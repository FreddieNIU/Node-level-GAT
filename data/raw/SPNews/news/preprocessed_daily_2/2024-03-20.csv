Those returns also surpass the year-to-date gains of retailing peers like Costco Wholesale and Target.', ""There could be more industry-leading growth to come. Walmart said in late February that it expects the fiscal 2025 year to feature solid sales growth and improving profitability, in fact. But are shares of the dividend-paying retailer a no-brainer buy right now? Let's take a closer look."", ""You might think Walmart's massive global sales footprint makes it impossible for the company to grow quickly. It's hard to meaningfully add to a $500-billion-plus annual sales haul, after all. But the chain can still surprise investors on this point. Sales last quarter rose a healthy 6%, for example, adding $10 billion to Walmart's Q4 revenue. That growth was powered by rising customer traffic, too."", 'The chain is winning market share from rivals like Target and Kroger in its key groceries and general merchandise niches. It is achieving these wins through its price leadership strategy, but also with help from its rising customer satisfaction metrics. Growth was particularly strong in the e-commerce segment, which seems to have a long runway ahead for expansion.', 'Unlike some other retailers, Walmart had no trouble boosting profitability this past year. Gross and operating profit margins both rose, powering a 10% earnings spike for the full 2023 year.', ""One key factor behind this increase has been the company's success in the tech niches of e-commerce and digital advertising sales. It is now generating over $100 billion in the digital selling space, for example."", ""Another is Walmart's strong customer traffic at stores. And yet another has been the retailer's wins with more affluent shoppers. You can see the impact of all these gains best in Walmart's operating profit margin. That key metric is moving back toward 5% of sales from a recent low of 4%."", ""Yet, dividend investors might want to leave Walmart stock on the shelf for now. Its yield is small compared to those of its peers at just 1.3%. You can get double that figure by purchasing Target shares. Home Depot is another great option, and its yield is roughly 1 percentage point higher than Walmart's."", ""On the positive side, Walmart's dividend has been increasing more quickly lately. Walmart just hiked its payout by 9% for 2024, marking a huge acceleration over the prior year's 2% boost. The faster pace of earnings growth today implies that there could be additional big dividend raises ahead for income investors. Still, there are many choices both within and outside of the retailing industry that pair a similar growth profile with a higher dividend yield."", ""Ultimately, though, Walmart stock deserves a spot on most investors' watch lists, if not in their portfolios. The retailing leader has proven that it can grow through a wide range of selling environments and it's finding ways to improve on its already impressive earnings and cash flow trends. These factors should support strong returns for the company's shareholders even if the dividend yield is a bit modest."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walmart right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walmart, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Walmart wasn’t one of them.

The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision."", 'Earnings Estimate Revisions', ""Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements."", 'For the current quarter, Walmart is expected to post earnings of $0.52 per share, indicating a change of +6.1% from the year-ago quarter.

The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making."", 'Earnings Estimate Revisions', ""Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else.

When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well.

In fact, efficiency level, which measures a company’s capability to transform available input into output, is often considered an important parameter for gauging its potential to make profits.', 'However, at times, it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company.

It shows a company’s potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the “accounts receivable turnover ratio” or “debtor’s turnover ratio” is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers.', 'Asset Utilization: This ratio indicates a company’s capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four-quarter average of total assets. Like the above ratios, high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient.', 'Inventory Turnover: The ratio of the 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a four-quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a company’s ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value indicates that the company is facing declining sales, which has resulted in excess inventory.', 'Operating Margin: This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a company’s ability to control operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers.', 'Here are the top four stocks that made it through the screen:', 'Post Holdings is a consumer-packaged goods holding company that is involved in the production of center-of-the-store, refrigerated, food service, food ingredient and convenient nutrition product categories.

Yet, we are concerned about the current economic uncertainty that continues to cast a negative impact on Align Technology’s dental procedures. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).', 'Align Technology is strategically capturing the growing malocclusion market, one of the most prevalent clinical dental conditions in the world. According to Align Technology’s May 2023 data, it is currently affecting approximately 60% to 75% of the global population. The company estimates that there are approximately 500 million people globally with malocclusion.This represents a significant growth opportunity for Align Technology to increase its share of the existing global market of orthodontic case starts, especially among teens, and expand the market for digital orthodontics, especially among adults. Till the end of 2023, the company achieved several major milestones, including 17 million Invisalign patients treated with 4.7 million teens. Total Invisalign Clear Aligner shipments for teens and younger patients reached a total of 809,000 cases, up 8% compared to 2022 and made up 34% of total Clear Aligner shipments.', '\xa0', 'Align Technology, Inc. price | Align Technology, Inc. Quote', '\xa0', 'In terms of innovation, over the past couple of years, Align Technology has successfully launched its first subscription-based clear aligner program, the Doctor Subscription Program (DSP), worldwide. The company introduced DSP in the United States and Canada in 2021. DSP currently continues to be well received by its customers and is currently available in the Iberia and Nordics and most recently, the U.K.Meanwhile, in the fourth quarter of 2023, Align Technology got FDA clearance for its Invisalign Palatal Expander System (IPE). The FDA 510(k)clearance is for broad patient applicability, including growing children, teens and adults. IPE is currently available on a limited basis in Canada and the United States, and the company recently received regulatory clearance in Australia and New Zealand, where commercialization is expected in the second quarter of 2024.', 'The company is also in the process of launching the ClinCheck smile video, the next generation of In-Face digitalization with AI-assisted video that is expected to be available to all doctors who use the Invisalign Practice App and ClinCheck treatment planning software. Align Technology currently expects the roll out the ClinCheck smile video in the first quarter of 2024 in North America and EMEA, followed by APAC later in the year.', 'On the flip side, although Align Technology is gradually coming out of the impact of the two-and-a-half-year-long healthcare crisis, the ongoing industry-wide trend of staffing shortages and supply chain-related hazards is denting growth. Deteriorating international trade, with global inflationary pressure leading to a tough situation related to raw material and labor costs, as well as freight charges and rising interest rates, all have put the dental treatment space (which is highly elective) in a tight spot.', 'Added to this, Align Technology is also concerned about the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine that is likely to continue in the upcoming period as well. The company noted earlier that while it continues to employ research and development personnel in Russia as well as limited post-sales support and administrative personnel, its total number of employees in Russia was materially reduced in 2022. Align Technology anticipates increasing headwinds from macroeconomic uncertainty and potential supply issues related to the war in the Middle East in the upcoming period.', 'Further, foreign exchange is a major headwind for Align Technology due to a considerable percentage of its revenues coming from outside the United States (in 2023, 44% of the company’s consolidated revenues came from international regions). In 2023, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against nearly every other major currency hampered Align Technology’s revenues in the international markets. This was mainly due to the Fed’s 10 consecutive aggressive hikes in interest rates to tackle inflation since March 2022.During the fourth quarter, the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange reduced revenues and margins significantly for Align Technology. In the fourth quarter, clear aligner revenues witnessed an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of approximately $12.8 million, or approximately 1.3% sequentially. Systems and services revenues were unfavorably impacted by approximately $2.1 million, or approximately 1.2% sequentially.', 'Some better-ranked stocks from the broader medical space are\xa0Stryker Corporation\xa0SYK, Cencora, Inc.\xa0COR and\xa0Cardinal Health\xa0CAH.

In addition, spending related to 2021's $1 trillion infrastructure bill is only starting to come through now. Moreover, lower interest rates could boost mining and energy prices, and also make investing in commodity projects more financially feasible."", ""If these things come together and Caterpillar's impressive pricing power still holds, then improving sales volumes and pricing could lead to Caterpillar exceeding expectations again in 2024."", ""Scott Levine (IBM): These days, it feels as if Nvidia dominates every conversation touching on artificial intelligence (AI).

Whether you're focused on investing to profit from the AI trend or looking to generate strong passive income -- or both -- IBM stock, with its forward yield of 3.4% at the current share price, is a great opportunity."", 'The company is starting the year with strong momentum regarding its AI business. In its fourth-quarter report, IBM noted that from the third to the fourth quarters, it nearly doubled its book of business (which the company defines as revenue, software-as-a-service contract revenue, and consulting signings) for generative AI and the Watsonx data and AI platform.', ""Since the start of 2024, IBM stock has raced 18.3% higher, well outperforming the S&P 500, which has climbed 7.3%. But extend your view to this time last year, and IBM stock's performance is even more impressive. While the S&P 500 has risen about 34% over the past 12 months, IBM has zoomed about 54% higher.

After all, this vaunted group used to be called the FAANG stocks, until Netflix dropped out and Nvidia and Microsoft displaced it."", ""So which company outside the Magnificent Seven has the potential to displace one of its current members? One tech giant seems like a strong candidate, especially since it's already larger than Tesla  and just made a potentially transformative acquisition."", 'The stock in question is Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), which is up 11% this year to reach an impressive market cap of $575 billion, making it the 13th largest company in the world today, and the 12th largest if one excludes Saudi Aramco.', ""Unlike the Magnificent Seven, Broadcom has assembled its current roster of businesses mainly through acquisition. CEO Hock Tan has been a master of the strategy, buying high-quality but bloated tech businesses, then folding those franchises into Broadcom's corporate umbrella."", 'Yet while that strategy may be a tad different from other Magnificent Seven stocks that primarily grew organically before making larger acquisitions later on, Broadcom shares a number of qualities with the other Mag Seven companies: strong competitive moats, high margins, technology innovation, and a platform likely to benefit from generative AI.', ""Like some Magnificent Seven stocks, Broadcom may be wholly unique among tech stocks. That's because after its massive acquisition of VMware in October, the company is now almost equally diversified between semiconductors and software. Prior to the closing of VMware, Broadcom generated less than 25% of revenues from software, and was primarily known for its leading semiconductors for networking and communications."", ""There aren't many companies that are equal weight software and semiconductors – usually companies are either on the hardware or the software side. But with a new emphasis on software, Broadcom may really turn some heads. And that's doubly true if VMware's new hybrid cloud platform takes off as much as management proclaims."", ""On the first quarter conference call with analysts, management noted it expects VMware's revenue to grow double-digits sequentially in each quarter this year. This obviously amounts to at least 40% growth for VMware in fiscal 2024. That's stunning, as VMware really wasn't growing its top-line that fast prior to the acquisition. In fact, in the quarter prior to the acquisition, VMware grew revenue only 2%."", 'However, Broadcom\'s upselling strategy appears to be working with help from VMware\'s new virtualized AI product called the VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF). VCF virtualizes large enterprises\' data centers, including compute, storage, and networking, giving large corporations a ""cloud-like"" experience with their on-premises data centers. In addition, VMware announced a partnership with Nvidia last summer, which will allow VCF to also run Nvidia GPUs in an offering called VMware Private AI Foundation. This allows customers to run AI models in their own data centers, which large corporations like for the privacy and security on-premises data centers provide.', ""Overall, Broadcom expects its software segment, including Symantec, California Technologies, and now VMware to bring in over $20 billion in revenue this year. That's compared with just $7.6 billion software revenue in fiscal 2023."", 'Besides the much-improved software offerings, Broadcom has two high-growth AI hardware businesses. One is in networking, where Broadcom dominates switch and router semiconductors through its Tomahawk and Jericho chipset brands. These brands are used in most leading data center switches and routers, enabling the lightning-fast ethernet connections needed for AI training and inference today.', ""The second AI business going gangbusters right now is Broadcom's custom ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) business. In this business, Broadcom contributes its IP to third-party AI chips, such as Alphabet's Tensor processing units. With basically all the cloud computing giants now looking to design their own in-house AI chips, this business is seeing very strong growth today."", ""These AI chip businesses are skyrocketing, growing from very little revenue a few years ago to billions of dollars today. This year, management sees the AI offerings garnering more than $10 billion in revenue, accounting for 35% of Broadcom's total 2024 semiconductor revenue. That forecast is already up significantly from last quarter, when Broadcom forecast its AI chips would only make up 25% of the chip segment this year."", ""Broadcom's other businesses don't have the eye-opening growth prospects of AI chips, but they do have strong franchises and high margins. For instance, Broadcom has a strong partnership with Apple, making radio frequency and wireless connectivity chips for the iPhone. In addition, Broadcom also makes a lot of leading chipsets primarily in cyclical broadband and wireless communications markets."", ""Currently, Broadcom trades around 26 times this year's earnings estimates, and it pays a 1.7% dividend. That would put Broadcom toward the lower end of valuations for Magnificent Seven stocks, and would also make it the one with the highest dividend yield."", 'That leaves room for growth, and those analyst earnings estimates may be too conservative as well. After all, Broadcom has consistently beaten analyst estimates over the years, and has been raising its outlook for AI revenue practically every quarter as of late, suggesting conservatism by management.', 'Furthermore, with VMware under its wing, Broadcom isn\'t just a chipmaker but a diversified tech conglomerate with numerous platforms. That ""broad"" reach also means Broadcom can hunt for new acquisitions in either the hardware or software industries, increasing its number of potential targets and ways for it to grow into the future.', ""With a significant part of its business benefiting from AI growth, I wouldn't be surprised to see Broadcom eventually make its way into the Magnificent Seven, or at least expand the category to an Elite Eight."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not superior to or as a substitute for, the GAAP financial measures presented in this earnings release and the Company\'s consolidated financial statements and other publicly filed reports. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.', 'The Company reports the following non-GAAP financial measures: free cash flow, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (""EPS""), sales changes on a constant currency basis and the debt and net debt leverage ratios, including on an adjusted basis.', 'Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. Management considers this metric to be helpful in understanding how the business is generating cash from its operating and investing activities that can be used to meet the financing needs of the business. Free cash flow is an indicator frequently used by management in evaluating its overall liquidity needs and determining appropriate capital allocation strategies. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes.', ""Non-GAAP operating income is a non-GAAP measure defined as operating income excluding the impact of certain items which management believes are not necessarily reflective of normal operational performance during a period. Management finds the information useful when analyzing operating results to appropriately evaluate the performance of the business without the impact of these certain items. Management believes the consideration of measures that exclude such items can assist in the comparison of operational performance in different periods which may or may not include such items. Management also utilizes non-GAAP operating margin, defined as non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of total sales, to further evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the Company's flexible operating model."", 'Non-GAAP diluted EPS is a non-GAAP measure defined as diluted EPS excluding the impact of certain items which management believes are not necessarily reflective of normal operational performance during a period. Management finds the information useful when analyzing financial results in order to appropriately evaluate the performance of the business without the impact of these certain items. In particular, management believes the consideration of measures that exclude such items can assist in the comparison of performance in different periods which may or may not include such items. The Company estimates the tax effect of all non-GAAP adjustments by applying a statutory tax rate to each item. The income tax items represent the discrete amount that affected the diluted EPS during the period.', ""The Company provides the year-over-year change in total sales excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to provide transparency to performance and enhance investors' understanding of underlying business trends. The effect from foreign currency, calculated on a constant currency basis, is determined by applying current year average exchange rates to prior year sales in local currency."", 'The adjusted debt and adjusted net debt leverage ratios are non-GAAP measures calculated by dividing Signet\'s adjusted debt or adjusted net debt by adjusted EBITDAR. Adjusted debt is a non-GAAP measure defined as debt recorded in the consolidated balance sheet, plus Preferred Shares, plus an adjustment for operating leases (5x annual rent expense). Adjusted net debt, a non-GAAP measure, is adjusted debt less the cash and cash equivalents on hand as of the balance sheet dates. The debt and net debt leverage ratios are non-GAAP measures calculated by dividing Signet\'s debt or net debt by adjusted EBITDA. Debt as used in these ratios is defined as current or long-term debt recorded in the consolidated balance sheet plus Preferred Shares. Net debt as used in this ratio is debt less the cash and cash equivalents on hand as of the balance sheet dates. Adjusted EBITDAR is a non-GAAP measure, defined as earnings before interest and income taxes, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, other non-operating expense, net and certain non-GAAP accounting adjustments (""Adjusted EBITDA"") and further excludes minimum fixed rent expense for properties occupied under operating leases. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR are considered important indicators of operating performance as they exclude the effects of financing and investing activities by eliminating the effects of interest, depreciation and amortization costs and certain accounting adjustments. Management believes these financial measures are helpful to investors and analysts to analyze trends in Signet\'s business and evaluate Signet\'s performance. The debt and adjusted debt leverage ratios are key to the Company\'s capital allocation strategy as measures of the Company\'s optimized capital structure. The net debt and adjusted net debt leverage ratios are supplemental to the debt and adjusted debt ratios as both investors and management find it useful to consider cash on hand available to pay down debt.', 'The following information provides reconciliations of the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP to presented non-GAAP financial measures.', 'Free

Signet (SIG), which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Jewelry industry, could be a great candidate to consider.', 'This jewelry company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 37.84%.', 'For the last reported quarter, Signet came out with earnings of $0.24 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.15 per share, representing a surprise of 60%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.34 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.55 per share, delivering a surprise of 15.67%.', 'Thanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Signet lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.', 'Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.', 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Signet currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.63%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on March 20, 2024."", ""With the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss."", 'Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.', ""Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.', ""The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system."", 'Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.', 'Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Signet basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.', 'Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices', ""The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock."", ""Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Signet imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher."", 'Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions', 'Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.', ""The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>."", 'Earnings Estimate Revisions for Signet', 'This jewelry company is expected to earn $9.96 per share for the fiscal year ending January 2024, which represents a year-over-year change of -15.6%.', 'Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Signet. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0.6%.', 'Bottom Line', ""Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating.

65,8e13b5a7-4ad5-3b6c-a0e1-27bb714a2dd2,WBA,2024-03-20,Should You Buy the 3 Highest-Paying Dividend Stocks in the Nasdaq-100?,Motley Fool,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/8e13b5a7-4ad5-3b6c-a0e1-27bb714a2dd2/should-you-buy-the-3.html,1710936900,STORY,"['KHC', 'FANG', 'WBA']","['It can be hard to find good dividend stocks without taking some short cuts as you create a list of investment candidates. For example, you might just pick out the highest-yielding stocks from an index like the Nasdaq-100 as you start your research. Although this index is heavily oriented toward technology, the three top yielders hail from outside that industry.', ""The trio includes pharmacy chain Walgreens (NASDAQ: WBA), consumer staples maker Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ: KHC), and energy producer Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ: FANG). Each has a yield soundly above 4%. But don't just buy these companies blindly; in fact, only one seems to have a story that a long-term dividend investor might find compelling."", ""When Walgreens released its fiscal 2924 first-quarter earnings results, it also announced that it would be reducing its dividend by 48% to $0.25 per share per quarter. The dividend yield based on the new, lower payment is roughly 4.8%, still high enough to place it atop the Nasdaq-100. But a dividend cut is usually not good news, and that's decidedly the case with regard to Walgreens."", ""The company has been attempting to shift gears within the healthcare space for several years now. First, it attempted to expand from its retail base into the pharmacy benefits management business, but that didn't pan out. Now it is working to build a medical clinic business. However, the CEO that spearheaded that change has left the company and been replaced."", ""The new CEO has only been there about six months and is revamping the leadership team under him, which suggests that the retailer's corporate direction could end up changing (again). At the very least, Walgreens remains in a state of flux. Add in the big dividend cut, and most dividend investors should probably wait on the sidelines until the new CEO has a bit more of a track record."", ""Iconic food maker Kraft Heinz has spent a few years lost in the woods. After the merger of Kraft and Heinz, which created the current enterprise, the focus was on cost-cutting. That can only take a company so far before it needs to start growing its business. That initial attempt to shift from cost-cutting to growth stumbled. Add in the upheaval around the coronavirus pandemic and inflation, and the investing thesis for Kraft Heinz wasn't very compelling for a while. But 2023 may have marked a key turning point."", ""First off, the company's leverage has been reduced so that it is back within management's target range. That means Kraft Heinz is finally working from a position of balance sheet strength. Second, revenue rose 0.6% for the year, with organic sales up 3.4%. While price increases were a big part of that strength, the company was able to boost its gross margins by 280 basis points."", ""In other words, the company appears to be doing a solid job of dealing with inflationary headwinds. And third, 65% of Kraft Heinz's portfolio is made up of brands that it believes have strong growth opportunities ahead of them."", 'To be fair, the dividend has been static since it was cut to $0.40 per share per quarter in 2020. Kraft Heinz stock would be far more compelling if the dividend were actually growing again. But it looks increasingly like this 4.6%-yielding consumer staples giant has finally gotten back on track. And that probably makes it the best option of this trio for long-term dividend investors.', 'Most investors looking at high-yield stocks are trying to find a reliable dividend payer that produces an attractive level of passive income. On the surface, Diamondback Energy\'s 4.2% yield would appear appealing relative to the rest of the Nasdaq-100 stocks, 97 of which have lower dividend yields. However, there\'s a huge ""but"" here because Diamondback Energy has a variable dividend policy that effectively ties the total dividend to the company\'s financial results.', 'This is a material problem if you want a consistent income stream given that Diamondback is an energy producer. This means that its financial performance is directly tied to the price of highly volatile commodities. While there is a base component to the quarterly dividend payment, it was just $0.90 per share in the first quarter of 2024. The variable part amounted to a huge $2.18 per share. While the variable dividend is a good way to ensure that shareholders benefit directly from high oil prices, the stock is not a good option for anyone that is seeking a consistent income stream.', ""Picking the top three highest-yielding stocks from the Nasdaq-100 clearly isn't a simple solution for investors trying to find reliable dividend stocks. You still need to dig into the story behind each company."", ""Walgreens just cut its dividend and the business is in a transition phase. Most investors will probably want to avoid it. Kraft Heinz has gotten its balance sheet and portfolio into better shape, which should interest investors even though the dividend hasn't yet started to grow again."", ""And Diamondback Energy's dividend is variable, so you can't really count on the yield. Some people might be OK with that, but it could be an unwanted surprise to those that don't understand the dividend policy and its impact on the payment."", ""Still, at the end of the day, maybe one out of three ain't too bad."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Kraft Heinz right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Kraft Heinz, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Kraft Heinz wasn’t one of them.

(NASDAQ:PAYX), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 74% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk)."", 'Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.', 'In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Paychex.', ' See our latest analysis for Paychex ', ""Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing."", ""As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Paychex. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Paychex's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story."", ""Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Paychex. From our data, we infer that the largest shareholder is B. Golisano (who also holds the title of Top Key Executive) with 10% of shares outstanding. Its usually considered a good sign when insiders own a significant number of shares in the company, and in this case, we're glad to see a company insider play the role of a key stakeholder. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.5% and 7.8% of the stock."", 'After doing some more digging, we found that the top 14 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.', ""Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future."", 'While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board.

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend aristocrats and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 10 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats To Buy According to Analysts.\xa0', 'Investors often grapple with the decision of whether to invest in growth stocks or value stocks. While both strategies aim to enhance value for investors, they follow distinct paths. The primary distinction lies in the pricing. Growth stocks tend to be pricier, with high valuations relative to their sales or earnings. Conversely, value stocks are more affordable, with lower stock prices in comparison to their sales or earnings. Over time, both growth and value investment approaches have demonstrated comparable performance, yet historical analysis indicates that value investing has been more advantageous for investors in the long term. According to research published by Josef Lakonishok, Andrei Shleifer, and Robert W. Vishny in the Journal of Finance, value strategies tend to yield superior returns. Various investment strategies centered around purchasing undervalued stocks have consistently outperformed those focused on trendy or high-flying stocks from April 1968 to April 1990.', 'The research paper also emphasized that value stocks typically offer significantly higher dividend yields and possess stronger fundamental ratios compared to growth stocks. Both Josef Lakonishok and the value investing expert David Dreman have observed that value investing outperforms growth investing approximately 70% of the time, regardless of the size of the companies involved. Their studies, which encompassed various company sizes, revealed that value stocks consistently delivered average returns of slightly over 7% per year higher than growth stocks over extended periods.', 'As mentioned earlier, dividends are often a key component of value stocks. Among dividend strategies, one of the most popular approaches is investing in dividend aristocrats. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index tracks the performance of companies within the S&P 500 that have consistently increased their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. A report from S&P Dow Jones Indices indicated that strategies focusing on generating income often exhibit significant value characteristics. Investors typically gravitate towards securities offering high dividend yields and lower price multiples. The report also mentioned that the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index demonstrated a blend of both growth and value traits, rather than a pronounced bias towards one style. Analysis of the index composition from 1999 to 2022 revealed its style breakdown. On average, the index maintained a 59.04% exposure to value stocks and a 40.94% exposure to growth stocks during this period.', 'Despite the allure of high-priced growth stocks, value stocks have consistently proven to be advantageous for investors over the long haul. Dimensional Funds conducted an analysis spanning nearly a century, affirming that value stocks typically offer higher expected returns. While there have been occasional downturns, the fundamental principle that lower relative prices correlate with higher expected returns remains steadfast. Value premiums have often manifested swiftly and significantly. For instance, in years when value outperformed growth, the average premium amounted to nearly 15%. On average, in the US, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks by 4.4% annually from 1927 to 2022.', ""Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Emerson Electric Co.

76,1dbd4a92-1385-3703-b1b5-c5e5894a610d,ADM,2024-03-20,11 Best Ethanol Stocks To Invest In Now,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-best-ethanol-stocks-invest-004636229.html,1710895596,STORY,"['GPRE', 'REX', 'ADM', 'VLO', 'MEOH']","['In this piece, we will take a look at the 11 best ethanol stocks to invest in now. If you want to skip our overview of ethanol and its potential to reduce emissions and maintain the performance edge enjoyed by fossil fuels, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Ethanol Stocks To Invest In Now. ', ""Ethanol is an alcohol, meaning that it's made of just three elements namely Carbon, Hydrogen, and Oxygen. This provides it with the same natural ingredients as gasoline, and it also makes it suitable for a variety of industrial use cases such as cleaning, sanitation, and making other chemicals. Ethanol's mixture with gasoline is called gasohol and is available in everyday fuel stations."", ""Since ethanol is an alcohol, unlike gasoline which is an alkene, it is cleaner burning. This makes it suitable for green energy use cases, a reality that stock market investors are also aware of. As part of our coverage of 12 Most Promising Green Stocks According to Analysts, we took a look at which clean energy stocks hedge funds are investing in. This revealed that out of the 12 stocks that had the greatest number of hedge fund investors out of the 910 that were part of Insider Monkey's database as of September 2023 end, two were ethanol companies. These two ethanol stocks are REX American Resources Corporation (NYSE:REX) and Green Plains Inc. (NASDAQ:GPRE) and their latest share price upside percentage as of March 2024 is 22% and 69%, respectively."", 'Seems like analysts are quite optimistic when it comes to these two particular ethanol stocks, despite the shift to traditional energy companies in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Ethanol also stands out from other green energy sources such as solar panels through the fact that it is able to blend in the supply chain of alkene fuels such as kerosene that is used in commercial turbine engines that power aircraft. This means that ethanol, and ethanol stocks, are also part of a broader category of fuels and equities called biofuels and biofuel stocks.', ""Just like we did with green stocks, we also took a look at which biofuel stocks hedge funds are buying as part of our coverage of 10 Best Biofuel Stocks To Buy Now. This particular analysis looked at how many hedge funds among the 910 that were covered by Insider Monkey's research in Q2 2023 had invested in biofuel companies. Out of these ten stocks, the majority, or six were involved either directly in making ethanol or working with it in the broader biofuel industry with some picks being Ecopetrol S.A. (NYSE:EC), Alto Ingredients, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALTO), and REX American Resources Corporation (NYSE:REX)."", ""As part of our research for this piece, we also discovered that one of the biggest fans of ethanol is the U.S. Department of Energy. The Energy Department's analysis of data from the Agriculture Department shows that the U.S. can cut down gasoline use by as much as 30% by utilizing existing agricultural land. In January 2024, the DoE announced the opening of the world's first commercial ethanol-to-jet fuel facility in Soperton, Georgia. This plant is owned by the Georgia based biotechnology firm LanzaJet. The facility is expected to generate economic activity worth tens of millions of dollars over its lifetime, and it is part of a growing global trend towards Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) that could provide sizeable catalysts to ethanol stocks especially since the global air travel industry often faces some of the harshest criticism for carbon dioxide and other emissions."", ""Shifting gears to take a look at ethanol stock performance this year, since the ethanol industry isn't popular among the broader public, there are few exchange traded funds or ETFs that track these stocks. Yet, we can still focus on their broader performance as a category and individual share price movements forced by company specific catalysts by analyzing how the ethanol stocks that we've discussed so far in this piece have done in 2024. The five ethanol stocks that we've discussed so far are NASDAQ:GPRE, NYSE:REX, NYSE:EC, NYSE:FF, and NASDAQ:ALTO. Year to date, the share price performance of these top hedge fund ethanol stock picks has been -16.65%, -5.41%, -9.28%, 18.05%, and -25.28%."", ""This brief stock analysis provides a rather interesting set of results where four out of five ethanol stocks haven't really done well. However, if we look at their performance over the past twelve months, then three out of these five stocks are in the green, with REX American in particular having gained 45% during this time period."", ""One ethanol stock that's been down 34% over the year is Green Plains Inc. (NASDAQ:GPRE), and here's what White Brook Capital Partners had to say about the firm in its Q4 2023 investor letter:"", 'Green Plains is a troubled investment. The stock did not perform as expected in 2023 and has had a difficult start to 2024. The Company continues to be well positioned, generating solid margins on each kernel of corn as the corn crush margin stays meaningfully positive. Furthermore, the industry’s progression is clear. There is an opportunity for ethanol producers to increase short and long term profitability by deriving higher amounts of corn oil, specialty alcohols, and high-density feed protein from each kernel of corn. It’s also increasingly clear that the required capital will prevent many current operators from transitioning. Green Plains was fortunate to begin its conversion relatively early and to have the scale necessary to complete the transition.', 'During the year, the regulatory environment bent towards ethanol producers as the federal government stopped preventing several midwestern states from blending a higher percentage of ethanol into gasoline and included their substrates in Inflation Reduction Act climate change subsidies.', ""Finally, the company is at the forefront of the ethanol industry’s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) development, a future use case that would use a substantial portion of the US’ current ethanol production if today's ethanol plants were to supply it. This year's developments were positive for Green Plains and portend a dramatically higher earnings stream within a year, even higher in two and higher still in three, making the stock incredibly cheap, particularly looking two or three years out."", ""With these details, let's take a look at the best ethanol stocks to buy. Some notable names are Green Plains Inc. (NASDAQ:GPRE), Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), and Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO)."", ""Farmers harvesting corn in a field, reminding us of the importance of the company's ethanol production."", 'Our Methodology', 'To make our list of the best ethanol stocks to buy, we made a list of all publicly traded companies on U.S. exchanges that are either direct participants in, or related to, the ethanol industry. These firms were then ranked according to the number of hedge funds that had bought their shares in Q4 2023 and the top stocks were selected.', 'For these top ethanol stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment.

The latest serious contender is  Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH), a health-focused drink designer with a global distribution deal, skyrocketing sales, and an 8% share of the convenience store and gas station market in North America.', 'Celsius is participating in a long and heated market battle. Known as Hansen Natural at the time, Monster brewed its first energy drink in April 2002 and has never looked back. The stock has gained a heart-stopping 144,000% since then, turning a hypothetical $350 investment into half a million dollars.', ""Challengers have come and gone over roughly two decades, but none have had the staying power of Monster and Red Bull. That won't stop even more rivals from entering the ring to capture a respectable slice of that ever-booming energy drink market."", ""Will Celsius follow in Monster's and Red Bull's red-hot footsteps? From here, Celsius and its stock can go three different ways."", ""In a perfect world, the global distribution deal with PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) sets Celsius up for long-term success. Putting the unfamiliar drink brand in front of billions of consumers, the top-notch distribution network raises awareness of the company's healthier energy drinks. The worldwide interest in organic, low-salt, and vegan foods continues for years and years, further boosting Celsius' growth prospects."", ""In this scenario, the best is yet to come. The $8.9 billion market cap and $1.3 billion of annual sales you see today could become comparable to Monster's 2023 tally of $53 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively."", 'Of course, Neither Celsius nor Red Bull will sit on their hands while Celsius rises, so the third-place challenger may still have more catching up to do before truly joining the ruckus at the very top of the energy drink market. Still, history suggests that Celsius might be able to grow both its sales and market value fivefold over the next decade.', 'Not too shabby, right?', 'On the other hand, the bull case assumes that Celsius comes up aces in every challenge along the way. Many things could go horribly wrong instead.', 'Consumer habits are notoriously fickle, and the health craze could very well cool down. That would be terrible news for Celsius, whose entire existence is based on a health-conscious alternative to traditional energy drinks.', 'Or, the health trend could take a sharp turn in the other direction. Imagine a world where consumers turn up their noses on every kind of energy drink, no matter how health-focused it might be. And governments in key markets like the U.S. and Western Europe might consider halting the sales of caffeinated drinks not named coffee, putting up brick walls in front of every growth rocket in this category.', ""Monster is notoriously litigious. The company sued up-and-comer Vital Pharmaceuticals in 2018, collecting enough damages to drive the Bang Energy maker out of business. Then, Monster bought what was left at a pennies-on-the-dollar bankruptcy discount. I don't know whether Monster would have a substantial case for doing the same to Celsius -- and PepsiCo should intervene with its deep pockets and access to high-powered law firms -- but you never know."", ""I'm not saying that any of these extreme downturns are especially likely, but the risks are real enough. At the very least, challenges like these will probably hold Celsius' skyrocketing growth back a bit."", ""I may share a first name with innovative physicist Anders Celsius, but that doesn't give me any special insights into our energy-drink namesake's business prospects. In my view, the company faces a promising growth market, but also a couple of powerful rivals and dominant market shares. As a result, Celsius looks like a promising growth stock with a couple of significant headwinds."", ""Investor enthusiasm is also running a bit hotter than I'd like, driving Celsius stock to lofty valuation ratios such as 114 times earnings and 168 times free cash flow. Monster Beverage looks like a bargain by comparison, and true value investors should consider taking part in the Celsius story by investing in distribution partner PepsiCo instead."", ""So Celsius Holdings is most definitely not every investor's dream stock. You may want to consider a small, speculative stake in this interesting growth story, but only as an extra-small part of a diversified portfolio. Companies heading into direct competition with Monster and Red Bull often fall short of their early goals."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Celsius right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Celsius, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Celsius wasn’t one of them.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their historical performance, and go directly to read 5 52-Week Low Dividend Stocks To Consider.\xa0', ""Dividend stocks experienced a tumultuous ride throughout 2023 and have struggled to bounce back. As of 2024, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks the performance of dividend stocks with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, has only managed to climb by 3.17%, lagging behind the broader market's robust 8.57% year-to-date gain. The underperformance of dividend stocks can largely be attributed to the dominance of tech stocks in the spotlight last year. However, Meta's recent announcement of its inaugural dividend brings a glimmer of hope for investors, potentially offering a blend of growth and dividend opportunities."", ""That said, dividend stocks have demonstrated strong historical performance owing to their capacity to generate income, a feature that attracts investors to these stocks. Since 1926, dividends have accounted for roughly 32% of the overall return for the S&P 500 index, with capital gains making up the remaining 68%. Thus, it's evident that sustainable dividend income alongside the potential for capital appreciation are vital considerations for investors in shaping their expectations regarding total returns. According to a report from S&P Dow Jones Indices, the Dividend Aristocrats index has historically shown superior returns with less volatility when compared to the broader S&P 500, resulting in enhanced risk-adjusted returns. This is evident from their ability to offer downside protection, as indicated by their upside and downside capture ratios. Specifically, the index has outperformed the S&P 500 during down months 69.34% of the time and during up months 43.61% of the time. Additionally, it's worth noting that the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats have experienced lower drawdown levels in comparison to the benchmark index."", 'Despite the recent underperformance and sluggish recovery of dividend stocks, analysts are recommending their inclusion in portfolios for income generation. Among the favored choices are dividend growers, as highlighted by prominent analysts. David Bahnsen, the chief investment officer at the Bahnsen Group, emphasized the importance of dividend growers in a portfolio during an interview with CNBC. Here are some comments from the analyst:', '“We really believe that cash flow is king and dividend growers through time and their avoidance of a lot of burst bubbles that happen with the alternative end up doing better. We have tons of track records to prove that, but I think ultimately right now people have actually gotten away with this recovery trade since the 2022 meltdown.”', 'Investing in dividend stocks like The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

Tesla shares have fallen 28.5% since the start of trading in 2024, losing its status as one of the “Strong Buy” EV stocks. A majority of Wall Street analysts covering Tesla have rated the U.S. automakers shares at either “Hold,” “Sell” or “Strong Sell.” The reason for this is pretty straightforward.', 'The EV market is in the midst of a slump, and while interest rates remain elevated for an elongated period, economic growth is not only at risk but so is consumer spending on products that many purchase using debt, such as cars. Despite this, there are a number of EV stocks with “Strong Buy” ratings from Wall Street. Below are just three of them.', 'Source: Andy Feng / Shutterstock.com', 'Li Auto\xa0(NASDAQ:LI) is a leading EV manufacturer from China. The company’s EV sales overshadowed that of Tesla’s China business late last year. This EV maker particularly focuses on producing smart SUVs with extended-range technology. The company’s flagship model, for instance, is the\xa0Li L7, a five-seat premium SUV that can run on both electricity and gasoline and competes directly with\xa0Tesla’s\xa0Model Y.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'While Li Auto’s shares are off to bad start in 2024, down 2.6% on a year-to-date perspective, Wall Street continues to be excited about the stock. There are 25 Wall Street analysts covering LI, and 24 have given the Chinese automaker’s shares either a “Buy” rating or “Strong Buy” rating.', 'That isn’t to say the things have been totally rosy for Li Auto. The EV maker’s deliveries declined by 35% in February, underscoring the general slowdown in the global electric vehicle market. Still, Li Auto’s share price is trading at an attractive 16.6x forward earnings.', 'Source: shutterstock.com/Trygve Finkelsen', 'Last year, BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY) became the world’s top EV maker, trouncing its American rival Tesla in electric vehicle sales. In Q4 2023, BYD sold 526,409 electric vehicles, while Tesla sold 484,507. Despite an EV slowdown, BYD is still increasing its sales year-over-year. In particular, in January 2024, the company sold 205,588 electric vehicles, up 33.1% YOY, but down more than 34% monthly. Similarly, February sales declined nearly 40%, but this is at least somewhat attributable to the Lunar New Year holiday. The Chinese EV maker was not the only large electric vehicle company to report a month-over-month decline in sales growth.', 'To cushion the slowdown in sales, BYD and its competitors have pursued price cuts in their expensive models. For example, BYD’s Yuan Plus SUV has a price tag of 119,800 yuan, approximately $16,642, which is nearly 12% less than where it was before. This price war will likely intensify, especially as the EV slump continues. The company also remains the second largest player in the global battery market with 14.4% of market share as of January 2024, according to recent study.', 'BYD is and continues to be larger than Tesla in EV sales, and the stock only trades at 15.7x forward earnings, which could present a great opportunity for interested investors.', 'Source: shutterstock.com', 'Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) designs and manufactures vehicle components worldwide. In particular, the company provides electrical and safety technology solutions to the automotive and commercial vehicle markets. The company has primarily two operating segments: Signal and Power Solutions as well as Advanced Safety and User Experience. The former manufacturers a vehicle’s electrical architecture, while the latter provides critical technologies and services for vehicle safety.', 'The company has delivered double-digit sales growth for the past couple years, likely powered by the rise of electric vehicles which have complex electrical components. Aptiv’s importance in the EV market has led to the company receiving several “Strong Buy” ratings from Wall Street analysts. The company also trades at about 13.8x forward earnings, which is relatively cheap given where many tech sector multiples have gone in the recent months.', 'On the date of publication, Tyrik Torres\xa0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'Tyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

In 2022, we purchased Netflix and added to our position in Meta on weakness as both stocks were selling significantly below our estimates of fair value.

Meta’s challenges were more self-inflicted as a ramp-up in spending caused free cash flow to plummet. We saw Netflix’s slowing subscriber growth as a normal feature of a maturing streaming market. Despite growth having slowed, Netflix’s position as the largest streaming service with currently close to 250 million subscribers is a key strategic advantage. Streaming is a scale and intellectual property business model that will result in a few large winners. Netflix remains far ahead of all streaming peers in subscribers, revenue, content spend and cash flow generation. Importantly, Netflix has also evolved its business model over the past year, becoming more efficient with its content spending, cracking down on password sharing and introducing a lower cost advertising-supported tier (lowering subscriber churn).

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value.

Of course, there are opposing views with many economists talking about the possibility of a soft landing. However, it’s relatively clear that expansionary monetary policies might be needed to avoid a hard landing. Possibly, there will be more than one rate cut in the second half of 2024. Investors can therefore consider buying stocks for a Fed rate cut before they go ballistic.', 'If we talk about specific sectors, precious metals, energy, and commodity stocks tend to do well during times of expansionary policies. At the same time, rate cuts boost investment and consumption spending. I would therefore look at creating a diversified portfolio of stocks (industry perspective) that will benefit from possible rate cuts.', 'Let’s talk about seven stocks for a Fed rate cut likely to surge higher in the next few quarters.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: Piotr Swat/Shutterstock', 'In anticipation of expansionary monetary policies, gold has already been trending higher.

I would bet on 30% to 50% total returns for NEM stock in the next 12 months.', 'Newmont recently announced that the Company will focus on its tier one portfolio of ten assets. Further, Newmont will be selling six non-core assets. This is likely to boost the Company’s financial flexibility and help in cost reduction. I must add that with 128 million ounces in gold reserves and 155 million ounces in resources, the Company has stable production visibility beyond the decade.', 'It’s also worth noting that for 2023, Newmont reported operating cash flow of $2.8 billion.

Therefore, rate cuts will trigger positive price action for oil. OXY stock is likely to surge higher from depressed levels.', 'From a financial perspective, there are two important points to note. First, Occidental has an investment-grade balance sheet. There is ample flexibility for organic and acquisition-driven growth. Last year, the company acquired CrownRock for a consideration of $12 billion.

Further, Tesla has faced challenges due to macroeconomic headwinds.', 'I therefore believe that potential rate cuts can trigger positive price action in Tesla stock. Besides making loan relatively cheaper, it’s likely that macroeconomic headwinds will wane on expansionary policies.', 'Specific to Tesla, Cybertruck is due for mass deliveries and that’s a catalyst for revenue growth. Further, there seems to be excitement on the potential launch of Roadster in 2025.', 'I must add here that Tesla has ambitious plans to produce 20 million EVs annually by 2030. To achieve this target, investment in multiple new factors is likely. The potential investments will possibly be focused on emerging economies. Tesla has already committed to cut EV production cost to half. This will set stage for the next leg of growth in emerging economies.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'In my view, potential rate cuts will also be positive for the cryptocurrency space. Expansionary monetary policies, in general, translate into higher speculation across asset classes. Therefore, the ongoing crypto bull market is likely to have another catalyst in the form of rate cuts.', 'Among crypto stocks that look attractive, I am bullish on Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT). The Bitcoin (BTC-USD) miner has strong fundamentals and aggressive expansion plans. In my view, at least 100% returns are likely in the next 12 months.', 'From a fundamental perspective, Riot reported $597 million in cash buffer as of Q4 2023. Further, the value of Bitcoin in the balance sheet was $311 million. With no debt outstanding, Riot has a quality balance sheet.', 'It’s therefore not surprising that the Company is looking at aggressive expansion in the next 24 months. Riot ended 2023 with a hash rate capacity of 12.4EH/s. The Company is targeting to increase capacity to 31.5EH/s by the end of the year. Further, hash rate capacity is likely to swell to 40.8EH/s in the second half of 2025. Therefore, Riot is positioned for stellar revenue and cash flow upside.', 'Source: Phawat / Shutterstock.com', 'Finally, let’s talk about a penny stock that’s likely to benefit from potential rate cuts. Hecla Mining (NYSE:HL) is the largest silver mining company in the United States. I believe that silver will catch-up with gold in terms of returns in the coming quarters. HL stock will surge higher from undervalued levels if this assumption holds true.', 'Besides higher realized price, there is another reason to be bullish on Hecla Mining. For 2023, the Company reported silver production of 3.1 million ounces. With Lucky Friday restarting production and the ramp-up of production from Keno Hill, I am bullish on robust growth. For this year, Hecla has guided for production of 5.1 million ounces. It’s worth noting that production growth will sustain in 2025.', 'Therefore, Hecla is positioned for strong revenue growth and cash flow upside. If silver surges higher, there is a case for significant EBITDA margin expansion in the second half of 2024 and in 2025. The penny stock is therefore worth accumulating at current levels.', 'On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

And nothing speaks to that like dividend growth.', 'These four companies have increased their dividends for decades and are poised to give you pay raises for decades longer.', ""Energy makes the world go 'round, and ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) is at the center of making it happen.

While not entirely dependent on commodity prices, low oil and gas prices can negatively impact ExxonMobil's business."", ""Yet ExxonMobil has paid and raised its dividend for 42 consecutive years, through geopolitical conflicts, recessions, and more. Over the past few years, high commodity prices have padded ExxonMobil's pockets with cash, reinforcing a massive balance sheet with nearly $400 billion in assets versus just $6 billion in net debt. You can buy ExxonMobil and feel great that the stock's 3.4% starting dividend yield will continue coming through."", ""Diversification can help a company -- when one part of the business stumbles, another can pick it up. That's one of the secrets behind Illinois Tool Works' (NYSE: ITW) streak of 61 years of dividend growth, making the stock a Dividend King. The company serves many markets, including business units dedicated to automotive, food equipment, electrical testing and measurement, welding, polymers and fluids, construction products, and specialty products."", ""It seems as if Illinois Tool Works has business opportunities as long as the world continues building things. The company's success stems from astute management that doesn't let the balance sheet take on too much debt.

It sells devices that measure and analyze liquid and gas flow, such as measuring how much water a farmer uses to water their crops or analyzing the flow of gases used in fracking."", ""Demand for Badger Meter's products seems to grow as an increasingly crowded world demands more efficiency to produce the most resources for the least amount of money.

As predicted by the International Energy Agency, the global renewable capacity is expected to increase to 2.5 times its current level by 2030.

I believe there is a significant long-term value and growth opportunity in investing in the market at this time. NextEra Energy offers exposure to a diversified clean energy portfolio. While I think it is an attractive long-term investment, I believe there are better allocations to companies more concentrated on solar, which I will specify, that offer the highest future returns.', 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NEE.', 'NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is a prominent player in the clean energy sector, and it is the parent company of Florida Power & Light Company, which is the largest electric utility in the United States based on retail electricity produced and sold. FPL serves around 5.8 million customer accounts, catering to 12 million people across Florida.', ""The company is also one of America's largest capital investors in infrastructure, with a presence in 49 U.S. states. It also operates NextEra Energy Resources, which is recognized as having the world's most extensive clean energy portfolio, with a generation capacity of 24,000 megawatts from renewable sources, predominantly solar and wind, which is more than any other company globally."", 'All of its operating revenue comes from the U.S., of which 82.5% comes from Florida Power & Light Company, 17.8% from NextEra Energy Resources and -0.2% from other corporate expenses.', ""From my research and confirmed by my investment recently in Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH), I believe solar energy is going to be the dominant form of power provision in the world by 2050. The Department of Energy's Solar Futures Study outlines that for a goal of 100% decarbonization of the U.S. grid by 2050, solar deployments could be 1,050 gigawatts to 1,570 gigawatts, meaning 44% to 45% of electricity demand. The study outlines a potential for net savings of $1.7 trillion due to this initiative."", ""In addition, the International Energy Agency highlights how globally, policy support and technological innovation are accelerating solar capacity growth. Countries including China, the European Union, the U.S., India and Brazil have ambitious decarbonization targets and policies, which are strengthened by advancements in solar photovoltaic technology and manufacturing capacity. The IEA's Net Zero by 2050 plan forecasts a 20-fold increase in solar capacity by 2050."", ""As mentioned, I recently invested in Enphase Energy, but this is not the only allocation to solar energy I plan to make. I think that China's LONGi Green Energy Technology Co. (SHSE:601012) is the greatest long-term investment in solar at this time. Its price is down 71% at the time of writing, indicating what I believe to be a rare opportunity. I have provided a breakdown of the key elements of comparison here:"", 'LONGi Green Energy: Price down 71%, price-earnings ratio of 10.25, equity-to-asset ratio of 0.44, debt-to-equity ratio of 0.21, net margin of 11.40% and three-year revenue growth rate of 53.70%.', 'Enphase Energy: Price down 62%, price-earnings ratio of 41, equity-to-asset ratio of 0.29, debt-to-equity ratio of 1.32, net margin 19.16% and three-year revenue growth rate of 43.10%.', 'NextEra Energy: Price down 40%, price-earninngs ratio of 15.40, equity-to-asset ratio of 0.27, debt-to-equity ratio of 1.54, net margin of 26% and three-year revenue growth rate of 14.80%.', 'LONGi evidently has an advantage, particularly in its balance sheet above both of the other companies, but also in regard to its revenue growth rate. Where it falls short is the net margin. Notably, LONGi is the only company of the three to have geographically diversified operating revenue. Both Enphase and NextEra have all revenue generated in the U.S.', ""LONGi is widely recognized as the world's leading solar technology company. It is planning to build the world's largest solar factory for $6.70 billion; positioned in China, it will be capable of manufacturing 100 gigawatts of solar wafers and 50 gigawatts of solar cells each year."", 'NextEra provides some competitive advantage over LONGi through its broader operational scope, including exposure to wind generation, energy storage and the operation of an extensive grid network. However, this operational diversification does not necessarily make for the best investment case in terms of long-term growth. In fact, I believe its portfolio diluted away from solar indicates lower growth than a pure-play solar investment provided by Enphase and LONGi.', 'At this time, all three stocks look significantly undervalued to me, but I will focus on NextEra for the purpose of this analysis. The GF Value chart suggests the stock could be a possible value trap, but, if not, it indicates a significant undervaluation. We can also see from the chart that consensus analyst estimates predict an earnings per share contraction until fiscal 2025, when growth is set to resume. Therefore, I consider now to be an excellent time to invest as I believe the market will begin to price the investment higher once it starts showing year-over-year earnings growth.', ""As the market is not placing a premium on solar companies at this time, as is the case with other elite technology companies, I believe a discounted cash flow analysis is the most prudent method of assessing fair value for NextEra. I believe the company has a significant growth horizon beyond the next 10 years; however, for the purpose of this analysis and for the sake of conservatism and risk mitigation, I have kept an inflation level 4% terminal-stage earnings per share annual growth rate for 10 years following my growth stage. From my research, I believe a market compound annual growth rate for solar capacity in the U.S. over the next 10 years could be roughly 20%, which estimates by the World Economic Forum confirm. However, NextEra's exposure to this is reduced due to its more diversified operations, including wind. As such, I have used a 15% earnings per share annual growth rate as a conservative estimate for the growth stage of my discounted cash flow analysis. I have also used a typical 11% discount rate. The results indicate a 22.30% margin of safety based on a share price of $57.80 and my fair value estimate of $74.40."", 'I believe the most significant risk with investing in any of the three clean energy companies I have outlined is short-term downward momentum as a result of wider economic stagnation and higher interest rates, particularly in the U.S., but also slow economic growth in Asia and wider internationally, as it relates to LONGi. Therefore, I believe investors should consider the need to weather considerable short-term losses before the clean energy markets resume more typical growth. This may be a challenging period, and while it is impossible to invest right at the bottom, I believe we are as close as we can rationally get without speculating, which affirms my buy rating for LONGi and Enphase.', 'NextEra is an exceptional investment in solar energy, but it is not the best. At this time, the first priority on my list goes to LONGi and second to Enphase. NextEra may have a place in portfolios looking for diversified energy exposure, particularly to wind, but I believe investors will find significantly better returns from allocating to LONGi and Enphase over the long term. I believe now is one of the best times to allocate heavily to solar energy with a long-term holding period considering outsized market growth to come leading up to 2050.', 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

Much like Plato’s allegory of the cave, our quest to travel is a conscious effort to rattle the chains of our cavic existence, expanding the horizons of our primitive minds in the process. Since the alleviation of COVID-19 travel restrictions, the human passion for globetrotting has been set ablaze once more. According to UNWTO, tourism levels reached 88% of pre-pandemic levels in 2023, and are expected to surpass them in 2024.', 'At the same time, unprecedented inflation in the wake of the pandemic has made it extremely expensive to vacation with the same liberty as we had previously been used to. Consequently, many tourists are actively avoiding travel to popular tourist destinations, accusing these places of being “tourist traps”. Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) recently revealed its “Unpack 24” report that states affordable alternatives to popular hotspots, or “Destination Dupes”, which is a top trend among travelers in 2024. Recently, destination dupes became a viral trend on TikTok, as users from all over the world pitched in their take on the question, “What is the most underrated place to travel?”. In addition to TikToks, websites such as Tripadvisor, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP) are also playing a pivotal role in driving tourists towards new destinations. Reviews published on such sites are crucial for driving business and provide unfamiliar third world destinations with the opportunity to market on the same platforms as the biggest tourist attractions.', 'Asian countries were some of the first to face the plight of COVID-19, because of which these were also the destinations which experienced the most severe travel restrictions from the rest of the world. As such, Asia has not been able to bank on the recent uptick in tourism in the same manner as the other continents. UNWTO revealed that while tourism increased to 88% of pre-pandemic levels in 2023, the figure for Asia-Pacific was only 65%. However, the potential for tourism in this region has not gone unnoticed. Tripadvisor, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP) released its list of Top 2024 Destinations According to Global Travelers, wherein Asia claimed 8 out of the top 10 destinations.

Penetration in the Asian market allows companies like Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) to enhance their alternative accommodations segment, which is becoming a popular feature of tourism in the region.

Join us as we check out the most underrated travel destinations in Asia.', '20 Most Underrated Travel Destinations in Asia', 'To develop our list of the most underrated travel destinations in Asia, we began by combing the internet for preexisting information in this area. In our search we checked out some of the most amazing countries in Asia, some of the most friendliest, and even the most respected. Next, we accumulated places within these countries from approximately 20 different sources, including credible new outlets and popular travel websites, to come up with a preliminary list of Asian travel destinations. Using a consensus approach, we shortlisted the places which had been recommended most frequently. Further research was narrowed to these places only. Once this list was obtained, we scored each destination based on the rank they had obtained in the previous lists, relative to the size of the list. For example, a destination recommended at number 6 in a list of top 10 most underrated travel destinations in Asia was assigned a score of 6/10 or 0.6. In case a source had not ranked its recommendations, each place received a score of 0.5. Each destination’s score was then accumulated. In case of a tie, we incorporated further feedback using online forums and user reviews (excluding influencer-generated feedback due to bias) to decide which destination would be ranked higher in our list of the most underrated travel destinations in Asia.', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

Clark, a former US airbase, is a city that offers the perfect blend of scenery, history, and modern attractions. The city has a wide range of historical landmarks such as decommissioned military facilities and museums, along with a dinosaur theme park that is perfect for entertaining children. Its most impressive attraction is the majestic Mount Pinatubo, where tourists get to summit through the Crow Valley before setting their sights on the Crater Lake.', 'IM Score: 1.57', 'Although Thailand is one of the most visited countries in Asia and its cities can hardly be deemed underrated, Koh Kood is one of the country’s lesser-known islands.

Another impressive sight is Fort Kochi, a coastal settlement that features monuments of Portuguese, British, and Dutch architecture.', 'IM Score: 1.62', 'Busan is typically reduced to the status of being a port city, however, it is so much more. The Haeundae Beach is a prominent site for beach goers and offers one of the most picturesque sunsets in the world. Busan is also notable for its religious sites as it features many historical temples and tombs, each of which is accompanied with its unique mythical folklore.', 'IM Score: 1.65', 'Another one of the most underrated travel destinations in Asia is Hue. This city was once the imperial capital of the Nguyen Dynasty. Many of the city’s historical sites are well preserved, including the citadel.

Moreover, Leshan is popular for its Sichuanese cuisine, which perfectly complements the spiritual odyssey you experience in Leshan.', 'IM Score: 1.74', 'The island nation of Taiwan is perhaps the most underrated country in Southeast Asia. Although most of the country’s major travel destinations can be explored in a single trip, we especially recommend the port city of Kaohsiung. This city offers incredible waterside sceneries, vibrant night markets, and many spiritual temples.', 'IM Score: 1.75', 'On the surface, Dhaka is an overcrowded mesh of traffic and sunburns, however, its blend of subcontinental culture with modern development means it is one of our most underrated travel destinations in Asia. It is caulked with historical monuments from the Mughal, British, and East Pakistani eras. If you wish to get a glimpse of the region’s diverse history, you will find it etched upon the walls of the Ahsan Manzil, Lalbagh Fort, and Star Mosque, some of Dhaka’s most prominent landmarks.', 'IM Score: 1.77', 'Similarly to Dhaka, our minds have a preexistent notion of what a trip to Japan would encompass, and its generally to the note of skyscrapers and tightly packed markets. However, in the northern mountains of the country is Hachimantai City. Famous for its year round ski resort, Appi Kogen, the city is the perfect destination to explore rustic hot springs, courtesy of the stratovolcanos which encircle the area. Moreover, it is regarded as being a more authentic experience of the Japanese tradition in comparison to the contemporary culture of Tokyo.', 'IM Score: 1.78', 'Pontianak is regarded as being a diversified melting pot of the Malay, Dayak, and Chinese cultures. Visitors have plenty of opportunities for boating as they traverse their way through the city’s floating market, enjoy river cruises in the Kalimantan rainforest, or venture through the pretzeled mangrove plantations of the Kapuas Delta.

Tourists can visit the Sultan Abu Bakar State Mosque or the Arulmigu Sri Rajakaliamman Glass Temple, giving them a glance at the spiritual significance of the city. If you’re looking for an excuse to ramp up your heartbeat, visit Legoland Malaysia. Or you might retreat to the sandy shores of Rawa Island, the ideal place to unwind and bask under the setting sun.', 'IM Score: 1.93', 'If you consider yourself an avant-garde explorer, hurry up and study the remnants of medieval China in the region of Gansu. Once a passage along the ancient silk road, Gansu is one of China’s untouched historical treasures.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Looking at Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), it does have a high ROCE right now, but lets see how returns are trending.', ""For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Lockheed Martin is:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.26 = US$9.1b ÷ (US$52b - US$17b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""So, Lockheed Martin has an ROCE of 26%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 9.8% earned by companies in a similar industry."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin ', ""Above you can see how the current ROCE for Lockheed Martin compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Lockheed Martin ."", ""Things have been pretty stable at Lockheed Martin, with its capital employed and returns on that capital staying somewhat the same for the last five years. It's not uncommon to see this when looking at a mature and stable business that isn't re-investing its earnings because it has likely passed that phase of the business cycle. So while the current operations are delivering respectable returns, unless capital employed increases we'd be hard-pressed to believe it's a multi-bagger going forward. This probably explains why Lockheed Martin is paying out 50% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Given the business isn't reinvesting in itself, it makes sense to distribute a portion of earnings among shareholders."", ""In summary, Lockheed Martin isn't compounding its earnings but is generating decent returns on the same amount of capital employed. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 69% over the last five years. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high."", 'If you want to continue researching Lockheed Martin, you might be interested to know about the 2 warning signs that our analysis has discovered.', 'High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.', 'Have feedback on this article?

Results found that V116 was immunogenic for all 21 vaccine serotypes across the studied age sub-groups, as assessed by serotype-specific OPA GMTs 30 days post-vaccination. There was a slight downward trend in immune responses in adults 65–74 years of age and 75 years of age and older compared to adults 50–64 years of age. V116 had a safety profile comparable to PCV20. Results from the STRIDE-3 trial were presented at the World Vaccine Congress West Coast in November 2023.', 'Data from STRIDE-6 and STRIDE-6 Sub-group (Abstracts #353 and #520)STRIDE-6 (NCT05420961) is a Phase 3 trial investigating V116 in adults 50 years of age and older who had previously received a pneumococcal vaccine at least one year prior (n=712). Participants were enrolled based on previous pneumococcal vaccination with PPSV23, PCV15, PCV13 (pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine), PPSV23+PCV13, PCV13+PPSV23 or PCV15+PPSV23, and received either V116, PCV15 or PPSV23.', 'Results showed that V116 was immunogenic across all cohorts, as assessed by OPA GMTs 30 days post-vaccination, and that V116 elicited comparable immune responses to the serotypes also covered by PCV15 and PPSV23 and higher immune responses for the serotypes covered only by V116. A STRIDE-6 sub-group analysis evaluating immunogenicity across all cohorts by time since prior pneumococcal vaccination found that V116 elicited comparable immune responses regardless of time since prior pneumococcal vaccination, including more than 10 years post-vaccination with PPSV23 (n=56), and 5–9 years post-vaccination with either PPSV23 or other pneumococcal vaccines (n=208). In this study, V116 had a safety profile comparable to both PCV15 and PPSV23.', 'Data from STRIDE-7 (Abstract #1093)STRIDE-7 (NCT05393037) is a Phase 3, double-blind study of V116 in adults living with HIV (n=304). Results showed that V116 was immunogenic for all serotypes covered by the vaccine, as assessed by OPA GMTs and IgG GMCs 30 days post-vaccination. V116 elicited comparable immune responses to the comparator, PCV15+PPSV23, for all 13 shared serotypes and higher immune responses for the eight serotypes covered only by V116. Fewer participants experienced adverse events (AEs) with V116 (71.6%) compared with PCV15+PPSV23 (91%), primarily due to fewer injection-site AEs.', 'Data from STRIDE-9 (Abstract #1085)STRIDE-9 (NCT05633992) is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, active-comparator controlled study, which investigated V116 in Japanese adults 65 years of age and older who had not previously received a pneumococcal vaccine (n=450). Serotype-specific OPA responses were measured at baseline and 30 days post-vaccination and results demonstrated that V116 elicited noninferior immune responses for the 12 serotypes shared with PPSV23 and serotype 15B, (which is included in PPSV23 but not included in V116).

Urine samples from patients were evaluated for antigens from 30 pneumococcal serotypes using novel serotype-specific urinary antigen detection (SSUAD) assays (all serotypes in PCV15, PCV20 and V116 are included except 15B). Among the 242 serotypes detected by SSUAD assays, approximately 84% were covered by V116, compared to approximately 64% covered by PCV20.

The serotypes covered by V116 are responsible for approximately 83% of invasive pneumococcal disease in individuals 65 years of age and older, based on the same CDC data. V116 is designed to be administered as a single dose to help prevent invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumococcal pneumonia in adults.', 'The V116 Phase 3 program includes multiple studies, including STRIDE-3 (NCT05425732), STRIDE-4 (NCT05464420), STRIDE-5 (NCT05526716), STRIDE-6 (NCT05420961), STRIDE-7 (NCT05393037), STRIDE-8 (NCT05696080), STRIDE-9 (NCT05633992) and STRIDE-10 (NCT05569954).', 'About Pneumococcal DiseasePneumococcal disease is an infection caused by a bacteria called Streptococcus pneumoniae. There are more than 100 different types (referred to as serotypes) of pneumococcal bacteria, which can affect adults differently than children. Certain serotypes threaten to put more people at risk for invasive pneumococcal illnesses, such as bacteremia (infection in the bloodstream); bacteremic pneumonia (pneumonia with bacteremia); and meningitis (infection of the coverings of the brain and spinal cord), as well as non-invasive pneumonia (when pneumococcal disease is confined to the lungs).', 'While healthy adults can suffer from pneumococcal disease, patient populations particularly vulnerable to infection include older adults and those with certain chronic or immunocompromising health conditions, such as heart disease, lung disease and liver disease. Mortality from invasive pneumococcal disease is highest among adults 50 years of age and older.', 'Merck’s Commitment to Pneumococcal Disease ProtectionMerck has been at the forefront of pneumococcal disease prevention through vaccination for more than four decades and remains committed to helping to protect people of all ages from this disease. Merck’s ongoing pneumococcal vaccine development program is designed to provide options that address the specific needs of different populations, including infants and children, healthy adults and at-risk sub-groups. This approach recognizes that disease burden in pediatric and adult populations is often driven by different bacterial strains, or serotypes, and aims to address unmet needs by offering vaccine options that target serotypes posing the greatest global risk to each population.

Can a brand like that get its 'cool' back?"", ""It is possible. My best example of a brand turnaround was Old Spice when I was at P&G. A long time ago, it was cool for our fathers, maybe our grandfathers, though the advertising was sexist by today's standards. It had to be renewed for the next generation, and we ultimately turned it into a multi-billion dollar brand. Another example is New Balance (not part of VF), which has lost its cool. Look at it now."", ""A big part of VF's modus operandi was M&A, thanks to its track record of turning brands it bought into market-leading names. What is your M&A philosophy?"", ""It's about turning the business around for long-term sustainable growth, not deals. I don't expect us to make any transformational deals now. I want to put pressure on getting organic growth and turning these brands into strong, sustainable growth engines. I don't want to be a portfolio investor; I want to be a business grower."", ""On your last quarterly call, you mentioned the warm winter in much of North America is hurting The North Face. Do you worry about climate change's impact on the brand?"", ""I do worry about climate change overall, but brands also need to figure out how to expand constantly. For The North Face, we have a team working on about five different strategies so we can make sure they are relevant 365 days a year, at least outdoors, not just when you're not on the mountain in winter. We have so many opportunities to grow. We tend to skew more males than females, so we have ample opportunities with women."", 'When will you know your brands have their mojo back, and will you be less hands-on after the point?', ""I'm a heat-seeking missile, and I go wherever I can help. Where I can't help, I want to make sure we have the best people. If I were a division leader working for me, I wouldn't want the CEO to be doing what I am doing with Vans.

Here's why all three of these dividend stocks have more room to run."", ""Lee Samaha (Caterpillar): The construction, mining, infrastructure, energy, power, and transportation machinery equipment maker has products its customers want. That much is clear from its fourth-quarter earnings report. The company's sales volume declined, taking its profit from sales volume down by $260 million year over year. However, this was more than offset by an increase in price of $982 million."", ""Caterpillar had a standout year, generating record sales of $67.1 billion, record adjusted operating profit of $13.7 billion, and record free cash flow (FCF) of $10 billion from its machinery, energy, and transportation segment.

For example, if interest rates come down in 2024, then it's likely that Caterpillar's construction equipment sales will benefit from a pickup in construction activity. In addition, spending related to 2021's $1 trillion infrastructure bill is only starting to come through now. Moreover, lower interest rates could boost mining and energy prices, and also make investing in commodity projects more financially feasible."", ""If these things come together and Caterpillar's impressive pricing power still holds, then improving sales volumes and pricing could lead to Caterpillar exceeding expectations again in 2024."", ""Scott Levine (IBM): These days, it feels as if Nvidia dominates every conversation touching on artificial intelligence (AI).

In fact, Big Blue is a Dow stock that doesn't only provide AI exposure but an attractive dividend as well. Whether you're focused on investing to profit from the AI trend or looking to generate strong passive income -- or both -- IBM stock, with its forward yield of 3.4% at the current share price, is a great opportunity."", 'The company is starting the year with strong momentum regarding its AI business. In its fourth-quarter report, IBM noted that from the third to the fourth quarters, it nearly doubled its book of business (which the company defines as revenue, software-as-a-service contract revenue, and consulting signings) for generative AI and the Watsonx data and AI platform.', ""Since the start of 2024, IBM stock has raced 18.3% higher, well outperforming the S&P 500, which has climbed 7.3%. But extend your view to this time last year, and IBM stock's performance is even more impressive. While the S&P 500 has risen about 34% over the past 12 months, IBM has zoomed about 54% higher.

We would usually expect to see the share price rise as a result. So given the share price is down it's worth checking some other metrics too."", ""Given the healthiness of the dividend payments, we doubt that they've concerned the market.

Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money.

The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for AES the TSR over the last 3 years was -37%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!"", 'While the broader market gained around 31% in the last year, AES shareholders lost 32% (even including dividends). However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Unfortunately, last year\'s performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 1.0% over the last half decade. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This spices and seasonings company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.58 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -1.7%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $1.55 billion, down 0.8% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.08% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for McCormick?', ""For McCormick, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.26%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.', 'So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that McCormick will beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that McCormick would post earnings of $0.79 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.85, delivering a surprise of +7.59%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", ""McCormick doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release."", 'Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And we've seen plenty of them soar in recent times, leading the index's gains."", ""In some cases, you may hold off on investing in certain players that have climbed a lot in recent weeks or months. The risk is they may have become too expensive and could be ready for stagnation or declines. But in other cases, the recent increase may be just a taste of the company's long-term performance potential. That means investing right now is a great idea. Here are two soaring stocks that fit the bill, and that means I'd buy them today with no hesitation."", ""Target's (NYSE: TGT) earnings and share price suffered over the past two years as rising inflation weighed on the consumer's buying power. But the retailer relied on its strengths such as the importance of its stores in the fulfillment process and the popularity and high margins of its owned brands, just to mention two examples -- and Target launched an efficiency plan too."", 'Above all, Target has continued to focus on its long-term development, opening new stores and revamping others to keep customers loving the shopping experience.', ""The result? Target's most recent earnings report showed tremendous progress, with the company announcing full-year wins in many metrics. Cash from operations more than doubled year over year to $8.6 billion, the operating income margin rate of 5.3% was almost two percentage points higher than the previous year, and GAAP and adjusted earnings per share of $8.94 both were about 50% higher than in 2022. Target also realized cost savings of more than $500 million."", 'All of this shows Target is heading for better days, and its stores should continue to drive growth. As chief executive officer Brian Cornell pointed out in the recent earnings call, the majority of U.S. shopping still happens in stores on any given day. Now Target trades for only 17 times forward earnings estimates, even after advancing 17% this year -- so this looks like a great time to get in on this top stock set to benefit as the U.S. consumer recovers and thrives over the long term.', ""Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) also went through a rough patch in recent years as higher inflation hurt the consumer and made the company's operations more expensive too. But Amazon revamped its cost structure, an effort that has already been bearing fruit and should continue to boost earnings down the road."", ""In the most recent quarter, the e-commerce giant reported net sales that climbed in the double digits, and operating income more than quadrupled. This is thanks to the company's growth in e-commerce, of course, but also thanks to its cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS). In fact, historically, AWS has driven profit at Amazon, and this trend looks set to continue. AWS generated $7.1 billion in operating income in the quarter, representing 54% of total Amazon operating income."", 'Amazon also is benefiting from its investment in the high-growth area of artificial intelligence (AI). The company uses AI to streamline operations, saving time and money and keeping customers happy as it delivers packages faster. And AWS sells a wide variety of AI services to customers, from chips and coding companions to a fully managed service that allows clients to tailor top large language models to their needs.', ""Amazon, after rising 15% so far this year, trades for 41 times forward earnings estimates, down from more than 56 just a few months ago.

RF is well-poised for revenue growth on the back of steady loan growth. The company’s capital distribution activities are backed by a strong liquidity profile. However, elevated expenses and lack of loan portfolio diversification remain near-term concerns.The company currently operates in strategic markets with strong economic and business trends, which are likely to propel loan growth for the bank. In fact, over the past five years (ended 2023), the metric witnessed a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.4%. Management expects low single-digit average loan growth for 2024.Driven by solid loan balance and high interest rates, both net interest income (NII) and net interest margin witnessed improvement in the past. NII saw a CAGR of 7.3% over the past five years, ending 2023. While loan growth will support spread income, a rise in deposit costs is likely to affect the metric in the near term.In 2021, the bank acquired Clearsight, Sabal Capital and EnerBank USA for revenue diversification. Regions Financial continues to explore opportunities for bolt-on acquisition and enhancing wealth management capabilities. By committing to diversifying revenue streams and meeting customer needs via diverse services, we believe such endeavors will likely support its growth prospects in the long term.Regions Financial boosts shareholder value through its capital-deployment activities. In July 2023, RF raised its quarterly common stock dividend by 20% to 24 cents per share. Under its $2.5 billion share repurchase program, as of the end of 2023, $2.2 billion remained available for buyback through the fourth quarter of 2024. Given the company’s robust liquidity, its capital deployment activities seem sustainable and will drive investors’ confidence in the stock.Regions Financial prioritizes investment in talent and technology to support growth. The company introduced digital platforms and redesigned mobile apps for its business clients in order to grow active users of mobile banking and increase digital sales.RF currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Shares of the company have gained 1.1% over the past six months against the industry’s decline of 4.4%.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Despite the above-mentioned tailwinds, the company continues to record an increase in expenses. Non-interest expenses witnessed a CAGR of 4.3% between 2018 and 2023. The rise was primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefit expenses and other expenses. A rising expense base is likely to hurt the bottom line in the near term.Regions Financial’s mortgage income, which is a key component of its non-interest income, witnessed a negative CAGR of 4.5% over the 2018-2023 period. The decrease in 2023 was mainly due to lower mortgage production and sales as a result of higher market interest rates. Moreover, high mortgage rates are likely to continue affecting residential first mortgage loan origination volume and margins in the upcoming period, further restricting mortgage income.As of Dec 31, 2023, the company’s total commercial loans comprise 57% of its total loan portfolio. In the recent quarters, the company witnessed pressure in the commercial loan portfolio due to the rapidly changing macroeconomic backdrop and high interest rates. Going forward, in case of any economic downturn, the asset quality of the loan category may deteriorate. Thus, the lack of loan portfolio diversification is likely to hurt the company’s financials if the economic situation worsens.', 'Some better-ranked bank stocks worth mentioning are Simmons First National Corp.

Investors should keep inflation in mind and position their portfolios accordingly.', 'How? Some companies can not only deal with inflation but thrive on it. Two great examples are Visa (NYSE: V) and Mastercard (NYSE: MA). These two leading payment networks can protect your portfolio from inflation.', ""I'll show you how these two companies can do it below."", ""First, it's essential to understand what inflation is and why it can be harmful. Inflation is the rise of prices. It generally happens in two ways. Prices rise when there is more demand for something than available supply, called demand-pull inflation."", ""On the other hand, cost-push inflation happens when the cost of making something increases, and producers raise prices to compensate. Inflation is normal, but too much can harm consumers, especially when it outpaces wage growth. In other words, prices rise faster than incomes. When that happens, consumers' buying power and quality of life decline."", 'Visa and Mastercard are payment networks that pass information between merchants where you swipe your payment card and the banks that hold your money or credit. Payment networks are like toll booths -- Visa and Mastercard collect a small fee, a percentage of each transaction that passes through the network.', ""If prices rise, the fees rise, because it's a percentage of the transaction value. So, generally speaking, Visa and Mastercard might be considered inflation-proof."", ""The only thing that has slowed Visa and Mastercard's remarkable growth since the early 2000s has been the occasional crisis that has muted consumer spending. Below, you can see the dip that occurred when the economy slowed to a virtual standstill amid COVID-19 lockdowns."", ""Over the long term, Visa and Mastercard will enjoy a two-pronged tailwind of steady, inflation-driven revenue growth and a broader shift away from cash as a payment method. Visa's transaction count has almost quadrupled from 58 billion in 2013 to 212 billion in 2023. Mastercard has done even better, growing from 18 billion to 171 billion."", 'The global market for digital payments is projected to grow by 15% annually and reach over $24 trillion by 2030. It seems realistic that Visa and Mastercard could each continue growing revenue at a pace near double digits for years to come.', 'Both Visa and Mastercard are poised to generate great long-term investment returns as long as they keep growing revenue. Here is how. Not only is double-digit revenue growth a high floor for returns, but Visa and Mastercard are also remarkably profitable. These companies generate a ton of cash flow from their respective revenue.', ""Both companies pay a dividend, but most cash flow goes to repurchase shares, further boosting earnings growth. Fewer shares mean more profit per share. Over the past decade, Visa's share count has declined by over 18% and Mastercard's by over 20%. There is no reason it can't continue."", 'These market-beaters also trade at reasonable valuations today. Both companies have roughly the same price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, around 2. That\'s not cheap; I typically look to buy at PEG ratios of 1.5 or less. However, it\'s arguably fair for companies with the profit and the long track record of growth that Visa and Mastercard possess. These stocks have been ""expensive"" for over a decade and have crushed the market anyway.', 'Investors can consider adding both names to a long-term portfolio and buying on the dips to hold shares indefinitely.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Mastercard right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Mastercard, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Mastercard wasn’t one of them.

Much like Plato’s allegory of the cave, our quest to travel is a conscious effort to rattle the chains of our cavic existence, expanding the horizons of our primitive minds in the process. Since the alleviation of COVID-19 travel restrictions, the human passion for globetrotting has been set ablaze once more. According to UNWTO, tourism levels reached 88% of pre-pandemic levels in 2023, and are expected to surpass them in 2024.', 'At the same time, unprecedented inflation in the wake of the pandemic has made it extremely expensive to vacation with the same liberty as we had previously been used to. Consequently, many tourists are actively avoiding travel to popular tourist destinations, accusing these places of being “tourist traps”. Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) recently revealed its “Unpack 24” report that states affordable alternatives to popular hotspots, or “Destination Dupes”, which is a top trend among travelers in 2024. Recently, destination dupes became a viral trend on TikTok, as users from all over the world pitched in their take on the question, “What is the most underrated place to travel?”. In addition to TikToks, websites such as Tripadvisor, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP) are also playing a pivotal role in driving tourists towards new destinations. Reviews published on such sites are crucial for driving business and provide unfamiliar third world destinations with the opportunity to market on the same platforms as the biggest tourist attractions.', 'Asian countries were some of the first to face the plight of COVID-19, because of which these were also the destinations which experienced the most severe travel restrictions from the rest of the world. As such, Asia has not been able to bank on the recent uptick in tourism in the same manner as the other continents. UNWTO revealed that while tourism increased to 88% of pre-pandemic levels in 2023, the figure for Asia-Pacific was only 65%. However, the potential for tourism in this region has not gone unnoticed. Tripadvisor, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP) released its list of Top 2024 Destinations According to Global Travelers, wherein Asia claimed 8 out of the top 10 destinations.

Penetration in the Asian market allows companies like Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) to enhance their alternative accommodations segment, which is becoming a popular feature of tourism in the region.

Next, we accumulated places within these countries from approximately 20 different sources, including credible new outlets and popular travel websites, to come up with a preliminary list of Asian travel destinations. Using a consensus approach, we shortlisted the places which had been recommended most frequently. Further research was narrowed to these places only. Once this list was obtained, we scored each destination based on the rank they had obtained in the previous lists, relative to the size of the list. For example, a destination recommended at number 6 in a list of top 10 most underrated travel destinations in Asia was assigned a score of 6/10 or 0.6. In case a source had not ranked its recommendations, each place received a score of 0.5. Each destination’s score was then accumulated. In case of a tie, we incorporated further feedback using online forums and user reviews (excluding influencer-generated feedback due to bias) to decide which destination would be ranked higher in our list of the most underrated travel destinations in Asia.', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

Clark, a former US airbase, is a city that offers the perfect blend of scenery, history, and modern attractions. The city has a wide range of historical landmarks such as decommissioned military facilities and museums, along with a dinosaur theme park that is perfect for entertaining children. Its most impressive attraction is the majestic Mount Pinatubo, where tourists get to summit through the Crow Valley before setting their sights on the Crater Lake.', 'IM Score: 1.57', 'Although Thailand is one of the most visited countries in Asia and its cities can hardly be deemed underrated, Koh Kood is one of the country’s lesser-known islands. This untarnished gem is one of the most underrated travel destinations in Asia, and a perfect location for a reclusive vacation. Tourists can snorkel on the shores of its pristine beaches, kayak through beautiful mangrove forests, and explore plenty of obscure tracks into the heart of the island.', 'IM Score: 1.62', 'Kerala is a state that stretches 600 Km across India’s Malabar coast. It offers tourists one of the most comprehensive tropical experiences in Asia. Apart from the magnificent shorelines of Varkala, you can cruise on houseboats along the Periyar river, or Trek in the Ambukuthi Hills which feature petroglyphs dating back to the Neolithic age. Another impressive sight is Fort Kochi, a coastal settlement that features monuments of Portuguese, British, and Dutch architecture.', 'IM Score: 1.62', 'Busan is typically reduced to the status of being a port city, however, it is so much more. The Haeundae Beach is a prominent site for beach goers and offers one of the most picturesque sunsets in the world. Busan is also notable for its religious sites as it features many historical temples and tombs, each of which is accompanied with its unique mythical folklore.', 'IM Score: 1.65', 'Another one of the most underrated travel destinations in Asia is Hue. This city was once the imperial capital of the Nguyen Dynasty. Many of the city’s historical sites are well preserved, including the citadel.

It offers views (and treks to) some of the highest peaks in the world. The Deosai National Park, a UNESCO heritage sight, is the second highest plateau in the world. Moreover, the Sarfaranga desert is the highest and coldest desert on the planet, and a popular place for stargazing as it allow you to glimpse the peripheries of the Milky Way.', 'IM Score: 1.74', 'Home to the tallest Buddha statue in the world, Leshan offers a mesmeric and insightful view into the religion of Nirvana. The Giant Buddha, carved out of the face of a cliff, is present at the junction of the Min and Dadu rivers, and is the main reason people flock to visit this city. Moreover, Leshan is popular for its Sichuanese cuisine, which perfectly complements the spiritual odyssey you experience in Leshan.', 'IM Score: 1.74', 'The island nation of Taiwan is perhaps the most underrated country in Southeast Asia. Although most of the country’s major travel destinations can be explored in a single trip, we especially recommend the port city of Kaohsiung. This city offers incredible waterside sceneries, vibrant night markets, and many spiritual temples.', 'IM Score: 1.75', 'On the surface, Dhaka is an overcrowded mesh of traffic and sunburns, however, its blend of subcontinental culture with modern development means it is one of our most underrated travel destinations in Asia. It is caulked with historical monuments from the Mughal, British, and East Pakistani eras. If you wish to get a glimpse of the region’s diverse history, you will find it etched upon the walls of the Ahsan Manzil, Lalbagh Fort, and Star Mosque, some of Dhaka’s most prominent landmarks.', 'IM Score: 1.77', 'Similarly to Dhaka, our minds have a preexistent notion of what a trip to Japan would encompass, and its generally to the note of skyscrapers and tightly packed markets. However, in the northern mountains of the country is Hachimantai City. Famous for its year round ski resort, Appi Kogen, the city is the perfect destination to explore rustic hot springs, courtesy of the stratovolcanos which encircle the area. Moreover, it is regarded as being a more authentic experience of the Japanese tradition in comparison to the contemporary culture of Tokyo.', 'IM Score: 1.78', 'Pontianak is regarded as being a diversified melting pot of the Malay, Dayak, and Chinese cultures. Visitors have plenty of opportunities for boating as they traverse their way through the city’s floating market, enjoy river cruises in the Kalimantan rainforest, or venture through the pretzeled mangrove plantations of the Kapuas Delta. Moreover, it is also in close proximity of the tempestuous Mount Kelam and the Betung Kerihun National Park, the latter being a UNESCO heritage site and habitat of Bornean Orangutans.', 'IM Score: 1.92', 'If you’re looking for a mixture of entertainment, adventure, and intellectual stimulation, Johor Bahru might be the perfect destination for you. Tourists can visit the Sultan Abu Bakar State Mosque or the Arulmigu Sri Rajakaliamman Glass Temple, giving them a glance at the spiritual significance of the city. If you’re looking for an excuse to ramp up your heartbeat, visit Legoland Malaysia. Or you might retreat to the sandy shores of Rawa Island, the ideal place to unwind and bask under the setting sun.', 'IM Score: 1.93', 'If you consider yourself an avant-garde explorer, hurry up and study the remnants of medieval China in the region of Gansu. Once a passage along the ancient silk road, Gansu is one of China’s untouched historical treasures.

Led by a surge in tech megacaps, often referred to as the ""Magnificent Seven,"" equities bounced back, mitigating earlier losses. This trend, characterized by Bank of America Corp., highlights the dominance of a select group of technology giants driving market gains. Notably, Nvidia Corp. experienced a notable uptick, fueled by optimism surrounding its latest chip technology, which is anticipated to catalyze further growth, already evidenced by a staggering $1 trillion increase in the company\'s market value this year. Simultaneously, the bond market stabilized following a recent downturn, during which traders adjusted their expectations for future policy easing. As Wall Street anticipates the Federal Reserve\'s decision, scheduled for Wednesday, investors are closely monitoring signals regarding potential adjustments to the rate-cut outlook. Amid these developments, Bank of Japan\'s Ueda commented on the confirmation of a positive feedback loop between wages and prices, contributing to the broader economic landscape. The collective sentiment among traders underscores the intricate interplay between market dynamics and central bank policies, shaping investment strategies and market movements. As the landscape evolves, market participants remain vigilant, analyzing emerging trends and developments for potential opportunities and risks.', ""The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has made a significant policy shift by abandoning its negative rates and unconventional easing measures, reported CNBC. This move, following robust wage negotiations and signals of sustainable price increases, marks a departure from its long-standing ultra-loose monetary policy. The decision triggered a sharp decline in the Japanese yen, reflecting market reactions to the BOJ's shift towards normalizing monetary policy. Going forward, the BOJ will focus on utilizing short-term interest rates as its primary policy tool, aiming to maintain accommodative financial conditions while gradually scaling back its asset purchases. However, the central bank remains cautious about the pace of rate hikes, considering the fragile economic outlook. While the immediate global impact of the BOJ's decision is expected to be limited, concerns persist about potential volatility stemming from the unwinding of carry trades and capital repatriation to Japan. Nevertheless, the BOJ's gradual approach to policy normalization suggests a measured response to evolving economic conditions. Looking ahead, market analysts anticipate continued adjustments in bond yields and monetary policy as the BOJ navigates the complexities of achieving sustained economic growth. The broader implications of these policy shifts are yet to unfold, with market participants closely monitoring developments and their potential impact on global financial markets."", 'On the stock market front, analysts are bullish on stocks such as Ulta Beauty, Inc.

The company is an asset-light global lodging franchisor and operator that benefits from strong network effects.

Marriott has an extensive portfolio of brands ranging from luxury brands such as The Ritz-Carlton, to premium brands such as Westin Hotels & Resorts, to select brands such as Residence Inn by Marriott. The company is doing an excellent job converting independent hotels into the Marriott system through its soft brands including the Luxury Collection, the Autograph Collection, and the Tribute Portfolio. This conversion opportunity should benefit Marriott’s net unit growth in a period when new hotel development could be challenging in North American and Europe. The company generates robust free cash flow through its long-term, contracted franchise fee and management fee revenue streams. Its competitive advantages include brand strength, operational scale, direct booking systems, and loyalty programs.

In 2022, we purchased Netflix and added to our position in Meta on weakness as both stocks were selling significantly below our estimates of fair value. Netflix and other media stocks were out of favor due to questions about the long-term economics of streaming, slowing subscriber growth and increasing competition. Meta’s challenges were more self-inflicted as a ramp-up in spending caused free cash flow to plummet. We saw Netflix’s slowing subscriber growth as a normal feature of a maturing streaming market. Despite growth having slowed, Netflix’s position as the largest streaming service with currently close to 250 million subscribers is a key strategic advantage. Streaming is a scale and intellectual property business model that will result in a few large winners. Netflix remains far ahead of all streaming peers in subscribers, revenue, content spend and cash flow generation. Importantly, Netflix has also evolved its business model over the past year, becoming more efficient with its content spending, cracking down on password sharing and introducing a lower cost advertising-supported tier (lowering subscriber churn). These changes have led to robust earnings and free cash flow growth.

The approach could also lead to ""a congestion issue,"" with many customers using the same connectivity in the same markets.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith"", ""JOSH LIPTON: Wireless companies have been piling hundreds of billions of dollars into 5G infrastructure in the US over the last few years but haven't really been reaping the benefits so far. But it seems that 2020 may be the year that things seem to change, at least for a few telecom giants, according to our next guest. Joining us now is Keith Schneider, CFRA Research Senior Equity Analyst."", ""Keith, it is good to see you. So it's interesting, Keith, your point is that, listen, these wireless companies, we know they've dedicated a lot of time and effort and a whole lot of money to 5G, Keith, but they haven't really monetized that yet, at least in any kind of meaningful way. Maybe to start, Keith, I'm just interested, why is that? What are the hurdles here that you would outline, both on consumer and enterprise?"", ""KEITH SNYDER: Sure. I mean, this is kind of the first generation that we've seen that just providing connectivity services isn't enough. So looking back at 4G LTE, 4G, 3G, just being able to connect people to each other, that was good enough for wireless companies."", ""With 5G, you have so many other alternatives. You have Wi-Fi 6. You have satellite internet coming out with Starlink. And Amazon's planning a big network. You have competition from all sides. And so now it's become a services game. And really, what we're seeing is these companies are going to need to, one, communicate to customers what they can offer. But, two, really redefine their business model as on the consumer side especially."", ""People didn't care about 5G. I mean, 5G is nice to have. But when they tried to push price increases, adding $10, $15 per month for 5G services, people really pushed back. And they walked back on that really quickly. And so consumers just don't want 5G. And they don't want to pay more for 5G."", ""So you know, it's going to be interesting to see how these companies monetize the hundreds of billions that they're pouring into these networks every year."", 'ALEXANDRA CANAL: When do you expect these companies to be able to eventually monetize? Is that soon, or are we still a ways out from that?', ""KEITH SNYDER: I mean, we've seen it in somewhat an indirect way with fixed wireless access. And so that's basically providing broadband service via 5G network. The issue is you have companies like AT&T and Verizon, who have existing wireline broadband businesses. So they have to be really careful about what markets they roll these services out to, so they don't cannibalize their own businesses."", ""You know, T-Mobile has been pushing really hard on the FWA front. But at the end of the day, given that fixed wireless access customers share the same network as wireless customers, it becomes a congestion issue. And so what we're seeing is companies kind OF cap the number of customers they're willing to sign up, especially on the AT&T and Verizon side."", ""But looking to when they can actually fully monetize it is probably going to be next year if not another year beyond that. It's going to be the enterprise customers who are really clamoring for the really cool technologies that we're seeing with 5G. Network slicing, low latency communications, IoT networks, these are all going to be big moneymakers. It's just no one's really fleshed out the software side of things, and no one really has an idea of how to deploy this on a large scale.""]"

There's also little question, at least in my mind, that AI is fueling a classic bubble. Start-ups founded less than a year ago, like Mistral AI, are already worth billions. Some publicly traded companies, notably server maker Super Micro Computer, have seen their valuations skyrocket to levels that seem illogical. Caution is increasingly being thrown to the wind."", ""Nvidia and its GPUs are at the center of it all. Not only are the company's GPUs well suited for the calculations necessary for training and running AI models, but its proprietary CUDA platform has become the de facto standard for accelerated computing over the past 16 years. With companies scrambling to win the AI race, Nvidia's GPUs are the path of least resistance."", ""It's not surprising then that demand for Nvidia's AI accelerators has exploded. The company's data center segment generated $18.4 billion of revenue in its latest quarter, a fivefold increase from the prior-year period. Profits are soaring as well.

Intel will launch the third generation of its capable Gaudi line of AI accelerators this year. OpenAI's Sam Altman is reportedly seeking vast funding for new semiconductor factories to build AI chips. Cloud giants including Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft are designing and installing their own AI chips. The list goes on."", ""Here's how the current shortage turns into a glut. First, insatiable demand and extravagant long-term projections drive a wave of competition. This is what's happening now. AMD has predicted that the AI chip market will reach $400 billion by 2027. For perspective, global semiconductor sales were just over $500 billion last year."", ""Second, future demand inevitably falls short of these wild projections. AI chip demand can still soar in the coming years and miss expectations, given how optimistic industry players have become. Eventually, this leads to a situation where there's more than enough supply of AI chips."", ""At this point, Nvidia's pricing power would have eroded considerably. CUDA would no longer be dominant as alternatives pop up and gain traction. For big cloud companies, there's a strong incentive to be able to support AI accelerators from a wide variety of suppliers."", ""This isn't the first time Nvidia's stock has soared thanks to a revolutionary technology.

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value.

While both strategies aim to enhance value for investors, they follow distinct paths. The primary distinction lies in the pricing. Growth stocks tend to be pricier, with high valuations relative to their sales or earnings. Conversely, value stocks are more affordable, with lower stock prices in comparison to their sales or earnings. Over time, both growth and value investment approaches have demonstrated comparable performance, yet historical analysis indicates that value investing has been more advantageous for investors in the long term. According to research published by Josef Lakonishok, Andrei Shleifer, and Robert W. Vishny in the Journal of Finance, value strategies tend to yield superior returns. Various investment strategies centered around purchasing undervalued stocks have consistently outperformed those focused on trendy or high-flying stocks from April 1968 to April 1990.', 'The research paper also emphasized that value stocks typically offer significantly higher dividend yields and possess stronger fundamental ratios compared to growth stocks. Both Josef Lakonishok and the value investing expert David Dreman have observed that value investing outperforms growth investing approximately 70% of the time, regardless of the size of the companies involved. Their studies, which encompassed various company sizes, revealed that value stocks consistently delivered average returns of slightly over 7% per year higher than growth stocks over extended periods.', 'As mentioned earlier, dividends are often a key component of value stocks. Among dividend strategies, one of the most popular approaches is investing in dividend aristocrats. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index tracks the performance of companies within the S&P 500 that have consistently increased their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. A report from S&P Dow Jones Indices indicated that strategies focusing on generating income often exhibit significant value characteristics. Investors typically gravitate towards securities offering high dividend yields and lower price multiples. The report also mentioned that the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index demonstrated a blend of both growth and value traits, rather than a pronounced bias towards one style. Analysis of the index composition from 1999 to 2022 revealed its style breakdown. On average, the index maintained a 59.04% exposure to value stocks and a 40.94% exposure to growth stocks during this period.', 'Despite the allure of high-priced growth stocks, value stocks have consistently proven to be advantageous for investors over the long haul. Dimensional Funds conducted an analysis spanning nearly a century, affirming that value stocks typically offer higher expected returns. While there have been occasional downturns, the fundamental principle that lower relative prices correlate with higher expected returns remains steadfast. Value premiums have often manifested swiftly and significantly. For instance, in years when value outperformed growth, the average premium amounted to nearly 15%. On average, in the US, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks by 4.4% annually from 1927 to 2022.', ""Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Emerson Electric Co.

As these types of stocks raise their dividend payments, that can help offset the effects of inflation and allow you to grow your dividend income without any additional effort on your part.', ""Three stocks that recently raised their payouts by more than 10% are Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS), Yum! Brands (NYSE: YUM), and American Express (NYSE: AXP). Here's a closer look at just how good these stocks are as dividend investments -- and whether you should expect more dividend increases from them in the future."", 'Entertainment and media giant Walt Disney reinstated its dividend this year. It suspended it during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic amid some incredibly challenging conditions for its business. But now the company behind Mickey Mouse and other iconic brands has gotten back to paying a dividend. And with some encouraging results of late, the company has also decided to give its dividend a big boost.', ""In February, Disney announced that it would increase its quarterly dividend by 50%. The $0.45 quarterly dividend will be just the second one it has paid since resuming payouts earlier this year. The first payment, in January, was $0.30. With the increase in the dividend, the stock's yield is 1.6%. Back in 2019, the company's quarterly dividend was $0.88."", ""Disney's revenue for the last three months of 2023 was flat at $23.5 billion although pre-tax income of $2.9 billion rose by 62% as the company has been slashing its expenses. Income investors may want to proceed cautiously with Disney right now, however, as the company is still struggling to make its streaming service profitable, is contemplating the sale of assets, and recently announced a $1.5 billion investment into video game maker Epic Games."", ""With a lot of balls in the air and the dividend only recently reinstated, this isn't the type of stock I would be comfortable assuming will sustain a payout for the long haul, or that it will continue increasing it. With the stock trading near its 52-week high, investors may be better off taking a wait-and-see approach with Disney's stock right now."", ""Yum! Brands, the company that operates Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, and KFC, can provide investors with a great way to profit from the economy's long-term growth, even amid challenging conditions."", ""Although consumers may be feeling the pinch of higher prices, fast-food restaurants can be relatively cheap options for eating out. And that is evident in Yum! Brands' financial resiliency. In 2023, the company reported 3% revenue growth with sales coming in at just under $7.1 billion. Operating income of $2.3 billion also rose by 6%."", ""In January, the company announced an 11% increase to its quarterly dividend. The $0.67 payment means investors are earning a 2% dividend yield from the stock. Yum! Brands has increased its dividend by 60% in just five years. And with a payout ratio of around 43%, there's still room for more rate hikes in the future."", 'At 24 times earnings, this can make for a good, reasonably priced dividend stock to buy and hold for the long term.', ""Credit card company American Express caters to an affluent customer base, which can make this a safer investment than many other stocks. Last year, the company's revenue net of interest expense totaled $60.5 billion and rose 14% year over year. Net income of $8.4 billion was also up by 11%."", ""This year, American Express announced that its board has authorized a 17% increase to the dividend. The new $0.70 quarterly dividend payment will push the stock's yield up to 1.3%, which is around the S&P 500 average of 1.4%. Five years ago, American Express' dividend was $0.39 -- it has increased by 79% since then."", ""At less than 20 times trailing earnings, the stock makes for a reasonably priced investment to hang on to. With a payout ratio of only 21% and some solid earnings growth, it wouldn't be surprising to see more dividend hikes from American Express in the years ahead."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Tim, great to have you here today. This is a company I cover closely here. And we were talking back and forth of whether or not we think Disney is concerned at all that they could potentially lose this board seat battle. Based on everything that's happened, we're two weeks out from that shareholder meeting, do you think it's a possibility that Nelson Peltz could win this proxy fight?"", ""TIM BAYSINGER: I mean, I think right now, you know, as you guys said Disney clearly has kind of the momentum right now. I mean their stock price has been up since their earnings call the Street. Obviously, loved it as you too pointed out. The next big shoe to drop will come, you know, maybe today, maybe tomorrow, maybe Thursday. Because you mentioned Glass Lewis recommending Disney's board nominees, but the next big one will be ISS putting their recommendation out. And they have a much larger client base. They're much more influential."", ""So what they say really could swing the way this vote goes. If they support Disney's nominees, then you might see Nelson, you know, and Trian maybe pull back a bit or maybe because he's already pulled back once last year. He'll just-- he's committed to seeing it through to the end. But if ISS somehow supports both Nelson and former Disney CFO Jay Rasulo who are trying to get on the board, then that makes that shareholder vote in two weeks very, very interesting."", ""JOSH LIPTON: It's interesting-- you know, what's interesting, too, Tim, is just how we talk about these big name personalities and choosing sides. And obviously, we're talking about George Lucas today. But Trian has its own website outlining their case in this fight. And it's just interesting on that site, Tim, when you look through it, they highlight execs from companies that have worked with Nelson Peltz. And on the site, you'll see them saying very nice things about Mr. Peltz kind of statements that support for him. Who do you think is kind of winning this very public campaign here? Or do we not know yet? We're just going to-- we have to wait for early April?"", ""TIM BAYSINGER: Yeah. I think we're going to have to wait probably until early April. I've covered this business too long to ever really make predictions with concreteness, because things always surprise you. But I would say, right now know Disney looks to be sort of in the lead in this battle."", ""ALEXANDRA CANAL: And Tim, a big question mark has been succession. And succession planning that's been an issue that the activists have brought up. Disney has also said they're working internally to find a candidate some names that have been thrown around, Dana Walden, Jimmy Pitaro. How do you think Disney avoids another Bob Chapek disaster and really find someone that has longevity at this company?"", ""TIM BAYSINGER: I think some of it is that they have to settle on someone of one of these potential four candidates. And they have to stick with it. I mean, for Bob Chapek, you can name the long list of potential Disney CEO successors from Kevin Mayer to Tom Staggs that were even put in that, especially in the case of Staggs that were put in that COO role, which is kind of-- which was seen as, OK, you're sort of the king in waiting for Disney. And then Iger, you know, renews his contract."", ""So I think the biggest thing that they could do to ensure a healthy and successful succession is that they settle on one of these four people or they decide to bring in someone from outside, and they stick with it. Iger doesn't renew his contract, and they finally pick someone. And Iger kind of steps out of the limelight a bit, which he had trouble agreeing on Chapek took over."", ""ALEXANDRA CANAL: So succession obviously a big question mark for investors. There's also other questions at this company when it comes to how they're going to achieve streaming profitability. We've seen the parks business slow. Obviously, linear TV has been on a serious decline. I'm curious to get your opinion on what you think is the main issue at this company, and whether or not Bob Iger has done enough to address that issue for investors."", 'TIM BAYSINGER: Yeah. I think two of their big issues going forward is their movie business. Obviously, Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars, they\'re big brands, have not done too well at the box office recently. Obviously, you know, Disney, Marvel have really, really high hopes for ""Deadpool"" and ""Wolverine"" coming out this summer. But it\'s the only Marvel film this year, which is their lowest in probably a decade.', 'And their other big thing is, as you mentioned, streaming. And not only that, but ESPN. What is it streaming future look like? What is this joint venture with Fox and Warner Brothers Discovery look like? They just named a CEO last week. So I think those are two of the big things and just how do they manage the long-term and probably irreversible decline of their linear TV business.', ""JOSH LIPTON: All right. Big shareholder meeting coming up. We're all going to be watching and keeping a close eye on it. Tim, thanks so much for joining us today. Appreciate it."", 'TIM BAYSINGER: Thanks for having me.']"

What effect does that have on your business?"", ""PIERCE NORTON: It actually has a little effect on our business because we're primarily a fee-based business. So the way we make money for our shareholders is actually just moving the molecules from point A to B, and what we basically do is we're taking those molecules and transporting them to where they have the most value. So most people don't know that natural gas when it comes out of the ground. You actually have to process it and treat it to get it in a marketable form. That's what we do."", 'JULIE HYMAN: And so you all have made a big acquisition in Magellan that closed last September. When it comes to scale in the pipeline business, is bigger better? How do you think about the strategy behind that acquisition?', ""PIERCE NORTON: Well, actually, Julie, bigger is better. And the reason is because it provides a lot of organic opportunities for you. So you get some interlace between the systems. One of the things that we wanted to do with Magellan is diversify our asset base. So we were already in gathering and processing, transmission of natural gas, and the movement of natural gas liquids, but we didn't have refined products in the crude oil piece. And because if you overlay our assets, you can actually use some of the same pieces of pipe to move different products. So we've just expanded our footprint, and it's a tremendous opportunity for our company, our employees, and our shareholders."", 'JULIE HYMAN: So in other words, if you have one pipeline, you might have sub pipes within it running different types of product.', ""PIERCE NORTON: Actually what you can do is you can put different products down the same line. It's called batching."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Oh, is it because there are different weights?', ""PIERCE NORTON: No, it's because you can actually put two different kinds of products in the same line. And when you do, there's just a small interface in between it, and so you can see catch that at the other end and separate them into the tanks that they need to go into."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Interesting. As I mentioned, there's a lot of talk here at CERAWeek and in the general conversation in the energy industry about the so-called transition. But of course, recently, there's been a little bit of pushback against the notion that oil and gas is going anywhere anytime soon. How are you thinking about that and the role of the products that you transport?"", ""PIERCE NORTON: We actually do a lot of studies on this, Julie. And what you really realize is that we've actually been in a transition for 200 years. The country started out actually using wood for its energy source. Then we added coal. We added natural gas. We added nuclear, and then, now, you've got geothermal. You've got the renewables, which is solar and the wind."", ""But we've actually built on it. And the reason is because the population increased and the demand because of your standard of living increased in the United States. The same thing is going to happen in the rest of the world. So there's going to be continued growth in those areas. But we believe it's more about energy addition than necessarily energy transition, and one more thought on that is, when you say transition, you're implying that you're moving from one energy source to another, and you're never going to go back. But if you really study it, it's more about transformation than it is transition."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Meaning what?', ""PIERCE NORTON: Well, meaning that you can use the same thing in maybe a different way. So you can use natural gas to form hydrogen or ammonia or those kinds of things. It's just a tremendous opportunity for, I think, our country as far as energy goes, and especially be the midstream aspects, which is the pipelines."", 'JULIE HYMAN: As you think about to-- you mentioned developing world, moving through different energy sources as well, do you think that you will end up exporting more of your product and not just piping it around the US, but piping it to an export terminal? And do you think demand will be greater even in other countries than in the US at some point?', ""PIERCE NORTON: Well, here's some statistics for you. Over the last 20 years, we've basically consumed around 100 quads of energy, which is just the way we measure the energy source in the United States. May, may fluctuate two or three quads a year based on weather. But what's going to be the interesting thing is to see how data centers use energy in the future and whether or not our domestic energy consumption actually starts to grow because of data centers, but then the rest of the world is going to continue. And we already export 12 to 15 Bcf a day, not us personally, but the industry does off shores of the United States to goes all over the world."", ""JULIE HYMAN: When you talk about our energy necessities, though, as a result of data centers, that's a really interesting topic. It's one that we've been talking a lot about recently. The question is, even if natural gas and other energy sources can provide that energy, can the grid have that capacity to meet the demand from data centers, for example?"", ""PIERCE NORTON: The short answer is probably not. So that really gets into the conversation about infrastructure, whether or not it's pipelines, processing plants, fractionators, petrochemical plants, or even transmission lines, and the ability to build more electric generation in the United States. So I personally think we've got to think a little bit bigger."", ""JULIE HYMAN: And on the pipeline front, there has been some talk about reforming the permitting process for pipelines. How optimistic are you that that's going to get done? And would ONEOK-- where are you on? Would you consider putting in an application for a new pipeline, or do you think it's just we're too far away from that process being more [INAUDIBLE]?"", ""PIERCE NORTON: Well, at ONEOK, we do this every day. I mean, that's what we do, is we permit pipelines, those kind of things. But what I am appreciative of is the dialogue because just a few years ago, we weren't talking about permit reform. We were talking about more regulation. So now you're talking about it, so which, in our opinion, it really focuses on the issues and not necessarily picking sides.""]"

Change has been a constant in the C-suite at Under Armour over the past few years, but not when it comes to the CFO role.', 'The Baltimore-based apparel and footwear retailer announced on March 13 that Kevin Plank, the founder and controlling shareholder, will become CEO—again—effective April 1. Plank will succeed Stephanie Linnartz, who joined the company as CEO in February 2023. Plank, who founded the company about 28 years ago, stepped down as CEO in 2020.', 'Linnartz’s departure was a surprise. As my colleague Maria Aspan writes: “Linnartz, a veteran executive who was previously No. 2 at Marriott International, left the global hotel chain last year to become CEO of Under Armour.\xa0She had said that her turnaround strategy for the company would take three years to execute.”', 'The challenges were many, Aspan adds: ""Under Armour has struggled to grow revenue and profits since its early heyday. Its share price has plummeted since its 2015 peak, and retail experts call its brand identity muddled at best.”', 'Although Under Armour (NYSE: UA, UAA) has had some tumultuous years, including charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2021, one constant has been David Bergman. He joined the firm nearly two decades ago and served in a variety of roles before becoming CFO in 2017.', ""Tom Nikic, analyst and SVP of equity research at Wedbush Securities, wrote in a note to investors following Under Armour’s latest CEO announcement: “The game of ‘musical chairs’ in the CEO seat that UAA has undergone in recent years (3 CEOs in the 4-year gap between Mr. Plank's two tenures) brings a layer of inconsistency and uncertainty to the story that investors don't really want to see.”"", ""But what's Nikic's assessment of Bergman?"", ""“Under Armour has had a lot of problems over the years, but I don't think Dave's been one of them,” he told me."", 'Since Bergman became CFO, the company\'s spending and inventory management has become more disciplined, and they\'re now in a net cash position after the company was “saddled with a lot of debt when he took the reins,” according to Nikic.\xa0“Given all the CEO/COO turnover, it\'s at least somewhat encouraging that there\'s been consistency in the CFO seat, which has likely been a function of his good relationship with Kevin Plank,"" he said.', ""But, Nikic added, there's only so much Bergman can do—the company needs better products, marketing, and execution. And Bergman's long tenure doesn't mean he's bulletproof."", '“What I think all the CEO turnover has shown,"" Nikic added, ""is that Kevin Plank is going to win any and all battles against other executives at the company. So if Dave ever runs afoul of Kevin, Kevin is going to get his way.""', 'In February, Under Armour reported earnings for the period ended Dec. 31, with revenue down 6% to $1.5 billion, which aligned with the company’s outlook. In its fiscal year 2024 outlook, the company expects revenue to be down 3% to 4%, compared with a previous expectation of 2% to 4%.', '""We remain encouraged by our evolving strategies to turn our inconsistencies into strengths,” Bergman said on the most recent earnings call. Managing the supply chain, tightening expenses, optimizing investments, focusing on cash management, and making prudent capital expenditures, all remain key priorities.', '""Without question,"" Bergman said, ""there is much work ahead of us.""', 'Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com', 'María Soledad Davila Calero curated the Leaderboard and Overheard sections of today’s newsletter.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

This indicates that a lot of the earnings are being reinvested into the business, with the aim of fueling growth."", 'Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 44.7% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 32% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.', ""Even over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.48 in 2014, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $1.60. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 13% per annum over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time."", ""Some investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. It's encouraging to see that Oracle has been growing its earnings per share at 6.7% a year over the past five years. Since earnings per share is growing at an acceptable rate, and the payout policy is balanced, we think the company is positioning itself well to grow earnings and dividends in the future."", 'Overall, we think that this is a great income investment, and we think that maintaining the dividend this year may have been a conservative choice. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.', ""Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

They spotlight Lam Research (NASDAQ: LRCX), a titan in semiconductor equipment, Oracle (NYSE: ORCL), a cloud-computing giant pivoting to AI, and Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU), a key player in the indispensable memory sector. Each business is uniquely positioned to thrive in the AI era, promising robust stock returns along the way."", ""In the quest for AI dominance, there's more to the story than just one company. Let's see what savvy investors can learn from this diverse collection of AI insights and promising investment ideas."", ""Billy Duberstein (Lam Research): While Nvidia dominates the AI training chipset today, will it be as dominant in the future? It's certainly possible but not assured."", 'But no matter which AI chip wins out, some things are nearly guaranteed. One is that the AI revolution will require a slew of leading-edge logic, DRAM memory, and NAND flash storage, based on emerging chipmaking technologies.', 'Semiconductor capital-equipment player Lam Research makes the critical equipment that enables foundries to make all of these advanced chips, in some cases winning 100% market share of specific process steps. The processes Lam tends to dominate are in the etch and deposition of chip components in stacked or vertical structures. These verticalization steps will be increasingly crucial in new AI technologies.', 'The technologies include gate-all-around transistors in which transistors are ""stacked"" and surrounded on all sides by gate nanosheets; backside power in which chip components are etched on the back of chips to allow for greater transistor content on the front; and advanced packaging in which holes and connectors are drilled vertically through 3D-stacked chips and high-bandwidth memory. In addition, Lam management highlighted its new dry-resist technology that helps better absorb photons of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) machines as a major opportunity. Currently, dry resist is in lab testing at all major foundry customers.', ""These are each incremental billion-dollar opportunities, according to Lam's management. And it means no matter whether Nvidia or one of its competitors gains the most share of AI chips or memory, Lam stands to benefit due to these broader chipmaking-technology transitions."", 'Moreover, Lam\'s prior ""core"" business in NAND flash is in its worst downturn ever. Despite that, Lam still made nearly $26 per share over the past 12 months in just about the worst environment one can imagine for the NAND investment industry.', 'Not only should NAND investment recover, but investment in NAND will probably eventually exceed its prior highs, CFO Doug Bettinger said at a recent investor conference. That assertion seems likely in the context of AI growth as well. While AI will be a known boon to both leading ledge logic and DRAM chips, AI servers also require about three times the NAND flash memory as a traditional server. And if edge devices and PCs eventually run AI models on edge devices, those devices will also need more ""fast storage"" -- i.e., NAND flash -- per device, too.', ""So when one thinks about a simultaneous AI-driven tech inflection in logic and DRAM chips along with the prospect of a an eventual NAND flash recovery later this year or next year, it's pretty apparent Lam is in for some powerful earnings growth. Combined with robust free-cash-flow generation, even in a trough year last year, and a growing dividend, and Lam looks like an AI winner to hold over the long term."", ""Anders Bylund (Micron Technology): Powerful AI systems require a lot of memory chips. And I mean a lot of memory chips. You know the Nvidia A100 AI accelerators that power the supercomputer OpenAI used to train ChatGPT's large language model (LLM)? That computing beast runs 3,456 computing nodes, each equipped with four A100 chips, and each one holds 64 gigabytes (GB) of DRAM memory right on the card. The nodes also hold 512 GB of shared DRAM managed by an Intel processor. That's 2.6 million gigabytes of random access memory, or 2.6 petabytes."", ""But that's not all. The Leonardo supercomputer also contains nearly 11 petabytes of flash memory in high-speed, solid-state drive (SSD) storage modules. Altogether, the ChatGPT-training supercomputer needs about 14 petabytes of high-end memory."", ""That's just one system, already belonging to an older generation of supercomputers. The next wave of LLM training platforms uses even more AI accelerators, more DRAM, and more flash-based storage. And since every tech giant worth its salt wants to take advantage of the AI boom, demand for these computing monsters runs high."", 'Micron Technology sees enormous value in the AI frenzy. The central data-crunching is also supported by beefier -- and more memory-hungry -- computing systems in many places.', '""Generative AI use cases are expanding from the data center to the edge with several recent announcements of AI-enabled PCs, smartphones with on-device AI capabilities as well as embedded AI in the auto and industrial end markets,"" Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said in December\'s first-quarter 2024 earnings call. ""From the data center to the edge, AI has emerged as a significant secular driver that will further bolster the industry toward record revenue [total addressable market] in 2025 and drive growth for years to come.""', ""AI computing will be a serious growth driver for Micron in the next few years. Unit prices are also on the rebound after a couple of weak years -- a common pattern in the highly cyclical memory-chip market. And amid these bullish signs, Micron shares trade at the affordable valuation ratios of 6 times sales and 13.5 times forward-earnings estimates. This leading provider of world-class memory chips is poised to soar as the AI mania plays out, and the stock is a bargain-bin find next to Nvidia's lofty valuation ratios."", 'Nicholas Rossolillo (Oracle): In the autumn of 2022, in the midst of the bear market and before all the Nvidia AI frenzy got rolling, an old and forgotten software company called Oracle quietly struck a deal with Nvidia.', ""You see, Oracle was still in the early stages of building its cloud-computing infrastructure service in which it rents out the use of data-center computing to customers, which can access those services on demand via an internet connection. In a bid to catch up to the cloud-infrastructure giants Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet Google Cloud, Oracle Cloud inked a deal to be the first to purchase and install Nvidia's AI-accelerated computing servers."", 'The rest, as they say, is history. Nvidia stock has gone off like a rocket since then.', ""But in all reality, the old software giant of yesteryear, Oracle, hasn't done so badly either. It's been putting up its best growth rates in years thanks to its head start plugging Nvidia chips and hardware into its cloud. The last quarter (which just ended in February 2024) was another case in point. Revenue increased 7% year over year, but resulting earnings per share jumped 16% year over year. Talk about positive operating leverage. A little additional revenue is almost entirely trickling down to the bottom-line profit for Oracle right now."", ""Oracle's cloud-infrastructure segment (versus the slower-growing and larger software segments) is responsible for much of this expansion, increasing 49% year over year to $1.8 billion in sales. For investors feeling like they missed the boat on Nvidia stock, Oracle offers a way to access Nvidia's success via proxy -- and a relative value at that. Oracle shares are currently valued at just 22 times expected current fiscal-year earnings (Oracle's current fiscal year wraps up in May) and 20 times next fiscal year's expected earnings.

What Nvidia didn\'t do, however -- and what investors apparently were hoping it would do -- is update its assessment of the size of the total addressable market (TAM) for AI chips. That means no new increase in the potential sales of Nvidia chips worldwide -- but also no increase in the TAM for Taiwan Semiconductor, Intel, or Micron, either (at least according to Nvidia).', 'This is probably the first reason semiconductor stocks are having a bad Tuesday morning.

TSMC, for example, has postponed the start of mass production at its Arizona plant from 2024 to 2025.', ""How bad is this news for Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor Company, and Micron? Taken in conjunction with Nvidia's lack of raising its estimate of AI TAM, it sounds a bit concerning for Intel and TSMC. And at least one of the suppliers -- LCY Chemical -- is also a supplier to Micron and its high bandwidth memory chips."", ""Still, I wouldn't worry too much about today's semiconductor sell-off. For one thing, a $1 trillion TAM for AI chips is still pretty darn large. And as big as Nvidia is, it still sold less than $61 billion in all sorts of chips last year."", ""Plus, according to Nikkei, it's faster to build chemical supply plants for chipmakers than for the semiconductor manufacturing plants they service. If demand for AI chips grows as expected, and Intel and TSMC get back on schedule building their Arizona plants, the suppliers could still probably finish their own plants in time to supply them before operations commence."", ""While today's news bears watching in case things get worse, I don't see it posing a huge risk to semiconductor stocks over the long term."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Intel, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intel wasn’t one of them.

Investors are particularly drawn to stocks that offer above-average yields and companies with consistent dividend payment track records. It's widely acknowledged that dividend yield holds significant importance when investing in dividend stocks. In the last CNBC's Delivering Alpha Stock Survey conducted in 2023, in which 300 investors, traders, and money managers were polled, dividend investing came out to be a key strategy popular among investors. About 23% of the polled audiences said they prefer high dividend-yielding stocks."", 'While high-dividend stocks may not always be the optimal choice, research indicates that over the long term, they tend to yield better results. A study conducted by the University of Nevada found that portfolios consisting of the top 10 highest dividend yield stocks from the Dow 30 index outperformed portfolios with medium and low dividend yields between 1987 and 2012. The study also highlighted that investing in high dividend yield stocks proved to be profitable in the long run, although short-term returns could fluctuate significantly.', 'According to a report from Capital Group, high dividend stocks exhibit potential for superior downside capture. The downside capture ratio is a metric used to assess how a fund performed relative to the index during market downturns. A ratio below 100 suggests that a fund experienced less loss compared to the index during a given period, while a ratio above 100 indicates greater loss than the index. Drawing on data from Eugene Fama and Kenneth French, the report emphasized that historically, high-dividend stocks have offered greater downside protection compared to stocks with low or no dividends. Specifically, over 30 years, high dividend-paying stocks exhibited significantly lower downside capture, experiencing less loss compared to the S&P 500 Index when contrasted with lower dividend-paying counterparts.', 'As mentioned earlier, combining high dividend yields with a consistent track record of dividend growth forms an advantageous investment strategy for investors.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis of travel trends in Asia, you may go to 5 Most Underrated Travel Destinations in Asia.', 'At its core, tourism is fueled by the innate human desire to venture into the unknown. Much like Plato’s allegory of the cave, our quest to travel is a conscious effort to rattle the chains of our cavic existence, expanding the horizons of our primitive minds in the process. Since the alleviation of COVID-19 travel restrictions, the human passion for globetrotting has been set ablaze once more. According to UNWTO, tourism levels reached 88% of pre-pandemic levels in 2023, and are expected to surpass them in 2024.', 'At the same time, unprecedented inflation in the wake of the pandemic has made it extremely expensive to vacation with the same liberty as we had previously been used to. Consequently, many tourists are actively avoiding travel to popular tourist destinations, accusing these places of being “tourist traps”. Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) recently revealed its “Unpack 24” report that states affordable alternatives to popular hotspots, or “Destination Dupes”, which is a top trend among travelers in 2024. Recently, destination dupes became a viral trend on TikTok, as users from all over the world pitched in their take on the question, “What is the most underrated place to travel?”. In addition to TikToks, websites such as Tripadvisor, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP) are also playing a pivotal role in driving tourists towards new destinations. Reviews published on such sites are crucial for driving business and provide unfamiliar third world destinations with the opportunity to market on the same platforms as the biggest tourist attractions.', 'Asian countries were some of the first to face the plight of COVID-19, because of which these were also the destinations which experienced the most severe travel restrictions from the rest of the world. As such, Asia has not been able to bank on the recent uptick in tourism in the same manner as the other continents. UNWTO revealed that while tourism increased to 88% of pre-pandemic levels in 2023, the figure for Asia-Pacific was only 65%. However, the potential for tourism in this region has not gone unnoticed. Tripadvisor, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP) released its list of Top 2024 Destinations According to Global Travelers, wherein Asia claimed 8 out of the top 10 destinations. Sarah Firshein, Head of Editorial commented,', '“It’s great to see a rebound on long-haul trips to\xa0Asia, with the region having fully opened up post-pandemic..”', '- Sarah Firshein, Head of Editorial, Tripadvisor, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP)', 'In anticipation of an uplift in tourism in the regions, Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) has been aggressively adding to their portfolio of hotels in the Asia-Pacific. In 2023, Marriott International Inc (NASDAQ: MAR) celebrated its milestone of reaching 1000 hotels in the region.', ""“Being able to celebrate the opening of Marriott's 1000th hotel in Asia Pacific is a testament to our vision for growth in the years to come in the region”."", '- Yibing Mao, President, Greater China, Marriott International, Inc.

(NASDAQ:EXPE) has also revealed that it has entered into partnerships with several new companies in the region, highlighting the importance of establishing a strong footprint in Asia to the company’s vision. Penetration in the Asian market allows companies like Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) to enhance their alternative accommodations segment, which is becoming a popular feature of tourism in the region. While Asia has its own catalogue of tourist hotspots such as Bali and Tokyo, there are a number of snow-capped landscapes, ancient temples, and historical monuments that continue to fly under the radar. Join us as we check out the most underrated travel destinations in Asia.', '20 Most Underrated Travel Destinations in Asia', 'To develop our list of the most underrated travel destinations in Asia, we began by combing the internet for preexisting information in this area. In our search we checked out some of the most amazing countries in Asia, some of the most friendliest, and even the most respected. Next, we accumulated places within these countries from approximately 20 different sources, including credible new outlets and popular travel websites, to come up with a preliminary list of Asian travel destinations. Using a consensus approach, we shortlisted the places which had been recommended most frequently. Further research was narrowed to these places only. Once this list was obtained, we scored each destination based on the rank they had obtained in the previous lists, relative to the size of the list. For example, a destination recommended at number 6 in a list of top 10 most underrated travel destinations in Asia was assigned a score of 6/10 or 0.6. In case a source had not ranked its recommendations, each place received a score of 0.5. Each destination’s score was then accumulated. In case of a tie, we incorporated further feedback using online forums and user reviews (excluding influencer-generated feedback due to bias) to decide which destination would be ranked higher in our list of the most underrated travel destinations in Asia.', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

Clark, a former US airbase, is a city that offers the perfect blend of scenery, history, and modern attractions. The city has a wide range of historical landmarks such as decommissioned military facilities and museums, along with a dinosaur theme park that is perfect for entertaining children. Its most impressive attraction is the majestic Mount Pinatubo, where tourists get to summit through the Crow Valley before setting their sights on the Crater Lake.', 'IM Score: 1.57', 'Although Thailand is one of the most visited countries in Asia and its cities can hardly be deemed underrated, Koh Kood is one of the country’s lesser-known islands. This untarnished gem is one of the most underrated travel destinations in Asia, and a perfect location for a reclusive vacation. Tourists can snorkel on the shores of its pristine beaches, kayak through beautiful mangrove forests, and explore plenty of obscure tracks into the heart of the island.', 'IM Score: 1.62', 'Kerala is a state that stretches 600 Km across India’s Malabar coast. It offers tourists one of the most comprehensive tropical experiences in Asia. Apart from the magnificent shorelines of Varkala, you can cruise on houseboats along the Periyar river, or Trek in the Ambukuthi Hills which feature petroglyphs dating back to the Neolithic age. Another impressive sight is Fort Kochi, a coastal settlement that features monuments of Portuguese, British, and Dutch architecture.', 'IM Score: 1.62', 'Busan is typically reduced to the status of being a port city, however, it is so much more. The Haeundae Beach is a prominent site for beach goers and offers one of the most picturesque sunsets in the world. Busan is also notable for its religious sites as it features many historical temples and tombs, each of which is accompanied with its unique mythical folklore.', 'IM Score: 1.65', 'Another one of the most underrated travel destinations in Asia is Hue. This city was once the imperial capital of the Nguyen Dynasty. Many of the city’s historical sites are well preserved, including the citadel. The city is home to several UNESCO heritage sites, including shrines, palaces, and pagodas, that embody the strength and tradition of the country’s former kingdom. Moreover, in the fall season the city is spritzed with the sweet fragrance of the perfume river, making for even more of a delightful experience.', 'IM Score: 1.69', 'The district of Skardu, perched at over 7,000 meters and nested in the center of the Karakoram Mountain range, is a paradise for mountain vacationers. It offers views (and treks to) some of the highest peaks in the world. The Deosai National Park, a UNESCO heritage sight, is the second highest plateau in the world. Moreover, the Sarfaranga desert is the highest and coldest desert on the planet, and a popular place for stargazing as it allow you to glimpse the peripheries of the Milky Way.', 'IM Score: 1.74', 'Home to the tallest Buddha statue in the world, Leshan offers a mesmeric and insightful view into the religion of Nirvana. The Giant Buddha, carved out of the face of a cliff, is present at the junction of the Min and Dadu rivers, and is the main reason people flock to visit this city. Moreover, Leshan is popular for its Sichuanese cuisine, which perfectly complements the spiritual odyssey you experience in Leshan.', 'IM Score: 1.74', 'The island nation of Taiwan is perhaps the most underrated country in Southeast Asia. Although most of the country’s major travel destinations can be explored in a single trip, we especially recommend the port city of Kaohsiung. This city offers incredible waterside sceneries, vibrant night markets, and many spiritual temples.', 'IM Score: 1.75', 'On the surface, Dhaka is an overcrowded mesh of traffic and sunburns, however, its blend of subcontinental culture with modern development means it is one of our most underrated travel destinations in Asia. It is caulked with historical monuments from the Mughal, British, and East Pakistani eras. If you wish to get a glimpse of the region’s diverse history, you will find it etched upon the walls of the Ahsan Manzil, Lalbagh Fort, and Star Mosque, some of Dhaka’s most prominent landmarks.', 'IM Score: 1.77', 'Similarly to Dhaka, our minds have a preexistent notion of what a trip to Japan would encompass, and its generally to the note of skyscrapers and tightly packed markets. However, in the northern mountains of the country is Hachimantai City. Famous for its year round ski resort, Appi Kogen, the city is the perfect destination to explore rustic hot springs, courtesy of the stratovolcanos which encircle the area. Moreover, it is regarded as being a more authentic experience of the Japanese tradition in comparison to the contemporary culture of Tokyo.', 'IM Score: 1.78', 'Pontianak is regarded as being a diversified melting pot of the Malay, Dayak, and Chinese cultures. Visitors have plenty of opportunities for boating as they traverse their way through the city’s floating market, enjoy river cruises in the Kalimantan rainforest, or venture through the pretzeled mangrove plantations of the Kapuas Delta. Moreover, it is also in close proximity of the tempestuous Mount Kelam and the Betung Kerihun National Park, the latter being a UNESCO heritage site and habitat of Bornean Orangutans.', 'IM Score: 1.92', 'If you’re looking for a mixture of entertainment, adventure, and intellectual stimulation, Johor Bahru might be the perfect destination for you. Tourists can visit the Sultan Abu Bakar State Mosque or the Arulmigu Sri Rajakaliamman Glass Temple, giving them a glance at the spiritual significance of the city. If you’re looking for an excuse to ramp up your heartbeat, visit Legoland Malaysia. Or you might retreat to the sandy shores of Rawa Island, the ideal place to unwind and bask under the setting sun.', 'IM Score: 1.93', 'If you consider yourself an avant-garde explorer, hurry up and study the remnants of medieval China in the region of Gansu. Once a passage along the ancient silk road, Gansu is one of China’s untouched historical treasures. It is a vast area, infused with Tibetan heritage sites such as the Mogao Caves, a collection of 500 temples which contain perfectly preserved Buddhist art spanning a period of 2 millennia.', 'IM Score: 1.96', 'Located near West Papua, the Raja Ampat Islands are a collection of 4 major islands surrounded by around 1500 smaller islets and cays. This place is one of the most underrated travel destinations in Asia, regarded as a paradise for divers and snorkelers who can access over 200 different diving spots. The waters are regarded as one of the most diverse aquatic sites in the world, home to coral reefs, batoids, and various species of dolphins. Moreover, the cliffs of its largest islands are adorned with ochre rock paintings dating back between 3000 to 5000 years.', 'IM Score: 2.29', 'Although it was recently featured in Trip Advisor’s list of Top 2024 Destinations According to Global Travelers, the recent hype around Palawan still does not do any justice to this tropical archipelago.

(NASDAQ:NTAP) has announced that it will pay a dividend on the 24th of April, with investors receiving $0.50 per share. This makes the dividend yield 2.0%, which will augment investor returns quite nicely.', ' See our latest analysis for NetApp ', ""Impressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. Based on the last payment, NetApp was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This indicates that quite a large proportion of earnings is being invested back into the business."", 'The next year is set to see EPS grow by 32.6%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 38% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.', ""The company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2014, the dividend has gone from $0.60 total annually to $2.00. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 13% over that duration. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period."", ""Investors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. However, NetApp has only grown its earnings per share at 2.1% per annum over the past five years. NetApp is struggling to find viable investments, so it is returning more to shareholders. While this isn't necessarily a negative, it definitely signals that dividend growth could be constrained in the future unless earnings start to pick up again."", 'Overall, we think that this is a great income investment, and we think that maintaining the dividend this year may have been a conservative choice. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.', 'Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So on that note, Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital."", ""For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Mondelez International is:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.11 = US$6.0b ÷ (US$71b - US$19b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""So, Mondelez International has an ROCE of 11%.  That's a pretty standard return and it's in line with the industry average of 11%."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Mondelez International ', ""Above you can see how the current ROCE for Mondelez International compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for Mondelez International ."", ""Mondelez International has not disappointed with their ROCE growth. Looking at the data, we can see that even though capital employed in the business has remained relatively flat, the ROCE generated has risen by 39% over the last five years. So it's likely that the business is now reaping the full benefits of its past investments, since the capital employed hasn't changed considerably. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking."", 'As discussed above, Mondelez International appears to be getting more proficient at generating returns since capital employed has remained flat but earnings (before interest and tax) are up. And with a respectable 62% awarded to those who held the stock over the last five years, you could argue that these developments are starting to get the attention they deserve. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.', ""Mondelez International does have some risks though, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Mondelez International  that you might be interested in."", ""While Mondelez International may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision."", 'Earnings Estimate Revisions', ""Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward.

Importantly, he restored relationships with elected officials, regulators, labor unions (after protracted negotiations beginning in late 2022), and the communities in which we operate. The right focus for Norfolk Southern was on the long term. Enhancing safety and service while demonstrating our commitment to good corporate citizenship in East Palestine and surrounding areas were essential to protecting the company for the future. The urgent demands of the regulatory environment required us to focus on safety and service investments over optimizing short-term operating ratio.', 'As a result, in 2023, we accelerated our investments in safety and made fundamental changes to operating processes to drive safer outcomes throughout the organization. We implemented a six-point safety plan and made an unprecedented move to bring in a consultant from outside the rail industry with unique safety expertise, Admiral Kirk Donald and his team at AtkinsRéalis from the U.S. Navy Nuclear Propulsion Program. AtkinsRéalis performed a top-to-bottom safety culture review, and Norfolk Southern instituted many of their recommended changes.', ""These initiatives required temporary setbacks to both service and profitability.

His efforts over a 70-day period resulted in significant operating progress: network speed improved by 31%, average terminal dwell improved 14%, car miles per car day improved 22%, and locomotive productivity improved 10%."", ""His appointment reflects the board's commitment to recruit exceptional talent who will help us accelerate the execution of our balanced strategy, as well as their receptivity to shareholder feedback regarding bringing a proven scheduled railroading leader onto the Norfolk Southern management team. Importantly, Alan and the board recognize John not only as one of the most knowledgeable operators in the industry, but as a high-integrity individual who shares Norfolk Southern's commitment to important values such as safety and service.

The math around Ancora's short-term targets that were advertised to our investors (~62% operating ratio in 18 months) only works with significant and immediate employee furloughs – despite Ancora telling these same investors that they have no plans to furlough.

This should bolster SRE’s footprint in the expanding renewable energy market.', 'The Cimarron project, the third phase of the Energía Sierra Juarez (“ESJ”) wind complex, comes with a wind generation capacity of approximately 320 megawatts (MW). The farm’s primary purpose is to provide renewable energy to the City of Santa Clara, CA, over the long term.Cimarron will produce energy equivalent to the annual energy consumption of more than 84,000 homes and is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by around 210,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year.\xa0 The project is expected to commence generating energy in late 2025.', 'To enhance its clean energy portfolio, Sempra Energy is focused on commercializing and deploying low-carbon solution projects like the Cimarron wind project. Sempra Infrastructure is also currently evaluating the Hackberry Carbon Sequestration development opportunity, which is a carbon capture and sequestration project that is intended to reduce emissions at the Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility and the proposed Cameron LNG Phase 2 project.As of Dec 31, 2023, Sempra Infrastructure had a fully contracted, total nameplate capacity of 1,044 MW related to its fully operating wind and solar power generation facilities.\xa0 Once the Cimarron project becomes fully operational, the ESJ wind complex will represent one of the largest commercial wind projects in Mexico, thereby further boosting SRE’s renewable generation capacity.', ""As industries across the board are putting in their efforts to fight climate change and promote decarbonization, the utility industry remains a forerunner in the energy transition process. As predicted by the International Energy Agency, the global renewable capacity is expected to increase to 2.5 times its current level by 2030. To reap the benefits of such growth prospects, utilities like SRE are increasingly investing in their renewable generation portfolio and reducing carbon emissions.Keeping up with this trend, other utilities like Xcel Energy Inc. XEL, NextEra Energy Inc. NEE and Avangrid AGR are also adopting measures to promote clean energy.As of Dec 31, 2023, Xcel Energy had wind capacity of more than 11,000 MW, including nearly 4,500 MW of owned wind.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2024 sales indicates an increase of 7.5% over the 2023 reported figure.NextEra Energy’s subsidiary, NextEra Energy Resources, is the world's largest generator of renewable energy from wind and sun, as well as a world leader in battery storage. The company expects to be able to add 33-42 GW of new renewables in the 2023-2026 period to the generation portfolio via clean energy investments.NEE’s long-term earnings growth rate is 8.20%.

On April 2 the company -- which has already spun off its healthcare operations -- will split into two separate businesses. That means the latest analyst takes on GE will be the last in its current configuration.', ""One of those soon-to-be-outdated takes is quite bullish, anticipating a double-digit percentage rise in the share price. Let's see whether the company's future is as rosy as that prognosticator believes."", 'Near the beginning of March, UBS analyst Chris Snyder pumped his GE price target nearly 40% higher, changing it from $138 per share to $191. In doing so, he maintained his buy recommendation on the once-monolithic industrial stock. The new target implies a 10% bump over the next 12 months from the current price.', 'In his research note detailing the change, Snyder acknowledged that many market players consider GE to be richly valued. However, he wrote of ""the company\'s increasingly attractive positioning across favorable end markets."" The analyst also feels that management is determined and able to grow all of its major business lines.', 'He added that ""when combined with impressive execution and a $60 billion-plus revenue base, GE continues to offer the most torque [toward developing a] positive rate of change across U.S. industrials.""', ""Investors are excited about the continued division of GE, with the latest phase being the split into two (resulting in GE Vernova, the current company's power business and related assets, and the self-explanatory GE Aerospace).

298,450933b8-caae-3764-acc9-f8ea679b9025,GE,2024-03-20,PPA: This Defense ETF Is Outperforming Its Peers,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ppa-defense-etf-outperforming-peers-040726743.html,1710907646,STORY,"['GE', 'PLTR']","['The Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF (NYSEARCA:PPA) has outperformed its peers over the past three, five, and 10 years. Defense stocks have historically been a good place to invest, and I’m bullish on PPA as a good way to gain exposure to them, thanks to its outperformance versus peers, its diversified approach to investing in aerospace and defense, and the fact that it gives investors a bit of different exposure to the space versus its peers. ', 'According to fund sponsor Invesco (NYSE:IVZ), PPA is “based on the SPADE Defense Index. The Fund will normally invest at least 90% of its total assets in common stocks that comprise the Index. The Index is designed to identify a group of companies involved in the development, manufacturing, operations and support of US defense, homeland security and aerospace operations. The Fund and the Index are rebalanced and reconstituted quarterly.”', 'The fund launched in 2005 and has $2.9 billion in assets under management (AUM).', 'Defense stocks are generally a good sector for investors to gain exposure to, as defense companies have strong relationships with large and stable customers, like the U.S. government and other national governments. Because of these strong, longstanding relationships and the considerable technical expertise and financial resources required to manufacture products like fighter jets, missiles, drones, and other complex military-grade equipment, these companies enjoy strong moats around their businesses.', 'Furthermore, defense spending is often uncorrelated with the broader economy, giving investors some downside protection.', 'PPA offers investors solid diversification within the aerospace and defense sector. It holds 53 stocks, and its top 10 holdings make up 50.7% of assets.', 'This makes PPA wider-reaching than peers like the SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF (NYSEARCA:XAR) and the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (BATS:ITA), which own 34 and 38 stocks, respectively.', 'Below, you’ll find an overview of PPA’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ holdings tool.', 'PPA owns all of the typical defense industry stalwarts that you would expect it to, like Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX), and Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC).', 'But what differentiates it a bit is that it also owns stocks that you might not immediately think of as aerospace and defense stocks, like General Electric (NYSE:GE) and Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON). While these stocks are indeed involved in aerospace and defense, they are giant industrial conglomerates with irons in the fires of many other industries as well. And while these stocks play a prominent role in PPA’s SPADE Defense Index, they are absent from the underlying indices of XAR and ITA.', 'As you can see, General Electric is PPA’s largest holding, with a weighting of 7.5%. And this far-reaching approach to aerospace and defense has been a good thing for the fund, as shares of General Electric have quietly gained 87.5% over the past year, driving a strong performance for PPA, as we’ll discuss further below. Honeywell’s performance hasn’t been quite as spectacular as General Electric’s, but it has still gained a decent 9.5% over the past year.', 'Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) is another interesting example of a stock that PPA owns, but XAR and ITA do not. While certainly not a traditional defense company, Palantir’s software and data solutions are utilized by the U.S. military, the Department of Defense, and other defense agencies around the world.', 'I like the fact that PPA gives investors exposure to the next generation of defense stocks like this. To be clear, Palantir isn’t a top holding, as it is just a small position within the fund, but Palantir has a lot of potential, and shares have gained 198.1% over the past year.', 'Another thing that I really like about PPA is that it has much less exposure to the beleaguered Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock than competitors like ITA. While Boeing is a top 10 holding for PPA, its 4.1% weighting within the fund makes it a much more manageable position than ITA’s 14.0% weighting in the troubled aerospace giant.', 'PPA has generated an excellent annualized return of 14.2% over the past three years and excellent annualized returns of 11.4% and 12.7% over the past five and 10 years, respectively.', 'These are pretty solid results on their own, and these results are more notable in that PPA has decisively outperformed its peers like XAR and ITA recently.', 'For example, XAR has returned 5.4% over the past three years, 8.2% over the past five years, and 11.3% over the past 10. Meanwhile, ITA has returned 11.2% over the past three years, 5.3% over the past five years, and 10.1% over the past decade.', 'As you can see, PPA outperformed both of these peers over each time frame, especially over the past three and five years.', 'PPA has an expense ratio of 0.58%, meaning that an investor putting $10,000 into PPA will pay $58 in fees annually. Interestingly, this is right in line with the average expense ratio for all index ETFs, which stands at 0.57%, but it’s also more expensive than that of peers like XAR and ITA, which charge 0.35% and 0.40%, respectively.', 'The fact that PPA is more expensive than its two closest competitors is the primary downside here. However, the fact that it has soundly outperformed these competitors over the past three and five years means that it can make a case that this higher fee is justified. If it keeps outperforming, most investors probably won’t mind.', 'PPA is a dividend payer. While its yield of 0.6% certainly isn’t the main draw here, it is an added bonus for investors. The fund has consistently paid dividends since its inception in 2005.', 'Turning to Wall Street, PPA earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 41 Buys, 11 Holds, and two Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average PPA stock price target of $107.49 implies 8.6% upside potential.', 'I’m bullish on PPA going forward, given its strong performance over both the short and long term and the fact that it has outperformed its competition. PPA is a bit wider-reaching and a bit more diversified than its peers, and it gives investors exposure to aerospace and defense stocks that its peers do not, such as General Electric, Honeywell, and Palantir. The defense industry looks like a good sector for investors to gain exposure to, and PPA is a good way to do it.', 'Disclosure']"

It\'s supposed to emphasize the company\'s goal of continuing to innovate and come up with new and improved products. Medical devices will play a key part in its future growth, but Solventum will also give investors a way to benefit from expanding in other markets, including oral care and health information systems, making it a more diversified investment option than other healthcare stocks.', ""In 2023, 3M's healthcare business generated $8.2 billion in net sales and an operating profit of $1.6 billion, resulting in an impressive operating margin of nearly 20%. Last year, the top line fell by 2.8%. But a key reason was due to divestitures, with 3M selling its dental local anesthetic business and splitting off its food safety segment a year earlier. Organically, the healthcare division expanded at a rate of 0.7% in 2023. And the year before that, its organic growth was 3.2%."", ""What's promising about Solventum is how diverse its operations are, because that could lead to various growth opportunities in its future. As part of a large conglomerate, it can be difficult for a segment to flourish and focus on its long-term potential. But as its own entity, there will be a greater emphasis for the business to expand. And with a global addressable market worth as much as $93 billion, there should be no shortage of growth potential for Solventum in the future."", 'The company projects that in the health information system division, its expansion rate will be between 6% and 8% through 2026. And even in its slower growing medical-surgical business, which includes its medical devices and products, revenue should rise between 3% and 5%.', ""While Solventum doesn't appear to have the makings of a fast-growing company, few in the healthcare industry fit that type of a mold. Last year, General Electric spun off GE Healthcare, and the fairly new healthcare stock has posted a 50% gain since then (even as the company's revenue only grew 7% in 2023). Solventum may not necessarily deliver such an impressive performance, but it's a reminder to investors that a business doesn't need to be forecasting high growth rates to be a good investment."", ""Solventum will be an intriguing healthcare stock to consider when it hits the market next month, but I would wait until the company has a couple of quarterly earnings reports under its belt before considering whether it's a worthwhile buy. At that point, the dust from the spinoff will have settled and investors should be able to get a good grasp of how the business is doing as its own entity."", ""This is a stock that is worth keeping an eye on, but it's not one that investors need to worry about buying right away."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in 3M right now?', 'Before you buy stock in 3M, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and 3M wasn’t one of them.

', ""Ethanol is an alcohol, meaning that it's made of just three elements namely Carbon, Hydrogen, and Oxygen. This provides it with the same natural ingredients as gasoline, and it also makes it suitable for a variety of industrial use cases such as cleaning, sanitation, and making other chemicals. Ethanol's mixture with gasoline is called gasohol and is available in everyday fuel stations."", ""Since ethanol is an alcohol, unlike gasoline which is an alkene, it is cleaner burning. This makes it suitable for green energy use cases, a reality that stock market investors are also aware of. As part of our coverage of 12 Most Promising Green Stocks According to Analysts, we took a look at which clean energy stocks hedge funds are investing in. This revealed that out of the 12 stocks that had the greatest number of hedge fund investors out of the 910 that were part of Insider Monkey's database as of September 2023 end, two were ethanol companies. These two ethanol stocks are REX American Resources Corporation (NYSE:REX) and Green Plains Inc. (NASDAQ:GPRE) and their latest share price upside percentage as of March 2024 is 22% and 69%, respectively."", 'Seems like analysts are quite optimistic when it comes to these two particular ethanol stocks, despite the shift to traditional energy companies in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Ethanol also stands out from other green energy sources such as solar panels through the fact that it is able to blend in the supply chain of alkene fuels such as kerosene that is used in commercial turbine engines that power aircraft. This means that ethanol, and ethanol stocks, are also part of a broader category of fuels and equities called biofuels and biofuel stocks.', ""Just like we did with green stocks, we also took a look at which biofuel stocks hedge funds are buying as part of our coverage of 10 Best Biofuel Stocks To Buy Now. This particular analysis looked at how many hedge funds among the 910 that were covered by Insider Monkey's research in Q2 2023 had invested in biofuel companies. Out of these ten stocks, the majority, or six were involved either directly in making ethanol or working with it in the broader biofuel industry with some picks being Ecopetrol S.A. (NYSE:EC), Alto Ingredients, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALTO), and REX American Resources Corporation (NYSE:REX)."", ""As part of our research for this piece, we also discovered that one of the biggest fans of ethanol is the U.S. Department of Energy. The Energy Department's analysis of data from the Agriculture Department shows that the U.S. can cut down gasoline use by as much as 30% by utilizing existing agricultural land. In January 2024, the DoE announced the opening of the world's first commercial ethanol-to-jet fuel facility in Soperton, Georgia. This plant is owned by the Georgia based biotechnology firm LanzaJet. The facility is expected to generate economic activity worth tens of millions of dollars over its lifetime, and it is part of a growing global trend towards Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) that could provide sizeable catalysts to ethanol stocks especially since the global air travel industry often faces some of the harshest criticism for carbon dioxide and other emissions."", ""Shifting gears to take a look at ethanol stock performance this year, since the ethanol industry isn't popular among the broader public, there are few exchange traded funds or ETFs that track these stocks. Yet, we can still focus on their broader performance as a category and individual share price movements forced by company specific catalysts by analyzing how the ethanol stocks that we've discussed so far in this piece have done in 2024. The five ethanol stocks that we've discussed so far are NASDAQ:GPRE, NYSE:REX, NYSE:EC, NYSE:FF, and NASDAQ:ALTO. Year to date, the share price performance of these top hedge fund ethanol stock picks has been -16.65%, -5.41%, -9.28%, 18.05%, and -25.28%."", ""This brief stock analysis provides a rather interesting set of results where four out of five ethanol stocks haven't really done well. However, if we look at their performance over the past twelve months, then three out of these five stocks are in the green, with REX American in particular having gained 45% during this time period."", ""One ethanol stock that's been down 34% over the year is Green Plains Inc. (NASDAQ:GPRE), and here's what White Brook Capital Partners had to say about the firm in its Q4 2023 investor letter:"", 'Green Plains is a troubled investment. The stock did not perform as expected in 2023 and has had a difficult start to 2024. The Company continues to be well positioned, generating solid margins on each kernel of corn as the corn crush margin stays meaningfully positive. Furthermore, the industry’s progression is clear. There is an opportunity for ethanol producers to increase short and long term profitability by deriving higher amounts of corn oil, specialty alcohols, and high-density feed protein from each kernel of corn. It’s also increasingly clear that the required capital will prevent many current operators from transitioning. Green Plains was fortunate to begin its conversion relatively early and to have the scale necessary to complete the transition.', 'During the year, the regulatory environment bent towards ethanol producers as the federal government stopped preventing several midwestern states from blending a higher percentage of ethanol into gasoline and included their substrates in Inflation Reduction Act climate change subsidies.', ""Finally, the company is at the forefront of the ethanol industry’s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) development, a future use case that would use a substantial portion of the US’ current ethanol production if today's ethanol plants were to supply it. This year's developments were positive for Green Plains and portend a dramatically higher earnings stream within a year, even higher in two and higher still in three, making the stock incredibly cheap, particularly looking two or three years out."", ""With these details, let's take a look at the best ethanol stocks to buy. Some notable names are Green Plains Inc. (NASDAQ:GPRE), Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), and Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO)."", ""Farmers harvesting corn in a field, reminding us of the importance of the company's ethanol production."", 'Our Methodology', 'To make our list of the best ethanol stocks to buy, we made a list of all publicly traded companies on U.S. exchanges that are either direct participants in, or related to, the ethanol industry.

From this perspective, products aren\'t just things people buy, but also something they ""hire"" to solve their problem.', ""This is important because there is a great opportunity to reduce the environmental impact of a product's use phases. This is even more critical when such products require water and energy, like showering, doing laundry, or washing dishes. While it's critical that companies continue to reduce their own operational and supply chain footprints, products also have an important role to play in the creation of sustainable habits at home. Consumer insights shed light into how brand influence and product innovation can inspire new behaviors."", 'By developing products that perform well and are better for people and the planet, this helps the consumer complete their job more easily, and helps to reduce the corresponding environmental impact. Developing a solution that can deliver performance for people and planet requires a deep understanding of how a person uses a given product and their surrounding environment.', 'The following outlines how Procter and Gamble (P&G) applies consumer insights to reduce the environmental impact of dishwashing using a three-principal approach. First, P&G studies how people use the product through understanding their surrounding environment; second, develops a deeper understanding of why certain behaviors exist; and finally, leverages the insights in the product design.', '1. Zoom out to understand the full picture of the environment the consumer is in.', ""As P&G creates both dish soap and dishwasher detergent, we study handwashing and auto-washing habits. It's important to put ourselves in the shoes of consumers to understand what's happening in the kitchen and why so that we can define the job to be done and problem to be solved. That information, powered by additional consumer insights, informs the product requirements for our innovation."", 'Some consumer behaviors we study include: How often is the sink running? How long do the dishes sit there? How many dishes are washed by hand? What temperature is the water? How much water is used? How many dishes are put into the dishwasher?', 'These questions and more enable a better understanding of behaviors that use water and energy in the kitchen.', '2. Understand how people feel about the task to get to the root of their behavior.', 'Washing dishes is a chore and typically people want it done fast and conveniently. Many busy people state that they feel overwhelmed by the sight of a full sink of dirty dishes. People then adopt compensating behaviors that they think will help them get the job done more efficiently. Some examples:', 'Keeping the faucet running in order to save time, resulting in significant water and energy use;', 'Soaking dishes to shave off time scrubbing;', 'Cleaning dishes on an ongoing basis to prevent stuck-on messes versus doing them all at the end;', 'Increasing the water temperature to help dishes dry faster, resulting in increased energy use; and,', ""Washing dishes before loading them because they don't believe the dishwasher will get them clean, resulting in wasted water and energy."", 'Understanding the why behind the actions - in this case a desire for efficiency combined with a distrust of dishwashers - gives R&D teams ideas for new solutions that foster more sustainable habits.', '3. Leverage insights to design products for performance for people and planet.', ""With an understanding of people's behaviors and the motivation behind them, P&G can then design products to help shift habits while delivering against the job to be done. In this case, the job is fast and effective dish cleaning that avoids resource intensive compensating behaviors."", 'Through a study of dishwashing habits and the water and energy used, P&G R&D determined that dishwashers should be the preferred choice to reduce environmental impact during the product use phase. All it takes is eight dishes washed by hand to use the same amount of water and energy that a dishwasher uses. Using a dishwasher, people can save 100 gallons a week.', 'By understanding consumer barriers to dishwasher usage, P&G R&D teams optimized the chemistry in Cascade Platinum Plus dishwashing pods to clean dishes better and eliminate the need for pre-washing or re-washing. The solution conserves resources and helps save time by avoiding soaking or pre-rinsing - people scrape the dish off and immediately load it in.', ""While dishwashers offer the most sustainability benefits over hand washing, some people don't have them. Dawn Powerwash was developed to reduce water and energy use for people that hand wash their dishes. The R&D team simplified the experience by avoiding water at the onset of cleaning dishes. The result: refillable packaging and formulation designed to release suds without the need for water to activate them."", 'Making dishwashing a faster and easier chore can also inspire further sustainable habit adoption, such as cooking and eating more at home.', 'Innovating a Superior and Sustainable Product', 'Consumer brands have a responsibility to identify where impact can be made and where they can step in to innovate, leading to a superior and sustainable product that delivers added value.', 'A science-based approach is important because it shows where the biggest improvement for the environment can be made. A consumer-inspired product is equally important because it results in a satisfied consumer when function and experience is delivered. The two must be merged for a holistic proposition that people want to buy.', 'When done right, the result is something we can all get behind: products that delight, enable better habits and reduce environmental footprints at home.', 'This article was originally published on GreenBiz.com', 'View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from P&G on 3blmedia.com.', 'Contact Info:Spokesperson: P&GWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/pgEmail: info@3blmedia.com', 'SOURCE: P&G', 'View the original press release on accesswire.com']"

As of 2024, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks the performance of dividend stocks with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, has only managed to climb by 3.17%, lagging behind the broader market's robust 8.57% year-to-date gain. The underperformance of dividend stocks can largely be attributed to the dominance of tech stocks in the spotlight last year. However, Meta's recent announcement of its inaugural dividend brings a glimmer of hope for investors, potentially offering a blend of growth and dividend opportunities."", ""That said, dividend stocks have demonstrated strong historical performance owing to their capacity to generate income, a feature that attracts investors to these stocks. Since 1926, dividends have accounted for roughly 32% of the overall return for the S&P 500 index, with capital gains making up the remaining 68%. Thus, it's evident that sustainable dividend income alongside the potential for capital appreciation are vital considerations for investors in shaping their expectations regarding total returns. According to a report from S&P Dow Jones Indices, the Dividend Aristocrats index has historically shown superior returns with less volatility when compared to the broader S&P 500, resulting in enhanced risk-adjusted returns. This is evident from their ability to offer downside protection, as indicated by their upside and downside capture ratios. Specifically, the index has outperformed the S&P 500 during down months 69.34% of the time and during up months 43.61% of the time. Additionally, it's worth noting that the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats have experienced lower drawdown levels in comparison to the benchmark index."", 'Despite the recent underperformance and sluggish recovery of dividend stocks, analysts are recommending their inclusion in portfolios for income generation. Among the favored choices are dividend growers, as highlighted by prominent analysts. David Bahnsen, the chief investment officer at the Bahnsen Group, emphasized the importance of dividend growers in a portfolio during an interview with CNBC. Here are some comments from the analyst:', '“We really believe that cash flow is king and dividend growers through time and their avoidance of a lot of burst bubbles that happen with the alternative end up doing better. We have tons of track records to prove that, but I think ultimately right now people have actually gotten away with this recovery trade since the 2022 meltdown.”', 'Investing in dividend stocks like The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, go directly to\xa0Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 5 Stocks with Rising Price Targets.', 'The resurgence in US stocks, buoyed by what\'s been labeled the ""most-crowded trade,"" underscores the market\'s resilience. Led by a surge in tech megacaps, often referred to as the ""Magnificent Seven,"" equities bounced back, mitigating earlier losses. This trend, characterized by Bank of America Corp., highlights the dominance of a select group of technology giants driving market gains. Notably, Nvidia Corp. experienced a notable uptick, fueled by optimism surrounding its latest chip technology, which is anticipated to catalyze further growth, already evidenced by a staggering $1 trillion increase in the company\'s market value this year. Simultaneously, the bond market stabilized following a recent downturn, during which traders adjusted their expectations for future policy easing. As Wall Street anticipates the Federal Reserve\'s decision, scheduled for Wednesday, investors are closely monitoring signals regarding potential adjustments to the rate-cut outlook. Amid these developments, Bank of Japan\'s Ueda commented on the confirmation of a positive feedback loop between wages and prices, contributing to the broader economic landscape. The collective sentiment among traders underscores the intricate interplay between market dynamics and central bank policies, shaping investment strategies and market movements. As the landscape evolves, market participants remain vigilant, analyzing emerging trends and developments for potential opportunities and risks.', ""The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has made a significant policy shift by abandoning its negative rates and unconventional easing measures, reported CNBC. This move, following robust wage negotiations and signals of sustainable price increases, marks a departure from its long-standing ultra-loose monetary policy. The decision triggered a sharp decline in the Japanese yen, reflecting market reactions to the BOJ's shift towards normalizing monetary policy. Going forward, the BOJ will focus on utilizing short-term interest rates as its primary policy tool, aiming to maintain accommodative financial conditions while gradually scaling back its asset purchases. However, the central bank remains cautious about the pace of rate hikes, considering the fragile economic outlook. While the immediate global impact of the BOJ's decision is expected to be limited, concerns persist about potential volatility stemming from the unwinding of carry trades and capital repatriation to Japan. Nevertheless, the BOJ's gradual approach to policy normalization suggests a measured response to evolving economic conditions. Looking ahead, market analysts anticipate continued adjustments in bond yields and monetary policy as the BOJ navigates the complexities of achieving sustained economic growth. The broader implications of these policy shifts are yet to unfold, with market participants closely monitoring developments and their potential impact on global financial markets."", 'On the stock market front, analysts are bullish on stocks such as Ulta Beauty, Inc.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) valuation and outlook within the technology sector. The move by Wells Fargo & Company reflects their analysis of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) performance and potential future growth opportunities. By increasing the price target, they indicate their belief that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock is poised for appreciation, although the specific upside potential is not provided. Alphabet Inc.

It provides guidance for investors evaluating their positions in Alphabet, offering insights into the potential trajectory of the stock price.', 'Upside Potential: 0.60%', ""On March 18, Wells Fargo analyst Jeffrey Donnelly affirmed his Equal-Weight rating for Marriott International, Inc.

(NASDAQ:MAR) operates in the hospitality sector and is renowned for its global portfolio of hotels and resorts spanning various brands and segments. The company's performance is influenced by factors such as travel trends, economic conditions, and competition within the industry. By raising the price target, Wells Fargo indicates a modest upside potential of 0.60% for Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) stock compared to its current market price of $248.52. This suggests that while Wells Fargo remains relatively neutral on Marriott's prospects, they still see some room for appreciation in the stock. Maintaining an Equal-Weight rating suggests that Wells Fargo believes Marriott's stock is fairly valued relative to its peers and market conditions."", 'Vulcan Value Partners made the following comment about Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:', '“Marriott International, Inc.\xa0(NASDAQ:MAR) is a company that we have owned several times in the past. The company is an asset-light global lodging franchisor and operator that benefits from strong network effects. Approximately 99% of Marriott’s global rooms are managed or franchised which enables the company to generate high returns on capital. Marriott has an extensive portfolio of brands ranging from luxury brands such as The Ritz-Carlton, to premium brands such as Westin Hotels & Resorts, to select brands such as Residence Inn by Marriott. The company is doing an excellent job converting independent hotels into the Marriott system through its soft brands including the Luxury Collection, the Autograph Collection, and the Tribute Portfolio. This conversion opportunity should benefit Marriott’s net unit growth in a period when new hotel development could be challenging in North American and Europe. The company generates robust free cash flow through its long-term, contracted franchise fee and management fee revenue streams. Its competitive advantages include brand strength, operational scale, direct booking systems, and loyalty programs. We sold Marriott in the first quarter of 2020 because of our concerns about the company’s debt structure. Since then, Marriott has restructured its debt and improved its balance sheet.

This rating takes into consideration various factors, including Accenture's financial performance, competitive position, and growth prospects in the consulting and professional services sector. Piper Sandler expects Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) second-quarter results to meet expectations, with revenue likely to be in-line amid muted market expectations. However, they anticipate the company may adjust the top end of its fiscal year 2024 revenue guidance range of 2%-5% due to a potentially slower path to second-half acceleration. Particularly, the consensus for third-quarter growth of +7.4% quarter-over-quarter appears ambitious, according to Piper Sandler. The analysis also highlights historical trends, noting that Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) has not experienced a similar level of improvement between the second and third quarters since 2017. Additionally, Piper Sandler underscores the importance of Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) commentary on the macroeconomic environment, as industry peers have differing views on the timing of enterprise spend acceleration. This commentary will likely be closely monitored by investors for insights into Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) future performance and industry trends."", 'ClearBridge International Growth EAFE Strategy stated the following regarding Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:', '“Another welcome change has been the recognition of generative artificial intelligence (AI) opportunities for companies outside the U.S. While our IT holdings trailed their mega cap U.S. counterparts for most of the year, semiconductor equipment makers ASML and Tokyo Electron, which we consider enablers of AI, as well as enterprise software maker SAP and IT consultant\xa0Accenture plc\xa0(NYSE:ACN), which we see as facilitators of AI adoption in new product lines and/or enhanced business models, rose strongly in the quarter.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:', '“Netflix, Inc.\xa0(NASDAQ:NFLX) and Meta Platforms—both categorized in the communication services sector—rounded out our top five contributors in Q4 as well as for 2023. Both stocks suffered sharp declines in 2022, each losing more than 50% of their market capitalizations. In 2022, we purchased Netflix and added to our position in Meta on weakness as both stocks were selling significantly below our estimates of fair value. Netflix and other media stocks were out of favor due to questions about the long-term economics of streaming, slowing subscriber growth and increasing competition. Meta’s challenges were more self-inflicted as a ramp-up in spending caused free cash flow to plummet. We saw Netflix’s slowing subscriber growth as a normal feature of a maturing streaming market. Despite growth having slowed, Netflix’s position as the largest streaming service with currently close to 250 million subscribers is a key strategic advantage. Streaming is a scale and intellectual property business model that will result in a few large winners. Netflix remains far ahead of all streaming peers in subscribers, revenue, content spend and cash flow generation. Importantly, Netflix has also evolved its business model over the past year, becoming more efficient with its content spending, cracking down on password sharing and introducing a lower cost advertising-supported tier (lowering subscriber churn). These changes have led to robust earnings and free cash flow growth. We did trim our positions in Meta and Netflix to put capital to work in names having greater discounts.”', '\xa0', 'Click to continue reading and see Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 5 Stocks with Rising Price Targets.', '\xa0', 'Suggested articles:', '15 Biggest Solar Companies in the World', '16 Sites Like Alibaba: Best Alternatives to Source Products', '50 Cities With The Largest Population In The US', 'Disclosure: None.

The underperformance of dividend stocks can largely be attributed to the dominance of tech stocks in the spotlight last year. However, Meta's recent announcement of its inaugural dividend brings a glimmer of hope for investors, potentially offering a blend of growth and dividend opportunities."", ""That said, dividend stocks have demonstrated strong historical performance owing to their capacity to generate income, a feature that attracts investors to these stocks. Since 1926, dividends have accounted for roughly 32% of the overall return for the S&P 500 index, with capital gains making up the remaining 68%. Thus, it's evident that sustainable dividend income alongside the potential for capital appreciation are vital considerations for investors in shaping their expectations regarding total returns. According to a report from S&P Dow Jones Indices, the Dividend Aristocrats index has historically shown superior returns with less volatility when compared to the broader S&P 500, resulting in enhanced risk-adjusted returns. This is evident from their ability to offer downside protection, as indicated by their upside and downside capture ratios. Specifically, the index has outperformed the S&P 500 during down months 69.34% of the time and during up months 43.61% of the time. Additionally, it's worth noting that the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats have experienced lower drawdown levels in comparison to the benchmark index."", 'Despite the recent underperformance and sluggish recovery of dividend stocks, analysts are recommending their inclusion in portfolios for income generation.
