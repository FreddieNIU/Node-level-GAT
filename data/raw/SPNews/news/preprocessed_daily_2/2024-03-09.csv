If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on a couple’s guide to budget retirement living, you may go to 5 States for Couples Retiring on Just Social Security in the US. ', ""If you've got a car or a van and a good parking spot, living on just social security seems pretty doable. This perception aligns with the expectations of the typical retiree in the United States as they envision navigating their retirement years on a fixed income. A modest 3.2% Cost-of-Living-Adjustment may be partly to blame for this pessimistic outlook, or it may be the swirling speculations regarding the depletion of social security funds."", ""As of January 2024, the majority of Americans enrolled in Original Medicare (Part A and Part B) or a Medicare Advantage plan have also begun paying a standard monthly premium for Part B at $174.70. Additionally, they have been subject to a Part B annual deductible of $240. Compared to figures from 2023, this is a significant uptick of $9.80 (5.9%) in the premium and a $14 (6.2%) increase in the deductible. Whether it's the modest Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), depleting funds, or the escalating costs of healthcare, the idea of retiring on Social Security alone seems rather distant for\xa0 majority of Americans today."", 'Interestingly, this fear appears to be propelling potential retirees in the right direction, statistics suggest. According to the Retirement Survey & Insights Report 2023 by Goldman Sachs Asset Management,\xa0a division of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), more US workers have been saving further for retirement, with many even confident that their retirement savings are on track. As of 2022, only 57% of workers were confident that they would be able to meet their retirement savings goals. However, this number reached 65% the following year, highlighting how potential retirees are now quite proactive regarding their future.', 'Nevertheless, a potential “financial vortex” seems to be eroding savings for many US workers saving towards their retirement goals, reveals The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS). For a majority of US workers saving for retirement; savings for college, credit card debts, and even caring for family members can affect how much they are saving for their retirement years.', '“Only 36% of US workers have three months of income or more saved for emergencies. Unplanned and often unpredictable financial challenges push too many of us off track, and catching up may be difficult. Saving for retirement must remain a top priority”.', '- Chris Ceder, Senior Retirement Strategist at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)', 'Despondently, the BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) Read on Retirement report reveals only 56% of respondents believe they are on track with their retirement savings to retire with the “lifestyle” they desire. According to BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) CEO, one reason may be that workers are ""over-saving"", yet ""under-investing"".', '""In some countries, people are actually over-saving but under-investing. If they are keeping their money in the bank rather than investing in the market, they won\'t generate the returns necessary to retire with dignity,""', '- Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK)', 'Due to the many above reasons, retirees often end up having little to no savings for their so-called golden years. Their only option now is to move to some of the best states to live on Social Security, the benefits majority of American retirees rely on. Given that the average social security for 2024 is $1,906, and that for a couple is an estimated double; moving to an affordable state to retire seems only wise. But what constitutes an affordable state? According to The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), there are many factors one should look at before making a move.', '""Whether you\'re a retiree, a remote worker, or just looking for a change of scenery, the idea of pulling up stakes for purportedly greener pastures isn\'t that unusual these days”.', '-Hayden Adams, CPA, CFP®, director of tax and financial planning at the The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) Center for Financial Research.', ""According to The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), looking at only one factor, for instance, taxes, isn't the right way to calculate a move."", '""Florida\'s lack of an income tax may seem like a bargain, but property tax there is high, and the government raises the bulk of its revenue through state and local sales taxes. That\'s why it\'s important to consider your entire tax burden.""', ""The giveaway? The best state to live in if you’re on social security may not be your what you think it is. So the question is, which ones are? Now that you know what the worst states to retire on social security are, let's move on to discover some of the best ones."", 'f11photo/Shutterstock.com', 'To compile the list of states for couples retiring on just social security in the US, we have used our previous work on the best states to live in for retirement, states that don’t tax your retirement income, and best states to retire on social security.

There's considerable prestige associated within militaries with the warrior elite! These are top-notch units of the armed forces made up of the finest soldiers recruited from across the country to perform special operations. What sets these operators apart from the rest is their high level of rigorous training and strong personality traits including bravery and resilient mentality."", 'While historically, special forces worked in small units and were only called in for critical missions, over time, their role has expanded throughout the world, especially because of the global war on terror. Special forces in the US for example under the Special Operations Command (SOCOM) grew from 38,000 personnel before the 2001 9/11 attacks to 73,000 by 2020, with their budget also seeing a 495% spike from $2.3 billion to $13.7 billion during this period.', 'Considering the complex challenges these forces undertake, the US military is equipping their special forces operators with sophisticated equipment to dominate the battlefield and overcome challenging scenarios that come in their way.

According to the company, these submersibles will provide the Navy SEALs the ability to travel well below the surface of the ocean without wetsuits and get in and out of the vehicles undetected while being entirely submerged. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is a key industrial partner of the American special forces, and also the primary contractor for SOCOM’s logistics and sustainment support program.', 'The US Navy is aggressively ramping up its seabed capabilities as well. According to a report, the Navy, with an eye on protecting assets deep in the ocean, has commissioned a next-generation attack submarine, work on which is already underway at the General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD). The submarine will be used for the Navy SEALs to perform covert operations along the floor of the operation to tap deep sea communication cables and retrieve parts of missiles and rockets tested underwater.', 'SOCOM is also upgrading its MH-47G Chinook fleet as part of the aircraft’s modernization efforts. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) in December 2023 received a $271 million modification contract, under which it will procure the MH-47G rotary wing renewal build aircraft for SOCOM. The company expects to complete work on the project, which would involve delivering six helicopters, by May 2027. Earlier that year in March, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) secured a $18 million task order for the acquisition of components and parts for the aircraft. MH-47G Chinook, first introduced in 1962 by The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), continues to be widely used in American special operations despite aging.', 'On the other hand, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD), between 2016 and 2021, under a five-year contract with a maximum ceiling of $900 million provided professional services to US special forces in their global operations. The services included technical and engineering work for major weapon systems, and assistance with decision-making related to production and program control.

The KSK carried out multiple successful special operations in Afghanistan, and is considered one of the most well-equipped special forces in the world.', 'The Kommando Spezialkräfte Marine (KSM) is the special forces group of the German Navy that is responsible for carrying out amphibious warfare. Both of these groups require their deployments to be authorized by the German parliament before they can undertake any operation.', 'Special Forces: 3', 'Next up on our list of countries with the highest number of military special forces in the world is Spain, with three major special operations groups.

The group has expertise in search and rescue, hostage rescue, psychological operations, direct action, reconnaissance, and taking out high-value targets.', 'The country’s navy also has a special forces group with the same name – the Pakistan Navy Special Service Group, which is also often called the Navy SEALs and Navy SSG. This unit is capable of carrying out unconventional special operations at land, air and sea.', 'On the other hand, the Special Services Wing is the special operations branch of the Pakistan Air Force, whose personnel are trained to perform special missions related to reconnaissance, combat control, pararescue, offensive raiding, and direct action. These commandos are primarily responsible for air traffic control in hostile environments.', 'Special Forces: 3', 'The Commandement des Opérations Spéciales, or the Special Operations Command (COS), in France is equivalent to the USSOCOM and UKSF, and oversees the operations of various special forces of the French military. The National Gendarmerie Intervention Group, or GIGN, is the most prominent special operations unit in France that is responsible for counter-terrorism, hostage rescue, and the protection of VIPs in the country.

Some provide great opportunities to buy solid companies at a lower cost. Others are best left alone.', ""I'm here with James Demmert, Main Street Research Chief Investment Officer. Thanks for being here."", 'JAMES DEMMERT: Good to see you, Julie.', ""JULIE HYMAN: So we're talking about two stocks today that are down year-to-date. And let's talk about your buy stock, first of all. And this is one that we have talked about a lot on the program."", ""It's Apple. The shares are down about 10% or so year-to-date. So let's talk about why you still like it. And part of it is because it is down from the highs. So good value right now?"", ""JAMES DEMMERT: Yeah, Julie, it's down from the high. It's getting no love, whatsoever from Wall Street. And, in fact, the short interest, the amount of people shorting the stock has increased quite a bit."", ""And we think that's an opportunity mainly for the underlying things. I think that investors are misunderstanding about Apple. Where are they going really in this what we call the new tech led AI bull market? It looks like they're left behind. But I think investors are mistaking that no, that's coming in the next quarter or two."", ""JULIE HYMAN: OK, so let's dig into that a little bit here because Apple has teased what might be coming here. There's been a lot of focus on some negatives and some perceived negatives like slowing sales in China. But you think that the AI tech is coming. What gives you that confidence?"", ""JAMES DEMMERT: Yeah, I think the China sales is moderating, first of all. I think investors should get used to that. And I think that's in the stock price at this point."", ""What we think is exciting-- and if someone missed NVIDIA or any of the semiconductors that have been the really hot stocks that led AI in the first phase. This is where you want to go now because the next phase is where it is AI make a difference. And we think the iPhone is what's going to be carrying AI over the next quarter or 2 and 3."", ""First, it starts with AI subscriptions probably in Q2. I don't think the street is putting that in the price of the stock here. And we think those subscriptions on a $200 million-- or 200 million users can be very significant to earn."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Let me just stop you right there. Because what does that mean? Like meaning there would be something ChatGPT like that Apple is offering as a subscription service on devices?', ""JAMES DEMMERT: Think like a Siri that's really incredible, right? Siri right now is really not incredible. We think that the AI subscription to Apple is going to be that on steroids."", ""So you're really going to be able to talk to your phone.

So that'll be the first phase we think that rolls out in Q2."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Interesting.', ""JAMES DEMMERT: Q3 is really exciting because that's going to be iPhone 16.

What's been going on production wise at the company?"", ""JAMES DEMMERT: Yeah, I mean, it takes decades to build a great reputation, Julie. You know that. It takes moments to ruin it. And I think this is what's going on."", ""This is the story with Boeing. And it's really a management problem. They've had mistake after mistake."", ""Some of them the same mistakes over the last two years. And that is really making the institutional investors sort of walk away. And that's why the stock is down."", ""Now, a lot of people think it's cheap because it's down a lot. And we think that is a value trap. And we can talk about valuation in just a moment."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, let's do that then. Let's talk about the valuation."", ""JAMES DEMMERT: You know, here's a company in the last 12 months. That's lost money. I mean, this is an AI-tech led new bull market. That is not really where you want to be."", ""AI can't save their valuation, right? But going forward, the street suggests that you're looking at the price relative to the earnings. You look at that."", ""The streets are estimating the earnings to be at a PE to about 60 times earnings. The S&P 500 is trading at about 21 times earnings. Here's a stock."", ""Three times as expensive as the average company, it's losing money. It's got a real reputation problem. I would stay away from a valuation."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Well, and let's get to the last one here, which is competition. Airbus, of course, its big competitor not suffering from these same issues."", ""JAMES DEMMERT: You know, Airbus has got that reputation down. They've really been able to be very consistent. Now, one problem with Airbus is they're pretty booked for a long period of time."", ""But I think investors should recognize when companies have one of their biggest competitors have a problem like Boeing does, Airbus very well may come out with a new way to produce more planes sooner.

But if the stock crashes, I mean, if the stock literally went down by 50%. I think investors then say, hey, maybe there's value now relative to book value, the amount of the number of the planes, and the future potentially getting brighter.

All right, and just to be clear here, you own Apple shares, if I'm not mistaken."", 'JAMES DEMMERT: We own Apple shares as a firm and as my family.

If you want to skip our introduction to one of the hottest industries, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Space Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. ', 'Most of the debate surrounding the stock market this year has focused on artificial intelligence stocks, and rightly so when we look at the 12 month share price performance of key players in the industry such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), one sector that has been the most turbulent this year has been space.', 'Since there is only handful of pure play space companies with beefy share prices or sufficient liquidity, space stocks generally do not receive as much media coverage as other sectors such as consumer technology and oil and gas. This is further bolstered by the fact that aerospace exploration has primarily been a government funded venture for most of its history. The Space Race of the 1970s, which culminated with the end of the Apollo program saw the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) pay private companies to develop complex industrial equipment like a launch vehicle (commonly known as a rocket) or shuttles.', ""Over the course of time since the end of the Apollo program and the Space Shuttle era, space stocks started to make their first moves. While these days private companies can rightfully claim to operate some of the most technologically advanced vehicles in the world, back then space stocks were limited to satellite companies. In fact, while it's still a NASA contractor and a space stock because of its rockets and crewed spacecraft, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BO) is also one of the first space stocks to trade on the market. This is because the course of Boeing's long history has also seen the U.S. aerospace giant acquire the space division of the now RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) owned American defense contractor The Hughes Company. Hughes' Syncom satellite was the first geosynchronous communications satellite sent into orbit. There's another decades old space stock on our list and you can find it as you scroll through."", ""This year, one space stock has made the news on the market and as well as in general press coverage. This stock belongs to the Houston, Texas based aerospace and defense firm Intuitive Machines, Inc. (NASDAQ:LUNR). Intuitive Machines's Nova C Odysseus lunar lander launched on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket earlier in February 2024 from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Before Odysseus, the privately held Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania based Astrobotic's Peregrine lunar lander had attempted to be the first U.S. Moon lander since the Apollo program, but the spacecraft failed soon after orbit."", ""So, hopes were high for Nova C, and since the lander is one of the few in the world that uses a methane powered rocket engine for its journey, it was slated to land on the Moon in just a week post launch. As the launch was successful and Intuitive Machines, Inc. (NASDAQ:LUNR) confirmed that it had separated from the second stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in space, the space stock soared. It jumped from $4.98 on the day of the launch to touch nearly $11 over the course of the next few trading days. The jump in Intuitive Machines' share price underscored the potential of successful space missions and untapped investor eagerness to buy space stocks."", ""However, this rise to glory would prove to be short lived and truly underscore the fragility of space exploration - one of the riskiest endeavors in the world. In a press conference after the lander touched down, Intuitive Machines, Inc. (NASDAQ:LUNR)'s management shared that oversight during final checkouts meant that Odysseus's landing sensors would not be online for landing. Consequently, engineers had to jerry rig a NASA payload on the lander to provide it with guidance, a procedure that led to (but might not have exclusively contributed to) the lander tipping over during landing. Instantly, the stock dropped by 30% in the aftermarket, and on the day the markets opened after the weekend, the shares reversed almost all price gains made post launch. Will hedge funds continue to hold Intuitive Machines, Inc. (NASDAQ:LUNR) stock after the lunar lander oversight? You can check in next quarter to find out."", 'With this chilling example demonstrating the fragility of investing in space stocks, we nevertheless decided to see what the hedge funds were doing.

If you want to skip our overview of the latest stock market news, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Hot Stocks to Buy For March.\xa0', ""The stock market of 2024 is dominated by one key theme. If you haven't been following us regularly, then you'd have missed out on the fact that artificial intelligence, powered by the shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) remains the key factor on investors' minds when they look at major indexes such as the S&P 500 and the tech focused NASDAQ Composite. No one can blame them for this either, as after inflation and interest rates set records, 2024 has also been a record setting year for the stock market."", ""The artificial intelligence fueled mania, exacerbated by the earnings season in January that confirmed to investors that the demand for AI products was real and not just hype has pushed the S&P 500 index to cross the coveted 5,000 point mark for the first time in history. This comes after the NASDAQ's record setting spree last year and follows the second half of 2023 that had seen investors wonder whether the soaring S&P 500 in H1 2023 would continue its upward trajectory in the second half."", ""This surge in the stock market, even as the Federal Reserve remains worried about inflation, has made NVIDIA one of the most valuable companies in the world and made it surpass the market volumes big ticket mega cap names the likes of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). The two are worth $1.8 trillion and $1.7 trillion, respectively, while NVIDIA's 64% rise year to date fueled by the firm's latest earnings release means that its latest market capitalization now sits at $1.97 trillion with trailing and forward price to earnings ratios of 66 and 33, respectively."", ""Yet, even though NVIDIA's shares take off and have no signs of looking back, the broader macroeconomic trends that shaped the stock market discourse in 2022 and 2023 are nevertheless still in play. Interest rates are still too high to be considered easy for business, and most investors expect that the first cuts will come in June - a percentage that increases for a July cut. The last week of February is also quite important because of the data that will become available. This will come in the form of the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) index reading for January. The PCE is one of the most important data to judge the Fed's future actions since it is the central bank's preferred inflation metric. If officials believe that inflation is on a sufficiently downward trend to not raise its head again after an interest rate cut, then rates might start dropping before June. Should investors also read this conclusion, then the stock market should do well after the PCE data for January 2024."", ""Before we move forward to our latest collection of the best hot stocks to buy though, a recent report from the famed investment bank The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) merits a mention. Goldman was one of the few voices on Wall Street that bucked the trend in late 2022 and argued that avoiding a recession might be avoidable despite rapid central bank interest rate hikes. Now, the bank shares that during the week that ended on February 2023, hedge funds sold technology stocks at some of the highest rates for the past five years. It believes that software stocks were among the biggest losers, while bullish bets such as call options for NVIDIA's shares remain in play and suggest a hesitancy to completely go against technology stocks."", 'So, with Q1 2024 shaping up to be quite interesting, we decided to take a look at some hot stocks to buy.

Cigna’s health services division Evernorth, which includes PBM Express Scripts, announced the news on Thursday before the insurer’s investor day in New York City.', 'The cap could insulate employers from surging costs for GLP-1s while increasing patients’ access to the popular therapies, experts say. GLP-1s have been out of reach for all but a select few, given their high price tags and ongoing shortages of the medication.', 'The cap is possible through agreements that Express Scripts made with drugmakers Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. Cigna is not sharing specifics of the contracts.', 'As a result, employers and plans participating in Evernorth’s weight management program EncircleRx won’t see more than a 15% annual increase in spending on Novo’s Wegovy and Lilly’s Zepbound, according to Cigna.', 'In comparison, health plans are seeing the annual cost trend for weight loss drugs hit 40% to 50%, a spokesperson for the insurer said.', '“It’s a completely unsustainable number and our clients continue to look to us for help,” Adam Kautzner, president of care management at Evernorth and of Express Scripts, said during the Thursday investor day.', 'The cap has potential to expand employer coverage of GLP-1s, experts say.', 'However, a 15% annual price increase being presented as a major step forward on affordability shows both the incredible demand for GLP-1s and the country’s out-of-control spending on drugs, said Arielle Trzcinski, a principal analyst at Forrester.', '“It’s a step forward. Is it enough? Maybe not, but in comparison to that 40% to 50% it feels like a much more palatable number,” Trzcinski said.', 'Cigna’s move illustrates how large insurers are looking for new strategies to prove the value of their pharmacy benefit offerings as they face federal scrutiny into their business practices and competition from drug pricing disruptors.', 'It’s also a snapshot of the evolving market for GLP-1s, as health services and pharmacy companies look to capitalize on not only providing access to the drugs, but creating services around them.', 'GLP-1s have long been approved to manage diabetes, but the medications — which control blood sugar levels and reduce hunger and food intake — have real potential to move the needle on obesity and the downstream health conditions caused by excess weight, according to physicians and researchers.', 'Yet payers have been leery about covering the drugs due to their cost. Wegovy and Zepbound — two of three GLP-1 medications currently approved for weight loss in the U.S. — have monthly list prices of $1,349 and $1,060, respectively.', 'And, the medication needs to be used in perpetuity to be effective. That sustained drain on resources could bankrupt some companies, according to experts.', 'As a result, only 25% of employers cover GLP-1s for weight management today, according to a recent survey by care delivery company Accolade. More than a third of employers cited cost as a barrier.', 'Moreover, the drugs remain in limited availability, according to the FDA. The shortages, paired with low coverage rates, are creating a bottleneck for the drugs despite sky-high demand.', 'More than 40% of Americans are obese, according to government data, creating a total addressable market for GLP-1s of almost 140 million individuals in the U.S.', '“Once the supply chain is figured out, it’s going to be amazing how many people will be on these drugs.""', ""Jennifer O'Brien"", 'Partner, West Monroe', 'Cigna’s new program is meant to make future GLP-1 cost trend increases predictable for employers, to give them more financial certainty in covering the medication, Kautzner told investors Thursday.', 'Evernorth is guaranteeing a maximum 15% annual increase in spend. But a company’s specific guarantee differs based on “client type, depending on current benefit offerings and size of patient population, among other factors including specific client preferences and financial strategy,” a Cigna spokesperson told Healthcare Dive.', 'Cigna is gambling that it will be able to successfully control medical costs for members of EncircleRx, the weight loss management program Express Scripts launched last summer amid spiking demand for GLP-1s. EncircleRx ties access to GLP-1s with lifestyle modification services like coaching.', 'Employers pay a monthly fee to enroll their workers in the program. As such, Cigna could generate savings by improving members’ health outcomes and avoiding more expensive medical care down the line.', '“If they can improve these individuals’ A1C [levels], blood pressure, cardiovascular health, that has long-term upside for them in terms of savings on medical spend,” said Forrester’s Trzcinski.', 'Cigna could also be on the hook for excess costs if the drugs and its lifestyle modification program are unsuccessful in changing members’ outcomes.', 'During the investor day, Kautzner said he was “confident” Evernorth can successfully manage trend, given the division’s history of caring for patients in value-based models. SafeGuardRx, Evernorth’s portfolio of value-based condition management programs, has run risk-based models for hepatitis C, diabetes and other diseases, Kautzner said.', 'Evernorth has some additional “proprietary” mechanisms that “do limit our downside risk,” Kautzner said.', 'Cigna has not shared enrollment numbers or savings projections for EncircleRx, but the financial upside of value-based programs can be huge.', 'SafeGuardRx — which covers 86 million lives across 14 value-based programs, including EncircleRx — created $6.4 billion in savings last year, according to its website.', 'Cigna isn’t the only insurance conglomerate with a weight management program that includes access to GLP-1s.', 'UnitedHealth and Elevance launched their own programs in January and February, respectively, for employer clients of their PBMs.', 'Expanding access to GLP-1s could also boost revenue for Express Scripts, experts say. That’s because PBMs generally receive larger financial rebates from drugmakers for including more expensive drugs on their formularies.', 'Starting last year, a number of insurers said rising utilization of GLP-1s was generating notable revenue or earnings in their pharmacy arms. That includes Cigna, which brings in three-quarters of its revenue from Evernorth, and just one-quarter from its legacy insurance business.', '“GLP-1 utilization does continue to build, which in the Evernorth business is a positive contributor to our earnings,” Evernorth CEO Eric Palmer said during an August call with investors.', ""Enticing more employers to cover GLP-1s “would obviously benefit Express Scripts. They would definitely be incented to do that,” said Jennifer O'Brien, a partner at consultancy West Monroe."", 'The GLP-1 trend cap could also help Express Scripts in the court of public opinion. Large PBMs have been touting recent cost-cutting and transparency measures as they face rising criticism over their role in increasing drug costs and frustration from employer clients over opaque business practices.', 'A growing number of employers and plans are turning instead to vendors with clear operational models like Mark Cuban’s Cost Plus Drugs. Still, Cigna’s cost cap shows how major players are jockeying to entrench their position in the GLP-1 distribution market before drug companies fix their supply chains, lessening shortages of the drugs and throwing open the doors to broader access, experts say.', 'Supply isn’t expected to return to normal until later this year as drugmakers struggle to keep pace with the market’s appetite for GLP-1s.', ""If insurers and their pharmacy benefit managers already have programs in place to manage that demand, once supply improves they’ll see a windfall, according to O'Brien."", '“Once the supply chain is figured out, it’s going to be amazing how many people will be on these drugs,” O’Brien said. “If these PBMs have all these people lined up, waiting — it’s like the amusement park. Let’s open the gates and let everyone in. And they’re well-positioned at that point to receive them.”', 'This story was originally published on Healthcare Dive.

20,045c277e-5a74-3437-b62c-8e50a52e05da,BXP,2024-03-09,Is it Wise to Retain Boston Properties (BXP) Stock for Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wise-retain-boston-properties-bxp-171100953.html,1709917860,STORY,['BXP'],"['Boston Properties BXP boasts a portfolio of Class A office assets in a few select markets of the United States. Although the overall demand for office spaces in some markets is likely to be subdued in the near term, healthy tenant demand for premier office assets and the company’s ability to offer such spaces will likely drive decent leasing activity and help it tide over near-term challenges.With the pandemic’s impacts waning, the return-to-office policies implemented by many companies, coupled with a relatively low unemployment rate and consistent job growth, are likely to drive the demand for Boston Properties’ strategically located, high-quality office properties in dynamic gateway markets — Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC. Given the robust demand for life-science assets, BXP is expected to witness healthy leasing activities in the life-science portfolio, driving the segment’s growth.This office real estate investment trust (REIT) enjoys a diversified, creditworthy tenant base, which includes several bellwethers. The long-term leases with these tenants assure stable revenue generation for the company, driving steady top-line growth.In 2023, the company executed 4.2 million square feet of leases, with a weighted average lease term of 8.2 years. As of Dec 31, 2023, the weighted-average remaining lease term for its 20 largest clients, based on leased square footage, was 10.2 years. With 2.7 million square feet of leases in its pipeline, Boston Properties is well-positioned to navigate through the current challenging environment. Although we estimate a 0.7% year-over-year increase in lease revenues in 2024, the same is expected to climb 2% in 2025.Boston Properties’ encouraging development and redevelopment pipeline is likely to fuel net operating income growth in the coming years. The company projects the properties under development and redevelopment through 2026 to add $249 million to the company’s share of net operating income cash upon stabilization. It also projects seeing a 4.4% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from development projects through 2026. The company’s solid balance sheet position, with $3.4 billion of liquidity as of Dec 31, 2023, is likely to help it capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.However, the U.S. office real estate market continues to struggle from the after-effects of the health crisis, with negative absorption and high vacancy levels. The lackluster environment can be attributed to the continuation of work-from-home, flexible or hybrid work setups, which have diminished office space utilization. Although property tours and leases under negotiation continue to take place, there is less urgency from clients to make new commitments. Also, persistent macroeconomic uncertainty has led to a slowdown in leasing activities.For 2024, management expects to have sticky occupancy due to some tenant defaults in addition to contractual expirations. For 2024, management expects average in-service portfolio occupancy between 87.2% and 88.6%. We anticipate the company to maintain an occupancy rate of 87.9% in 2024.A high interest rate environment is another concern for Boston Properties. Elevated rates imply high borrowing costs for the company, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate. The company has a substantial debt burden and its share of debt as of Dec 31, 2023, was $15.9 billion. High interest expenses are anticipated to adversely impact FFO per share in 2024. Management expects consolidated net interest expenses for 2024 between $570 million and $590 million.Analysts seem a bit bearish on this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.

Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. In other words, investors can purchase Devon Energy's shares before the 14th of March in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 28th of March."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.44 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$2.87 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Devon Energy stock has a trailing yield of around 5.4% on the current share price of US$46.16. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. As a result, readers should always check whether Devon Energy has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut."", ' See our latest analysis for Devon Energy ', 'Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Devon Energy paid out a comfortable 49% of its profit last year. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Over the last year it paid out 72% of its free cash flow as dividends, within the usual range for most companies.', ""It's positive to see that Devon Energy's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. It's encouraging to see Devon Energy has grown its earnings rapidly, up 40% a year for the past five years."", ""Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Devon Energy has delivered 11% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it."", ""From a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Devon Energy? Earnings per share have grown at a nice rate in recent times and over the last year, Devon Energy paid out less than half its earnings and a bit over half its free cash flow. Devon Energy looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely."", ""So while Devon Energy looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 3 warning signs for Devon Energy (of which 1 is significant!) you should know about."", ""If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks."", 'Have feedback on this article?

No one can blame them for this either, as after inflation and interest rates set records, 2024 has also been a record setting year for the stock market."", ""The artificial intelligence fueled mania, exacerbated by the earnings season in January that confirmed to investors that the demand for AI products was real and not just hype has pushed the S&P 500 index to cross the coveted 5,000 point mark for the first time in history. This comes after the NASDAQ's record setting spree last year and follows the second half of 2023 that had seen investors wonder whether the soaring S&P 500 in H1 2023 would continue its upward trajectory in the second half."", ""This surge in the stock market, even as the Federal Reserve remains worried about inflation, has made NVIDIA one of the most valuable companies in the world and made it surpass the market volumes big ticket mega cap names the likes of Amazon.com, Inc.

Interest rates are still too high to be considered easy for business, and most investors expect that the first cuts will come in June - a percentage that increases for a July cut. The last week of February is also quite important because of the data that will become available. This will come in the form of the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) index reading for January. The PCE is one of the most important data to judge the Fed's future actions since it is the central bank's preferred inflation metric. If officials believe that inflation is on a sufficiently downward trend to not raise its head again after an interest rate cut, then rates might start dropping before June.

Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Coca-Cola, it has a TSR of 52% for the last 5 years.

The Zacks analyst believes based on a number of near-term challenges, Chevron appears to be a risky bet. Over the past year, the energy major has seen its stock price decline more than 10% compared with the S&P 500’s increase of 21%.The supermajor – with 60% liquids-weighted production – is highly exposed to the perils of oil price fluctuations. The drop in downstream segment earnings as a fallout of lower margins is a concern too while reserve replacement ratio remains weak, indicating challenges in replenishing produced energy.Moreover, it has been experiencing an increase in costs as a percentage of revenue. Finally, Chevron has been a laggard compared to its European peers to jump into the clean energy bandwagon. Considering these factors, the company is unlikely to return to favor anytime soon. This calls for a bearish stance on Chevron.(You can read the full research report on Chevron here >>>)Verizon’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+13.3% vs. +7.5%). The company reported healthy fourth-quarter 2023 results, with the top and bottom line beating the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate, driven by significant 5G adoption and wireless traction.It is offering various mix-and-match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans, which has led to solid client additions.

Its mmWave footprint delivers game-changing experiences for the densest parts of the network.However, lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns.

The company’s ongoing research and development are allowing the company to develop new products to provide efficient power management solutions.It will benefit from improving end-market conditions, increasing demand from the new AI data center and contributions from its organic assets.

Interest rates are still too high to be considered easy for business, and most investors expect that the first cuts will come in June - a percentage that increases for a July cut. The last week of February is also quite important because of the data that will become available. This will come in the form of the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) index reading for January. The PCE is one of the most important data to judge the Fed's future actions since it is the central bank's preferred inflation metric. If officials believe that inflation is on a sufficiently downward trend to not raise its head again after an interest rate cut, then rates might start dropping before June. Should investors also read this conclusion, then the stock market should do well after the PCE data for January 2024."", ""Before we move forward to our latest collection of the best hot stocks to buy though, a recent report from the famed investment bank The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
