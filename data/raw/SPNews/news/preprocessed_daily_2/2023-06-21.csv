Instead, users will have to go through financial intermediaries to buy and sell crypto assets, similar to how trades are executed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or the Nasdaq (NASDAQ). Regulators like the different approach, Nazarali said, because they think it’s important that there’s separation between the exchange function and the broker dealer function.“What we’re seeing is that increasingly, investors want to trade through their trusted intermediaries and that’s especially true post FTX, which was supposed to be the leader in the digital market. If you can’t trust them, who can you trust?” Nazarali told CoinDesk in an interview in April. “So people are falling back on the firms that have been around for a really long time and that have really stood the test of time and that’s a really important tailwind for us.”Story continuesThe company will later this year launch EDX Clearing to settle trades matched on EDX Markets.So far, the exchange only offers four tokens – bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH), litecoin (LITE) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) – partly because of the unclear regulatory landscape in the U.S.“We have a limited set of tokens because until there is more regulatory clarity, we don’t want to trade something that’s potentially a security,” Nazarali said in April. “Regulators really like that we don’t take that risk.”While EDX Markets will consider an international expansion “down the line,” for right now, it will solely focus on its operations in the U.S., Nazarali said in April. “We were founded really to solve a problem in the marketplace in the U.S.""]"
5,72812cf5-7782-3a7f-bca5-f28377ec47b5,SCHW,2023-06-21,20 Worst Performing S&P 500 Stocks in 2023,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-worst-performing-p-500-200036146.html,1687291236,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'CMA', 'SCHW', 'CVS', 'AESC', 'VFC', 'ENPH', 'DG', 'IFF', 'EPAM', 'MRNA', 'USB', 'MET', 'TFC', 'CFG']","[In this article, we discuss 20 worst performing S&amp;P 500 stocks in 2023. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the stock market outlook, skip over to 5 Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 2023. Wall Street analysts are still largely split when it comes to their forecasts for the S&amp;P 500 index, despite the year being halfway through. The difference in opinion among analysts has grown even more since the benchmark index emerged from its lengthiest bear market since 1948. Goldman Sachs raised its end of year target for the S&amp;P 500 from 4,000 to 4,500, noting that their 2023 earnings-per-share projections remain unmodified. Goldman Sachs speculates that a soft landing will be delivered by the Federal Reserve, despite the brutal interest rate hikes over the last year to counter inflation. The firm believes that market sectors that are underperforming so far have the potential to keep pace with market leaders. The mega-cap tech stocks are dominating the market this year, and the profits from artificial intelligence can potentially prolong the current stock market upswing. On the other hand, Morgan Stanley reiterated its negative stance on the stock market, noting that the bear market is not over and an earnings recession is projected to hinder any further gains. Michael Wilson, the chief equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, expects the S&amp;P 500 to sink to 3,900 by year-end. On May 23, Reuters polled 43 Wall Street strategists and they believe that the S&amp;P 500 index is expected to experience a decline by the end of 2023. These strategists think that investor sentiment will be negatively impacted due to high interest rates, banking failures, and disappointing earnings. They expect the S&amp;P 500 index to close at 4,150 at the end of 2023. The substantial gains this year are predominantly attributed to the growth and technology sectors, which led to significant market rallies and offset some of the instability caused by collapsing regional banks. According to Jonathan Golub, head of U.S. equity strategy and quantitative research for Credit Suisse, the S&amp;P 500 will likely close at 4,050 at the end of this year. He told Reuters: Story continues""It's just a very uninspiring, low-growth backdrop, with tight monetary policy and earnings that will be down this year versus last."" Data from Refinitiv suggests that the forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of the S&amp;P 500 is presently 19, compared to 17 recorded at the end of 2022 and exceeding the long-term average of approximately 16. UBS Global Wealth Management has a year-end S&amp;P 500 target of 3,800, and Nadia Lovell, a senior U.S. equity strategist at UBS, said: ""Historically, when you've seen this level of valuation, it's normally associated with re-acceleration in earnings and also an outlook for double-digit earnings growth going forward. We don't see that happening."" Market expectations are increasingly varied. For example, RBC Capital, citing improved earnings expectations, limited layoffs, and rebounding corporate sentiment, raised its end of year S&amp;P 500 price target to 4,250 from 4,100. Bloomberg cited Lori Calvasina, head of US equity strategy at RBC Capital, who commented: “While our new target still reflects a fairly neutral view on the direction of stocks through year end, when asked we do acknowledge more upside risks than downside risks. We’ve also been struck by how many bearish leaning investors have been asking us to walk them through the bull case and explain why stocks have been so resilient.”Amid the mixed market sentiment on Wall Street, some of the worst performing S&amp;P 500 stocks include DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH), Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP), and Newell Brands Inc. (NASDAQ:NWL). Our MethodologyFor this list, we screened the S&amp;P 500 stocks and chose the 20 worst performing companies based on highest decline in share prices year-to-date as of June 16, 2023. We have ranked the list in ascending order of the year-to-date share price drop. 20 Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 2023Image By peshkov - Adobe StockWorst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 202320.

However, on May 25, MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET)’s board authorized a $1 billion increase in the share repurchases, making the total share repurchase authorization outstanding approximately $4 billion.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 43 hedge funds were long MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET), with combined stakes worth $812.4 million. Richard S. Pzena’s Pzena Investment Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 4.18 million shares worth $242.3 million. Like DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH), Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP), and Newell Brands Inc. (NASDAQ:NWL), MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) is one of the worst performing S&amp;P 500 stocks in 2023. 19. International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. (NYSE:IFF)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 23.94%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. (NYSE:IFF) manufactures and markets cosmetic active and natural health ingredients that are used in consumer products. It operates through four segments – Nourish, Scent, Health &amp; Biosciences, and Pharma Solutions. International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc.

(NYSE:IFF) reported a Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $0.87, missing Wall Street estimates by $0.02. The revenue of $3.03 billion fell 5.3% as compared to the prior-year quarter, but outperformed market consensus by $50 million. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. (NYSE:IFF) was part of 41 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 39 in the earlier quarter. Scott Ferguson’s Sachem Head Capital is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 6.68 million shares worth $614.7 million.  Here is what Rhizome Partners has to say about International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. (NYSE:IFF) in its Q1 2021 investor letter:“We are still getting used to the higher multiples that investors will pay for larger market cap and pure play companies such as IFF. We do understand the market’s rationale. IFF’s products account for a small percentage of the customers’ cost while playing critical roles in the products’ performance. With some operating leverage, the company can probably grow FCF at 4-6% a year. This brings the total return close to the long-term return of the S&amp;P 500 index of 10%. Through trial and error, we have come to appreciate how scale, higher market share, route densities, switching costs, and collaborative relationships amongst major industry players can contribute to sustained high returns on invested capital.”18. The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 24.08%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) is a power generation and utility company using coal, gas, hydro, wind, solar, biomass, and renewable sources.

The revenue increased 13.7% year-over-year to $3.24 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $400 million. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 44 hedge funds held stakes worth $1.1 billion in The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES), compared to 44 funds in the prior quarter holding stakes worth $1.3 billion. Massif Capital made the following comment about The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“We currently have roughly 13% of the portfolio allocated to two utilities: The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) and Polaris (PIF). We invested in AES in December 2020 at an average entry price of $21.3 and invested in PIF in July 2020 at an average entry price of 16.36 CAD. We are currently underwater on PIF and making money in AES. Our near-term outlook for both positions is mixed. AES had a solid year in 2022, up 13%; it has telegraphed growth in earnings and cash flow through 2025 and seems to be hitting its targets. We will have to see what the year holds for utilities and AES, but another year like last year, and the firm will be touching our full value expectations.”17. U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 25.07%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) was founded in 1863 and is headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It is a financial services company that operates through Corporate and Commercial Banking, Consumer and Business Banking, Wealth Management and Investment Services, Payment Services, and Treasury and Corporate Support segments.

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which had been a long-term stakeholder of U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), sold all its shares during the first quarter of 2023. Mairs &amp; Power Growth Fund made the following comment about U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“Financials were roiled in the quarter thanks to the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failures. Even though the Fund has a similar weight to Financials as the index, our bank stocks—U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Charles Schwab (SCHW)—fell more than the Financials sector and hurt relative performance. We have performed a thorough analysis of our banking stocks and believe that they will exit this banking event intact, and a few may even benefit from the sector turmoil.The largest detractors from relative performance in the quarter were US Bank, Charles Schwab, UnitedHealth Group (UNH), and Hormel (HRL). The first two got caught up in the previously mentioned bank scare. With the selloff in the quarter, we have added to US Bank selectively, but more so to JPMorgan as it appears better positioned to gather deposits in the current environment.”16. Organon &amp; Co. (NYSE:OGN)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 25.51%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33Organon &amp; Co.

Steven Boyd’s Armistice Capital is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 3.20 million shares worth $75.2 million. Miller Value Partners made the following comment about Organon &amp; Co. (NYSE:OGN) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Organon &amp; Co. (NYSE:OGN) was the top detractor for the quarter, falling 30.0%2. Organon reported 2Q22 revenue of $1.59 billion, -0.6% Y/Y, ahead of consensus of $1.54 billion, and Adjusted EPS of $1.25, -27.3% Y/Y, in-line with analyst expectations.

Management revised FY22 guidance for revenue of $6.1-6.3 billion, compared to previous guidance for revenue of $6.1-6.4 billion, to reflect persisting foreign exchange (FX) headwinds, and Adjusted EBITDA margin of 32-34%, compared to prior guidance for a margin of 34-36%, which incorporates ~$110 million of in-process research and development (IPR&amp;D) and milestone expenses from business development.

Off the heels of last year’s outstanding performance, the Fund’s Energy stocks were down -16%. Financials were down -5%, primarily due to Truist Financial Corporation (NYSE:TFC) (bank), as banks sold off due to the failure of SVB Financial Group. Consumer Discretionary finished the quarter up but was pulled down by the -9% performance of RH (home products store).”14. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 27.11%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 77CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is a health services provider in the United States.

On May 25, CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) disclosed that only 21% of its Medicare Advantage members are enrolled in plans that have a star rating of four or higher, which will result in its net income dropping between $800 million to $1 billion in 2024.

John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors is the biggest position holder in the company. Greenlight Capital made the following comment about CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Second, we will discuss Oak Street Health (OSH), which we closed out after costing us 0.8% (net) during the quarter. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is buying OSH for $39 per share, or about $10 billion. When shorting, there is always the risk that someone with deep pockets will buy out the company at a silly price, or maybe even at twice a silly price. CVS is worth $115 billion (or it was the day they announced the deal; subsequently, CVS’s shares have fallen and it’s now worth $93 billion), so it can afford to piss away $10 billion.OSH is in value-based care, which has become a trendy segment of the market. Most of the “value” comes from doing a more thorough and aggressive job of documenting how sick a patient is, so as to maximize Medicare payments. OSH operates 169 clinics (costing between $1.5-$2 million to build) in mostly lower income neighborhoods and employs 600 doctors. CVS projects that in 2026 the pro forma entity will have 300 clinics and “embedded EBITDA” of $2 billion, plus over $500 million of synergies.In 2022, OSH generated less than $1 million of adjusted revenue per doctor2 and lost $500 million (almost $3 million per clinic). Even if it triples the number of doctors by 2026, it will need over $1 million of “embedded EBITDA” per doctor, implying margins shifting from a loss to nearly 100%. Obviously, this can’t happen, as the doctors need to be paid and there are other substantial costs. The amazing thing is that when rumors of this deal circulated, we reached out to CVS management and had a call where we walked them through the math… and they went ahead with the deal anyway. When the proxy came out, it revealed that OSH conducted an auction and, like a late-night eBay shopper who had one too many glasses of wine, CVS raised its uncontested bid several times… Rant over.”13.

Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 6.5 million shares worth $1 billion. Baron Health Care Fund made the following comment about Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) is a leader in the emerging field of mRNA-based vaccines and therapeutics and was one of the three main producers of the COVID vaccine. Shares fell during the quarter. We believe as COVID shifts away from pandemic status and becomes an increasingly commercial market (rather than government funded), there is increasing investor uncertainty around what a booster market could look like, which is pressuring shares. Looking beyond COVID, we think Moderna has the potential to disrupt the biopharmaceutical industry, from infectious disease vaccines to oncology, and we remain shareholders.”12. Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 28.23%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Enphase Energy, Inc.

(NASDAQ:ENPH) designs, develops, manufactures and sells home energy solutions in the U.S. and internationally for the solar industry. The company is the world’s leading manufacturer of microinverters that convert solar-generated D.C. energy to A.C. energy usable in homes and buildings. Enphase introduced the world’s first microinverter system in 2008 and has expanded its offerings to include battery storage systems and proprietary technologies that provide energy monitoring and control services for solar energy systems. It sells its products and solutions directly to solar system distributors, large installers and strategic partners.We see Enphase having a substantial market share that is gained through a premium product offering, superior customer service and the development of a large and diverse network of solar installers and distributors. The company’s products and services address a growing residential solar market. Coupling battery backup systems with existing and newly installed residential solar systems could accelerate the company’s revenue and earnings growth over the next several years, in our view. Additionally, commercial and international expansion offer additional revenue and earnings upside. Enphase also plans to expand manufacturing capacity in the U.S. during 2023 to benefit from tax incentives related to domestic production included in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).”11. V.F.

Corporation (NYSE:VFC) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Apparel and footwear company V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC)’s stock declined in Q4 after management lowered guidance based on weaker-than-expected demand in North America, higher promotions and elevated wholesale order cancellations. The company also announced a CEO transition, effective immediately. Following these developments, we sold our shares in favor of higher conviction ideas.”10. Citizens Financial Group, Inc.

Stephen Mandel’s Lone Pine Capital is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 965,588 shares worth $288.7 million. Harding Loevner Emerging Markets Equity Strategy made the following comment about EPAM Systems, Inc. (NYSE:EPAM) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“The portfolio’s returns in the roaring IT sector were hampered by software-engineering company EPAM Systems, Inc. (NYSE:EPAM) and payment-services provider Network International. EPAM signaled a more cautious outlook for growth and cost pressures related to the geographic reconfiguration of its East European engineering workforce in the wake of the war in Ukraine. UAE-based Network International indicated that challenging macroeconomic conditions in Africa may hinder near-term growth. In Communication Services, detractors included Safaricom, the leading mobile-network operator and payment-services company in Kenya, where the currency has weakened amid high inflation and a sizable current account deficit.Buying Globant didn’t increase our portfolio weight in IT services, as the purchase was funded by reducing two other industry holdings, EPAM and Tata Consultancy Services, for which valuations had become less attractive. EPAM’s share price fell sharply in early 2022 after Russia invaded Ukraine, given that close to 60% of the company’s staff was working in the affected countries of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. We were patient through this period as EPAM management restructured its workforce; only 30% are now based in these three countries. Despite the disruption, productivity remained comparable to pre-war times, and EPAM managed to retain nearly all of its customers. As a result, the stock recovered from its lows last year, offering an opportunity to trim our position.”8. Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 33.40%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 53Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) stock has plummeted 33.4% year-to-date as of market close on June 16, 2023.

The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 33.61%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 87The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) specializes in wealth management, securities brokerage, banking, asset management, custody, and financial advisory services. The financial holding company, however, ranks 7th on our list of the worst performing S&amp;P 500 stocks as its share price has fallen 33.61% year-to-date. On April 17, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) reported a Q1 revenue of $5.12 billion, up 9.6% year-over-year but missing Street consensus by $10 million. Similarly, the company expects an even worse year-over-year drop in Q2 revenue, citing a reduced net interest margin (NIM) and a smaller base of interest-earning assets, combined with decreased trading activity.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 87 hedge funds were bullish on The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), compared to 74 funds in the last quarter. D E Shaw is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 12.2 million shares worth $642.7 million. Generation Investment Management Global Equity Strategy made the following comment about The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“Your portfolio has been relatively insulated from recent banking troubles. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is the only financials company in your portfolio (forming 2.37% of it). The company’s share price has suffered. We are watching the situation closely. Regulators have responded quickly to the turmoil. After a few weeks when people were withdrawing deposits from small banks across America, the rush seems to have slowed.We do not have strong views on whether the banking turmoil will tip the global economy into recession. We are not economists, and in any case the global economy has rarely been so hard to predict. Forecasters are trying to weigh up a large number of highly unusual variables: a land war in Europe, the fallout from massive fiscal stimulus in 2020– 21 and high inflation. In this environment all judgments about the macro economy are uncertain.”6. Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 35.78%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) provides financial products and services, operating through Commercial Bank, Retail Bank, Wealth Management, and Finance segments. On June 13, the company announced that it is going to disengage from the mortgage banker finance business by the end of 2023. Comerica highlighted the reduction of seasonal and cyclical fluctuations in its loan portfolio, enhancing the efficiency of capital utilization, and improving the stability of its liquidity as potential benefits of the exit. As of June 16, Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) stock has declined nearly 36% year-to-date. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 46 hedge funds were bullish on Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA), compared to 37 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is the largest stakeholder of the company, with a position worth $137.8 million. In addition to DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH), Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP), and Newell Brands Inc. (NASDAQ:NWL), Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) is one of the worst performing S&amp;P 500 stocks this year. Third Avenue Value Fund made the following comment about Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“The largest detractors from Fund performance during the quarter included two banks, Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) and Deutsche Bank. As it relates to the Fund specifically, events within U.S. banking applied most directly to our investment in Comerica, a U.S. super-regional that does have a large portion of corporate deposits and is not classified as a globally systemically important bank (“G-SIB”), which means it has not recognized certain mark-to-market securities losses in its regulatory capital. Comerica was a 2.6% position at the beginning of the quarter, prior to a roughly 34% stock price decline during the quarter. After purchasing more shares following the stock price decline, the Fund’s position in Comerica was approximately 2.3% at quarter end. While the general contagion fears and bank depositor behavior remain a fluid situation today, we took some confidence from immediate, forceful and targeted actions by the Fed, FDIC and Treasury. In our view, the Fed’s Bank Term Funding Program (“BTFP”) seems a well-tailored and appropriate near-term liquidity solution that allows banks to obtain immediate liquidity, collateralized by the par value of securities, to meet any near-term deposit outflows. At the time of this writing, early signs are that the deposit flight from regional banks is calming rapidly and depositor psychology is improving, though this could change. To the extent that calming continues, our suspicion is that there may be very attractive bargains to be had among regional banks. More will be known in the coming days and weeks as information regarding deposit flows emanates post-quarter end. That said, there will remain some mystery around the extent of the bargains on offer because increases in FDIC funding, increases in regulatory capital requirements, more stringent liquidity stress testing, and changes to the list of banks subject to G-SIB regulatory regimes are all on the table now. It is also very likely that deposit costs, which had been rising very slowly, will rise much more rapidly as commercial banks work harder to entice depositors to stay put. None of these developments, if they eventuate, are likely to impact banks’ returns and earnings in a positive way.More broadly, the Third Avenue Value Fund owned investments categorized as financials totaling 15.94% by weight, at quarter end. This category includes non-bank financials such as Old Republic, a U.S. property and casualty insurer and title insurance business, Lazard, an advisory business and asset management firm, and Ashmore, a U.K. asset management firm specializing in emerging markets credit. The Fund’s actual bank exposure at quarter end totaled 9.52% and comprises Bank of Ireland, Deutsche Bank and Comerica, in order of position size…” (Click here to read the full text) Click to continue reading and see 5 Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 2023.  Suggested articles:Top 20 Countries with the Highest Oil Consumption10 Best GARP Stocks That Pay Dividends15 Biggest Journalism Companies in the US Disclosure: None. 20 Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 2023 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this company have returned +4.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, which The Charles Schwab Corporation falls in, has gained 6.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The Charles Schwab Corporation is expected to post earnings of $0.76 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -21.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.6%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.29 points to a change of -15.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.7%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.20 indicates a change of +27.6% from what The Charles Schwab Corporation is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.4%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for The Charles Schwab Corporation.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For The Charles Schwab Corporation, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $4.62 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -9.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $19.48 billion and $22.18 billion estimates indicate -6.2% and +13.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryThe Charles Schwab Corporation reported revenues of $5.12 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +9.5%. EPS of $0.93 for the same period compares with $0.77 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.18 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.15%. The EPS surprise was +3.33%.Over the last four quarters, The Charles Schwab Corporation surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.The Charles Schwab Corporation is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about The Charles Schwab Corporation. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Semiconductor - General industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 2.48 as of yesterday's close.The Semiconductor - General industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 92, which puts it in the top 37% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

From its IPO in May 1997 through March 31, 2023, Alexandria has generated an outstanding TSR of 1,444% (assuming reinvestment of dividends), significantly outperforming major indices over the same period, including the Nasdaq Composite's TSR of 998%, the MSCI U.S. REIT's TSR of 706% and the S&amp;P 500's TSR of 683%.Story continues(PRNewsfoto/Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.)Alexandria's strong and timely execution of its strategic value harvesting and asset recycling program to raise accretive capital has demonstrated continuing solid demand for scarce, high-quality life science assets. Affiliates of Alexandria recently completed the sale of five non-core, non-mega campus properties aggregating 428,663 RSF in the Greater Boston market to affiliates of TPG Real Estate Partners. The portfolio includes 780 and 790 Memorial Drive in Cambridgeport, which the company acquired in 2001 and delivered in 2002 as its first two life science developments in the Cambridge cluster. It also consists of three properties in Waltham — 225 Second Avenue, a laboratory facility acquired in 2014, and 266 and 275 Second Avenue, which Alexandria purchased in 2017 and immediately redeveloped into Class A laboratory facilities. All five facilities were successfully operated and maintained by Alexandria during its ownership. Alexandria sold the portfolio for $365 million, or an average sales price of $852 per RSF, and at a weighted-average capitalization rate of 5.2% (based upon cash net operating income for 2Q23 annualized) that includes vacancy available for redevelopment, resulting in a gain on sale of $187.2 million and a value-creation margin of 80%. Inclusive of this transaction, Alexandria has completed or has signed letters of intent or purchase and sale agreements for pending transactions aggregating $884 million, or 58%, of its 2023 capital plan that is targeting $1.525 billion (at the midpoint of guidance) of dispositions and sales of partial interests.Proceeds from this strategic disposition will be reinvested into the company's highly leased value-creation pipeline, which consists of large-scale research and development centers for top life science companies, including Eli Lilly, Bristol Myers Squibb and Moderna. As of March 31, 2023, 6.7 million RSF of current and near-term value-creation projects that are 72% leased are expected to drive over $610 million of annual incremental net operating income, primarily commencing from 2Q23 through 1Q26. This embedded growth enabled Alexandria to reiterate guidance of 6.4% annual growth in funds from operations (FFO) per share – diluted, as adjusted, for 2023 at the midpoint of guidance as of April 24, 2023, with a strong adjusted EBITDA margin of 69% for 1Q23. While these projects are delivering during a time when supply is elevated above historic norms in some submarkets, Alexandria's value-creation pipeline is concentrated in high-value, high-barrier-to-entry submarkets, such as Cambridge and Watertown in Greater Boston, Torrey Pines in San Diego, Lake Union in Seattle and Shady Grove in Rockville, Maryland. These Class A development and redevelopment projects are primarily mega campus expansions in core markets, where supply is inherently limited due to a lack of available land and conversion opportunities. Alexandria's highly differentiated strategy and preeminent brand afford the company a distinct competitive advantage against new market supply across most of its operating asset base of nearly 42 million RSF as of March 31, 2023.Alexandria's growth is supported by a strong and flexible balance sheet with no debt maturities until 2025, 96.1% of fixed-rate debt, credit ratings among the top 10% of all publicly traded U.S. REITs and $5.3 billion in liquidity as of March 31, 2023. Alexandria's cash dividend of $4.84 per common share for the 12 months ending June 30, 2023, represents an increase of 24 cents, or 5 percent, over the 12 months ended June 30, 2022. The dividend allows the company to share its continued high-quality, strong and increasing net cash provided by operating activities with its common stockholders while retaining a significant portion for reinvestment into its highly leased pipeline of new Class A development and redevelopment projects. Additionally, its FFO payout ratio (quarterly common stock dividends divided by quarterly funds from operations) remains favorably low at 55 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2023.""A true national treasure, the life science industry has made incredible progress with over 250 new FDA-approved medicines over the past five years, and 2023 is on pace to be another near record-high year with potentially up to 60 new drug approvals. And still, with over 10,000 diseases known to humankind, 90% of which remain unaddressed, there is a vast opportunity for the industry to create new and better treatments and cures,"" said Joel S. Marcus, executive chairman and founder of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. and Alexandria Venture Investments. ""With an estimated market value in excess of $5 trillion and aggregate annual research and development funding in the range of $450 billion to $500 billion, the life science industry, which is advancing innovation at unprecedented rates, is set for remarkable secular growth.""Alexandria's mission-critical Labspace assets house billions of dollars of high-intensity infrastructure, specialized equipment, and irreplaceable tenant research and clinical pipeline assets, which fuel the large, diverse and growing life science industry. This scientific research cannot be performed from home and must be conducted in dedicated spaces in compliance with stringent laboratory safety requirements governed by city, state and/or federal regulatory agencies. The company's Labspace assets often include nontechnical space that is fully integrated with the laboratories and intentionally designed to enable seamless workflows. While scientists must conduct research inside laboratories, they utilize the adjacent nontechnical space to meaningfully analyze data and make related business decisions, and hence this space is also critical to their research efforts overall. Alexandria's proven track record of operating and safeguarding its tenants' mission-critical research and development has yielded an incredibly loyal client base with an average retention rate of over 80% over the past five years.Alexandria has established a powerful moat around its novel life science real estate platform, fueled by its stellar brand reputation; highly sought-after mega campuses; long-tenured, highly experienced management team; strong and flexible balance sheet; REIT industry-leading client base of over 850 tenants that drives stable, resilient and long-duration cash flows; direct asset management and integrated laboratory support services; and unmatched life science industry experience and expertise. In recognition of the company's nearly three-decade track record, renowned author and business strategist Jim Collins has said, ""Alexandria has achieved the three outputs that define a great company: Superior Results, Distinctive Impact, and Lasting Endurance.""About Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the stock market outlook, skip over to 5 Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 2023. Wall Street analysts are still largely split when it comes to their forecasts for the S&amp;P 500 index, despite the year being halfway through. The difference in opinion among analysts has grown even more since the benchmark index emerged from its lengthiest bear market since 1948. Goldman Sachs raised its end of year target for the S&amp;P 500 from 4,000 to 4,500, noting that their 2023 earnings-per-share projections remain unmodified. Goldman Sachs speculates that a soft landing will be delivered by the Federal Reserve, despite the brutal interest rate hikes over the last year to counter inflation. The firm believes that market sectors that are underperforming so far have the potential to keep pace with market leaders. The mega-cap tech stocks are dominating the market this year, and the profits from artificial intelligence can potentially prolong the current stock market upswing. On the other hand, Morgan Stanley reiterated its negative stance on the stock market, noting that the bear market is not over and an earnings recession is projected to hinder any further gains. Michael Wilson, the chief equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, expects the S&amp;P 500 to sink to 3,900 by year-end. On May 23, Reuters polled 43 Wall Street strategists and they believe that the S&amp;P 500 index is expected to experience a decline by the end of 2023. These strategists think that investor sentiment will be negatively impacted due to high interest rates, banking failures, and disappointing earnings. They expect the S&amp;P 500 index to close at 4,150 at the end of 2023. The substantial gains this year are predominantly attributed to the growth and technology sectors, which led to significant market rallies and offset some of the instability caused by collapsing regional banks. According to Jonathan Golub, head of U.S. equity strategy and quantitative research for Credit Suisse, the S&amp;P 500 will likely close at 4,050 at the end of this year. He told Reuters: Story continues""It's just a very uninspiring, low-growth backdrop, with tight monetary policy and earnings that will be down this year versus last."" Data from Refinitiv suggests that the forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of the S&amp;P 500 is presently 19, compared to 17 recorded at the end of 2022 and exceeding the long-term average of approximately 16. UBS Global Wealth Management has a year-end S&amp;P 500 target of 3,800, and Nadia Lovell, a senior U.S. equity strategist at UBS, said: ""Historically, when you've seen this level of valuation, it's normally associated with re-acceleration in earnings and also an outlook for double-digit earnings growth going forward. We don't see that happening."" Market expectations are increasingly varied. For example, RBC Capital, citing improved earnings expectations, limited layoffs, and rebounding corporate sentiment, raised its end of year S&amp;P 500 price target to 4,250 from 4,100. Bloomberg cited Lori Calvasina, head of US equity strategy at RBC Capital, who commented: “While our new target still reflects a fairly neutral view on the direction of stocks through year end, when asked we do acknowledge more upside risks than downside risks. We’ve also been struck by how many bearish leaning investors have been asking us to walk them through the bull case and explain why stocks have been so resilient.”Amid the mixed market sentiment on Wall Street, some of the worst performing S&amp;P 500 stocks include DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH), Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP), and Newell Brands Inc. (NASDAQ:NWL). Our MethodologyFor this list, we screened the S&amp;P 500 stocks and chose the 20 worst performing companies based on highest decline in share prices year-to-date as of June 16, 2023. We have ranked the list in ascending order of the year-to-date share price drop. 20 Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 2023Image By peshkov - Adobe StockWorst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 202320. MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 23.08%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43MetLife, Inc.

On May 3, MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) reported a Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $1.52 and a revenue of $16.12 billion, falling short of Wall Street estimates by $0.34 and $720 million, respectively. However, on May 25, MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET)’s board authorized a $1 billion increase in the share repurchases, making the total share repurchase authorization outstanding approximately $4 billion.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 43 hedge funds were long MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET), with combined stakes worth $812.4 million. Richard S. Pzena’s Pzena Investment Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 4.18 million shares worth $242.3 million. Like DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH), Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP), and Newell Brands Inc. (NASDAQ:NWL), MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) is one of the worst performing S&amp;P 500 stocks in 2023. 19. International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. (NYSE:IFF)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 23.94%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. (NYSE:IFF) manufactures and markets cosmetic active and natural health ingredients that are used in consumer products. It operates through four segments – Nourish, Scent, Health &amp; Biosciences, and Pharma Solutions. International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. (NYSE:IFF) shares declined nearly 24% year-to-date as of June 16, making it one of the worst performing S&amp;P stocks.On May 8, International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. (NYSE:IFF) reported a Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $0.87, missing Wall Street estimates by $0.02. The revenue of $3.03 billion fell 5.3% as compared to the prior-year quarter, but outperformed market consensus by $50 million. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc.

(NYSE:IFF) in its Q1 2021 investor letter:“We are still getting used to the higher multiples that investors will pay for larger market cap and pure play companies such as IFF. We do understand the market’s rationale. IFF’s products account for a small percentage of the customers’ cost while playing critical roles in the products’ performance. With some operating leverage, the company can probably grow FCF at 4-6% a year. This brings the total return close to the long-term return of the S&amp;P 500 index of 10%. Through trial and error, we have come to appreciate how scale, higher market share, route densities, switching costs, and collaborative relationships amongst major industry players can contribute to sustained high returns on invested capital.”18. The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 24.08%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) is a power generation and utility company using coal, gas, hydro, wind, solar, biomass, and renewable sources.

The revenue increased 13.7% year-over-year to $3.24 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $400 million. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 44 hedge funds held stakes worth $1.1 billion in The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES), compared to 44 funds in the prior quarter holding stakes worth $1.3 billion. Massif Capital made the following comment about The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“We currently have roughly 13% of the portfolio allocated to two utilities: The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) and Polaris (PIF). We invested in AES in December 2020 at an average entry price of $21.3 and invested in PIF in July 2020 at an average entry price of 16.36 CAD. We are currently underwater on PIF and making money in AES. Our near-term outlook for both positions is mixed. AES had a solid year in 2022, up 13%; it has telegraphed growth in earnings and cash flow through 2025 and seems to be hitting its targets. We will have to see what the year holds for utilities and AES, but another year like last year, and the firm will be touching our full value expectations.”17. U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 25.07%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) was founded in 1863 and is headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It is a financial services company that operates through Corporate and Commercial Banking, Consumer and Business Banking, Wealth Management and Investment Services, Payment Services, and Treasury and Corporate Support segments.

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which had been a long-term stakeholder of U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), sold all its shares during the first quarter of 2023. Mairs &amp; Power Growth Fund made the following comment about U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“Financials were roiled in the quarter thanks to the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failures. Even though the Fund has a similar weight to Financials as the index, our bank stocks—U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Charles Schwab (SCHW)—fell more than the Financials sector and hurt relative performance. We have performed a thorough analysis of our banking stocks and believe that they will exit this banking event intact, and a few may even benefit from the sector turmoil.The largest detractors from relative performance in the quarter were US Bank, Charles Schwab, UnitedHealth Group (UNH), and Hormel (HRL). The first two got caught up in the previously mentioned bank scare. With the selloff in the quarter, we have added to US Bank selectively, but more so to JPMorgan as it appears better positioned to gather deposits in the current environment.”16. Organon &amp; Co. (NYSE:OGN)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 25.51%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33Organon &amp; Co.

(NYSE:OGN), compared to 37 funds in the preceding quarter. Steven Boyd’s Armistice Capital is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 3.20 million shares worth $75.2 million. Miller Value Partners made the following comment about Organon &amp; Co. (NYSE:OGN) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Organon &amp; Co. (NYSE:OGN) was the top detractor for the quarter, falling 30.0%2. Organon reported 2Q22 revenue of $1.59 billion, -0.6% Y/Y, ahead of consensus of $1.54 billion, and Adjusted EPS of $1.25, -27.3% Y/Y, in-line with analyst expectations. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter came in at $512 million (32.3% margin), compared to 2Q21 Adjusted EBITDA of $627 million (39.3% margin). Management revised FY22 guidance for revenue of $6.1-6.3 billion, compared to previous guidance for revenue of $6.1-6.4 billion, to reflect persisting foreign exchange (FX) headwinds, and Adjusted EBITDA margin of 32-34%, compared to prior guidance for a margin of 34-36%, which incorporates ~$110 million of in-process research and development (IPR&amp;D) and milestone expenses from business development. Management’s guidance implies FY22 Adjusted EBITDA of $2.05B, at the respective midpoints, or an Enterprise Value (EV)/EBITDA multiple of ~7.0x.”15. Truist Financial Corporation (NYSE:TFC)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 26.89%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48Truist Financial Corporation (NYSE:TFC) is a North Carolina-based provider of banking and trust services in the Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic United States.

Ric Dillon’s Diamond Hill Capital is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 16.7 million shares worth $569.3 million. Ave Maria Rising Dividend Fund made the following comment about Truist Financial Corporation (NYSE:TFC) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“The weakest performers were the Energy, Financials, and Consumer Discretionary sectors. Off the heels of last year’s outstanding performance, the Fund’s Energy stocks were down -16%. Financials were down -5%, primarily due to Truist Financial Corporation (NYSE:TFC) (bank), as banks sold off due to the failure of SVB Financial Group. Consumer Discretionary finished the quarter up but was pulled down by the -9% performance of RH (home products store).”14. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 27.11%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 77CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is a health services provider in the United States. It operates through Health Care Benefits, Pharmacy Services, and Retail/LTC segments. On May 25, CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) disclosed that only 21% of its Medicare Advantage members are enrolled in plans that have a star rating of four or higher, which will result in its net income dropping between $800 million to $1 billion in 2024. As of June 16, CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) stock has declined 27% year-to-date, making it one of the worst performing members of the S&amp;P 500 this year. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 77 hedge funds were bullish on CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), compared to 70 funds in the preceding quarter. John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors is the biggest position holder in the company. Greenlight Capital made the following comment about CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Second, we will discuss Oak Street Health (OSH), which we closed out after costing us 0.8% (net) during the quarter. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is buying OSH for $39 per share, or about $10 billion. When shorting, there is always the risk that someone with deep pockets will buy out the company at a silly price, or maybe even at twice a silly price. CVS is worth $115 billion (or it was the day they announced the deal; subsequently, CVS’s shares have fallen and it’s now worth $93 billion), so it can afford to piss away $10 billion.OSH is in value-based care, which has become a trendy segment of the market. Most of the “value” comes from doing a more thorough and aggressive job of documenting how sick a patient is, so as to maximize Medicare payments. OSH operates 169 clinics (costing between $1.5-$2 million to build) in mostly lower income neighborhoods and employs 600 doctors. CVS projects that in 2026 the pro forma entity will have 300 clinics and “embedded EBITDA” of $2 billion, plus over $500 million of synergies.In 2022, OSH generated less than $1 million of adjusted revenue per doctor2 and lost $500 million (almost $3 million per clinic). Even if it triples the number of doctors by 2026, it will need over $1 million of “embedded EBITDA” per doctor, implying margins shifting from a loss to nearly 100%. Obviously, this can’t happen, as the doctors need to be paid and there are other substantial costs. The amazing thing is that when rumors of this deal circulated, we reached out to CVS management and had a call where we walked them through the math… and they went ahead with the deal anyway. When the proxy came out, it revealed that OSH conducted an auction and, like a late-night eBay shopper who had one too many glasses of wine, CVS raised its uncontested bid several times… Rant over.”13. Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 28.08%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA), the American pharmaceutical giant, is one of the worst performing S&amp;P 500 constituents so far in 2023. The share price plummeted 28% year-to-date as of June 16, 2023. On May 4, Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) reported a Q1 GAAP EPS of $0.19 and a revenue of $1.9 billion, topping Wall Street estimates by $1.94 and $730 million, respectively. While revenue exceeded market consensus, it experienced a decline of 69% compared to the same period in 2022, mainly due to lower sales volume.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 40 hedge funds were bullish on Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA), down from 52 funds in the prior quarter. Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 6.5 million shares worth $1 billion. Baron Health Care Fund made the following comment about Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) is a leader in the emerging field of mRNA-based vaccines and therapeutics and was one of the three main producers of the COVID vaccine. Shares fell during the quarter. We believe as COVID shifts away from pandemic status and becomes an increasingly commercial market (rather than government funded), there is increasing investor uncertainty around what a booster market could look like, which is pressuring shares. Looking beyond COVID, we think Moderna has the potential to disrupt the biopharmaceutical industry, from infectious disease vaccines to oncology, and we remain shareholders.”12. Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 28.23%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) is a California-based based company that designs and manufactures home energy solutions for the solar industry in the United States and internationally. Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) shares have lost 28.23% in value since the beginning of this year till June 16, consequently making it to our list of the worst performing S&amp;P 500 stocks in 2023. Although Enphase Energy, Inc.

(NASDAQ:ENPH) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) designs, develops, manufactures and sells home energy solutions in the U.S. and internationally for the solar industry. The company is the world’s leading manufacturer of microinverters that convert solar-generated D.C. energy to A.C. energy usable in homes and buildings. Enphase introduced the world’s first microinverter system in 2008 and has expanded its offerings to include battery storage systems and proprietary technologies that provide energy monitoring and control services for solar energy systems. It sells its products and solutions directly to solar system distributors, large installers and strategic partners.We see Enphase having a substantial market share that is gained through a premium product offering, superior customer service and the development of a large and diverse network of solar installers and distributors. The company’s products and services address a growing residential solar market. Coupling battery backup systems with existing and newly installed residential solar systems could accelerate the company’s revenue and earnings growth over the next several years, in our view. Additionally, commercial and international expansion offer additional revenue and earnings upside. Enphase also plans to expand manufacturing capacity in the U.S. during 2023 to benefit from tax incentives related to domestic production included in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).”11. V.F.

(NYSE:EPAM) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“The portfolio’s returns in the roaring IT sector were hampered by software-engineering company EPAM Systems, Inc. (NYSE:EPAM) and payment-services provider Network International. EPAM signaled a more cautious outlook for growth and cost pressures related to the geographic reconfiguration of its East European engineering workforce in the wake of the war in Ukraine. UAE-based Network International indicated that challenging macroeconomic conditions in Africa may hinder near-term growth. In Communication Services, detractors included Safaricom, the leading mobile-network operator and payment-services company in Kenya, where the currency has weakened amid high inflation and a sizable current account deficit.Buying Globant didn’t increase our portfolio weight in IT services, as the purchase was funded by reducing two other industry holdings, EPAM and Tata Consultancy Services, for which valuations had become less attractive. EPAM’s share price fell sharply in early 2022 after Russia invaded Ukraine, given that close to 60% of the company’s staff was working in the affected countries of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. We were patient through this period as EPAM management restructured its workforce; only 30% are now based in these three countries. Despite the disruption, productivity remained comparable to pre-war times, and EPAM managed to retain nearly all of its customers. As a result, the stock recovered from its lows last year, offering an opportunity to trim our position.”8.

Similarly, the company expects an even worse year-over-year drop in Q2 revenue, citing a reduced net interest margin (NIM) and a smaller base of interest-earning assets, combined with decreased trading activity.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 87 hedge funds were bullish on The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), compared to 74 funds in the last quarter. D E Shaw is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 12.2 million shares worth $642.7 million. Generation Investment Management Global Equity Strategy made the following comment about The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“Your portfolio has been relatively insulated from recent banking troubles. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is the only financials company in your portfolio (forming 2.37% of it). The company’s share price has suffered. We are watching the situation closely. Regulators have responded quickly to the turmoil. After a few weeks when people were withdrawing deposits from small banks across America, the rush seems to have slowed.We do not have strong views on whether the banking turmoil will tip the global economy into recession. We are not economists, and in any case the global economy has rarely been so hard to predict. Forecasters are trying to weigh up a large number of highly unusual variables: a land war in Europe, the fallout from massive fiscal stimulus in 2020– 21 and high inflation. In this environment all judgments about the macro economy are uncertain.”6. Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 35.78%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) provides financial products and services, operating through Commercial Bank, Retail Bank, Wealth Management, and Finance segments. On June 13, the company announced that it is going to disengage from the mortgage banker finance business by the end of 2023.

(NYSE:AAP), and Newell Brands Inc. (NASDAQ:NWL), Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) is one of the worst performing S&amp;P 500 stocks this year. Third Avenue Value Fund made the following comment about Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“The largest detractors from Fund performance during the quarter included two banks, Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) and Deutsche Bank. As it relates to the Fund specifically, events within U.S. banking applied most directly to our investment in Comerica, a U.S. super-regional that does have a large portion of corporate deposits and is not classified as a globally systemically important bank (“G-SIB”), which means it has not recognized certain mark-to-market securities losses in its regulatory capital. Comerica was a 2.6% position at the beginning of the quarter, prior to a roughly 34% stock price decline during the quarter. After purchasing more shares following the stock price decline, the Fund’s position in Comerica was approximately 2.3% at quarter end. While the general contagion fears and bank depositor behavior remain a fluid situation today, we took some confidence from immediate, forceful and targeted actions by the Fed, FDIC and Treasury. In our view, the Fed’s Bank Term Funding Program (“BTFP”) seems a well-tailored and appropriate near-term liquidity solution that allows banks to obtain immediate liquidity, collateralized by the par value of securities, to meet any near-term deposit outflows. At the time of this writing, early signs are that the deposit flight from regional banks is calming rapidly and depositor psychology is improving, though this could change. To the extent that calming continues, our suspicion is that there may be very attractive bargains to be had among regional banks. More will be known in the coming days and weeks as information regarding deposit flows emanates post-quarter end. That said, there will remain some mystery around the extent of the bargains on offer because increases in FDIC funding, increases in regulatory capital requirements, more stringent liquidity stress testing, and changes to the list of banks subject to G-SIB regulatory regimes are all on the table now. It is also very likely that deposit costs, which had been rising very slowly, will rise much more rapidly as commercial banks work harder to entice depositors to stay put. None of these developments, if they eventuate, are likely to impact banks’ returns and earnings in a positive way.More broadly, the Third Avenue Value Fund owned investments categorized as financials totaling 15.94% by weight, at quarter end. This category includes non-bank financials such as Old Republic, a U.S. property and casualty insurer and title insurance business, Lazard, an advisory business and asset management firm, and Ashmore, a U.K. asset management firm specializing in emerging markets credit. The Fund’s actual bank exposure at quarter end totaled 9.52% and comprises Bank of Ireland, Deutsche Bank and Comerica, in order of position size…” (Click here to read the full text) Click to continue reading and see 5 Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 2023.  Suggested articles:Top 20 Countries with the Highest Oil Consumption10 Best GARP Stocks That Pay Dividends15 Biggest Journalism Companies in the US Disclosure: None. 20 Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 2023 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

The reiteration represents USB’s competence amid expectations of an economic slowdown/recession.Because of the uncertainty related to debt ceiling, U.S. Bancorp built cash balances a little more than what was expected in the second quarter. As a result, its second-quarter 2023 net interest margin (NIM) might be slightly lower than the 3% projected earlier.However, this is temporary and USB intends to restore cash to normal levels. Thus, the company’s NIM guidance for full-year 2023 remains in the 3-3.05% band.Management said that the net-charge off ratio is expected to increase over time and reach the 50 basis points mark by mid-2024.While the company has restated its guidance, it has made a minor change to the tax rate outlook for second-quarter and full-year 2023. Now, the adjusted income tax rate for each of second-quarter and full-year 2023 is expected to be 24%, slightly increased from the prior guidance of 23%.Notably, in December 2022, U.S. Bancorp completed the acquisition of MUFG Union Bank’s core regional banking franchise, expanding its branch network and having greater access to digital banking tools.In connection with the integration, USB’s chief financial officer Terry Dolan stated, “So, we're really fundamentally taking that 1.2 million customers and put it onto our platform and being able to utilize all the technology investment that we've already made.”Dolan added, “And again, scale in this environment is critically important. If you think about it simply Union Bank allowed us to increase our scale 15% to 20% with a very efficient platform that we've already invested in.”Dolan also noted that the acquisition of MUFG Union Bank would aid the bank’s earnings strength. It is expected that USB would improve its CET1 capital ratio by 0.20% to 0.25% every quarter. Also, Dolan aims to lower the bank's risk-weighted assets through ""low impact actions"".Story continuesProviding its guidance on capital, the bank’s chief executive officer Any Cecere said that the company’s target CET1 capital ratio for 2023 and 2024 is 9% and 10.5%, respectively.Apart from the above-mentioned metrics discussed at the conference, USB had provided guidance for some other line items during its first-quarter earnings call.The company had said that it expects second-quarter 2023 total revenues to reach $7.1-$7.3 billion compared with $7.2 billion in the first quarter. The outlook included purchase accounting accretion of approximately $85 million.Also, management had anticipated average earning assets to be between $600 billion and $605 billion compared with $607.6 billion recorded in the first quarter.Over the past six months, shares of USB have lost 20.2% compared with a decline of 2.5% recorded by the industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCurrently, U.S. Bancorp carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

NII is anticipated to slide 12% sequentially, which is substantially below the 4-5% fall guided during the first-quarter earnings conference call.FITB stated that adjusted NII is anticipated to be down 4-5% sequentially in the second quarter.

The eight-bed home, called Dallas Hope Center, provides residents with a 12-month program that provides a secure, welcoming environment where they can learn important life skills necessary to successfully lead independent lives.LGBTQIA+ youth are overrepresented among young people experiencing homelessness in the U.S., according to a 2022 report by The Trevor Project. Some 28% of LGBTQIA+ youth reported experiencing homelessness or housing instability in their lives, and those who did had two to four times the odds of reporting mental health challenges such as depression, self-harm or attempting suicide compared to those with stable housing. About 16% of LGBTQIA+ youth reported they ran away from home, with the majority saying they ran away because of mistreatment due to their identity, and another 14% reported they were kicked out or abandoned by their parents or caregivers.""The consequences of homelessness for LGBTQIA+ youth are devastating,"" said Doug Whittemore, senior vice president, head of consumer &amp; mortgage default operations at U.S. Bank. ""This program is designed to help young people who are often forced to leave their homes due to rejection, discrimination and abuse from their families and communities. They are left without a support system, without a safe and stable place to call home.""U.S. Bank provided the funding to rehabilitate the fixer-upper home Dallas Hope Charities purchased in 2020, partnering with other companies including property services company MCS and landscaping company SHINEscapes for home renovations that ranged from stabilizing the foundation to installing new appliances.

16,4b03f053-dcbb-30e4-80eb-9195ee795be5,WMT,2023-06-21,Slowdown in grocery inflation may be good news for trucking companies,FreightWaves,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/slowdown-grocery-inflation-may-good-110000873.html,1687345200,STORY,['WMT'],"[Grocery shopping may become less painful this year. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)The biggest food brands have cooled it on price inflation. That’s good news for consumers — and trucking companies.Two freight brokers told FreightWaves that truckers have had to reorganize their routes to grocers in the past year due to reduced volumes, though they haven’t experienced the fallout of business that other firms have grappled with:Andrew Lynch, the president of Zipline Logistics, said food companies in his network are moving less freight. Demand is choppy; a shipper may want to send 12 pallets one week and then a full truckload the next week. However, he said his brokerage’s volumes are up overall 20% year over year.David Spencer, vice president of market intelligence at Arrive Logistics, said there hasn’t been a “dramatic pullback” in consumers buying the necessities, like groceries. However, he’s noticed some key grocery customers are more likely to ship products twice a week, whereas several years ago it may have been once a week.Food headed to restaurants or cafeterias requires less packing than food headed to grocery stores. The shift to grocery spending over eating out was great for trucking companies in the early months of the pandemic; Spencer estimated that a truckload of food headed to a restaurant requires four to five truckloads if headed to a grocery store — thanks to that hefty packing. However, as consumers have shifted their spend from grocery back to restaurants, trucking companies have less packaging to haul.FreightWaves SONAR data suggests that truckers have been hard-pressed to find grocery loads. Looking specifically at refrigerated freight (which, unfortunately, leaves out a healthy chunk of the grocery sphere), conditions this spring hit their weakest point since at least 2019.The Reefer Outbound Tender Reject Index shows that trucking fleets are rejecting around 4.7% of refrigerated freight jobs. Last year at this time, that number was around 8%. Truckers rejected a whopping 34.9% of refrigerated truck jobs at this time in 2021.Story continuesRefrigerated truckload tenders rejected by carriers have fallen below 5%. (Chart: FreightWaves SONAR. To learn more about FreightWaves SONAR, click here.)While this index is currently very low, there have been signs of stabilization in the past six months. In mid-May, the Reefer Outbound Tender Reject Index slumped to around 2.6%. The current reading of nearly 5% is a marked improvement.The percentage of refrigerated truckload tenders rejected by carriers has slightly recovered in June. (Chart: FreightWaves SONAR. To learn more about FreightWaves SONAR, click here.)That stabilization may be because of slowing inflation for consumer packaged goods, like soda, dish soap, cereal and bread. According to Nielsen data, food prices increased by 7% in May 2023 compared to the same month last year. Consumption decreased by 2% over that same period.As food inflation slows, experts believe that volumes will creep up again.“We saw volume shrink to some of the lowest levels in a very long time in grocery,” Jennifer Bartashus, who is Bloomberg Intelligence’s senior equity research analyst of consumer staples and retail, told FreightWaves. “Now the tide seems to be turning and inflation is coming down … . We’re expecting to see volume start to rise again across grocery.”‘Excuseflation’ has been great for food manufacturers… but not customersIn recent months, there’s been something of a reckoning on why everything has gotten more expensive. Highly circulated research from Isabella Weber of the University of Massachusetts Amherst points to increased profit margins as an outcome of inflation. The supply chain crisis should have limited corporate profits as companies scrambled to find key inputs, like semiconductors or space on a container ship, as Weber has outlined.Instead, many industries have reported record profits in the past few years. That’s particularly notable among food manufacturers. As Time reported in April, giants like Cal-Maine Foods (which owns Land O’ Lakes and Eggland’s), Kraft-Heinz, General Mills and Conagra saw their net incomes soar during the past year.Given that troublesome supply chain crisis, presumably they shouldn’t have profited so much. However, thanks to what Bloomberg’s Odd Lots podcast dubbed “excuseflation,” companies were able to excuse historic price hikes by pointing to the everything shortage and supply chain crisis.Inflation on household staples and food is slowing, but customers are still buying less and less. (Chart: NielsenIQ.) Many of these shortages have dissipated or even reversed. Freight transportation capacity in most modes is plentiful. Still, companies aren’t exactly hankering to slash costs — in part because they’ve found that consumers will still buy stuff even if it’s more expensive than it was last year. Many companies have accepted lower volumes in exchange for higher prices.Companies have opted for higher prices and sacrificed volumes — not particularly a chipper development for the trucking industry. CPG giants enjoyed higher profits even though they were selling less. Increasingly, they’re finding that they’ll have to be more reasonable with prices and boost that volume again.“Grocery sales and margins were really supported by inflation, so they got lots of good top-line growth,” Bartashus of Bloomberg Intelligence said. “That was at the expense of volume. So in order for a lot of the publicly traded grocers to continue to show profit gains, they need volume to pick up.”Trucking companies would definitely like you to buy more stuff at the grocery store. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)Unfortunately for consumers (and truckers), CPG companies almost never make things cheaper. Big-box retail whiz Arun Sundaram, who is a senior equity research analyst at CFRA Research, said prices will come down thanks to promotions — particularly on cereal, produce, dairy, protein and other staples.Sundaram pointed out that there are still some pressures to keep food prices high, by the way. Certain commodities are still unusually expensive, like cocoa and sugar. The cost of labor has increased. But other key inputs like corn and (of course) transportation are down from pandemic highs.Grocery chains don’t like food price inflation either, so they’d like you to buy their private-label brandsBack in March, UBS Chief Economist Paul Donovan wrote about the possibility of a “consumer rebellion” that could halt grocery inflation. There’s also a precedent of the U.S. government stepping in to halt price increases, most notably in the 1940s.Neither of those things happened. In lieu of the federal government protecting household budgets, we have … Walmart?During its first-quarter earnings call in May, Walmart said food prices were up 20% on a two-year basis — largely thanks to CPGs keen on hiking prices. As a result, Walmart has been pushing its private-label brands. About 20% of Walmart sales are now private-label; at Sam’s Club, that’s around 30%.Private-label goods got a bad rap in the 1990s as weird, off-brand stuff. Think “Sweet Fizzy Drink” instead of Coca-Cola, or “Sugary Grain Circles” instead of Froot Loops. (Note: Neither of those private-label goods actually exists.)Now, store brands are a bit wiser, with their own in-house kitchens and branding experts to make private-label cool, said Juli Herdegen Lassow, the owner of private-label partnership firm JHL Solutions and former director of sourcing operations at Target. The aim is for private-label to be not just an economical option for consumers, but their first choice.“That’s where you’re going to see something super fun and innovative, like premium granola or a fruit snack,” Lassow said. “That grocer has taken the time to invest in food scientists and to build out a brand and a compelling flavor profile that the consumers are gonna be excited to have.”Walmart’s private-label brand is called Great Value. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves) Among all U.S. grocery channels, the dollar spend on private-label brands jumped 10.3% during the first three months of 2023. National brands grew by just 5.6%, according to data analyzed by industry group Private Label Manufacturers Association and data firm Circana.Private-label is likely here to stayGrocery stores aren’t just pushing their in-house brands because they want to save us money. Private-label foods are more profitable for grocery stores. Grocers also don’t enjoy the same plunderBartashus noted that grocery stores’ profit margins generally sit around 2% to 5%. CPG firms typically enjoy a profit margin of 11% to 15%.One reason is that there aren’t many options of, say, what kind of boxed mac ‘n’ cheese you buy. There’s the iconic Kraft blue box, Velveeta, or Annie’s if you’re feeling indie. But there are myriad options for where you buy that mac ‘n’ cheese: big-box grocery stores; dollar stores; online; pharmacies; or a mom-and-pop.If, say, Kroger can develop a killer mac ’n’ cheese that you can’t seem to stop craving, that’s a win for them. You’ll likely buy your other groceries while you’re there.Christopher Durham, president of Velocity Institute, a private-label professional association, noted that store brands are typically thought of for staples like vegetable oil or milk. But a trend that started before the pandemic — and is set to continue on — is store-brand stuff that consumers actually like.“If I can get you to love one or two unique things and come back for it, that’s when I win,” Durham said.In the long term, that may mean more profits for grocers.For the $875 billion trucking industry, freight and private-label experts alike told FreightWaves there’s not really a big difference whether a retailer is intaking its own store-brand goods versus a national brand. But, we can thank the private-label world for keeping freight volumes somewhat elevated this past year.What’s your favorite store brand purchase?

XYL have rallied 51.7% in a year, outperforming the industry’s 32.6% increase. The upside can be linked to solid underlying demand, price realization and improving supply chains. Shareholder-friendly policies also drove the stock higher.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s Aiding Xylem?Solid global demand across end markets is supporting Xylem’s top line. The Water Infrastructure segment is benefiting from effective price realization and strength in both utility and industrial end markets. For 2023, the company expects high-single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure.The Applied Water segment is gaining from commercial and industrial end markets. The company expects mid-single-digit growth in Applied Water. Measurement &amp; Control Solutions is benefiting from a robust utility end market, primarily in the United States, due to strong backlog execution. Also, strong price realization and an improvement in chip supply bode well. The company predicts the segment’s sales to increase in the high-teens for the year.Amid a strong demand environment, effective price realization and improving supply chains, Xylem’s bullish guidance for 2023 holds promise. The company expects adjusted earnings of $3.15-$3.35 per share. This compares with the year-ago adjusted earnings of $2.85 per share. XYL anticipates total revenues of $5.90-$6.00 billion for 2023, reflecting an increase of 8-9% on an organic basis.Xylem’s commitment to handsomely reward its shareholders through dividends and share buybacks are encouraging. In 2022, Xylem paid out dividends worth $217 million, up 6.9% year over year. In the first three months of 2023, it paid out dividends worth $60 million, up 9.1% year over year. The company bought back shares worth $52 million in 2022 and $8 million in the first three months of 2023. In February 2023, the company hiked its dividend by 10%.Will the Uptrend in Shares Continue?Improving supply chains and strength across end markets are expected to drive Xylem’s performance. While manufacturing activities have contracted lately, some market watchers expected a turnaround in the manufacturing sector in the second half of 2023. This bodes well for all industrial companies, and Xylem is no exception. The recent acquisition of Evoqua (for approximately $7.5 billion) is expected to bolster Xylem’s top line in 2023. Evoqua’s advanced water and wastewater treatment capabilities and exposure to key industrial markets complement Xylem’s portfolio of solutions across the water cycle. The acquisition boosts XYL’s position in water technologies, solutions and services and strengthens its foothold in lucrative end markets.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Other Stocks to ConsiderXylem currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks within the broader Industrial Products sector are as follows:Ingersoll Rand IR presently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

20,1701a18a-f60d-36ae-8a5c-6dceb7c13254,HBAN,2023-06-21,Capstone Partners Reports: Middle Market M&A Persists Amid Volatile Conditions,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/capstone-partners-reports-middle-market-144500031.html,1687272300,STORY,"['HBAN', 'HBANL', 'HBANM', 'HBANP']","[BOSTON, June 20, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Capstone Partners, a leading middle market investment banking firm, released its Q1 2023 Capital Market Update, reporting that total middle market merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) volume declined 14.3% year-over-year (YOY) in Q1 2023 as macroeconomic headwinds caused a slowdown in dealmaking. However, middle market deal volume continued to outperform the broader M&amp;A market, as total M&amp;A volume declined 25.2% YOY in Q1. While buyers have demonstrated increased selectivity, quality companies with strong margin profiles have continued to command M&amp;A interest at premium valuations. The Federal Reserve's ability to navigate a soft landing will likely prove consequential for middle market M&amp;A throughout 2023.Uncertainty is seldom received favorably by capital markets and the lack of economic visibility has caused angst among many market participants. The Federal Reserve has yet to settle on a terminal interest rate, with the continued strength of the labor market complicating the task of whether to hike or pause. Recent turmoil among regional banks has contributed to the tightening of the U.S. economy—an element that may be difficult to quantify in basis points. As the U.S. navigates a higher-for-longer rate environment to quell stubborn inflationary headwinds, confidence in a smooth recovery has often fluctuated with equity market swings, leaving many to wonder when the U.S. will enter a recession, or if the economy is already in the midst of one. As the economy eyes an emergence from monetary tightening, there is hope that the M&amp;A market may have reached a modest trough—presenting a strong backdrop for a recovery in middle market dealmaking.Inflation and elevated interest rates have continued to pressure M&amp;A valuations in the middle market. However, there has been evidence of some upward pricing momentum in early 2023. The average EBITDA multiple amounted to 9.1x in Q1, following a drastic decline to 7.2x in Q4 2022. Interestingly, it is the large-scale transactions that have seen the most significant pullback in pricing. The core middle market ($100-$250 in enterprise value) has continued to be the bellwether of middle market pricing. Valuations at this range have held steady at 10.9x EV/EBITDA, nearly mirroring the prior year's average of 11.1x EV/EBITDA.Story continuesBusiness owners, dealmakers, and lenders will be closely monitoring the monetary policy environment and its reverberations on the broader economy. If the U.S. has reached, or is approaching, its trough in the M&amp;A market, there is a precedent for what is to come. Sellers can expect an exuberant interest from buyers looking to reengage in inorganic growth upon a market recovery. Timing and asset position will be key as a substantial level of pent-up demand can be expected to create healthy levels of competition in the middle market.""As has traditionally been the case, M&amp;A market valuations and activity levels are driven more by credit trends than by equity market levels. Tightened credit conditions have decreased the amount of debt available for transactions as well as increasing the cost of that debt. With higher required equity contributions and more expensive debt, valuations have adjusted downward to maintain returns. Further, the natural flight to quality in times of uncertainty has further reduced supply in the short term. We look forward to the inevitable rebound in activity as conditions stabilize,"" said Phil Seefried, Executive Advisor at Capstone Partners.Also included in this report:Key considerations for middle market business owners regarding dry powder levels, buyer appetite, lending conditions, and M&amp;A pricing trends.Commentary on the primary drivers of transaction volume and valuations through Q1 2023.A breakdown of private equity dealmaking activity and data on dry powder reserves.How to create an evidence-based post-acquisition strategy, featuring Capstone's Financial Advisory Services group.To access to full report, click here.ABOUT CAPSTONE PARTNERSFor over 20 years, the firm has been a trusted advisor to leading middle market companies, offering a fully integrated range of investment banking and financial advisory services uniquely tailored to help owners, investors, and creditors through each stage of the company's lifecycle.  Capstone's services include M&amp;A advisory, debt and equity placement, corporate restructuring, special situations, valuation and fairness opinions and financial advisory services.  Headquartered in Boston, the firm has 175+ professionals in multiple offices across the U.S. With 12 dedicated industry groups, Capstone delivers sector-specific expertise through large, cross-functional teams.  Capstone is a subsidiary of Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (NASDAQ:HBAN).  For more information, visit www.capstonepartners.com.For More Information Contact:Rebecca LevesqueDirector of Marketing617-619-3318rlevesque@capstonepartners.comCisionView original content:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/capstone-partners-reports-middle-market-ma-persists-amid-volatile-conditions-301853552.htmlSOURCE Capstone Partners]"

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Huntington Bancshares (HBAN) earns a Zacks Rank #3 30 days from its next quarterly earnings release on July 20, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.37 a share.By taking the percentage difference between the $0.37 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.35 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Huntington Bancshares has an Earnings ESP of 5.38%.HBAN is one of just a large database of Finance stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is SL Green (SLG).SL Green, which is readying to report earnings on July 19, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $1.35 a share, and SLG is 29 days out from its next earnings report.SL Green's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 1.61% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.33.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, HBAN and SLG could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

NCLH have increased 66.8% in the past year compared with the industry’s 24.4% growth. The company is benefiting from solid onboard revenue generation, improving occupancy and fleet-expansion efforts. Also, the emphasis on digital initiatives bode well.An upward revision in earnings estimates for 2023 reflects analysts’ optimism regarding the company’s growth potential. In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings moved up 8.5% to 77 cents per share.Key Growth DriversNorwegian Cruise is benefiting from solid onboard revenue generation. During the first quarter of 2023, gross onboard revenue per passenger cruise day was nearly 30% higher than 2019 levels. The upside was primarily driven by enhancements to its bundled offerings. Also, the emphasis on margin enhancement initiatives, such as corporate overhead reductions, itinerary optimization, supply chain initiatives and the rationalization of product delivery, bodes well.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNorwegian Cruise benefits from improvements in occupancy. In first-quarter 2023, occupancy was approximately 101.5%, exceeding the company’s expectations of approximately 100%. In the previous quarter, the company reported an occupancy of 87%. It anticipates occupancy ramp-up to complete and reach approximately 105% during the second quarter of 2023. Relaxation in COVID-related protocols is likely to add to the positives.Norwegian Cruise is constantly striving to expand its fleet size to drive growth. It plans to introduce eight more ships through 2028. A majority of them are on order for the Norwegian Cruise Line, while the rest are for Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises. For the Regent brand, it has one Explorer Class Ship to be delivered in 2023. For the Oceania Cruises brand, the company has one Allura Class Ships to be delivered in 2025. For the Norwegian brand, the company has five Prima Class Ships on order, with scheduled delivery dates from 2023 through 2028.The company continues to make use of strategic and data-driven tools for marketing, product development and enhance the consumer experience. It is focused on identifying and evaluating incremental opportunities across every area of the business, that pave path for an accelerated margin recovery.During the first quarter 2023, the company initiated the rollout of the Starlink low-latency broadband internet system in a phased manner across its fleet. The strategic and cost-effective initiative focuses on the reliability and speed of Internet connectivity at sea. Also, the initiative supports the company’s brand value propositions as well as attract new cruisers to sail. Going forward, the company remains optimistic in this regard and anticipates the initiative to drive growth in the upcoming period.Story continuesHurdlesNorwegian Cruise has been bearing the brunt of high expenses for quite some time. During the first quarter of 2023, total cruise operating expenses came in at $1,280.4 million compared with $735.4 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The company’s expenses in the quarter stemmed from the resumption of cruise voyages and inflationary pressures. The company reported a rise in payroll, fuel and direct variable costs of fully-operating ships. Also, inflationary pressures related to food, perishables and logistics added to the woes. The company anticipates inflation and global supply chain constraints to dent margins in the near term. The company is cautious about the ongoing uncertain macroeconomic environment.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderNorwegian Cruise currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

At the same time, the Dow lost 0.72%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 5.08%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the chipmaker had gained 7.96% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 8.33% and outpaced the S&amp;P 500's gain of 5.36% in that time.Microchip Technology will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Microchip Technology to post earnings of $1.64 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 19.71%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $2.29 billion, up 16.55% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $6.23 per share and revenue of $8.81 billion, which would represent changes of +3.49% and +4.45%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Microchip Technology. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices.

25,8f9bf2b4-e9a2-354b-ad97-817882efc65a,MCHP,2023-06-21,Is Microchip Tech (MCHP) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microchip-tech-mchp-buy-wall-133007946.html,1687267807,STORY,['MCHP'],"[When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Microchip Technology (MCHP).Microchip Tech currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.68, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 17 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.68 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 17 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 10 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 58.8% and 11.8% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for MCHPBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for MCHPCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Microchip Tech here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Microchip Tech, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Should You Invest in MCHP?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Microchip Tech, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $6.23.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Microchip Tech. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Microchip Tech.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

26,72812cf5-7782-3a7f-bca5-f28377ec47b5,MET,2023-06-21,20 Worst Performing S&P 500 Stocks in 2023,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-worst-performing-p-500-200036146.html,1687291236,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'CMA', 'SCHW', 'CVS', 'AESC', 'VFC', 'ENPH', 'DG', 'IFF', 'EPAM', 'MRNA', 'USB', 'MET', 'TFC', 'CFG']","[In this article, we discuss 20 worst performing S&amp;P 500 stocks in 2023. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the stock market outlook, skip over to 5 Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 2023. Wall Street analysts are still largely split when it comes to their forecasts for the S&amp;P 500 index, despite the year being halfway through. The difference in opinion among analysts has grown even more since the benchmark index emerged from its lengthiest bear market since 1948. Goldman Sachs raised its end of year target for the S&amp;P 500 from 4,000 to 4,500, noting that their 2023 earnings-per-share projections remain unmodified. Goldman Sachs speculates that a soft landing will be delivered by the Federal Reserve, despite the brutal interest rate hikes over the last year to counter inflation. The firm believes that market sectors that are underperforming so far have the potential to keep pace with market leaders. The mega-cap tech stocks are dominating the market this year, and the profits from artificial intelligence can potentially prolong the current stock market upswing. On the other hand, Morgan Stanley reiterated its negative stance on the stock market, noting that the bear market is not over and an earnings recession is projected to hinder any further gains. Michael Wilson, the chief equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, expects the S&amp;P 500 to sink to 3,900 by year-end. On May 23, Reuters polled 43 Wall Street strategists and they believe that the S&amp;P 500 index is expected to experience a decline by the end of 2023. These strategists think that investor sentiment will be negatively impacted due to high interest rates, banking failures, and disappointing earnings. They expect the S&amp;P 500 index to close at 4,150 at the end of 2023. The substantial gains this year are predominantly attributed to the growth and technology sectors, which led to significant market rallies and offset some of the instability caused by collapsing regional banks. According to Jonathan Golub, head of U.S. equity strategy and quantitative research for Credit Suisse, the S&amp;P 500 will likely close at 4,050 at the end of this year. He told Reuters: Story continues""It's just a very uninspiring, low-growth backdrop, with tight monetary policy and earnings that will be down this year versus last."" Data from Refinitiv suggests that the forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of the S&amp;P 500 is presently 19, compared to 17 recorded at the end of 2022 and exceeding the long-term average of approximately 16. UBS Global Wealth Management has a year-end S&amp;P 500 target of 3,800, and Nadia Lovell, a senior U.S. equity strategist at UBS, said: ""Historically, when you've seen this level of valuation, it's normally associated with re-acceleration in earnings and also an outlook for double-digit earnings growth going forward. We don't see that happening."" Market expectations are increasingly varied. For example, RBC Capital, citing improved earnings expectations, limited layoffs, and rebounding corporate sentiment, raised its end of year S&amp;P 500 price target to 4,250 from 4,100. Bloomberg cited Lori Calvasina, head of US equity strategy at RBC Capital, who commented: “While our new target still reflects a fairly neutral view on the direction of stocks through year end, when asked we do acknowledge more upside risks than downside risks. We’ve also been struck by how many bearish leaning investors have been asking us to walk them through the bull case and explain why stocks have been so resilient.”Amid the mixed market sentiment on Wall Street, some of the worst performing S&amp;P 500 stocks include DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH), Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP), and Newell Brands Inc. (NASDAQ:NWL). Our MethodologyFor this list, we screened the S&amp;P 500 stocks and chose the 20 worst performing companies based on highest decline in share prices year-to-date as of June 16, 2023. We have ranked the list in ascending order of the year-to-date share price drop. 20 Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 2023Image By peshkov - Adobe StockWorst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 202320. MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 23.08%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43MetLife, Inc.

However, on May 25, MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET)’s board authorized a $1 billion increase in the share repurchases, making the total share repurchase authorization outstanding approximately $4 billion.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 43 hedge funds were long MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET), with combined stakes worth $812.4 million. Richard S. Pzena’s Pzena Investment Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 4.18 million shares worth $242.3 million. Like DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH), Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP), and Newell Brands Inc. (NASDAQ:NWL), MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) is one of the worst performing S&amp;P 500 stocks in 2023. 19. International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. (NYSE:IFF)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 23.94%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. (NYSE:IFF) manufactures and markets cosmetic active and natural health ingredients that are used in consumer products. It operates through four segments – Nourish, Scent, Health &amp; Biosciences, and Pharma Solutions. International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc.

(NYSE:IFF) reported a Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $0.87, missing Wall Street estimates by $0.02. The revenue of $3.03 billion fell 5.3% as compared to the prior-year quarter, but outperformed market consensus by $50 million. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc.

(NYSE:IFF) in its Q1 2021 investor letter:“We are still getting used to the higher multiples that investors will pay for larger market cap and pure play companies such as IFF. We do understand the market’s rationale. IFF’s products account for a small percentage of the customers’ cost while playing critical roles in the products’ performance. With some operating leverage, the company can probably grow FCF at 4-6% a year. This brings the total return close to the long-term return of the S&amp;P 500 index of 10%. Through trial and error, we have come to appreciate how scale, higher market share, route densities, switching costs, and collaborative relationships amongst major industry players can contribute to sustained high returns on invested capital.”18. The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 24.08%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) is a power generation and utility company using coal, gas, hydro, wind, solar, biomass, and renewable sources.

The revenue increased 13.7% year-over-year to $3.24 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $400 million. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 44 hedge funds held stakes worth $1.1 billion in The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES), compared to 44 funds in the prior quarter holding stakes worth $1.3 billion. Massif Capital made the following comment about The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“We currently have roughly 13% of the portfolio allocated to two utilities: The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) and Polaris (PIF). We invested in AES in December 2020 at an average entry price of $21.3 and invested in PIF in July 2020 at an average entry price of 16.36 CAD. We are currently underwater on PIF and making money in AES. Our near-term outlook for both positions is mixed. AES had a solid year in 2022, up 13%; it has telegraphed growth in earnings and cash flow through 2025 and seems to be hitting its targets. We will have to see what the year holds for utilities and AES, but another year like last year, and the firm will be touching our full value expectations.”17. U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 25.07%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) was founded in 1863 and is headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It is a financial services company that operates through Corporate and Commercial Banking, Consumer and Business Banking, Wealth Management and Investment Services, Payment Services, and Treasury and Corporate Support segments.

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which had been a long-term stakeholder of U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), sold all its shares during the first quarter of 2023. Mairs &amp; Power Growth Fund made the following comment about U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“Financials were roiled in the quarter thanks to the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failures. Even though the Fund has a similar weight to Financials as the index, our bank stocks—U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Charles Schwab (SCHW)—fell more than the Financials sector and hurt relative performance. We have performed a thorough analysis of our banking stocks and believe that they will exit this banking event intact, and a few may even benefit from the sector turmoil.The largest detractors from relative performance in the quarter were US Bank, Charles Schwab, UnitedHealth Group (UNH), and Hormel (HRL). The first two got caught up in the previously mentioned bank scare. With the selloff in the quarter, we have added to US Bank selectively, but more so to JPMorgan as it appears better positioned to gather deposits in the current environment.”16. Organon &amp; Co. (NYSE:OGN)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 25.51%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33Organon &amp; Co.

(NYSE:OGN), compared to 37 funds in the preceding quarter. Steven Boyd’s Armistice Capital is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 3.20 million shares worth $75.2 million. Miller Value Partners made the following comment about Organon &amp; Co. (NYSE:OGN) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Organon &amp; Co. (NYSE:OGN) was the top detractor for the quarter, falling 30.0%2. Organon reported 2Q22 revenue of $1.59 billion, -0.6% Y/Y, ahead of consensus of $1.54 billion, and Adjusted EPS of $1.25, -27.3% Y/Y, in-line with analyst expectations.

Management revised FY22 guidance for revenue of $6.1-6.3 billion, compared to previous guidance for revenue of $6.1-6.4 billion, to reflect persisting foreign exchange (FX) headwinds, and Adjusted EBITDA margin of 32-34%, compared to prior guidance for a margin of 34-36%, which incorporates ~$110 million of in-process research and development (IPR&amp;D) and milestone expenses from business development. Management’s guidance implies FY22 Adjusted EBITDA of $2.05B, at the respective midpoints, or an Enterprise Value (EV)/EBITDA multiple of ~7.0x.”15.

Off the heels of last year’s outstanding performance, the Fund’s Energy stocks were down -16%. Financials were down -5%, primarily due to Truist Financial Corporation (NYSE:TFC) (bank), as banks sold off due to the failure of SVB Financial Group. Consumer Discretionary finished the quarter up but was pulled down by the -9% performance of RH (home products store).”14. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 27.11%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 77CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is a health services provider in the United States. It operates through Health Care Benefits, Pharmacy Services, and Retail/LTC segments. On May 25, CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) disclosed that only 21% of its Medicare Advantage members are enrolled in plans that have a star rating of four or higher, which will result in its net income dropping between $800 million to $1 billion in 2024. As of June 16, CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) stock has declined 27% year-to-date, making it one of the worst performing members of the S&amp;P 500 this year. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 77 hedge funds were bullish on CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), compared to 70 funds in the preceding quarter. John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors is the biggest position holder in the company. Greenlight Capital made the following comment about CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Second, we will discuss Oak Street Health (OSH), which we closed out after costing us 0.8% (net) during the quarter. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is buying OSH for $39 per share, or about $10 billion. When shorting, there is always the risk that someone with deep pockets will buy out the company at a silly price, or maybe even at twice a silly price. CVS is worth $115 billion (or it was the day they announced the deal; subsequently, CVS’s shares have fallen and it’s now worth $93 billion), so it can afford to piss away $10 billion.OSH is in value-based care, which has become a trendy segment of the market. Most of the “value” comes from doing a more thorough and aggressive job of documenting how sick a patient is, so as to maximize Medicare payments. OSH operates 169 clinics (costing between $1.5-$2 million to build) in mostly lower income neighborhoods and employs 600 doctors. CVS projects that in 2026 the pro forma entity will have 300 clinics and “embedded EBITDA” of $2 billion, plus over $500 million of synergies.In 2022, OSH generated less than $1 million of adjusted revenue per doctor2 and lost $500 million (almost $3 million per clinic). Even if it triples the number of doctors by 2026, it will need over $1 million of “embedded EBITDA” per doctor, implying margins shifting from a loss to nearly 100%. Obviously, this can’t happen, as the doctors need to be paid and there are other substantial costs. The amazing thing is that when rumors of this deal circulated, we reached out to CVS management and had a call where we walked them through the math… and they went ahead with the deal anyway. When the proxy came out, it revealed that OSH conducted an auction and, like a late-night eBay shopper who had one too many glasses of wine, CVS raised its uncontested bid several times… Rant over.”13. Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 28.08%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA), the American pharmaceutical giant, is one of the worst performing S&amp;P 500 constituents so far in 2023. The share price plummeted 28% year-to-date as of June 16, 2023. On May 4, Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) reported a Q1 GAAP EPS of $0.19 and a revenue of $1.9 billion, topping Wall Street estimates by $1.94 and $730 million, respectively. While revenue exceeded market consensus, it experienced a decline of 69% compared to the same period in 2022, mainly due to lower sales volume.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 40 hedge funds were bullish on Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA), down from 52 funds in the prior quarter. Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 6.5 million shares worth $1 billion. Baron Health Care Fund made the following comment about Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) is a leader in the emerging field of mRNA-based vaccines and therapeutics and was one of the three main producers of the COVID vaccine. Shares fell during the quarter. We believe as COVID shifts away from pandemic status and becomes an increasingly commercial market (rather than government funded), there is increasing investor uncertainty around what a booster market could look like, which is pressuring shares. Looking beyond COVID, we think Moderna has the potential to disrupt the biopharmaceutical industry, from infectious disease vaccines to oncology, and we remain shareholders.”12. Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 28.23%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) is a California-based based company that designs and manufactures home energy solutions for the solar industry in the United States and internationally. Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) shares have lost 28.23% in value since the beginning of this year till June 16, consequently making it to our list of the worst performing S&amp;P 500 stocks in 2023. Although Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) reported better than forecasted Q1 adjusted earnings and revenues, the company guided Q2 revenues below Wall Street estimates. Enphase expects Q2 revenue to range between $700 million to $750 million, falling short of the market consensus of $760 million. The gross margin in Q2 is expected to be 41% to 44%, which is lower than Q1.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 55 hedge funds were long Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH), compared to 63 funds in the prior quarter. John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 590,709 shares worth $124.2 million.Aristotle Atlantic Large Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) designs, develops, manufactures and sells home energy solutions in the U.S. and internationally for the solar industry. The company is the world’s leading manufacturer of microinverters that convert solar-generated D.C. energy to A.C. energy usable in homes and buildings. Enphase introduced the world’s first microinverter system in 2008 and has expanded its offerings to include battery storage systems and proprietary technologies that provide energy monitoring and control services for solar energy systems. It sells its products and solutions directly to solar system distributors, large installers and strategic partners.We see Enphase having a substantial market share that is gained through a premium product offering, superior customer service and the development of a large and diverse network of solar installers and distributors. The company’s products and services address a growing residential solar market. Coupling battery backup systems with existing and newly installed residential solar systems could accelerate the company’s revenue and earnings growth over the next several years, in our view. Additionally, commercial and international expansion offer additional revenue and earnings upside. Enphase also plans to expand manufacturing capacity in the U.S. during 2023 to benefit from tax incentives related to domestic production included in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).”11. V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 29.67%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28V.F.

Corporation (NYSE:VFC) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Apparel and footwear company V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC)’s stock declined in Q4 after management lowered guidance based on weaker-than-expected demand in North America, higher promotions and elevated wholesale order cancellations.

(NYSE:EPAM) trimmed its Q2 and FY23 outlook because of further downturn in short-term demand. For FY23, the company forecasts revenues between $4.650 billion to $4.80 billion, down from the earlier guidance of $4.95 billion to $5.00 billion. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 34 hedge funds were bullish on EPAM Systems, Inc. (NYSE:EPAM), compared to 35 funds in the preceding quarter. Stephen Mandel’s Lone Pine Capital is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 965,588 shares worth $288.7 million. Harding Loevner Emerging Markets Equity Strategy made the following comment about EPAM Systems, Inc. (NYSE:EPAM) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“The portfolio’s returns in the roaring IT sector were hampered by software-engineering company EPAM Systems, Inc. (NYSE:EPAM) and payment-services provider Network International. EPAM signaled a more cautious outlook for growth and cost pressures related to the geographic reconfiguration of its East European engineering workforce in the wake of the war in Ukraine. UAE-based Network International indicated that challenging macroeconomic conditions in Africa may hinder near-term growth. In Communication Services, detractors included Safaricom, the leading mobile-network operator and payment-services company in Kenya, where the currency has weakened amid high inflation and a sizable current account deficit.Buying Globant didn’t increase our portfolio weight in IT services, as the purchase was funded by reducing two other industry holdings, EPAM and Tata Consultancy Services, for which valuations had become less attractive. EPAM’s share price fell sharply in early 2022 after Russia invaded Ukraine, given that close to 60% of the company’s staff was working in the affected countries of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. We were patient through this period as EPAM management restructured its workforce; only 30% are now based in these three countries. Despite the disruption, productivity remained comparable to pre-war times, and EPAM managed to retain nearly all of its customers. As a result, the stock recovered from its lows last year, offering an opportunity to trim our position.”8.

During the first quarter, Dollar General reported solid comps, as their core lower-income consumer remained resilient despite rising inflation.”7. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 33.61%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 87The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) specializes in wealth management, securities brokerage, banking, asset management, custody, and financial advisory services.

Similarly, the company expects an even worse year-over-year drop in Q2 revenue, citing a reduced net interest margin (NIM) and a smaller base of interest-earning assets, combined with decreased trading activity.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 87 hedge funds were bullish on The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), compared to 74 funds in the last quarter. D E Shaw is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 12.2 million shares worth $642.7 million. Generation Investment Management Global Equity Strategy made the following comment about The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“Your portfolio has been relatively insulated from recent banking troubles. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is the only financials company in your portfolio (forming 2.37% of it). The company’s share price has suffered. We are watching the situation closely. Regulators have responded quickly to the turmoil. After a few weeks when people were withdrawing deposits from small banks across America, the rush seems to have slowed.We do not have strong views on whether the banking turmoil will tip the global economy into recession. We are not economists, and in any case the global economy has rarely been so hard to predict. Forecasters are trying to weigh up a large number of highly unusual variables: a land war in Europe, the fallout from massive fiscal stimulus in 2020– 21 and high inflation. In this environment all judgments about the macro economy are uncertain.”6. Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 35.78%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) provides financial products and services, operating through Commercial Bank, Retail Bank, Wealth Management, and Finance segments. On June 13, the company announced that it is going to disengage from the mortgage banker finance business by the end of 2023. Comerica highlighted the reduction of seasonal and cyclical fluctuations in its loan portfolio, enhancing the efficiency of capital utilization, and improving the stability of its liquidity as potential benefits of the exit. As of June 16, Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) stock has declined nearly 36% year-to-date. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 46 hedge funds were bullish on Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA), compared to 37 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is the largest stakeholder of the company, with a position worth $137.8 million. In addition to DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH), Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP), and Newell Brands Inc. (NASDAQ:NWL), Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) is one of the worst performing S&amp;P 500 stocks this year. Third Avenue Value Fund made the following comment about Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“The largest detractors from Fund performance during the quarter included two banks, Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) and Deutsche Bank. As it relates to the Fund specifically, events within U.S. banking applied most directly to our investment in Comerica, a U.S. super-regional that does have a large portion of corporate deposits and is not classified as a globally systemically important bank (“G-SIB”), which means it has not recognized certain mark-to-market securities losses in its regulatory capital. Comerica was a 2.6% position at the beginning of the quarter, prior to a roughly 34% stock price decline during the quarter. After purchasing more shares following the stock price decline, the Fund’s position in Comerica was approximately 2.3% at quarter end. While the general contagion fears and bank depositor behavior remain a fluid situation today, we took some confidence from immediate, forceful and targeted actions by the Fed, FDIC and Treasury. In our view, the Fed’s Bank Term Funding Program (“BTFP”) seems a well-tailored and appropriate near-term liquidity solution that allows banks to obtain immediate liquidity, collateralized by the par value of securities, to meet any near-term deposit outflows. At the time of this writing, early signs are that the deposit flight from regional banks is calming rapidly and depositor psychology is improving, though this could change. To the extent that calming continues, our suspicion is that there may be very attractive bargains to be had among regional banks. More will be known in the coming days and weeks as information regarding deposit flows emanates post-quarter end. That said, there will remain some mystery around the extent of the bargains on offer because increases in FDIC funding, increases in regulatory capital requirements, more stringent liquidity stress testing, and changes to the list of banks subject to G-SIB regulatory regimes are all on the table now. It is also very likely that deposit costs, which had been rising very slowly, will rise much more rapidly as commercial banks work harder to entice depositors to stay put. None of these developments, if they eventuate, are likely to impact banks’ returns and earnings in a positive way.More broadly, the Third Avenue Value Fund owned investments categorized as financials totaling 15.94% by weight, at quarter end. This category includes non-bank financials such as Old Republic, a U.S. property and casualty insurer and title insurance business, Lazard, an advisory business and asset management firm, and Ashmore, a U.K. asset management firm specializing in emerging markets credit. The Fund’s actual bank exposure at quarter end totaled 9.52% and comprises Bank of Ireland, Deutsche Bank and Comerica, in order of position size…” (Click here to read the full text) Click to continue reading and see 5 Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 2023.  Suggested articles:Top 20 Countries with the Highest Oil Consumption10 Best GARP Stocks That Pay Dividends15 Biggest Journalism Companies in the US Disclosure: None. 20 Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 2023 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Toward the end of last year, Saudi Arabia reiterated its commitment to China as its “most reliable partner and supplier of crude oil,” along with broader assurances of its ongoing support in several other areas. This followed the comment in March 2021 at the annual China Development Forum hosted in Beijing, from Aramco chief executive officer, Amin Nasser that: “Ensuring the continuing security of China’s energy needs remains our highest priority - not just for the next five years but for the next 50 and beyond.” Such statements appeared to confirm that MbS now sees the U.S. as a partner just for its security considerations in the new global oil market order, with no meaningful quid pro quo on Saudi Arabia’s part, whilst regarding China as its key partner economically and Russia as its key partner in energy matters. A slew of new commitments last week from Saudi Arabia to China appear to confirm these views.To begin with, Saudi Arabia’s energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said that the Kingdom is keen to cooperate further with China in developing gas ties, as well as those relating to crude oil. These gas ties will span the entire sector, from the development of reserves to new petrochemicals projects, and follow on from the signing last August of a multi-pronged memorandum of understanding (MoU) between Saudi Aramco and the China Petroleum &amp; Chemical Corporation (Sinopec). As the president of Sinopec, Yu Baocai, put it at the time: “The signing of the MoU introduces a new chapter of our partnership in the Kingdom [of Saudi Aabia] …The two companies will join hands in renewing the vitality and scoring new progress of the Belt and Road Initiative [BRI] and [Saudi Arabia’s] Vision 2030.” Crucially for China’s long-term plans in Saudi Arabia, it also covers opportunities for the construction of a huge manufacturing hub in King Salman Energy Park that will involve the ongoing, on-the-ground presence on Saudi Arabian soil of significant numbers of Chinese personnel. These will not just be directly related to the oil, gas, petrochemicals, and other hydrocarbons activities, but will also include a small army of security personnel to ensure the safety of China’s investments. At that point last year, Aramco already had a 25 percent stake in the 280,000 barrels per day (bpd) Fujian refinery in south China through a joint venture with Sinopec (and the U.S.’s ExxonMobil) and had also earlier agreed (in 2018) to buy a 9 percent stake in China’s 800,000 bpd ZPC refinery from Rongsheng.Story continuesSeveral other joint projects between China and Saudi Arabia that had been agreed in principle had been delayed due to a combination of factors at the time. These were the ongoing effects of COVID-19, Aramco’s crushing dividend repayment schedule, and concern from both countries – especially China – on how Washington might react to this clear threat to the U.S.’s own long-running relationship with Saudi Arabia, as also analysed in depth in my new book on the new global oil market order. The basis of this enduring relationship had been struck back in 1945 at a meeting on 14 February 1945 between the then-U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Saudi King at the time, Abdulaziz bin Abdul Rahman Al Saud. The deal that they agreed – which had been the basis for all the U.S.’s Middle East policy up until very recently - was this: the U.S. would receive all of the oil supplies it needed for as long as Saudi had oil in place, in return for which the U.S. would guarantee the security both of the ruling House of Saud and, by extension, of Saudi Arabia. This landmark deal survived the 1973 Oil Crisis and even looked as though it might survive the Saudi-led Oil Price War from 2014 to 2016, aimed by Riyadh at destroying or at least severely disabling the then-nascent U.S. shale oil industry. The real death of the 1945 Bitter Lake deal came when Russia emerged at the end of 2016 to support the then-beleaguered Saudi Arabia and OPEC in future oil production deals, given the lack of credibility in the global oil markets that both had at the end of the 2014-2016 Oil Price War. With the announcements last week, it seems that all the key elements of the previously-announced deals between Saudi Arabia and China are coming back into play.Just prior to the signing of the wide-ranging MoU in August 2022 – the precursor to last week’s agreements - Saudi Aramco’s senior vice president downstream, Mohammed Y. Al Qahtani, announced the creation of a ‘one-stop shop’ provided by his company in China’s Shandong. “The ongoing energy crisis [caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022], for example, is a direct result of fragile international transition plans which have arbitrarily ignored energy security and affordability for all,” he said. “The world needs clear-eyed thinking on such issues - that’s why we highly admire China’s 14th Five Year Plan for prioritising energy security and stability, acknowledging its crucial role in economic development,” he added. The megaproject in Shandong, which is home to around 26 percent of China’s refining capacity and is a key destination for Saudi Aramco’s crude oil exports, will broadly involve the flagship Saudi oil and gas giant creating “stronger ties with the world’s largest oil exporter [that] would enhance China’s energy security, especially as we work on increasing our production capacity to 13 million barrels per day,” according to Al Qahtani. Aside from the fact that Saudi Arabia still cannot produce anywhere near 13 million barrels per day of crude oil, as examined in detail in my new book, closer cooperation between Aramco and China will mean Saudi Arabia investing heavily in the build-out of a large, integrated downstream business across the country in tandem with its Chinese partners.A key facet of agreements made by emerging nations with China is that they tend to feature significant deal creep. As highlighted above, they all tend to feature the build-out by China of major facilities in the target countries that allow Beijing to station significant numbers of personnel – including those designated as security staff – in and around them. They also tend to act as the precursor to several other more insidious features that only become clearer as time progresses. In December 2022, MbS hosted a series of meetings in Riyadh between China’s President Xi Jinping and the leaders of countries in the Arab League. The Arab League comprises Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordon, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Palestinian Authority, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen. At this meeting – and the January 2022 meeting between senior officials from the Chinese government and foreign ministers from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, plus the secretary-general of the Gulf Cooperation Council (comprising Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates) - the principal topics of conversation were to finally seal a China-GCC Free Trade Agreement and to forge a “deeper strategic cooperation in a region where U.S. dominance is showing signs of retreat”.Also at the December 2022 meetings, China’s President Xi Jinping identified two ‘priority areas’ that he believed should be addressed as quickly as possible, as also analysed in depth in my new book on the new global oil market order. The first was the transition to using the Chinese renminbi in oil and gas deals done between the Arab League countries and China. The second was to bring nuclear technology to targeted countries, beginning with Saudi Arabia. Previously, the Kingdom had been in talks to acquire nuclear technology from the U.S. under the ‘1-2-3’ protocol. As highlighted in 2019 by then-US Energy Secretary, Rick Perry, Saudi Arabia had told the U.S. that it wanted to go ahead with a full-cycle nuclear programme, including the production and enrichment of uranium for atomic fuel. The U.S. had made it clear that for U.S. companies to participate in Saudi Arabia’s project, Riyadh would need to sign an accord on the peaceful use of nuclear technology with Washington. The ‘1-2-3’ protocol was intended to limit the enrichment of uranium for arms purposes. China does not have such a protocol in place for Saudi Arabia. And, as Saudi Arabia’s energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman again reiterated last week: “We came to recognise the reality of today that China has taken a lead and will continue to take that lead […] We do not have to compete with China, we have to collaborate with China.”By Simon Watkins for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:UK Manufacturing Sector Soars Thanks To Aerospace BoomChina Expands Influence In Latin America Through Belt And Road InitiativeTransmission Problems Pose Risk For RenewablesRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

But we have Ines Ferre with a bigger breakdown. Take us through it, Ines.INES FERRE: Yeah, Diane. And part of this really has to do with the recovery in China and the nonlinear recovery really as it has been or a whimper of a recovery as some would say it has been so far. China has taken some stimulus measures. It has cut some key lending rates recently. And so that is to shore up their economy. And some experts are saying perhaps that is not enough to shore up their economy. But this has really been sort of a disappointment for the oil markets, which were sort of banking on China to be able to recover, roar back from its lockdowns, COVID lockdowns, last year.You have exports and imports in China that have fallen, factory activity that it shrank. And so you are seeing pressure on oil over the last a weeks. And despite, in fact, also output cuts from OPEC Plus. Remember that in early April, OPEC Plus announced a surprise output cut. And Saudi Arabia earlier this month had announced that it would be doing it alone and also cutting some production.Nevertheless, you have seen oil year-to-date. I'm going to show you a chart here. For Brent crude, for example, this was in early April with that surprise cut. Well, it has fallen since then. So these cuts that OPEC Plus have done have sort of put a floor, try to put a floor on the oil market. But they haven't been necessarily that effective. And this is because of concerns of demand going forward.You also have Russian oil that has seeped into the market as well. That has put prices lower as well. So nevertheless, demand, that is what's going forward is concerning these oil markets. And you're seeing it also in oil related stocks. I'm going to pull up the XLE that Seana was mentioning earlier. XLE, the worst performer today year-to-date. It is also the worst performer, down about 10% year-to-date.And remember, this is a reversal of what we saw last year, where XLE was the outperformer, the best performer. And you can see tech and communication services this year taking the lead, guys.]"

The People's Bank of China recently cut key lending rates in order to shore up its economy. ""There is no longer any evidence of recovery in China, now that their exports and imports are falling.

The cut came on top of an OPEC+ surprise output reduction announced in early April.Recession fears and crude outflows from Russia continuing to make their way into the market are keeping a lid on prices.""Overall oil demand is still expected to grow during this year but could increasingly slow down in the following years, which could fuel downward price pressures over the longer term,"" Denys Peleshok, head of Asia at CPT Markets recently said in a note to investors.Oil related stocks slid on Tuesday amid pressure on the underlying commodity.

But Jeremy Bryan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Gradient Investments, says Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley could benefit from the AI hype. Bryan also lays out why he is not a fan of Molson Coors and Caterpillar.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]- Well, they're having fun. As investors, potential headwinds for the recent market rally. We're looking at potential stock opportunities and names to steer away from. And to do so we have Jeremy Bryan back with us, Gradient Investments senior portfolio manager. Jeremy, let's get right into this and start with your picks first, who are your faves?JEREMY BRYAN: What we're leaning towards right now is a little bit of a derivative play, if you will. It's Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. And the reason why we say that is that I believe that over the next year, pretty much every new company that's going to be introduced is going to have AI after it. And how these two are going to be affected by that is that I really think that we're at the bottom or bottoming process of the investment banking IPO cycle.And I think if you look at AI right now, it's really favored the incumbents to start, as your Microsofts, your Alphabets, those types of companies. Where I think this evolves to in year 2 and going forward will be new companies that start up that have technologies, services, applications around AI. And I think there will be somewhat of a frenzy to get out and get public as a result of that. And I think the beneficiaries of that are going to be Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.So from that perspective, they have good wealth management, traditional asset management businesses that I think are still going to be relatively healthy. And then a second wave coming from the IPO side, which should benefit them over the next two to three years, I'd be buying these right now.- Jeremy, what is it more specifically, maybe it might be that wealth management exposure there that you just mentioned. But what makes Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs better positioned in your eyes than their big competitors here like a city, like a-- what else do we have? JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, some of those other larger Banks?Story continuesJEREMY BRYAN: Very simply is less banking exposure. Is that they are not-- the Citigroup, Wells Fargo's of the world, a lot of their revenue, a lot of their earnings comes from the traditional banking structure. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, to be honest with you, Goldman Sachs failed at their traditional banking offering. Is that they're really pulling back from that and going back to what their core is, if you will.So that's what we want as an opportunity going forward is much more of that investment banking oriented wealth management side. While Citi and Wells will definitely benefit from those kinds of things, the traditional banking side is what we want to have away from to a certain extent to focus on. And Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs will just benefit to a greater degree from that.- Jeremy, let me ask you a leadership question about both of these banks. So Morgan Stanley, of course, we know their CEO is heading out. They haven't named a successor yet but, one, are you satisfied given that the trajectory of who's possible-- who's being talked about as a potential new CEO. And then of course, Goldman Sachs. They've been in the hot seat David Solomon being criticized for his handling of different things.And one of the things, of course, that Goldman is under the microscope about as is its role with SVB and possibly playing both sides of the coin. You have the government looking at them. Regarding that, does that give you any cause for concern?JEREMY BRYAN: Sure. Always cause for concern but it's more of a monitoring situation. Is that these are not companies that are brand new. By any stretch of the imagination, leadership can certainly have an influence and an impact on what their future trajectory holds. But really the businesses in the exposures generally tend to win out. And if they're truly destroying capital, there will be an adjustment that will have to be made at the top. And we're going to monitor it.We're going to pay attention to it. We understand it as a risk potential factor there. But really what we're buying is that business exposure. And generally these companies have benefited from those. And we don't think enough of their business has changed to really say that that's not going to happen in the future.- All right. Jeremy, let's get to some of your icks here, some of the stocks that you're saying to avoid. Molson Coors was the one that stuck out to me because quite frankly it has been a top performer since the start of the year. Why do you see that momentum fading here in the back half?JEREMY BRYAN: A lot of it has been a controversy from a competitive brand. That's why people have flocked to this in a market share shift. But really that's why we're looking at this and saying, I would not be buying here now as the stock has massively accelerated. This year alone, it's sitting at near five-year high valuations. And from my perspective, it does not change the course while market share could absolutely shift.They may be right in that regard. I don't know yet whether the long-term trajectory has changed or not, we'll find out. But what I do know is that the overall industry is still relatively challenged. The domestic US beer market is still not, what I would call a growth market by any stretch of the imagination. So from that perspective, that's where it becomes a little bit challenging, to say I would be buying here right now.And so from that, if you've made profit in the name great, good, I would be looking to maybe take that profit. And then secondarily, if I did not own a position, which we do not, I would not be looking to add here right now.- Well, you're certainly not contrary to the broader analyst list of where they stand. I mean, look more than half of analysts see it as a hold. So you fall in line with that. But let's talk about your other caterpillars on the list. Explain this one.JEREMY BRYAN: The cyclical trade might run a little too far too fast. That's really-- the thought there is that we've seen a mid-teens, I believe, rebound off of the recent lows here to where the stock has really propelled higher on just a hope that we're done with the fed or those things. But this is a heavy cyclical name and we don't think that that area is ripe for re-acceleration as of yet.And so from our perspective, it's just saying that this is probably not an opportune time to be buying into caterpillar. We think more likely there's downside in the future in the next 6 to 12 months to where if you want to own caterpillar for the long term trends of growth, whether China comes back and does industrial type of things or whether the US continues to build in the infrastructure, we think there's better entry points down the road than there certainly are right now.- All right. Buy the dip. Jeremy Bryan, thank you so much, we appreciate you as usual.]"

In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Salesforce.com (CRM) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this customer-management software developer is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Salesforce.com is 22.4%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 41.9% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 8.3%.Cash Flow GrowthCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Salesforce.com is 12.1%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 9%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 36% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 12.7%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for Salesforce.com have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 7.8% over the past month.Bottom LineSalesforce.com has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #1 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that Salesforce.com is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

47,5d84becb-837a-361e-b4ed-9faf31105ad8,CRM,2023-06-21,Brokers Suggest Investing in Salesforce.com (CRM): Read This Before Placing a Bet,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brokers-suggest-investing-salesforce-com-133006775.html,1687267806,STORY,['CRM'],"[Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Salesforce.com (CRM) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Salesforce.com currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.79, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 38 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.79 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 38 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 23 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 60.5% and 5.3% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for CRMBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for CRMCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Salesforce.com here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Salesforce.com, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Story continuesZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Should You Invest in CRM?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Salesforce.com, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 7.8% over the past month to $7.44.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Salesforce.com. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Salesforce.com may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Graco Inc. GGG, Ingersoll Rand Inc. IR, Crane Company CR and Flowserve Corporation FLS.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Finding Opportunities in General Industrial ManufacturingGeneral Industrial Manufacturing is a pretty broad umbrella and it would be incorrect to say that the current environment is supportive of all the players.After all, despite the pause in rate hikes, we do have hawkish comments from the Fed that there may be another 50 bps of increase to digest. The Fed doesn’t want to stop until it has achieved the targeted 2% inflation rate, but its wait-and-see approach is positive for the economy because if all goes well, the pause may come to a halt. At least that’s the hope.From the data currently available, we know that manufacturing PMI in May remains below 50%, an indication of contraction in the manufacturing sector.However, new orders data from the Census Bureau shows an increase for manufactured goods, driven by orders for military aircraft. Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, considered a proxy for business spending plans, rose 1.4% in April (latest available data), up from a 0.6% decline in March. This number has fluctuated in a close range since August of 2022, reflecting the prevailing economic uncertainty.Capacity utilization was 0.1% below estimates (and the long-term average) in May, but still quite strong at 79.6%. Manufacturing capacity utilization was slightly lower at 78.4%. Production increased 0.2%. Inventories increased at manufacturers by 0.5%, wholesalers -0.1% and retailers 0.1%. The numbers indicate an element of caution at manufacturers and distributors.Story continuesUS GDP growth of 1.6% in the first quarter was also an improvement over the 0.9% managed in the December quarter, according to the BEA.Therefore, overall economic conditions, a big driver of industrial manufacturing appears neutral with significant uncertainty persisting.The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) see a challenge with respect to the workforce. Given the rapid adoption of technology in manufacturing, there is the need to recruit more skilled workers and reskill the existing workforce. The skills gap can affect production efficiency despite available technology. However, adopting the latest technology holds the promise of improved productivity, efficiency, and quality, thereby leading to cost savings. Therefore, technology adoption should be considered a positive and will be an important factor deciding competitiveness going forward.Infrastructure development, whether public or private, increases demand for industrial goods. Therefore, the government’s initiatives to boost road and rail, energy systems, telecom infrastructure are positive for the industry. As regards private/commercial construction activity, there is an ongoing drive to complete projects, as unfinished inventory is still considerable. New starts are going slow in residential (for a number of reasons) and at a virtual halt in commercial because of plummeting demand.Overall, the manufacturing sector is undergoing many changes because of the renewed focus on reshoring, environmental factors, consumer preferences and government policy changes.Also, the supply chain issues that companies struggled with in the past year are moderating, with production becoming easier to that extent. Companies are also reconsidering the efficacy of a just-in-time model given these concerns.Here are four stocks from the industry that caught my attention:Graco Inc.Graco designs, manufactures and markets equipment and systems used to measure, move, control, spray and dispense fluid and powder materials. This Minneapolis, MN-based company with manufacturing operations across the U.S, Europe and China caters to end customers in the Asia Pacific, the Americas, and Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA).Graco has three operating segments. Industrial provides pre-engineered and equipment packages for paints, sealants, adhesives and other fluids to wood and metal products, automotive and vehicle assembly, components production, aerospace, construction, farm, rail, marine, recreational vehicles and other customers.

Contractor provides sprayers used to paint structures like walls and product models.In the last quarter, the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 21.3%. The estimate for 2023 has increased 10.9% while that for 2024 increased 8.1% in the last 60 days. At these levels, the estimates represent growth of 16.4% in 2023 followed by 4.5% in 2024.Ingersoll Rand Inc.Davidson, NC-based Ingersoll Rand provides mission-critical technologies in air, fluid, energy, specialty vehicle, and medical fields. It operates through two segments. The Industrial Technologies and Services segment offers air and gas compression, fluid transfer equipment and power tools. The Precision and Science Technologies segment specializes in pumps, gas boosters, automated liquid handling systems and other components. Some of the most important markets it serves include medical, life sciences, industrial manufacturing, water and waste water, chemical processing, energy, food and beverage and agriculture.Ingersoll posted a 25.0% surprise at the last earnings announcement. In the last 60 days, its 2023 and 2024 earnings estimates have increased 7.1% and 7.0%, respectively. Going by these estimates, analysts are looking for 14.8% earnings growth this year and 3.4% in the next.The shares carry a Zacks Rank #1.Crane CompanyCrane is a global manufacturing company based in Stamford, CT.

50,addea1da-107d-3196-943a-51caf171738a,FLS,2023-06-21,Xylem (XYL) Surges 52% in a Year: Will the Momentum Continue?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xylem-xyl-surges-52-momentum-170100351.html,1687280460,STORY,"['XYL', 'FLS', 'GGG']","[Shares of Xylem Inc. XYL have rallied 51.7% in a year, outperforming the industry’s 32.6% increase. The upside can be linked to solid underlying demand, price realization and improving supply chains. Shareholder-friendly policies also drove the stock higher.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s Aiding Xylem?Solid global demand across end markets is supporting Xylem’s top line. The Water Infrastructure segment is benefiting from effective price realization and strength in both utility and industrial end markets. For 2023, the company expects high-single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure.The Applied Water segment is gaining from commercial and industrial end markets. The company expects mid-single-digit growth in Applied Water. Measurement &amp; Control Solutions is benefiting from a robust utility end market, primarily in the United States, due to strong backlog execution. Also, strong price realization and an improvement in chip supply bode well. The company predicts the segment’s sales to increase in the high-teens for the year.Amid a strong demand environment, effective price realization and improving supply chains, Xylem’s bullish guidance for 2023 holds promise. The company expects adjusted earnings of $3.15-$3.35 per share. This compares with the year-ago adjusted earnings of $2.85 per share. XYL anticipates total revenues of $5.90-$6.00 billion for 2023, reflecting an increase of 8-9% on an organic basis.Xylem’s commitment to handsomely reward its shareholders through dividends and share buybacks are encouraging. In 2022, Xylem paid out dividends worth $217 million, up 6.9% year over year. In the first three months of 2023, it paid out dividends worth $60 million, up 9.1% year over year. The company bought back shares worth $52 million in 2022 and $8 million in the first three months of 2023. In February 2023, the company hiked its dividend by 10%.Will the Uptrend in Shares Continue?Improving supply chains and strength across end markets are expected to drive Xylem’s performance. While manufacturing activities have contracted lately, some market watchers expected a turnaround in the manufacturing sector in the second half of 2023. This bodes well for all industrial companies, and Xylem is no exception. The recent acquisition of Evoqua (for approximately $7.5 billion) is expected to bolster Xylem’s top line in 2023. Evoqua’s advanced water and wastewater treatment capabilities and exposure to key industrial markets complement Xylem’s portfolio of solutions across the water cycle. The acquisition boosts XYL’s position in water technologies, solutions and services and strengthens its foothold in lucrative end markets.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Other Stocks to ConsiderXylem currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks within the broader Industrial Products sector are as follows:Ingersoll Rand IR presently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system.

This means that both companies have witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.FLS currently has a forward P/E ratio of 20.25, while SXI has a forward P/E of 20.67. We also note that FLS has a PEG ratio of 0.93. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. SXI currently has a PEG ratio of 2.30.Another notable valuation metric for FLS is its P/B ratio of 2.55. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, SXI has a P/B of 2.71.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to FLS's Value grade of B and SXI's Value grade of C.Story continuesBoth FLS and SXI are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that FLS is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To skip our analysis of the recent market activity, you can go directly to see the 5 Stocks Under $50 Billionaires Are Loading Up On.The global economy has taken massive hits in the recent past starting with the covid-19 pandemic which was followed by the Russia – Ukraine conflict. These major global catastrophes led to supply constraints and other issues which ultimately led to inflationary pressures almost all across the world. The response across the board was an increase in interest rates by the central banks.The U.S. Federal Reserve delivered 10 consecutive interest rate hikes starting from March 2022. These hikes added full 5 percentage points to the interest rate prior to March 2022 and included four interest rate hikes of 75 basis points. In its latest meeting concluded on June 14, the Fed decided to hold off hikes for the time being with the possibility of two 25 bps increases by the end of the year.The increase in interest rates has had a significant impact on equity valuations and there has been significant pressure on stock prices in the past year or so. In times of adversity, it pays to look up to others that have historically performed well in similar circumstances. This is the rationale behind emulating the strategies of billionaires and prominent hedge funds.

On the flip side, we remain concerned about the current economic uncertainty, which continues to cast a negative impact on Align Technology’s dental procedures. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past year, Align Technology has outperformed its industry. The stock has gained 40.9% compared with the industry’s 24.2% rise.Align Technology’s first-quarter 2023 earnings and revenues exceeded the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. The sequential increase in first-quarter revenues reflects stability across all regions for the Clear Aligner business and a favorable average selling price (ASP) for the Clear Aligner and Systems and Services segments.Non-case revenues increased year over year, driven by continued growth from the Invisalign Doctor subscription program and the Vivera Retainers. During the quarter, the EMEA region witnessed an increase in Clear Aligner cases for teenagers compared to the prior-year quarter. This reflects the increased utilization and recent introduction of Invisalign moderates across the region, which outpaced the year-over-year growth rate of Invisalign First.Align Technology, Inc. PriceAlign Technology, Inc. PriceAlign Technology, Inc. price | Align Technology, Inc. QuoteThe teen segment, which represents the largest portion of the 21 million annual orthodontic case starts, registered 182,000 teens and kids starting treatment with Invisalign Clear Aligners during the first quarter. The numbers increased both year over year and sequentially.The initial adoption of Invisalign Comprehensive was well-received in the market. The company is confident about a largely untapped market opportunity for digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry. The company expects 2023 to be a crucial year for innovation.On the flip side, during first-quarter 2023, across the Clear Aligner operating segment, revenues were down year over year, primarily due to lower volumes and lower ASPs, including unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by higher non-case revenues. Invisalign ASPs for comprehensive treatment were almost flat on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to a product mix shift, unfavorable foreign exchange and higher discounts.Story continuesSystems and services revenues decreased 9.7% sequentially, primarily due to seasonally lower scanner volume. On a year-over-year basis, System and Services revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $5.8 million.The contraction of both margins is worrisome. Align Technology’s operating expenses reported during the quarter increased due to higher incentive compensation and continued investments in sales and R&amp;D activities.The volatility surrounding inflationary pressure and other macroeconomic headwinds continue to pose challenges for the company.Meanwhile, Align Technology faces significant competition from traditional orthodontic appliance (or wires and brackets) players such as 3M’s Unitek, Danaher Corporation’s Sybron Dental Specialties and Dentsply International. The company also competes with products similar to Invisalign Technology, such as products from Ormco Orthodontics, a division of Sybron Dental Specialties.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are CONMED CNMD, Merit Medical Systems, Inc. MMSI and Boston Scientific Corporation BSX.CONMED, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), has an estimated long-term growth rate of 19.4%.

To see more of these stocks, you can go directly to see the top 5 Tech Stocks Benefiting From The AI Boom.The world of artificial intelligence (AI) these days is overwhelmingly dominated by discussions on generative AI and its implications. Simply put, generative AI is a form of machine learning through which AI software can produce text, video, images, and more. Basically, generative AI can produce any form of content on the basis of prompts. This form of AI became more widespread and renowned after the launch of ChatGPT and similar generative AI platforms, which revolutionized the AI sector while pulling in major tech companies to become part of the AI race.This form of AI and its impact on the markets was discussed by Jim Stewart, a New York Times columnist, on CNBC's 'Squawk on the Street' on June 16. According to Stewart, big tech companies, especially those that are AI beneficiaries, have been leading the recent stock market rally. These include companies such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Stewart claimed that he was bullish on AI, especially considering the fact that this technology could boost productivity gains across different fields, including journalism.AI and the US Stock MarketIn May, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) joined the group of companies with valuations in trillions of dollars. Many financial professionals today are attributing the gains of the S&amp;P 500 to AI, primarily, with the focus being on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and other big tech companies that have begun incorporating AI and generative AI in their products and services.This overwhelming focus on a select few number of companies that can successfully play the AI boom and come out victorious has led to many investors worrying that the stock market in 2023 will turn into a selection of a few winners and a lot more losers. According to CNBC, the S&amp;P 500 has ""basically been the S&amp;P 7,"" a reference to the fact that only seven major tech companies have been calling the shots so far in 2023, leading the market to heavily rely on them and their gains.Story continues""You Are At The Starting Line Of AI""This reality has led many professionals and corporations to realize that the AI boom is very real and may be here to stay. Companies today will be bound to figure out where they stand in this environment and how they can integrate AI into their business models to reap the benefits of this technological revolution. NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO, Jensen Huang, in an address at the National Taiwan University in May, stated that we are currently at ""the starting line of AI"" and that at this moment, we should run instead of walking. The implications of his statement are many, but perhaps the most obvious lesson to take away from Huang's speech is that companies and individuals today shouldn't be slow to join the AI race - they should try their best to become part of it and ensure they don't end up getting left behind by their competitors.Keeping the above-mentioned market dynamics and developments in mind, we have compiled a list of the top tech stocks to consider investing in to play the AI boom. We included the obvious stock picks because of their contributions to this industry so far, but we also attempted to find other companies that wouldn't be the first to come to your mind when looking at AI beneficiaries today.10 Tech Stocks Benefiting From The AI Boom Pixabay/Public DomainOur MethodologyTo select our stocks, we looked at which companies analysts are expecting to benefit from the AI boom and shortlisted them based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter of 2023.

We believe these results highlight ORCL’s ability to effectively cross-sell and upsell apps and infrastructure, as well as the emergence of the company’s cloud platform as a competitive offering.”9. CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is an information technology company offering cybersecurity products and services. It is based in Austin, Texas.There were 72 hedge funds holding stakes in CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) at the end of the first quarter. Their total stake value in the company was $2.4 billion.CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.

CrowdStrike rebounded as its financial results eased demand-related concerns in its core endpoint business, while adoption in platform adjacencies continued to rise.”CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD), like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), is a tech stock that can benefit immensely during the AI boom.8. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 91Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was spotted in the portfolios of 91 hedge funds in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $4.9 billion.Based in Santa Clara, California, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a semiconductor company that operates globally.Joseph Moore, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, raised his price target on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) shares on June 16 from $97 to $138. The analyst also holds an Overweight rating on the shares.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a chipmaker that TD Cowen's John Blackledge has picked as one of his tech stocks to play the AI boom. This is unsurprising considering the fact that this June, the company revealed its new AI chip in its race with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). The new MI300X chip was described by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) as ""the world's most advances accelerator for generative AI.""Citadel Investment Group held 13.9 million shares in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMD) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“It is among what are considered to be the great technology companies, like Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel, that one is apt to see some of the greatest confusion between short-term financial results and share price movements, on the one hand, and long-term financial results. The former are exceedingly difficult to predict. Long term results are relatively easy to predict, because they are bound by the limiting realities of the business model. In the case of AMD, that is the business of being a large-scale semi-conductor manufacturer with a more dominant competitor that has a scale economy advantage.Here’s what people see, remember and act upon. In the past several years, AMD has been the best performing major technology stock. It’s outperformed Apple, Amazon, Google, Meta (Facebook) and Nvidia…” (Click here to read the full text)7. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a diversified software and information technology company based in San Jose, California. The company's flagship product is its Creative Cloud, a subscription service offering members access to its creative products.John Blackledge at TD Cowen sees Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) as a smart AI play because the company has begun rolling out new generative-AI content creation tools.An Outperform rating was reiterated on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) shares on June 16 by Kirk Materne at Evercore ISI. The analyst also raised his price target on the stock from $475 to $590.A total of 99 hedge funds were long Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $7.3 billion.Polen Capital mentioned Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“One area we are watching regarding Alphabet and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is AI systems and their capabilities, including generative AI. Interestingly, both Adobe and Alphabet could see benefits or threats from the emergence of generative AI and large language models (LLMs). Both companies already use generative AI to the benefit of their users in anticipating how content creators edit their work (Adobe) and in how search results are anticipated and generated (Google). At the same time, breakthrough technologies like AI can open the door to additional competition and/or impact a company’s profitability levels. We now see AI systems others are developing, including LLMs and generative AI offerings, that could be more competitive in the future. While we think it remains early days for ChatGPT and the capabilities of these types of LLMs and generative AI programs like DALL-E, the technology seems to be progressing at a fast rate and will at least require a strong response from incumbents.As of now, we believe Alphabet and Adobe are leaders in their own right in these areas and have a clear path to improving their existing offerings with AI advancements, which would allow them to be net beneficiaries of AI. There are also significant barriers to building leading AI offerings in these areas. As a result, our position sizes in Adobe and Alphabet remain sizeable. For Adobe, the status of its pending $20 billion-plus Figma acquisition is also uncertain. There is a good chance, in our view, that it will be blocked by regulators, which would mean the future opportunity to expand its offerings to the developer community (beyond designers) may not occur.”Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), is a smart stock pick to play the AI boom.6. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 131Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) may not be the first big tech company that comes to your mind when looking for AI plays, but with the company's new Vision Pro headset, some believe it may be getting involved in the machine learning space more than before.Analysts at Bernstein hold a Market Perform rating and a $175 price target on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares as of June 14.Our hedge fund data for the first quarter shows 131 hedge funds long Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Their total stake value was $165 billion.Holding 915.6 million shares in the company, Berkshire Hathaway was the largest stakeholder in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) at the end of the first quarter.Silver Ring Value Partners made the following comment about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Exited the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) put options position, as I came to the conclusion that I was wrong about the degree to which the stock is overvalued. While I still believe it’s optimistically priced, the fundamentals over the last few years made me believe that my initial decision to buy the put options was wrong.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Tech Stocks Benefiting From The AI Boom.Suggested articles:Top 10 Generative Artificial Intelligence Companies to Invest InHow to Play The AI Boom And NASDAQ Rally10 Tech Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Philippe LaffontDisclosure: None. 10 Tech Stocks Benefiting From The AI Boom is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

If you want to skip our analysis of how we ranked these games and want to dive directly into the best-selling Xbox games, head to the 5 Most Profitable Xbox Games in the World.Gaming has expanded the realm of entertainment, surpassing the boundaries of Hollywood and the traditional movie industry. With its immersive and awe-inspiring experiences, gaming now captivates around 3.24 billion people worldwide, thus redefining the term ""entertainment industry."" Throughout the last decade, the gaming industry has steadily outpaced its counterparts in the movie and music businesses in terms of revenue. In 2019, video games remained the most profitable entertainment sector, earning approximately $120 billion, a number that skyrocketed to more than $184 billion this past year. Currently a $200 billion powerhouse, the gaming market is constantly evolving, and technological advancements are opening new possibilities for game developers to create more immersive and engaging experiences through emerging technologies such as cloud gaming and Virtual Reality (VR) gaming.Calling the global gaming industry lucrative would be an understatement. According to a research report by Mordor Intelligence, the gaming market size is estimated at $245.10 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach approximately $376.08 billion by 2028, growing at a CAGR of 8.94% during the forecast period.The Big 3The gaming wars of today are just heating up as the battle over console supremacy is being waged by the Big 3 of the industry: Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY), and Nintendo. The Big 3 enjoy a significant edge over other gaming companies due to their ownership and operation of major console gaming platforms. While the Nintendo Switch stands out as one of the highest-selling gaming consoles in history, Sony's PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series X/S, both next-generation consoles, are fiercely competing for consumer acclaim. As of now, the PlayStation 5 has achieved an impressive sales figure of nearly 38 million units, while the Xbox Series X/S follows closely behind with nearly 22 million console sales. Both companies have their own subscription services as well: Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) Xbox Game Pass and Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY)'s PS Plus grant users access to a rotating catalog of games from a range of publishers and other premium services.Story continuesSince next-gen consoles are pushing the limits of consumer entertainment technology with an array of blockbuster titles, gaming companies are forced to engage in a fierce battleground for players' loyalty through platform exclusivity. Among the highly anticipated 200 upcoming video games spanning from late 2022 to 2024, Sony's PlayStation 5 had planned a staggering 115 releases, while Microsoft's Xbox Series X/S boasted an impressive lineup of 113 titles.At the same time, the mobile gaming industry has been picking up pace as well. Mobile gaming made up about 61 percent of the total market share of the gaming industry in 2022, with over half of the worldwide population projected to play a mobile game by 2027.  The lucrative market caught the attention of tech giants like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), who recognized its potential for growth. In 2019, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) made its foray into the industry by introducing Apple Arcade, a subscription service valued at $500 million. On the Asian front, Chinese digital giant Tencent is also among the top companies by gaming revenue due to its success with mobile and online games.The XboxMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s entry into the console gaming realm was marked by the launch of the original Xbox. Introduced during the sixth-generation of gaming consoles, it unveiled iconic series like Halo and Fable, which became synonymous with the Xbox brand. Additionally, this console revolutionized online gaming with the introduction of Xbox Live. The initial release took place in late 2001 in the United States, followed by a global launch in early 2002. With a total lifespan until 2006, the original Xbox garnered significant popularity, selling an impressive 24 million units worldwide before its discontinuation.In 2005 the original Xbox was replaced by Microsoft’s Xbox 360, but, even with a superior console available, many players continued to use the original in order to take advantage of the Xbox Live network. In an intensely competitive market, where the Xbox 360 faced strong pressure from the Nintendo Wii and the Sony PlayStation, Microsoft struggled to make consistent profits from its console. In November 2013 Microsoft released the Xbox One, a technologically advanced system that aimed to fix a long-standing drawback of its predecessor. With a larger and improved ventilated housing, complemented by more efficient cooling mechanisms, the Xbox One successfully addressed the overheating concerns that had plagued its predecessor. The fourth line of Xbox consoles, the Xbox Series X and Series S, the most powerful in Xbox consoles in terms of hardware, were released in November 2020.Several hundreds of Xbox games have been developed over the last half a century or so. With varying levels of popularity, features, and gameplay, it makes it a challenge to identify the top Xbox games in the industry. However, a metric of success that can be measured is the number of copies of a game that were sold. Let’s look at the top 15 most profitable Xbox games in the world.15 Most Profitable Xbox Games in the WorldOur MethodologyFor our list of the most profitable Xbox games in the world, we ranked the best-selling Xbox games according to the number of copies sold. What should be noted is that sales numbers for Xbox franchises can be misleading since players can subscribe to Game Pass and play many of the console's biggest titles without technically buying a copy. In that regard, and for the sake of clarity, we will be focusing on the most profitable Xbox games for the original Xbox console.

The security recently bounced off a May 26, 11-year low of $29.48, but still carries a 12.5% deficit for 2023, which may soon get extended as it's come near a historically bearish trendline.According to Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, Walgreens Boots Alliance stock is trading within one standard deviation of its 60-day moving average. The equity has seen six similar signals in the past three years, and was negative one month later 83% of the time averaging a 2.9% dip. A comparable move would place WBA back below $31.WBA 60 DayAn unwinding of optimism in the options pits could create additional headwinds. This is per WBA's 50-day call/put volume ratio of 3.62 at the International Securities Exchange (ISE), Cboe Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX), which sits higher than all readings from the last year.

WBA is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, backed by the strength of new partnerships. Progress made in the company’s all four strategic priorities sounds promising. The addition of Summit Health accelerates the build-out of Walgreens’ healthcare growth engine. The company’s long-term growth model buoys optimism. However, escalating costs and a highly leveraged balance sheet are worrisome.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 14.2% compared with the 22.3% fall of the industry and the 19% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned pharmacy-led health and beauty retail company has a market capitalization of $28.19 billion. WBA surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an average earnings surprise of 2.48%.Let’s delve deeper.Factors at PlayNew Alliances Seem Strategic: In April 2023, Walgreens entered into a partnership with the Dublin-based biotech company, Prothena Corporation. The collaboration aims to accelerate patient identification and recruitment for Prothena’s ongoing ASCENT-2 multiple ascending dose clinical trial.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the same month, the U.S. Healthcare segment of Walgreens and VillageMD announced the expansion of Village Medical at Walgreens into Colorado, with three new primary care practices, two in Fort Collins and a third in Longmont. In March 2023, Walgreens, in partnership with DoorDash and Uber, announced free, Same Day Rx Delivery of medications for the prevention and treatment of HIV. The latest offering is available to eligible patients within 15 miles of thousands of participating Walgreens retail pharmacies nationwide.Progressing Well With Strategic Priorities: In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, Walgreens continued to transform the method of delivering healthcare through physical stores and digital channels. The company has opened its ninth automated micro fulfillment center, now supporting about 3,000 total stores.Story continuesFurther, the addition of Summit Health is likely to be transformational for the company as it creates one of the largest integrated provider platforms in the United States, delivering quality affordable care for all patient populations, regardless of insurance or payer type. Summit will accelerate the U.S. Healthcare segment to scale and profit.Long-Term Growth Model Looks Encouraging: Following the announcement to acquire Summit Health-CityMD, the company raised its U.S. Healthcare fiscal year 2025 sales goal to $14.5-$16.0 billion, from $11.0-$12.0 billion expected previously. The segment is also expected to achieve positive adjusted EBITDA by the end of fiscal year 2023.Looking beyond 2023, the company increased clarity into its long-term growth algorithm, building to low-teens adjusted EPS growth in the fiscal year 2025 and beyond.DownsidesQ2 Negatives: During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, Pharmacy sales were affected by a 3.5% headwind from AllianceRx Walgreens. The International segment was also impacted by an adverse currency impact of 7.5% in the fiscal second quarter. Moreover, escalating costs and contraction of gross margin remain a concern.Leveraged Balance Sheet with Heavy Payout Load: Total debt at the end of second-quarter fiscal 2023 was $13.04 billion, much higher than the corresponding cash and cash equivalents of $1.09 billion. With a short-term payable of $4.2 billion, the company displays weak solvency.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Walgreens’ 2023 earnings per share has moved from $4.50 to $4.45 in the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $136.1 billion.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on June 27. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis largest U.S. drugstore chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.08 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +12.5%.Revenues are expected to be $33.82 billion, up 3.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.89% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Walgreens?For Walgreens, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.60%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Walgreens will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Walgreens would post earnings of $1.10 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.16, delivering a surprise of +5.45%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Walgreens doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company has also reduced carbon emissions associated with the electricity it provides to customers by 53% from 2005 levels. The Sustainability Report details the company’s progress in transitioning to clean energy while maintaining reliable and affordable natural gas and electricity service, as well as the company’s commitments to further strengthen communities and value the people that make up its workforce.""Xcel Energy is at the heart of our nation’s clean energy transition,"" said Bob Frenzel, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Xcel Energy. ""Guided by our customers’ priorities and enabled by rapidly changing technology, we’re driving toward a clean energy future, bringing reliable, affordable, increasingly clean energy to millions.""Xcel Energy was the first U.S. energy provider to set aggressive goals to reduce carbon emissions from the most significant ways customers use energy: for electricity, heating and transportation. In 2018, the company set a goal to provide customers with 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050 and reduce carbon emissions from its operations by 80% from 2005 levels by 2030.The company has begun to implement its Colorado and Upper Midwest energy plans, which outline the new energy generation, transmission infrastructure, and other resources it will develop to meet its 2030 goal. Xcel Energy also plans to exit from coal by the end of 2030 if regulators approve its proposal to retire coal operations at Tolk Generating Station in Texas four years ahead of schedule. To support the reliability and resiliency of the grid as this transition continues, the company is helping to incubate and scale emerging technologies, including demonstration-scale projects in long-duration battery storage and clean hydrogen production. Xcel Energy also continues to develop new transmission lines and in 2022 received approval for Colorado’s 560- to 650-mile Power Pathway project. The company has built more miles of transmission over the last 15 years than any other utility in the U.S.Story continuesThrough the clean energy transition, the company is reducing other environmental impacts of its operations as well. Since 2005, Xcel Energy has reduced water consumption from owned and purchased energy generation by 39% and air emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from its power plants by about 80%.Providing customers with reliable and affordable serviceXcel Energy continues to provide reliable, affordable energy to its customers. The company outperforms the industry reliability standard, restoring power to 94% of customers within 24 hours during major storm events, and maintains average residential electric bills 20% lower than the national average.The company is also taking steps to save customers money through cost-effective wind and solar projects as well as efficiency programs to help them save energy. From 2017 to 2022, company-owned wind projects saved customers approximately $3 billion through avoided fuel costs and earned tax credits.As high global natural gas prices drove up energy bills this past winter, the company expanded efforts to arrange payment plans with customers and connected more than 190,000 customers to assistance programs from both Xcel Energy and public sources in 2022. Those customers received a total of $216 million in energy assistance, a nearly 50% increase over 2021. Xcel Energy continues to work on policies that will enhance its ability to protect customers from future natural gas price volatility.Investing in people and communitiesXcel Energy continues to build and maintain a talented workforce that matches the diversity of the communities it serves. The company has increased female representation on both the Xcel Energy Board of Directors and senior executive leadership team and has also increased the racial and ethnic diversity of its leadership.New programs will help to ensure that all customers have opportunities to participate in the clean energy transition. The company’s transportation vision, for example, includes programs that will make it easier and more affordable for customers to own and charge an electric vehicle and access electric transportation. Xcel Energy helped customers complete about 4.5 million energy efficiency projects in 2022, and nearly 290,000 customers participated in renewable choice programs.Together with the Xcel Energy Foundation, employees and retirees, the company gave back to its communities, donating $15.6 million — up from $14.9 million the previous year — across the eight states it serves and contributing more than 74,000 volunteer hours for non-profit and community improvement projects. Meanwhile, Xcel Energy continues to partner with local economic development organizations to attract new business to communities, initiating 40 projects in 2022 with the combined potential to add $1.8 billion in investment and about 2,900 jobs. Xcel Energy spent $2.8 billion on goods and services with local businesses in 2022 and $1.2 billion with small and diverse businesses.Read the full Sustainability Report.About Xcel EnergyXcel Energy (NASDAQ: XEL) provides the energy that powers millions of homes and businesses across eight Western and Midwestern states.

That is because the Sep 15, 2023 $45.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Archer Daniels shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Archer Daniels is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Agriculture - Operations industry that ranks in the Bottom 15% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.58 per share to $1.54 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Archer Daniels right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Monster Beverage MNST, Ford Motor F and Chipotle Mexican Grill CMG.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:The People's Bank of China Matters: Global Week AheadIn this short Global Week Ahead, there are still more central bank decisions.The Bank of England is facing a stormy gilts market, whileTurkey's new governor is expected to ramp up rates sharply at central bank meetings in the week to comeThese should supply a fresh read on the health of the world economy.Key policy makers also hit the road, with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken just back from Beijing, and London and Paris hosting big summits.Next are Reuters’ five world market themes, reordered for equity traders—(1) U.S. Secretary of State Visited Beijing, China. Plus Other Events…The first trip to Beijing in five years for a U.S. Secretary of State yielded a modest improvement between the world's top two economies.Cautious optimism is in the air in London as well, where Western policy makers are gathering on June 21-22 for the Ukraine Recovery Conference to tackle issues from short-term financing, to long-term reconstruction costs.The event is held after the breach of the huge Soviet-era dam on the Dnipro river, which experts warn will have a huge impact not only on Ukraine but also on global food security.Meanwhile in Paris, the New Global Financing Pact on June 22-23 is the summit debut for newly appointed World Bank Chief Ajay Banga, who will be joined by heads of state from around the globe to discuss how financing, especially related to climate issues, can be structured for some of the poorest nations.(2) The Bank of England (BoE) Faces Steep Policy TradeoffsThe Bank of England could be facing its worst nightmare — an economy that's barely growing and the shadow of a 1970s-style wage price spiral.Story continuesEarnings are growing at their fastest clip on record, excluding the pandemic. The jobs market is tight, the cost of living is high and workers, both in the public and private sectors, are pushing for better pay to make ends meet.Add to that a surge in the government's borrowing costs to their highest since 2008 and the pressure that is putting on an already-struggling mortgage market and the central bank's position is looking unenviable.Markets show traders are placing an almost one-in-five chance the BoE will raise rates by half a point next week, up from near zero at the start of June. Even if the bank raises by this much, will it do the trick?(3) Lots of Purchasing Manager Indices (PMIs) ArriveA raft of decidedly hawkish noises from big central banks — including the Fed — has once again raised questions about how much central bank tightening is accelerating a global slowdown.Cue Purchasing Managers' Indexes (PMIs) from around the world that will offer a fresh look into demand trends and evidence of the health of the manufacturing sector in the United States, Europe and Japan so far in June.May reports showed bad news in many key regions. U.S. manufacturing contracted for a seventh straight month, as new orders continued to plummet amid higher interest rates.PMIs for the Eurozone in May moved further into contraction zone — another gloomy sign for the region that tipped into a technical recession in the first quarter of 2023.(4) The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Supplies Latest MinutesAfter back-to-back hawkish surprises at the Reserve Bank of Australia's past two policy meetings, investors will be keen to parse minutes from June's confab on Tuesday to gauge the risks of a third.Right now, money markets put the odds of a hike, or a hold, at a coin toss for July, but either way, by November at the latest traders are certain rates will be 50 basis points higher than now.With the cash rate already at a decade high, and RBA Governor Philip Lowe prioritizing reining in stubborn inflation over preserving jobs, recession risks are rising. May's blockbuster employment report could also provide more leeway for the RBA to tighten rates further.Investors in Australia need to keep a close eye on key trading partner China as well, where a post-COVID recovery is already spluttering and Sino-U.S. tensions are simmering.(5) Turkey’s New Central Bank Governor Supplies a Rates Decision on ThursdayAnother debut is on the agenda for Hafize Gaye Erkan, Turkey's newly appointed central bank governor, who hosts her first rate-setting meeting on Thursday.Analysts at leading investment banks expect her to start ramping up interest rates — currently at 8.5% — to anywhere up to 25% as part of a major reset of the country's economic policies. That is still some way short of the inflation rate, which dipped just below 40% in May.Investors are keen to see how deep and lasting those changes will be after President Tayyip Erdogan clinched an election victory in late May.Erdogan said his newly appointed Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek would take unspecified steps swiftly with the central bank, but that it was a mistake to suggest that he himself had changed his views on interest rates.Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) StocksI see three important U.S. consumer stocks made it onto our #1 list this week.(1) Monster Beverage:This Beverage-Soft Drinks company’s stock prices at $59, with for a market cap of $58.8B.I see a Zacks Value score of F, a Zacks Growth score of F and a Zacks Momentum score of B.Monster Beverage Corporation, headquartered in Corona, CA, is a marketer and distributor of energy drinks and alternative beverages.

Per this long-term strategic deal, Coca-Cola acquired an approximate 16.7% equity stake in Monster Beverage. Coca Cola also transferred ownership of global energy drinks business, which includes brands like NOS, Full Throttle, to Monster Beverage. In exchange, Monster Beverage transferred non-energy business to TCCC.Monster Beverage reports results under three operating segments:Monster Energy Drinks (92.4% of net sales in FY22): Monster Energy Drinks Segment includes the former Direct Store Delivery segments, excluding Peach Tea brand.

It manufactures, markets and services cars, trucks, sport utility vehicles, electrified vehicles, and Lincoln luxury vehicles.Until 2022, Ford had three reportable operating segments: The Automotive segment (contributed 94.2% to total revenues in 2022), The Mobility segment (contributed 0.1% to total revenues in 2022) and The Ford Credit segment (contributed 5.7% to total revenues in 2022).Effective 2023, Ford came up with a new operating model and reporting structure. As a result of this change, the business has the following segments: Ford Blue, Ford Model e and Ford Pro (combined, replacing the previous Automotive segment), Ford Next (previously the Mobility segment) and Ford Credit.Ford Blue's core focus lies in the retail sales of Ford and Lincoln vehicles, encompassing both internal combustion engine (ICE) and hybrid models.

With an emphasis on innovation, Ford Blue dedicates its efforts towards the advancement of Ford and Lincoln ICE and hybrid vehicles.The core focus of Ford Model e centers around retail sales of electric vehicles (EVs), along with service parts, accessories, and digital services for customers.

The Ford Credit segment deals with vehicle-related financing and leasing activities.(3) Chipotle Mexican Grill: This is a $2,044 stock also found in the Retail-Restaurants industry.This company’s stock has a market cap of $56.6B.I see a Zacks Value score of F, a Zacks Growth score of A and a Zacks Momentum score of F.A Delaware corporation, Chipotle Mexican Grill, together with its subsidiaries, operates quick-casual and fresh Mexican food restaurant chains.The company was founded in 1993 by Steve Ells who started with a single restaurant in Denver, CO. The company offers a focused menu of burritos, tacos, burrito bowls (a burrito without the tortilla) and salads. Chipotle restaurants feature free-range, hormone-free pork, natural chicken and other meat products cooked through traditional methods and served in a unique atmosphere. Chipotle classifies its restaurants as end-caps (at the end of a line of retail chains), in-lines (in a line of retail chains), free-standing units and others.Chipotle, being one of the most recognized fast-casual Mexican restaurant chains in the United States, had a good share of negative publicity throughout 2016 due to an issue of food-borne illnesses that surfaced toward 2015-end. As a safety measure, the company was forced to close several outlets. In order to chalk out a viable business strategy, Chipotle discarded its former co-CEO model and appointed former Yum! Brands' executive Brian Niccol as the CEO.The company is committed to using high-quality real ingredients, classic cooking techniques and distinctive interior design to serve customers. As of Dec 31, 2022, the company owned and operated about 3,187 restaurants across the United States, Canada, the U.K., France and Germany.Chipotle’s marketing strategy shifted from a promotion driven decentralized approach in 2017 to a more central model designed to generate higher consumer awareness and attract guests. The company utilizes e multiple marketing channels, including national television, digital marketing, social media, fundraising, events and sponsorships to reach consumers. Delivery services are mostly made by third party service providers.In 2018, Chipotle launched a loyalty program called Chipotle Rewards, which provides customers with the opportunity to earn bonus points or free food.

Southwest Airlines.The justices in that case said Southwest baggage handler supervisors are engaged in interstate commerce because they routinely load cargo onto planes that cross state lines.But on Tuesday, the 9th Circuit judges said they did not see how the Southwest ruling made any difference in Domino's case. All three judges cited a footnote in the Southwest decision that said the Supreme Court was not addressing workers who are ""further removed from the channels of interstate commerce or the actual crossing of borders.""""Both sides are arguing this is a slam drunk for them, but Saxon seems pretty irrelevant to me to decide this case,"" Circuit Judge Andrew Hurwitz said.Circuit Judge Barrington Parker similarly said that in light of the Supreme Court's footnote, ""I'm not clear what work we've got to do on this particular case.""Story continuesNorman Leon, who represents Domino's, said the Supreme Court's key holding was that the arbitration exemption depends on the type of work employees perform, and not on the nature of the employer's business.He said the 9th Circuit last year had focused on the fact that Domino's is in the business of delivering pizzas to customers, and not that the drivers were merely making local deliveries.Aashish Desai, a lawyer for the drivers, countered that their work was part of a continuous flow of goods across state lines.""Domino's has hired the big rig drivers [and] set up the supply chain,"" Desai said. ""Whatever brief period of time the goods sit at the warehouse is irrelevant.""The panel includes Circuit Judge Kim Wardlaw.The case is Carmona v.

In that same time, the Consumer Staples sector lost 0.73%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 5.36%.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Philip Morris as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be July 20, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Philip Morris to post earnings of $1.47 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 0.68%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $8.73 billion, up 11.41% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $6.20 per share and revenue of $35.24 billion. These totals would mark changes of +3.68% and +10.95%, respectively, from last year.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Philip Morris. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

Philip Morris is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Story continuesIn terms of valuation, Philip Morris is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 15.3. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 9.34, so we one might conclude that Philip Morris is trading at a premium comparatively.It is also worth noting that PM currently has a PEG ratio of 2.4. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. Tobacco stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 2.31 based on yesterday's closing prices.The Tobacco industry is part of the Consumer Staples sector.

But Jeremy Bryan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Gradient Investments, says Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley could benefit from the AI hype. Bryan also lays out why he is not a fan of Molson Coors and Caterpillar.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]- Well, they're having fun. As investors, potential headwinds for the recent market rally. We're looking at potential stock opportunities and names to steer away from. And to do so we have Jeremy Bryan back with us, Gradient Investments senior portfolio manager. Jeremy, let's get right into this and start with your picks first, who are your faves?JEREMY BRYAN: What we're leaning towards right now is a little bit of a derivative play, if you will. It's Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. And the reason why we say that is that I believe that over the next year, pretty much every new company that's going to be introduced is going to have AI after it. And how these two are going to be affected by that is that I really think that we're at the bottom or bottoming process of the investment banking IPO cycle.And I think if you look at AI right now, it's really favored the incumbents to start, as your Microsofts, your Alphabets, those types of companies. Where I think this evolves to in year 2 and going forward will be new companies that start up that have technologies, services, applications around AI. And I think there will be somewhat of a frenzy to get out and get public as a result of that. And I think the beneficiaries of that are going to be Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.So from that perspective, they have good wealth management, traditional asset management businesses that I think are still going to be relatively healthy. And then a second wave coming from the IPO side, which should benefit them over the next two to three years, I'd be buying these right now.- Jeremy, what is it more specifically, maybe it might be that wealth management exposure there that you just mentioned. But what makes Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs better positioned in your eyes than their big competitors here like a city, like a-- what else do we have? JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, some of those other larger Banks?Story continuesJEREMY BRYAN: Very simply is less banking exposure. Is that they are not-- the Citigroup, Wells Fargo's of the world, a lot of their revenue, a lot of their earnings comes from the traditional banking structure. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, to be honest with you, Goldman Sachs failed at their traditional banking offering. Is that they're really pulling back from that and going back to what their core is, if you will.So that's what we want as an opportunity going forward is much more of that investment banking oriented wealth management side. While Citi and Wells will definitely benefit from those kinds of things, the traditional banking side is what we want to have away from to a certain extent to focus on. And Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs will just benefit to a greater degree from that.- Jeremy, let me ask you a leadership question about both of these banks. So Morgan Stanley, of course, we know their CEO is heading out. They haven't named a successor yet but, one, are you satisfied given that the trajectory of who's possible-- who's being talked about as a potential new CEO. And then of course, Goldman Sachs. They've been in the hot seat David Solomon being criticized for his handling of different things.And one of the things, of course, that Goldman is under the microscope about as is its role with SVB and possibly playing both sides of the coin. You have the government looking at them. Regarding that, does that give you any cause for concern?JEREMY BRYAN: Sure. Always cause for concern but it's more of a monitoring situation. Is that these are not companies that are brand new. By any stretch of the imagination, leadership can certainly have an influence and an impact on what their future trajectory holds. But really the businesses in the exposures generally tend to win out. And if they're truly destroying capital, there will be an adjustment that will have to be made at the top. And we're going to monitor it.We're going to pay attention to it. We understand it as a risk potential factor there. But really what we're buying is that business exposure. And generally these companies have benefited from those. And we don't think enough of their business has changed to really say that that's not going to happen in the future.- All right. Jeremy, let's get to some of your icks here, some of the stocks that you're saying to avoid. Molson Coors was the one that stuck out to me because quite frankly it has been a top performer since the start of the year. Why do you see that momentum fading here in the back half?JEREMY BRYAN: A lot of it has been a controversy from a competitive brand. That's why people have flocked to this in a market share shift. But really that's why we're looking at this and saying, I would not be buying here now as the stock has massively accelerated. This year alone, it's sitting at near five-year high valuations. And from my perspective, it does not change the course while market share could absolutely shift.They may be right in that regard. I don't know yet whether the long-term trajectory has changed or not, we'll find out. But what I do know is that the overall industry is still relatively challenged. The domestic US beer market is still not, what I would call a growth market by any stretch of the imagination. So from that perspective, that's where it becomes a little bit challenging, to say I would be buying here right now.And so from that, if you've made profit in the name great, good, I would be looking to maybe take that profit. And then secondarily, if I did not own a position, which we do not, I would not be looking to add here right now.- Well, you're certainly not contrary to the broader analyst list of where they stand. I mean, look more than half of analysts see it as a hold. So you fall in line with that. But let's talk about your other caterpillars on the list. Explain this one.JEREMY BRYAN: The cyclical trade might run a little too far too fast. That's really-- the thought there is that we've seen a mid-teens, I believe, rebound off of the recent lows here to where the stock has really propelled higher on just a hope that we're done with the fed or those things. But this is a heavy cyclical name and we don't think that that area is ripe for re-acceleration as of yet.And so from our perspective, it's just saying that this is probably not an opportune time to be buying into caterpillar. We think more likely there's downside in the future in the next 6 to 12 months to where if you want to own caterpillar for the long term trends of growth, whether China comes back and does industrial type of things or whether the US continues to build in the infrastructure, we think there's better entry points down the road than there certainly are right now.- All right. Buy the dip. Jeremy Bryan, thank you so much, we appreciate you as usual.]"

While the bank may save money if highly paid staff leave, the exits have prompted concerns that Goldman is losing top talent. A company spokesperson said however the average tenure of the bank's partners had risen to its highest in a decade at 8.3 years last year, versus 6.2 years in 2010.Nicole Agnew, currently global head of consumer in private equity investing at GSAM, will take on expanded leadership responsibilities to oversee healthcare investing, according to a separate memo seen by Reuters.Jeff Bernstein and Adam Dawson will become co-heads of healthcare private equity investing.

You can skip our detailed analysis of non-fungible tokens and the outlook of the industry, and go directly to read 5 Best NFT Stocks to Buy Now. NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are digital assets that represent ownership of a unique item or a piece of content. NFTs utilize blockchain technology, which ensures their authenticity and traceability. While this concept had been around for a few years prior, it was in 2017 that NFTs captured mainstream attention and generated widespread interest through the launch of Cryptokitties, a blockchain-based game. It allowed users to collect, breed, and trade virtual cats represented as NFTs.NFTs are primarily bought and sold through NFT marketplaces, which serve as platforms where creators can list their NFTs for sale, and buyers can browse and purchase those NFTs. Some well-known marketplaces include OpenSea, Rarible, Foundation, and Mintable. Investing in NFTs can be challenging for amateurs as it requires a combination of research, knowledge, and personal preferences. The best NFTs for beginners would be those that are unique, well-executed, and have the potential to grow because the market is highly volatile and subject to rapid changes.In 2021, a significant surge in interest, adoption, and activity surrounding NFTs was observed. Numerous high-profile NFT sales and collaborations with mainstream artists, musicians, athletes, and brands captured broad interest and media coverage. One notable example was the sale of Beeple's artwork, ""Everydays— The First 5000 Days,"" which fetched $69 million at auction in March 2021. This sale made headlines and solidified NFTs as a viable platform for digital art. However, high-interest rates and inflation last year brought the sustainability and long-term value of the NFT market into question. In December 2022, NFT sales dropped to their lowest level since July 2021, as reported by Bloomberg. Reuters also mentioned DappRadar data in its report, highlighting that NFT sales fell to $3.4 billion in the third quarter of 2022, from $8.4 billion in the prior-year quarter.Story continuesDespite such performance last year, the overall NFT market showed signs of recovery in 2023. According to DappRadar, a total of 19.4 million NFTs were sold during the first quarter of 2023, up 8.5% from the previous quarter. The report also mentioned that the trading volumes climbed $4.7 billion during the quarter, showing a 137% growth from the preceding quarter. In addition to this, the development of user-friendly marketplaces and improved infrastructure contributed to growing sales. For example, Blend, a new peer-to-peer perpetual lending platform, made over $442 million in sales in May. Launched on May 1, Blur now represents 65% of the overall NFT market share, as reported by Fortune.The gradual rise of digital art and collectibles has fueled the growth of the NFT market. According to Market Research’s report, the NFT market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 27.6% from 2022 to 2032, gaining a value of $342.5 billion. The report also highlighted that the market was valued at $38.2 billion in 2022.NFTs also grabbed the attention of some major companies and brands. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) auctioned its NFTs for over $575,000 in 2021. Similarly, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) launched a limited edition of McRib NFTs in 2021 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of its pork sandwich. NIKE, Inc.

Although sales came in slightly lower than expectations, strong gross margins drove a solid earnings beat. MAT maintained its full-year revenue outlook but lowered its EPS guide to account for Fx headwinds and greater promotions and discounts on high price-point items. We remain encouraged by management’s execution on its strategy to grow market share, improve profitability and generate higher levels of cash flow. We continue to view MAT as an undervalued asset with attractive growth prospects, particularly with the reintroduction of the Disney Princess and Frozen toy lines, Trolls, the global launch of Monster High, and product support around the highly anticipated Barbie movie in 2023.”7.

In June, both BTIG Research and Jefferies Financial Group raised their price targets on the stock to $31 and $35, respectively.As of the close of Q1 2023, 37 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database owned stakes in DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG), up from 32 a quarter earlier. The total value of these stakes is over $1.1 billion.Baron Funds made the following comment about DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“We re-initiated a position in former Fund holding DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG), a leading online sportsbook, digital casino, and daily fantasy sports operator. DraftKings’ mobile applications offer consumers the ability to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and play hundreds of real-money casino games. The company has spent the past three years building a proprietary technology stack that improves the customer experience and delivers best-in-class breadth of bet types (such as parlays, same-game parlays, and player props). State-level online sports betting (OSB) and iCasino legalization, along with a multi-year consumer adoption timeline in active states, has supported a 90% revenue growth rate for DraftKings since 2020. The opportunity for OSB legalization remains significant, with under 50% of the U.S. population currently having legal mobile sports betting. We expect 65% to 80% of the population will eventually have access to OSB. ICasino is currently legal in just seven states representing roughly 13% of the population. ICasino product adoption in legalized states has been robust, with the average user spending twice as much as a sports bettor. While the pace of legalization for iCasino has been slower, we believe additional states will pass regulation in the coming years.As U.S. states began to legalize sports betting, the DraftKings management team moved quickly to build widespread brand awareness. DraftKings is the #2 operator in both OSB and iCasino by a wide margin, and has demonstrated improving market share trends across almost all states. When a new state legalizes sports betting, DraftKings has a first mover advantage as many of its customers are converted from the DraftKings daily fantasy sports offering. The quality of their sportsbook product along with increasingly targeted promotional spending results in strong customer retention and high lifetime values. In states where iCasino is legal, DraftKings can cross-sell OSB customers. DraftKings’ scale and product advantages are creating a flywheel that will enable the company to continue to out-invest the competition in acquisition marketing, retention, and research and development. The high barriers to entry are resulting in a consolidated industry that will eventually lead to a highly profitable business. This is evidenced by older-vintage state contribution margins that are already approaching 40%. Longer term, we believe DraftKings can generate EBITDA margins between 20% and 30% with strong free-cash-flow conversion.”6. Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) is a California-based IT service management company that provides a wide range of services, including cloud and cybersecurity. In the first quarter of 2023, the company reported revenue of $290.2 million, up 36.8% from the same period last year. Its operating cash flow for the quarter came in at $36.4 million, which represented 13% of its total revenue. The company also generated roughly $14 million in free cash flow.In 2021, Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) announced that its Cloudflare Stream platform supports NFTs. The platform allows users to host and deliver video content associated with NFTs. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) are some other major companies expanding their NFT exposure.At the end of March 2023, 41 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database reported having stakes in Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET), up from 40 in the preceding quarter. These stakes are collectively worth $774.7 million.Baron Funds mentioned Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We also added to Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) during the quarter, the leading cloud-based networking and software infrastructure provider. Despite facing a macro-driven elongation of deal cycles, the company reported solid quarterly results with 42% year-over-year revenue growth, while also guiding to 37% growth for 2023. The company’s speed of innovation enables it to continuously grow its opportunity set as it adds more products to its platform, solving additional problems for customers from network services to zero-trust. Its scale-based competitive advantages enable it to be the low-cost provider in the industry, while also having significant volumes of data to power its AI models and improve its product over time. Once it gets customers on board, Cloudflare is then able to cross-sell them additional networking and security solutions at high marginal profitability, as they are served on the same underlying infrastructure and thus the company doesn’t need to spend once more on customer acquisition. This creates a virtuous cycle that should enable Cloudflare to become an important part of the infrastructure layer of organizations over time, in our view.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best NFT Stocks to Buy Now. Suggested articles:12 Best Short Squeeze Stocks to Buy Now11 Best Health Insurance Stocks to Buy10 Reliable Dividend Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up OnDisclosure.

MAT is benefiting from solid contributions from the Hot Wheels brand and cost-saving initiatives. Increased focus on core brands and an expanding product portfolio bode well for the company.Shares of MAT have risen 9.5% in the past three months, outperforming the Zacks Toys - Games - Hobbies industry’s growth of 8.8%.However, this toy manufacturing company’s growth is impeded by inflationary pressure and the dismal performance of the North America segment.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet us discuss the factors broadly.Factors Favoring MATMattel’s Hot Wheels brand continues to impress investors with its growing performance trend. During the first quarter of 2023, gross billings at the Hot Wheels brand rose 1% (on a reported basis) and 2% (at constant currency “cc”) year over year. The company has been witnessing an improving sales trend for Hot Wheels and is quite confident about the brand’s long-term prospects.Using its Optimizing for Growth program, Mattel remains focused on achieving cumulative cost savings and enhancing its margins. The company is simplifying its organization structure and optimizing processes and supply chain to generate savings across operations. The program contributed $106 million of incremental savings in cost of goods in 2022. Mattel anticipates the program to deliver incremental savings of $96 million and additional savings of $300 million by 2023.Mattel remains well positioned for growth, given a strong product lineup, which includes core brands, licensed brands and lucrative product associations. In January 2022, the company entered into a multi-year global licensing agreement with Disney to develop and market the latter’s Princess and Frozen branded line of products. Built upon its existing licensing arrangement with Disney for Pixar Animation Studio’s Toy Story and Cars franchises as well as for Lightyear, the company anticipates launching the new products starting in 2023. Also, the return of Disney Princess and Frozen to Mattel’s portfolio is likely to boost strength and act as a growth driver in the upcoming periods.Story continuesFactors Impeding GrowthMattel is consistently facing pressure from increasing economic inflation, which is, in turn, affecting its margins and growth prospects. In first-quarter 2023, the adjusted gross margin contracted 660 basis points year over year to 40%. The downside was mainly caused by inventory management efforts, including higher close-out sales and inventory obsolescence expense, cost inflation and unfavorable fixed cost absorption. The challenging environment is likely to persist for some time.Also, the North America segment performed unimpressively, affecting the company’s growth trend. In first-quarter 2023, gross billings declined 27% (as reported and at constant currency) year over year. Per our model, net sales and gross billings of North America segment in 2023 are likely to decline 2.4% and 3.4%, respectively, year over year.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksMattel currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Some top-ranked stocks from the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL, Skechers U.S.A., Inc. SKX and Marriott International, Inc. MAR.Royal Caribbean Cruises presently sports a Zacks Rank #1. RCL has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 26.4%, on average.

Faced with vast geopolitical and economic uncertainty and complex family dynamics, the survey found that family offices are returning to a focus on core principles: making sure they have the right investing and governance plans, and the best strategies, to fulfill the family’s long-term goals, including:How family offices are responding to inflation, potential recession and geopolitical risks;Special considerations for direct investments;Interest and action related to environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing; andHow families are most effectively making decisions and preparing the next generation to manage the wealth.Geopolitical and Economic UncertaintyWhen asked about their greatest concerns, family office respondents cited inflation (24%), the possibility of recession (18%) and geopolitical risk (17%) as top of mind. While these concerns are not surprising given the current environment, they do manifest in a similar fashion: increased market volatility.Direct Investments and ESG InvestingFamily offices have substantially increased direct private investments at the expense of making investments through private-equity firms. However, at the same time, family offices have not staffed up with private equity professionals to evaluate, structure, monitor and add value to such direct investments.""Private investments are attractive for many family offices because of the potential for high returns, but it is imperative that they deploy the right resources to evaluate and manage these investments,"" said Professor Raphael Amit, Founder and Chairman of the Wharton Global Family Alliance and the author of the Wharton 2022 Family Office report.Story continuesIn addition, many family offices report that they are or plan to deploy capital to ESG investments. Even so, a significant number of survey respondents report that ESG investments amount to less than 10% of their portfolios. Hesitancy to act may be attributed to challenges in finding consensus among the family on investment themes. It can be hard to find agreement on what is ‘most’ important, as many families remain uncomfortable about potentially sacrificing returns, while others grapple with the best way to measure performance.Succession PlanningWhile succession is a normal, healthy part of every family’s evolution, succession plans are rare, with just one-third of respondents having a formal succession plan in place for either the family office or the family itself. Further, when there is a succession plan in place, only 37% of stakeholders are aware of the plan.""The risks inherent in avoiding these conversations and failing to prepare are immense. A well-planned succession process takes at least a year; the time to start is now,"" said David W. Fox, President of Northern Trust Global Family and Private Investment Office Services.MethodologyThe Wharton Global Family Alliance is a world-leading research forum created by the Wharton School and the CCC Alliance. Northern Trust and Wharton have collaborated on research programs spanning multi-generational, multi-branch families and their businesses since 2017.This report is the sixth in a series of benchmarking surveys that seek to develop a better understanding of trends and financial performance drivers of family offices. It highlights the latest knowledge and best practices that will benefit substantial global families.For the purposes of the survey, a family office is defined as a professional organization, owned and controlled by a wealthy family, dedicated to managing the personal and financial affairs of family members.The sample used in this survey spans 24 countries. With respect to assets under management, the majority of survey respondents have more than $1 billion in assets under management and represent families who own, manage and/or control at least one business in addition to the wealth managed by their family offices.Assets under management (AUM) managed by respondents, 51% have greater than $1 billion; 27% have between $500 million to $1 billion; 19% have AUM between $100 million and $500 million; and 3% have less than $100 million.34% of the Family Offices in our sample serve 1-3 households, about 23% serve 4-6 households, and about 43% of the Family Offices in the sample serve more than 7 households.More than 30% of sample Family Offices employ 4-7 professionals. Nearly 20% are larger Family Offices that employ more than 21 professionalsRequest the full executive summary here.Northern Trust Wealth Management offers holistic wealth management services for affluent individuals and families, family offices, foundations and endowments, and privately held businesses.

HQY has been gaining from its unique investment platform. The optimism led by a solid first-quarter fiscal 2024 performance and strength in Health Savings Accounts (HSA) are expected to contribute further. However, data security issues and a tough competitive landscape are major downsides.Over the past year, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has lost 9.5% compared with the 18.3% decline of the industry and against 17.1% growth of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned provider of technology-enabled services platforms for healthcare savings and spending decisions has a market capitalization of $5.34 billion. The company projects 22% growth for the next five years and expects to witness continued improvements in its business. HealthEquity’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average earnings surprise being 9.1%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Let’s delve deeper.Unique Investment Platform: We are optimistic about HealthEquity’s multiple cloud-based platforms, accessed by its members online via a desktop or mobile device. Individuals can make health-saving and spending decisions and pay healthcare bills, among other activities, via these platforms. These platforms provide users access to services HealthEquity provides as well as services provided by third parties selected by HealthEquity or its Network Partners. Among other features, HealthEquity’s HSA platform has the capability to provide users with medical bills upon adjudication by a health plan, including details such as the amount paid by insurance.Strength in HSA: HealthEquity’s total number of HSAs, as of Apr 30, 2023, rose 9.3% year over year. HealthEquity reported 556,000 HSAs with investments as of Apr 30, 2023, up 9.9% year over year. Total Accounts, as of Apr 30, 2023, were up 3.8% year over year. This uptick included total HSAs and 6.9 million other consumer-directed benefits (CDBs). Total HSA assets were up 10.1% year over year at the end of Apr 30, 2023.Story continuesStrong Q1 Results: HealthEquity saw solid top-line and bottom-line performances in first-quarter fiscal 2024. The top line benefited from robust contributions from all its revenue sources. The expansion of both margins was also seen.DownsidesStiff Competition: HealthEquity faces stiff competition in the Medical Services market, which is rapidly evolving and fragmented. The company’s success depends to a substantial extent on the willingness of consumers to increase their use of HSAs and other CDBs, and its ability to increase engagement and demonstrate the value of its services to existing and potential clients, Network Partners and members.Data Security Issues: HealthEquity deals with a high level of sensitive personal data and information. Any security breaches might result in the loss of sensitive information, theft or loss of actual funds, litigation or indemnity obligations to the customers. The company’s ability to ensure the security of its technology platforms and, thus, sensitive customer and partner information is critical to its operations.Estimate TrendHealthEquity has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for fiscal 2024.

PACB, popularly known as PacBio, announced a clinical research study with Radboud University Medical Center (Radboudumc) to explore genetic causes of rare and genetic diseases. The study is also expected to explore the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of using PacBio’s HiFi sequencing technology for routine clinical use.PacBio and Radboudumc aim to discover the genetic origins of rare and genetic diseases via collaboration.The latest research collaboration is expected to significantly strengthen PacBio’s global sequencing business.Rationale Behind the CollaborationPer PacBio’s estimates, presently, the genetic basis of 50% of rare diseases remains unsolved due to the lack of accuracy and depth of current testing workflows. PacBio’s management believes that the study, designed to make significant discoveries in medical genetics, will likely enable it to better understand the critical gap by using its Revio sequencing systems to identify key variants at scale with higher accuracy.Management also feels that the research, which has the potential to help revolutionize patient care each year, will also deepen PacBio’s understanding of the practical application of long-read sequencing technology in routine clinical use.Radboudumc’s management feels that by studying the potential consolidation of standard molecular tests into a clinical workflow with PacBio HiFi whole genome sequencing (WGS), the project would be able to explore PacBio’s technology as a potential first-line assay. This is likely to pave the way for a more efficient and effective diagnostic process in the future.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Grand View Research, the global WGS market was valued at $1,645.2 million in 2022 and is anticipated to expand at a CAGR of approximately 20.1% between 2023 and 2030. Factors like the growing prevalence of genetic disorders and mutations that lead to cancer progression and the possibility of identification and diagnosis of targeted diseases are expected to drive the market.Story continuesGiven the market potential, the latest tie-up is expected to significantly strengthen PacBio’s global business.Notable DevelopmentsLast month, PacBio announced its first-quarter 2023 results, wherein it saw a robust increase in its overall top line, including strong revenues from Instrument and Consumables.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the history of the entertainment industry, the American film and television industry, evolution of online streaming platforms, impact of Covid-19 on online streaming services and future outlook of streaming and go directly to 10 Best TV Shows of All Time.The entertainment industry has a long and varied history, with roots dating back to ancient civilizations. One of the earliest forms of entertainment was the art of storytelling, which has been a part of human culture for millennia. Theater and drama have also been popular for thousands of years and the ancient Greeks are credited with developing the art of theater, as we know it today. However, the global entertainment industry was revolutionized after the invention of the first motion picture camera in 1891. The first movie theater opened in 1905, radio broadcasts began in 1920 and television broadcasts began in 1928, but it was not until after World War II that television was widely adopted as a form of mass communication around the globe. American Film and Television Industry:The production and distribution of motion pictures and television programs is a nation’s most valuable economic and cultural resource. As we mentioned in our article 15 Most Watched TV Shows of 2023, the film and television entertainment sector in the U.S. provides $21 billion in annual payments to more than 260,000 local businesses across the country. The industry is made up of more than 122,000 companies located in every state in America, 92% of which have less than 10 employees. The film and television sector supported a total of 2.1 million jobs and paid $186 billion in total wages in 2021. The industry also provided $29 billion in public tax revenue and earned $14.4 billion in export revenues for the country in 2021. Evolution of Online Streaming Platforms: The global TV and film industry went through a paradigm shift in the last few years with the evolution of online streaming services. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) began as a DVD rental service in 1997, which allowed consumers to select and receive DVDs by mail. In 2007, the company expanded into online streaming of movies and television shows directly from its streaming platform. Now, after 16 years of redefining global entertainment distribution and even giving us some of the greatest TV shows of all time, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) currently has over 222 million subscribers worldwide, a market cap of over $200 billion and boasted a revenue of $31.6 billion in 2022. Story continuesNetflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) opened the door to a new entertainment distribution and production model and was then followed by other popular streaming platforms, like Amazon Prime by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Disney+ by The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), HBO Max by Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc (NASDAQ:WBD) and many others. Impact of Covid-19 on Online Streaming Services: When the entire world went into a lockdown during the Covid-19 pandemic, people could no longer go to theaters or cinemas and so online streaming platforms became an important source of home entertainment. In 2020, the number of streaming subscriptions across platforms crossed one billion worldwide. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) hit 200 million subscribers for the first time and witnessed a 47% growth in revenue from 2019 to 2021. Meanwhile, global box office revenues, which reached a record $42.3 billion in 2019, plunged by over 70% and reached $12 billion in 2020. This was also the first year that China overtook the U.S. as the country with highest box office revenues. Future Outlook of Streaming:It’s fairly clear that streaming is becoming increasingly popular among viewers worldwide. According to Forbes, binge watchers and casual viewers spent 35% of their total TV time streaming in 2022, up from just 10% in 2020, and they streamed an average of 190 billion minutes per week. In addition to increased viewership numbers, streaming services are also pushing for an increase in the number of subscribers. A recent example of this is Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) cracking down on its subscribers sharing their passwords with others. The move seems to have worked and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) had its four largest single days of U.S. customers signing up since it issued the alert. A report by Lightshed Partners has predicted that subscriptions for streaming platforms will cross 1.25 billion by 2024, driven largely by fresh content offering from existing providers, as well as new entrants in the market. With that said, here is a list of the best TV shows in history.30 Best TV Shows of All TimeCopyright: buchachon / 123RF Stock PhotoMethodology: To collect data for our article, we went through several different sources, such as IMDB, Rolling Stone, Reader’s Digest etc., searching for the top-ranking TV shows of all time, and picked the top 5 shows from every index until we had our list of 30 greatest TV shows. Then we ranked these TV series based on their number of appearances in the aforementioned indexes. If you’re also interested to read about our compilation of best movies, please refer to our article 35 Best New Movies on Netflix. 30. Chernobyl (2019)Chernobyl is an HBO original series that offered a brilliant dramatization of the horrors and chaos following the meltdown of a nuclear plant in the Soviet Union in 1986. With a 95% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, the show has 3 Emmys and 2 Golden Globes to its name. 29. Sesame Street (1969-Present)Sesame Street has always been a show on a mission: to educate and entertain both its young target audience and their exhausted parents through a mix of songs, sketches, and a voice that speaks to kids rather than at them. The show that gave us the Cookie Monster, is available for streaming on HBO Max, owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc (NASDAQ:WBD). It has often been regarded by pop culture as one of the best shows of all time.28. Rick and Morty (2013-Present)Although Rick and Morty is a cartoon show with its vivid splashes of color and its improvisational voice acting, it is a hilarious and original sci-fi comedy meant for a mature audience. Each episode is funny, smart and weird and gets you invested in its world and characters. It is estimated that a single episode of the show costs between $1.2 million to $1.5 million and most of this goes into animation and design. 27. The Office U.K. (2001-2003)The Ricky Gervais-led British show that inspired its more famous American counterpart, The Office, was intended to look as ordinary, as mundane and as unremarkable as possible. Instead, it is one of the greatest comedy shows of the 21st century and though it ran for only 14 episodes, the show’s cultural impact is immense. The Office U.K. is available to watch on PrimeVideo, by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)26.

Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009)The original Battlestar Galactica, which aired in 1978, only enjoyed one season, but Ron Moore’s more modern version of the show is one of the finest examples of a reboot one can imagine. Fans couldn’t get enough of the Galactica crew and their face-off with the Cylons, humanoid robots bent on destruction. The original series in 1978 cost roughly $1 million per episode, more than double that of a prime-time TV show at the time.24. 30 Rock (2006-2013)With an average audience score of 92% on Rotten Tomatoes, 30 Rock was a comedy sitcom on NBC, centered on a young Liz Lemon, currently head writer for a live comedy-sketch show in New York. The show is loosely based on the backstage shenanigans at Saturday Night Live. 23. Better Call Saul (2015-2022)Spin-offs rarely live up to the original show and so people didn’t exactly have high hopes when a spin-off of the legendary series Breaking Bad was announced. Better Call Saul has exceeded expectations and managed to be considered on par with the all-time great show it was born from. For the final season of the series, Bob Odenkirk, the lead actor, reportedly earned $200,000 per episode. Better Call Saul is one of the best TV series of all time on Netflix. 22. Atlanta (2016-2022)With a perfect 100% rating by the top critics, Atlanta is rated one of the best TV shows of all time on Rotten Tomatoes. Atlanta is a comedy sitcom that boldly experiments with tone, storylines and themes, making an unpredictable show that is different with every episode. Donald Glover won Emmys, both as an actor and director for the show. The show is available to stream on Hulu, a platform majorly owned by The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). 21. Lost (2004-2010)Lost is a sci-fi soap opera adventure, with humor, mystery and interesting characters galore.

The science fiction drama aired on ABC, the flagship property of the Disney Entertainment division of The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). 20. Fleabag (2016-2019)Fleabag is a British comedy-drama television series starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who portrays a woman living in London and navigating her struggling business and busy dating life, while attempting to keep her dark secrets from overcoming her. Fleabag is available to watch on Amazon Prime, the streaming platform of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). 19. Friends (1994-2004)Perhaps one the most popular TV shows of all time, Friends earned more than 60 Emmy nods in its time. The show revolved around the lives of six friends living in New York City and to this day, is still among the most watched shows in the world. Each of the six stars earned $1 million per episode in the 9th season and by the 10th and final season, they were earning approximately $1.6 million per episode. Although Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) hasn’t made Friends available to watch on Netflix US, it can be streamed in several other countries. 18. The Office U.S. (2005-2013)The U.S. adaptation of the Ricky Gervais-led British original, the show features the staff of a fictitious paper company called Dunder Mifflin, based in Scranton. One of the best comedy series of all time, The Office has a hardcore fan base and is still watched by millions today and is the biggest selling point for Peacock. When season 5 of The Office was filmed, the average budget was in the region of $250,000 to $400,000 per episode.17.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the utility sector and its outlook, and go directly to read 5 Best Utility Dividend Stocks To Buy. The utility sector in the US is responsible for providing essential services such as electricity, water, and natural gas to residential, commercial, and industrial consumers. Utility stocks are considered to be defensive investments as they provide stable dividends and exhibit lower volatility compared to other sectors. In 2022, when inflation was at its record high, the Dow Jones Utility Average lost about merely 1.4%, compared with an 18% decline in the S&amp;P 500. In addition to this, electricity sales in the US showed an upward trend in the US last year, showing a 3.6% year-over-year growth in the first eight months of the year, as we reported in our article 12 Cheap Utility Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.Many utility companies in the US are regulated by the government to ensure the provision of essential services in a fair, reliable, and safe manner. Regulators also oversee and approve utility rates and returns on equities. While utility companies may argue for higher returns in high-interest rate periods, regulators become cautious about approving rate increases as they could burden consumers with higher costs. Karl Dunkle Werner and Stephen Jarvis’research published by the Energy Institute at Haas showed that due to higher costs, utility consumers could potentially be paying between $2 billion to $20 billion annually compared to what they would pay. Moreover, electric and gas utilities tracked by S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights requested $12.4 billion in rate increases in 2022 through October. One reason for this is that utility companies often require significant capital investments to maintain and upgrade their infrastructure and comply with environmental regulations.Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) may aid in achieving this potential. According to a report published by Goldman Sachs, the impact of the IRA could lead to a staggering $11 trillion in infrastructure investments by 2050. The report further mentioned that by 2032, there will be a total investment opportunity of $2.9 trillion across different sectors for energy system transformation in the US. This translates to an average annual investment of $290 billion.Story continuesAlso read: 10 Best Electric Utility Stocks To Buy NowAs we mentioned above, utility stocks are generally considered defensive investments because of the stable demand for the sector’s services and products. This means that these stocks can be great options to weather this market uncertainty. Analysts are also projecting a bullish outlook on the sector this year. Timothy Winter, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, spoke with Forbes earlier this year and highlighted the significance of utility stocks in this clean energy era. He said:“Utilities are growing earnings at stronger than historical rates (5%-7% versus 3%-4%) as they continue to ramp up investment to transform from fossil fuel to clean energy. This requires new wind, solar, and battery storage as well as other new technologies (green hydrogen, carbon capture), upgraded transmission to move power around and handle intermittent wind/solar, upgrade distribution for solar panels, EV charging, and electrification.”Another quality that makes utility stocks stand out is their stable dividends. Nearly all utility companies pay regular dividends to shareholders because of their consistent revenue streams. Some of the best dividend stocks in the utility sector include NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES), and Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D).12 Best Utility Dividend Stocks To BuyHigh-voltage power lines.

FSLR stockSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comFirst Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR), a leading player in the renewable energy sector, is at the forefront of developing and manufacturing thin-film solar panels. These cutting-edge panels utilize their larger size to outperform competing technologies, yielding a higher energy output. This unique advantage positions First Solar as an ideal choice among growth stocks in the realm of renewable energy.As the demand for solar panels continues accelerating, First Solar is poised to capitalize on this favorable market trend. Recognizing the tremendous potential, the company is actively investing in expanding its manufacturing capacity. Consequently, by the second quarter of 2022, First Solar had already sold out all its production capacity through 2024, except for a new plant under construction in India.By 2025, the company aims to ramp up its annual domestic manufacturing capacity to 10.6 GW. Furthermore, it has secured long-term contracts to sell panels extending into 2026, providing significant visibility into future revenue.With one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry, First Solar can easily sustain its expansionary endeavors. Despite the substantial investments in constructing new manufacturing facilities, the company anticipates closing 2022 with a cash reserve of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion.This robust financial position grants First Solar unparalleled flexibility, enabling it to capitalize on the soaring demand for solar panels. As a result, it solidifies its position as one of the best green energy stocks and one of the high-potential renewable energy stocks to generate substantial returns.On the publication date, Faizan Farooque did not hold (directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

With governments going all in, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that the energy sector is booming. This means investors should be ready to bet on the new technology. In a few decades from now, we will see the impact of sustainable energy on our lives and business performance. It can bring down the cost of energy while building a cleaner and greener world. Smart investors should consider investing in sustainable energy stocks and make the most of their growth. We have already seen the rising demand for solar energy across Europe and the soaring utility costs mean that the demand is only going to grow. For energy companies, this is a million-dollar opportunity. They could also benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act, taking home big gains. The market is forward-looking and it has already factored in the ups and downs of the economy. With that in mind, here are the best sustainable energy stocks for sustainable profits. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNextEra Energy (NEE)The NextEra Energy (NEE) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.comOne reason I love NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is its diversified business. It mixes two energy businesses into one: a clean energy company and a utility. This brings consistency and stability in revenue. Using the utility segment as a foundation to grow the business, NextEra is expanding clean energy operations. NEE stock is trading at $74 today and is up 4% in the past year. It is one of the best green energy stocks for profit.Another reason to bet on this stock is the dividend. NextEra Energy has increased the dividend annually for three decades and this means it has enough liquidity to continue rewarding the shareholders. Its dividend has grown at a compound annual rate of about 10% in the last few years and if you are looking for a dividend stock NEE is one of the top energy stocks to own. It has a dividend yield of 2.52% and has recently announced a quarterly dividend of $0.74. The management aims to grow the dividend by 10% annually at least through 2024. It will also benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act since most of its projects are based in the U.S. The renewable energy division has gone from making losses to reporting a net profit in the recent quarter. Story continuesThe management aims to double the NextEra Energy Resources division by the end of 2026 and if it manages to achieve the same, we will see higher earnings and dividends. The company plans to add at least 33 to 42 gigawatts of renewables capacity between 2023 and 2026. This move will boost the company’s earnings while supporting dividend growth. NextEra is likely to live up to the projections and continue rewarding shareholders over the years. First Solar (FSLR)ESG stocks: Solar energy panels are arranged in a green field under a sunny sky. best niche energy market leadersSource: Diyana Dimitrova / Shutterstock.comThe largest developer of solar panels in the U.S., First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) primarily focuses on utility-scale panels. This is another company that is set to benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act due to its operations in the United States. The company recently announced that it will build a new solar panel manufacturing facility in the Southeast of the U.S. and will spend $1.1 billion on the factory. It also plans to spend another $185 million to upgrade and expand the current facilities in Ohio. Fundamentally, the company is in a strong position. Its net sales in the first quarter hit $548 million and the gross profit increased to 20% from 3% in the same quarter the previous year. With the country looking to achieve its climate change goals, we will see First Solar growing at a rapid pace. It recently acquired Evolar which is a manufacturer of perovskite solar cells. First Solar is set to benefit from this acquisition because the Sweden-based company, Evolar, develops the thin films that are used in solar panels, meaning this acquisition can speed up the development of the next-gen solar technology. If all goes as planned, this acquisition could define the future and make First Solar one of the biggest solar companies in the country.  The government is taking all the necessary moves to protect the solar panel industry, and First Solar is set to benefit from the same. FSLR stock is trading at $195 today and is up 34% year to date. The stock started the year at $145 and has significantly grown since then. However, it is down 11% in the past month which means it could be a good opportunity to buy the energy stock at a discount. Enphase Energy (ENPH)An image of a man walking toward a car holding a plug that's connected to the sun; solar power, EV, solar carSource: GOLDMAN99 / ShutterstockAnother sustainable profits energy stocks to add to your portfolio is Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH). The company specializes in solar micro-inverters, EV charging stations, and energy storage. In the recent quarter, it reported a sales growth of 64% year over year and expects sales in the range of $700 million to $750 million for the second quarter. Enphase stock is already priced at a premium and is trading at $179. However, with this stock, there is ample upside potential. It has dropped 46% in the past six months and its 52-week high is $339. The stock dropped after the firm warned about the slowing demand in the residential solar segment, but investors shouldn’t miss out on the EV charging market. This means the current range is a solid opportunity to buy this stock which has the potential to double in the coming months. The solar power evolution is at its prime and the world is going to need more microinverters that can create solar energy. Besides that, the company also has a presence in the EV industry as it produces Level 2/3 chargers for residential use. It will benefit the consumers who are switching to EVs and as the adoption of EVs continues to increase, we will see a rise in the demand for chargers. This is one energy stock with massive upside potential but investors will have to remain patient. However, Enphase stock will have a solid run and will pay off in the long term. On the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Beyond macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, our guidance further assumes that there are no material adverse developments associated with wide-spread public health concerns.1Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Measures table appearing behind the accompanying financial information is provided to adjust reported GAAP measures, namely operating income, other income (expense), net income before taxes, income tax expense, net income, net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. and diluted earnings per share attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc., for the impact of deal amortization, integration and business restructuring expenses, legal reserves, inventory donation charges and gains on investments along with the related tax effects of these items.The term ""free cash flow"" used in this release is defined as net cash used in operating activities less capital expenditures plus the collection of deferred purchase price receivables.In addition, the term ""internal sales"" used in this release represents net sales adjusted to exclude the impact of foreign currency, the extra week of selling results in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and the impact from recent acquisitions. Foreign currency impact represents the difference in results that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates the company uses to convert results for all foreign entities where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. The company calculates the impact as the difference between the current period results translated using the current period currency exchange rates and using the comparable prior period's currency exchange rates. The company believes the disclosure of net sales changes in constant currency provides useful supplementary information to investors in light of fluctuations in currency rates.Management believes that these non-GAAP measures may provide a helpful representation of the company's fourth quarter performance and enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for informational and comparative purposes and should not be regarded as a replacement for corresponding, similarly captioned, GAAP measures.Fourth Quarter Conference Call and ReplayPatterson Companies’ fiscal 2023 fourth quarter conference call will start at 8:30 a.m. Eastern today.

TSN faces headwinds due to a tough market scenario, marked by escalated costs and hurdles in the Beef segment.These factors dented the company’s second-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein the bottom line deteriorated year over year and lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Management also lowered its revenue guidance for fiscal 2023. This can be accountable to consumers opting for alternatives amid the inflationary landscape.A Glimpse of Q2 &amp; AheadThe company posted an adjusted loss of 4 cents per share, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of 81 cents. The bottom line significantly declined from earnings of $2.29 reported in the year-ago period. Most of the decline in profits was led by reduced earnings in the Beef and Chicken segments. Total sales were $13,133 million, flat compared with the year-ago quarter figure. The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13,602 million. Average price changes had a 3.2% adverse impact on the top line, while total volumes rose 3.3%.Management anticipates sales in the band of $53-$54 billion for fiscal 2023, flat to up 1%. Earlier, it expected sales in the range of $55-$57 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCost &amp; Margin PressureIn the second quarter of fiscal 2023, Tyson Foods’ gross profit came in at $527 million, down from $1,735 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The gross profit, as a percentage of sales, came in at roughly 4%, down from the 13.2% reported in the year-ago quarter. Tyson Foods’ adjusted operating income plunged 94% to $65 million. The adjusted operating margin contracted to 0.5% from 8.9% reported in the year-ago quarter.The company witnessed elevated input costs per pound in all segments except pork. Most of this was a result of inflated costs of raw materials and labor. The company also saw a decline in pricing due to lower outside meat purchases of chicken and decreased supply-chain costs.Story continuesBeef &amp; Chicken Unit HurdlesIn the second quarter of fiscal 2023, sales in Tyson Foods’ Beef segment declined 8.3% to $4,617 million. Volumes dropped 2.9% owing to reduced head processed. The average price fell 5.4% due to lower domestic demand and weaker export markets. The company continued to see increased live cattle costs due to reduced beef herd, which restricted supply.For fiscal 2023, management expects beef segment margins between a 1% loss and a 1% gain due to the deterioration of the current market scenario. For the Beef segment, U.S. Department of Agriculture projects domestic production to fall 4% year over year in fiscal 2023.Although Chicken segment sales increased in the second quarter, the macro environment remained difficult. Commodity prices for chicken cuts were quite lower compared with the year-ago period. Prices of boneless breast meat, tenders, and wings declined more than 50%. Further, the company saw a rise in feed ingredient costs. On its second-quarter earnings call, management stated that the key export markets remain closed due to the high-path avian influenza.Wrapping UpFocus on core strategies, such as driving growth across the core protein platform, bodes well for Tyson Foods. The company’s growth strategy is based on three main pillars. Firstly, it includes driving growth across the core protein platform. Secondly, it aims to fuel growth through its robust brands, which include more than 30 prepared food and snacking brands. Thirdly, Tyson Foods is focused on prudent international expansion.However, we cannot ignore the aforementioned hurdles, at least in the near term.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT and Meta META.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:As NVIDIA cruised into the stratosphere of $1 trillion valuations, one of the most common remarks heard across business and social media was “Oh my, look at that sky-high valuation!”There was first talk of NVDA trading at 100 times on a price to earnings (PE) basis.Then I saw posts about a 200X PE.Where were investors and journalists -- and armchair analyst-traders -- getting these ridiculous numbers?The Rearview MirrorMostly from looking backwards. Because when NVIDIA reported quarterly earnings on May 24, those looking in the rearview mirror ran off the road in bewilderment.Maybe they got scared by the “smart trucks” (large quantitative investors) accelerating behind them.But if they had only listened to me in my umpteenth explanation of why you buy NVDA at all valuations between 10 and 20 times sales, they would have been looking forward.For years I have said two things over and over again…1. Advances in Gaming GPU R&amp;D were teaching NVIDIA engineers what they needed to know to build the foundations of AI.2. Datacenter demands for AI “massively parallel architectures” would overtake Gaming revenues in the early 2020s.On March 20, I published a special edition of Zacks Confidential (ZC) where I outlined why NVIDIA was still the reigning “King of AI” and how the acceleration of, and access to, tools from ChatGPT had just put the stock back on the launch pad -- even though we already had 100%+ gains from buying the October lows.Here are some excerpts from that report titled ChatGPT: Time to Become an AI Conversationalist…I've pounded the table about the King of AI since 2016 for several reasons that all preceded the current gee-whiz fascination with ChatGPT -- including the emerging ability for software to write itself.Story continuesWhat I did NOT predict is that ChatGPT would catch on like wildfire this year and be the instrument that directly and rapidly teaches everyone the power of AI.Now, we're all talking about the ""super bot"" in awed, hushed tones, and wondering what jobs it can replace.In this report, we'll examine the capabilities, and the fears, of the chatterbox that ate the internet.What Was So Super About NVIDIA AI Before ChatGPT?First, we recap a basic 3-prong thesis for being awed by the power of AI, especially in the hands of NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang and his teams of engineering wizards...1) NVIDIA does deep research in nearly all applications of HPC (high-performance computing) and hyper-scale data mining and modeling that create the foundations for autonomous driving, protein and molecule discovery, factory design and automation, and the future of scientific discoveries in cancer, energy, agriculture, longevity, and climate.And they are able to do this because they don't just build the hardware GPU (graphics processing unit) semiconductors that make hyper-scale possible. They also build the software engines that integrate with them in a full stack of developer tools called CUDA, for Compute Unified Device Architecture. Along with work at Alphabet and Microsoft, these are the most powerful platforms in the world that can use neural networks to create machine learning (ML) reinforcement and deep learning (DL) inference.For these reasons, I continuously encourage investors -- whether they own NVDA shares or not -- to frequent the company's newsroom page to see the constant stream of innovations, discoveries, and partnerships that make the industry of AI as powerful as any for business, science, and society.2) Jensen Huang and his superior leadership strategy is not only focused on hiring the best engineering talent, but they also collaborate with major scientific institutions and technology companies to put the best tools in the smartest, most(ly) ethical hands. They build the most powerful supercomputers in the world for these organizations by stacking and connecting hundreds of their GPU-based DGX machines, as one example, to create ""massively parallel architectures"" vs. the slower serial-processing of CPUs from Intel.Plus, they know how to evangelize the platform technologies of AI by supporting developer communities where new ideas and solutions will be created at ground level that we haven't even imagined.3) The day that software can meaningfully write itself is nearly upon us. I've written often about Ray Kurzweil's ""singularity"" prediction -- when AGI (artificial general intelligence) becomes equivalent (or superior) to human intelligence -- and he may be getting ready to pull that forecast forward again, from his original target for the year 2045.(end of excerpt from my March 20th Zacks Confidential)In that report, I said that investors still needed to buy the stock at $250 then, looking for at least $300 this year -- despite semiconductor analyst Joe Moore at Morgan Stanley reluctantly raising his price target to $300.Little did he or I know that Jensen &amp; Co. would blow the roof off with a big raise in sales guidance on May 24. But I want to share what he said because, at the time, he was very prescient about the NVDA + GPT growth potential -- even though he was a reluctant diner and I was devouring the feast of possibilities with years of high double-digit compound growth ahead as AI surpasses the mobile industry revolution with a potential TAM (total addressable market) of $15 trillion…Network Effects and Exponential CompoundingLast Friday (3/17/23), a Morgan Stanley analyst threw in the towel on his Neutral rating for NVDA and wrote ""The stock will continue to be hard to ignore in an otherwise challenging semiconductor environment.""Analyst Joseph Moore raised his rating on NVDA shares to Overweight from Equal-Weight and bumped his price target from $255 to $304 as he conceded that he underestimated the growth resilience of the innovator's products and admitted that the ""megatrend"" of generative AI will overshadow all doubts.""The high capital intensity of these workloads, particularly on the training side, is now a major part of the calculus for the largest companies in technology, with NVIDIA having dominance in the training market that is likely to persist for several years even with a relatively fixed number of model developers, model complexity plus multiple languages should still drive 3-5x growth in training over 5 years.""Moore also observed that the enthusiasm the firm is seeing for Large Language Models is boosting spending both in the near and long-term. In fact, NVDA just filed a securities shelf offering for $10 billion two weeks ago and, since the stock barely flinched, maybe that's what moved the analyst to admit how dominant their position will remain with new investment. Large enterprise customers who depend on data ""mining and modeling"" will want what Jensen is building for many years to come.As his final mea culpa, Moore noted that ""the power of transformers has become clear as products such as ChatGPT and other AI workloads have moved up priority lists and are now seen as one of the most significant developments in technology since the development of mobile internet.""How Forward Estimate Revisions Leave Behind the Backward BearsIn my full ZC on ChatGPT, which you can get a copy of by emailing Ultimate@Zacks.com -- and tell ‘em Cooker sent you -- I explain the dynamics of “GPT” (Generative Pre-Training Transformers) and I give you 4 other stock picks to capitalize on the revolution that is being televised in real-time.But now let’s get to the goodness of what analysts have done with sales and earnings estimates since Jensen &amp; Co. dropped their “demand-driven” bomb.Here’s how I described the situation in TAZR Trader on May 24…NVIDIA: It's the TAM, Stupid!Posted on 5/24/23TAZR Traders""How extremely stupid not to have thought of that.""Thomas Henry Huxley, upon hearing of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selectionNVIDIA blew some doors off tonight -- and not just for the bears.Yes, they raised guidance significantly. But so many investors and amateur analysts are still grappling to understand the significance of this juggernaut that I have called the King of AI for 6 years...Get Your ""MPA"" in Deep LearningMarch, 2017NVIDIA Gaming Drives the Deep Learning-AI RevolutionAugust 21, 2018Who Cares NVIDIA Makes Great Gaming Graphics?August 23, 2018And there are still so many amateurs who never understood those drivers then (or even yesterday) and still try to sound like experts now -- heck, they didn't even know what ""CUDA"" stood for last year!ChatGPT and NVDA shares' meteoric rise have made them all very interested ""experts"" now.And I bet they still didn't know tonight what Ampere, or Hopper, or Lovelace are. We know because we talk about them and I'm writing a book about ""13 Great Women of Science"" which includes Madames Hopper and Lovelace!Nor do they understand a DGX, or a ""petaflop,"" much less a ""massively parallel architecture"" used for deep learning training and inference.It's almost comical, if it weren't so sad. Next, when CRISPR stocks go meteor, they'll be all about them too.Anyway, my point is to be careful about the analysis you hear over the next few days and weeks as the arm-chair AI experts tell you why or why not NVDA shares should trade at any given valuation of 100X or 200X EPS.As you know, I've traded NVDA from extreme valuations of 5X sales (realllly cheap) up to 30X sales (pretttty expensive).And as I told our internal strategy group tonight in a chat...""P/E for NVDA doesn't matter as they dominate a TAM (total addressable market) that is hard to calculate right now. Is it $300 billion? $500B? (Some projections are for $2 trillion by 2030 and I think that is conservative.) So it can grow into a 20X sales valuation for a while. Imagine the transition from datacenters that were CPU-centric (serial processing) and devoid of software for training &amp; inference. GPU A100 and H100 cards set the standard now as massively parallel architectures in DGX machines (8 cards with 50+ billion transistors). The one they built for Tesla that does 1.8 exaflops stacks hundreds of DGX boxes (basically a 2-foot cube). Every corp will want one now. That's tens of thousands of $68,000 machines. CUDA has been the development platform they didn't know they needed for design, engineering, data crunching and simulation.""What do we mean when we talk about doing a billion or a trillion calculations per second?Just like a million million equals a trillion, so too a billion billion equals a quintillion.Coming to terms: FLOP stands for ""floating point operations per second."" An exaflop is a measure of performance for a supercomputer that can calculate at least 10 to the 18th power, or one quintillion, FLOPS.In mid 2022, CEO Jensen Huang guesstimated a TAM for NVIDIA of $300 billion in hardware and $300 billion in software. This is the defining projection for the CUDA hard+soft stack I've been preaching about for 6 years.I think Jensen has been so conservative because it would blow the minds of even professional analysts to think about what is possible.Imagine NVDA growing to just 3X a $600 billion TAM where it would still be the dominant player...That would be a $1.5 trillion valuation minimum. See you soon above $1T.(end of May 24 TAZR commentary excerpt)Architect of the AI SupercomputerI used to talk 5 years ago about how much NVIDIA’s revenue could grow as they sold DGX boxes for $68,000. That’s the “mini” supercomputer in a 2-cubic foot space with 400 to 500 billion transistors for machine learning (ML)  applications -- depending on what generation of GPU card is used, from Volta to Ampere to Hopper. The A100 system-on-a-chip GPU costs $10,000 each.A single DGX box is capable of massive computing power of between 1 to 5 petaFLOPS. A petaFLOP is a billion million floating point operations per second, so you can imagine how many you need to build a supercomputer like the one at Tesla.Here’s a good description from software consulting firm Run:ai of what a user gets for their investment in a single DGX box…“Beyond the powerful hardware they provide, DGX systems come out of the box with an optimized operating system and a complete pre-integrated environment for running deep learning projects. They provide a containerized software architecture that lets data scientists easily deploy the deep learning frameworks and management tools they need with minimal setup or configuration.”To build a corporate, university, or scientific R&amp;D lab supercomputer, you need between 100 and 1,000 of these dynamic cubes, “stacked” together to form “massively parallel architectures.”Now a DGX box costs anywhere from $100,000 to $150,000. Not to mention the value-enriching capabilities of the full CUDA hardware+software stack.And every major enterprise wants 100 to 1,000 of them now that ChatGPT took center stage. They either need to capitalize on the “chatterbox that ate the internet,” or exceed it.THIS is the math you need to understand to grasp how and why Wall Street analysts underestimated NVIDIA sales potential, even after ChatGPT.And they are just catching up with these potential topline moves…Fiscal year 2024 (ends January ‘24): $42.64 billion = 58% growthFiscal year 2025 (ends January ‘25): $54.70 billion = 28% growthThese are dramatic turnarounds from where revenue projections were only a few months ago when I wrote my ChatGPT report.Back in mid-March, FY24 sales were cast at around $30 billion and FY25 was around $37 billion. But you were already starting to see the optimism being expressed in those 12-24 months forward estimates as ChatGPT caught like wildfire and NVIDIA was inking deals left and right with partners like Microsoft.In fact, the day I published that ChatGPT report on March 20 was the start of the greatest computing event of the year, the NVIDIA GPU Tech Conference, or GTC. Jensen &amp; Co. are always full of surprises that wow the tech crowd and this was no disappointment.NVIDIA launched DGX Cloud, where users can rent access for $37,000 per month. And they unveiled DGX GH200, a large-memory AI supercomputer that uses NVIDIA NVLink to combine up to 256 NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips into a single data-center sized GPU. Google Cloud, Meta and Microsoft are already the first customers.This was one of the primary drivers in the dramatic leap in sales estimates for this year and next.What Price-to-Sales Valuation Do We Have Now?On current-year estimates we have $1 trillion/$42 billion = 23.8 times.On next year estimates of $55 billion, we have 18X.To me, that’s a BUY based on everything I’ve presented.Regarding misplaced P/E ratios, when NVDA EPS FY25 estimates were at only $6 a month ago (before their quarterly report), the stock was trading at 50X EPS.Then when shares launched above $400 after earnings on May 24, allMay the valuation hand-wringers started screaming about 100X and even 200X earnings. But, again, they were looking backwards at trailing EPS. In the worst possible view of earnings, some are looking at fully-diluted TTM (trailing 12 months) EPS of $2.19. In the best possible TTM view, they are using around $3.35 non-GAAP.Right now, the FY24 EPS consensus is for $7.64 and FY25 is over $10, putting the forward PE somewhere around 50 times.For a conservative view of these numbers, let’s hear from analysts at Stifel Nicolaus where they have a $370 price target and Hold rating on shares…“We continue to view NVDA as amongst the best-positioned companies to benefit from accelerated AI-focused spending. With shares trading well above the company's 5-year average multiple on a forward earnings basis at 54.2x our F2024 EPS estimate and 50.4x our F2025 estimate, versus average multiples of 42x and 35x, respectively, we believe strong near-term momentum is well understood.”I’m not saying NVDA is cheap. But the world has finally woken up to its AI potential and you may never get the chance to buy it at 10X sales again. Maybe 15X sales during a correction, or after an earnings miss. So don't blink if you see a $750billion market cap. Just buy.Bear of the Day:In early April, the Zacks Rank pegged Tyson Foods as a candidate for lower share prices as earnings estimates fell ahead of their quarterly report on May 8.My colleague Andrew Rocco wrote about TSN slipping into the cellar of the Zacks Rank on April 10 when shares were trading above $60 and he identified several fundamental trends that led analysts to lower their estimates for the chicken products giant.One area of weaker growth surprised me: beef. I didn't know that this segment was bigger for Tyson than its chicken sales. Here's how Andrew summed it up in April...""Meanwhile, last quarter, earnings growth was an abysmal -70% year-over-year. The company's lagging beef segment is one factor dragging down Tyson’s growth. In Q1, Tyson’s beef segment declined from $5,002 million to $4,723 million. The slowdown is not isolated to Tyson – the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) projects fiscal 2023 domestic production to fall roughly 5% in the segment.""Earnings Confirm the SlowdownOn May 8 Tyson Foods came out with a quarterly loss of $0.04 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.81. This compares to earnings of $2.29 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -104.94%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this meat producer would post earnings of $1.35 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.85, delivering a surprise of -37.04%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.Tyson, which belongs to the Zacks Food - Meat Products industry, posted revenues of $13.13 billion for the quarter ended March 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.45%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $13.12 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.Zacks Rank Nails the DropWhen Andrew wrote his report in April, analysts had lowered consensus EPS from $4.18 to $2.21, and this dramatic drop in estimates put TSN into the Zacks #5 Rank cellar.Since the May report (for Tyson's Q2 of fiscal year 2023, ending in September), the consensus has now fallen to $1.48 after that big earnings miss and lowered guidance. This keeps TSN shares at a #5 Rank Strong Sell.The stock is also still over 20% lower from April levels. Another interesting dynamic is that the stock is well off of its early 2022 peak near $100 since the bear market began.The reason I find this interesting is that while inflation drove food prices higher for consumers, the producers clearly were hit with higher costs that they couldn't pass along to distributors.This was something that Andrew also identified in his discussion of declining profit margins for Tyson.Quarter BreakdownTyson management also lowered its revenue guidance for fiscal 2023. This can be accountable to consumers opting for alternatives amid the inflationary landscape, per media sources.Despite a tough protein market, Tyson Foods has been optimistic about its long-term prospects due to its growth strategies and focus on enhancing margins.Total Q2 sales were $13,133 million, nearly flat with the year-ago quarter figure. The top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13,602 million. Average price changes had a 3.2% adverse impact on the top line, while total volumes rose 3.3%.The gross profit in the quarter came in at $527 million, down from the $1,735 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The gross profit, as a percentage of sales, came in at roughly 4%, down from the 13.2% reported in the year-ago quarter.Tyson Foods’ adjusted operating income plunged 94% to $65 million. The adjusted operating margin contracted to 0.5% from the 8.9% reported in the year-ago quarter.Segmental DetailsBeef: Sales in the segment declined to $4,617 million from the $5,034 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Volumes dropped 2.9% and the average price fell 5.4% in the segment.Pork: Sales in the segment declined to $1,421 million from the $1,565 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Volumes climbed 1.1%, while the average price tumbled 10.3%.Chicken: Sales in the segment increased to $4,430 million from the $4,086 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Sales volumes rose 6.4% and the average price increased 2%.Prepared Foods: Sales in the segment rose to $2,422 million from the $2,393 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Prepared Foods’ sales volumes dipped 0.4% and the average price increased 1.6%.International/Other: Sales in the segment were $634 million, up from the $565 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Volumes moved up 8% and the average sales price jumped 4.2%.Bottom line on Tyson: While US chicken consumption is expected to rise to over 100 lbs per capita in this decade, producers face headwinds from rising costs, meat alternatives, and other healthy and/or sustainable choices.

131,4d8fc6ee-597a-378b-9aad-45bc2c4bff4a,MA,2023-06-21,"When We Connect Women Entrepreneurs to Capital, the Whole World Wins",ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/connect-women-entrepreneurs-capital-whole-200200758.html,1687291320,STORY,['MA'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / June 20, 2023 / MastercardMastercard, Tuesday, June 20, 2023, Press release pictureIn rural Brazil, a group of women banded together to gather a wild chestnut called baru. When they had little luck selling the nuts as a snack in local markets, they came up with a plan to turn their harvest into a base for a dark, frothy Guinness-like beer. Despite their ingenuity and hard work ethic, the women were missing a key ingredient for success: access to capital needed for equipment and to distribute their first batch.The plight of this baru cooperative is common for women entrepreneurs around the world, whether it's a simple one-woman operation or a hot tech startup with growth potential, women-owned firms are plagued by funding challenges.Companies with only female founders raised just 2.2% of all venture funding in the first eight months of 2021, according to an analysis by Crunchbase; this is lower than any of the five previous calendar years. Historically, women entrepreneurs are less likely to get approved for bank loans and are often subject to higher interest rates and smaller loan amounts. In developing economies, women-owned businesses make up 23% of micro, small and medium-size businesses but account for 32% of the overall financing gap.Women entrepreneurs also do not always have banking services or digital tools, which can help grow an informal cash-based business into one with a larger financial footprint. While the proliferation of mobile money in sub-Saharan Africa has boosted financial inclusion for women, the gender gap in account ownership in developing economies overall has fallen but stands at 6%, according to the World Bank, and 740 million women - equivalent to 13% of the world's adults - still do not have a bank or mobile money account.Nevertheless, there's a significant upside to supporting women-led businesses.On a larger scale, attaining economic parity for women could add $12 trillion to the world economy, according to the World Economic Forum. If women were able to participate in entrepreneurship at the same rate as men, global gross domestic product would rise by an additional 3% to 6%, equivalent to $2.5 trillion to $5 trillion in value, according to one estimate.Story continuesUp to $5 trillionAmount the global gross domestic product could rise if women were able to participate in entrepreneurship at the same rate as men.Lenders would also do well by investing in women. One study found that even though female-led startups receive less than half the funding that male-founded ones do, they generate 10% more cumulative revenue. This benefits the wider community as well, creating financial security and an asset base for entire family groups and local economies.Mastercard is working to connect women entrepreneurs to the tools they need. We recently announced the fulfillment of our pledge to connect 25 million women entrepreneurs worldwide to the solutions they need to grow their businesses, two years ahead of schedule. To meet that ambitious goal, we focused on digital acceptance of payments, access to credit and mentorship, as well as networking and other forms of expertise.In Latin America, Mastercard co-created a new value proposition to digitize small retailers so they are able to accept electronic payments and pay suppliers digitally. For instance, we are partnering with some of the largest consumer packaged goods brands by arming their network of small mom-and-pop distributors with the ability to accept digital payments. That allows these entrepreneurs to get paid almost in real time, giving them funds with which to purchase more stock, while at the same time equipping these brands with insight into which distributors might need additional capital in order to grow.Meanwhile, for the women harvesting baru nuts in Brazil, help for their traditional business came in a very 21st-century form. Moeda, a social investing platform and veteran of our Start Path startup engagement program, uses blockchain to link worthy entrepreneurs with investors looking for both profit and social good, and it extended a microloan that allowed the cooperative to purchase equipment and turn their harvest into Baru Beer. That beer sold out in a matter of months, netting perhaps five times what the women could have earned by selling the nuts alone. And as those newly converted Baru Beer fans will agree, unlocking the potential of these fierce entrepreneurs will benefit everyone.Click here to view the original content.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Mastercard on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: MastercardWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/mastercardEmail: info@3blmedia.com SOURCE: MastercardView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/762540/When-We-Connect-Women-Entrepreneurs-to-Capital-the-Whole-World-Wins]"

While we’ve already seen many companies take off with the AI boom, there are still others just starting to show big signs of life. In fact, while the AI frenzy has been red-hot, the story is still in its early stages. Companies all over the world are scrambling to figure out how to best use it to their advantage. We’re just now learning how it can impact defense, education, energy, finance, healthcare, retail and transportation to name a few. But again, this is just the start of the ballgame, folks. One that could be worth well over $1.81 trillion by 2030.So, you have two choices. One, you can sit around and think about buying the best AI stocks for 2023, only to kick yourself for doing nothing.

In fact, according to Qualcomm SVP of Product Management, Ziad Asghar, “This generative AI opportunity is just amazing for Qualcomm. You have to understand that this is how we’re able to bring all of these experiences onto the devices that are in people’s hands.”The company recently launched Qualcomm QCS610 and Qualcomm QCS410, which run the Qualcomm AI Engine. Even more exciting, Qualcomm used Stable Diffusion, a text-to-image generative AI program, on an Android smartphone. While that may not sound like a big deal, consider this. Qualcomm demonstrated what an AI model can do without relying on the cloud.Micron Technology (MU)An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock.Source: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.comNext up is Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), whose memory and storage software help power AI. In fact, the company may be one of the most overlooked and undervalued AI opportunities on the market. For one, we have to consider Micron is one of the biggest suppliers of Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM) in the world. Also, consider that your average AI server needs about six times as much DRAM as a traditional server. That alone gives the company a massive leg up in the AI story.Story continuesEven better, the company expects AI to boost sales moving forward. President and CEO Sanjay Mehorta has even said, “When you look at the future, it equals AI. And AI equals memory, and Micron is well positioned with our technology and product road maps to address the growing opportunities there.”Analysts seem to like the stock too. Citi (NYSE:C) recently named Micron a top semiconductor pick. The firm also reiterated its buy rating, with a $75 price target. Analysts at Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) also raised their price target on Micron to $65 from $55 a share.iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Multisector ETF (IRBO)Hand touching digital chatbot for provide access to information and data in online network, robot application and global connection, AI, Artificial intelligence, innovation and technology.

Of course, with more travelers expected in the coming months, demand will be steadily increasing until the end of 2023. Higher demand for airline tickets means elevated fares, which will cause many cost-conscious travelers to seek out the cheapest airline tickets they can find.How To Create a Budget Using ChatGPT: A Step-by-Step GuideLearn: How To Get Cash Back on Your Everyday PurchasesThe good news is that ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence chatbot, can help you save money on airfare. Here are four ways to use ChatGPT to find the cheapest airline tickets.ChatGPT vs. ChatGPT PlusBefore you start using ChatGPT to find cheap airline tickets, it’s important to understand that you’ll get the most comprehensive results with ChatGPT Plus. ChatGPT Plus requires a subscription and costs $20 per month.Once you’ve subscribed to ChatGPT Plus, you’ll need to follow these steps to install travel plugins, such as Expedia, Kayak or Travel.com:Log in to the platform and click on your name, which is located on the bottom left of the screen.Click on “Beta Features” and make sure the “Plugins” option is toggled on.Click on the GTP-4 option at the top of the screen to access a dropdown menu.Click on “Plugins.” You will receive a message stating, “No plugins enabled.”Click on “Plugins Store” and search and add the plugins you want by clicking “Install.”Exit the store and return to the GTP-4 tab where you’ll find the icons for the installed plugins.It’s also important to understand that this is experimental technology and results might not always be accurate. For example, the Expedia Group said this in a press release about its ChatGPT travel plugin: “It’s also important to remember that while many measures have been taken to limit inaccurate results and inappropriate responses, at times the experience may not work exactly as expected. Feedback from both our employees and all those using the experience will be continually looked at to make sure responses meet our standards.”Story continuesRelated: Don’t Buy Airline Tickets on This Day of the WeekUse the Kayak Plugin on ChatGPT PlusThe Kayak plugin will handle your request to find the cheapest airline tickets. You can post specific questions, such as, “What are the cheapest round-trip flights from Los Angeles, CA to Dallas, TX from July 11 to July 18?”The Kayak plugin will post results with links so you can book the flights immediately.Use the Expedia Plugin on ChatGPT PlusThe Expedia plugin for ChatGPT Plus works in a similar way to the Kayak plugin. Users can post their request to the chatbot and receive results with links that will allow them to book their flights on Expedia.Feel free to add specific details to your query such as, “I prefer a long layover” to get more personalized results.Use the Trip.com Plugin on ChatGPT PlusTrip.com offers a plugin for ChatGPT Plus that can help you find cheap flights. Simply type in your query and wait for the results. Click on the corresponding link for the flight you want, and you’ll be able to book it right away.Find Cheap Flights Using Regular ChatGPTIf you don’t have ChatGPT Plus, you might be able to use ChatGPT to find the cheapest airline tickets. However, you’ll have to do more of the legwork than you would when using the Kayak plugin.First, enter details about your travel dates and destination. For example, this is a prompt from earlier this summer: “Find the cheapest airline tickets for a roundtrip from Los Angeles, CA to Dallas, TX from July 11 to July 18.” Here are the options received from ChatGPT using that prompt:Option 1:Airline: Spirit AirlinesDeparture: Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) on July 11, 2023Return: Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) on July 18, 2023Price: Approximately $180 per ticketOption 2:Airline: Frontier AirlinesDeparture: Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) on July 11, 2023Return: Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) on July 18, 2023Price: Approximately $190 per ticketOption 3:Airline: American AirlinesDeparture: Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) on July 11, 2023Return: Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) on July 18, 2023Price: Approximately $220 per ticketNote that there are no links like you’ll find when you use the integrated travel plugins in ChatGPT plus. Instead, it gives you an idea of what airlines are offering the cheapest fares for your chosen itinerary. You’ll then have to look up the airfares and book the tickets yourself.ChatGPT also stated that the prices are subject to change and additional fees may apply. It suggested visiting the respective airline’s website or using a trusted travel booking platform to secure tickets at the best price. It also recommended comparing options and factoring in baggage allowances and flight times to allow you to make an informed decision based on your preferences and budget.Note that on a second attempt to use ChatGPT to get cheap airfare suggestions, it stated that it didn’t have access to real-time flight data or the ability to browse the internet and could not give specific information for the cheapest airline tickets from Los Angeles to Dallas on July 11-18. So, it seems that the best way to use ChatGPT to find cheap airline tickets is to subscribe to ChatGPT Plus and install the travel plugins of your choice.More From GOBankingRates5 Expensive Renovations Homeowners Always RegretWhich Bank Gives 6% Interest on Savings Accounts?3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000How Many Points Will a Credit Builder Raise My Credit Score?This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Saving Money With AI: 4 Ways To Use ChatGPT To Find the Cheapest Airline Tickets]"

KTOS recently formed an alliance with Shield AI to merge artificial intelligence (“AI”)-based piloting systems with former’s unmanned aircraft XQ-58 Valkyrie. The alliance aims at promoting unmanned aircraft operations in the absence of GPS and communications.Rationale Behind the AllianceThe integration of AI algorithms with unmanned vehicle will allow better management of complex task leading to overall operational efficiency and capability of unmanned vehicles. Also, the continuous monitoring of changing condition in a mission would provide more security for uncrewed jets.Real-time data analysis by the AI encourages trajectory optimization, reducing the operational cost of an unmanned vehicle. AI Pilots enabled jet to carry out tactical missions without GPS and communications interference, thus ensuing optimal safety of jets.With that being said, the integration of Kratos’s Valkyrie XQ-58 with AI pilot would bring about a revolution in the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) segment of the defense landscape and would certainly meet the needs of changing dynamics of warfare capabilities. This would result in the steady flow of contracts for Kratos, thus boosting its revenue-generation prospects from the unmanned vehicle businesses.Growth ProspectsOngoing technology advancement needs in carrying out combat missions is fueling a rapid increase in defense spending by nations across the globe. In such a scenario, increased spending on autonomous capabilities like UAV has been witnessed and will likely gain more traction in the days ahead.Per the report from Markets and Markets, the UAV market is poised to witness a CAGR of 7.9% over 2022-2027 period. This reflects on expanding market opportunities for companies like KTOS that enjoy an established position in the UAV manufacturing.In this context, it is imperative to mention that Kratos manufactures nearly 150 jet drones annually, thus entailing significant demand and order line up from United States Air Force, Navy, Army, Marine Corps and others. The pairing of AI pilot with its Valkyrie would unlock strategic benefits for KTOS by staying at the forefront of innovation. Other defense majors that may benefit from the increasing demand for UAV’s are:Story continuesNorthrop Grumman NOC: It is a leader in autonomous systems and offers an impressive portfolio of UAVs.

138,1148c128-7ede-315f-954f-234bb6c6fd7e,LMT,2023-06-21,Raytheon (RTX) to Complete Upgraded F135 Engine in 2024,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/raytheon-rtx-complete-upgraded-f135-112200139.html,1687260120,STORY,"['RTX', 'NOC', 'BAESF', 'LMT']","[Raytheon Technologies Corp. RTX recently announced that its business unit, Pratt &amp; Whitney, is on schedule to complete preliminary design review (PDR) for the F135 Engine Core Upgrade (ECU) and move into the detailed design phase in early 2024. Once accomplished, this upgraded F135 will be installed in the Block 4 upgrade of the F-35 fighter jets.This upgrade has been funded through a $115 million contract awarded to Raytheon in December 2022 and an additional funding provided in the fiscal 2023 Defense Appropriations bill.Benefits of the UpgradeThis upgrade will give the F135 engine the capabilities it needs to meet and exceed the F-35 jet’s growing requirements for power and thermal management while improving durability and restoring life to the engine.Notably, the F135 ECU is the fastest, most cost-efficient and lowest-risk path to support Block 4 upgrade for all global F-35 operators. It is projected to yield $40 billion in lifecycle cost savings by avoiding disruptive and costly air vehicle changes and leveraging the current global sustainment infrastructure.To this end, it is imperative to mention that Lockheed Martin’s LMT F-35 jets already enjoy a steady flow of orders from the U.S. Army, seven international partner countries and eight foreign military sales customers. Notably, Lockheed has delivered 899 F-35 airplanes since the program's inception, with 340 jets in the backlog as of Mar 26, 2023.This reflects the solid demand that F-35 jets enjoy in the combat aircraft market, which in turn also boosts the demand for F135 engine. The latest upgrade, once completed in 2024, should further bolster F135’s demand, thereby supporting Raytheon’s future revenue growth.Future ProspectsIn March 2023, the Department of Defense chose to upgrade the F135 instead of replacing it with an entirely new engine. With the U.S. government's current inventory target being 2,456 F-35 aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy, we may expect more production contract for F135 engines, especially for the upgraded ones. This, in turn, is expected to boost RTX’s earnings in the days to come.Story continuesSuch a solid inventory target will also benefit other defense majors like Northrop Grumman NOC and BAE Systems Plc BAESY that are involved in the production of F35 jets.Northrop Grumman: The company renders its expertise in carrier aircraft and low-observable stealth technology for the F-35 program.

Builders are gaining confidence from the shortage of existing homes in the sector, which is improving demand conditions. Lennar Corporation LEN, one of the top homebuilders in the United States, also has an optimistic view for the second half of fiscal 2023.Recently, it delivered impressive results for second-quarter fiscal 2023, where earnings and revenues handily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Although results were down for major metrics due to difficult year-over-year comparisons, the company expects solid third-quarter and fiscal 2023 deliveries and orders.Lennar shares have gained 8.6% in a month in-line with the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research On a positive note, Lennar has undertaken various price actions and cost-saving moves that are helping it mitigate macroeconomic woes. Also, digital marketing platforms, a land-lighter strategy and a dynamic pricing model bode well. Strong liquidity positions Lennar well for the future.LEN has adopted a price-to-market strategy, which means the company is continuously searching for market-clearing price for each of its homes on a community-by-community basis.Let’s check the factors supporting this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s growth potential.Solid Q3 &amp; FY’23 GuidanceFor third-quarter fiscal 2023, Lennar expects deliveries within 17,750-18,250 homes compared with 17,248 units reported a year ago. New orders are likely to be between 18,000 and 19,000 units (significantly up from 14,366 units posted a year ago) and the average selling price is expected to be similar to the fiscal second quarter.Financial Services’ operating earnings are expected to be in the range of $100-$105 million, up from $63 million generated in the prior-year period.For fiscal 2023, Lennar projects deliveries between 68,000 and 70,000 (versus 62,000 and 66,000 homes expected earlier). The new projection is strong compared with the previous year’s reading of 66,399 homes.Story continuesImpressive Builders’ Sentiment LevelAfter being hurt by significant inflation and labor shortages, strikingly high-interest rates and production deficits, homebuilders are regaining strength since the beginning of 2023. The recent National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI) for June also reflects signs of recovery. Builder confidence for newly-built single-family homes rose five points to 55 in June from May.This was the first time in the last 11 months that the HMI was above mid-point, backed by a lack of existing inventory and improving supply chain efficiency. Not only this, but sales expectations for the next six months also increased by six points, reflecting impressive 2024 prospects.Additional Factors Supporting LennarRecently, the Federal Reserve signaled that tight Monetary policy is about to end. Although the cost of financing for builder and developer loans has increased and has become more difficult to obtain, which will ultimately result in lower lot supplies, consumers have come to accept it as a ""new normal."". This will definitely aid Lennar in the next few quarters.Lennar has increasingly integrated its marketing strategy via digital channels. It strategically invests in companies involved in technology initiatives that enhance the homebuying experience, reduce SG&amp;A expenses and boost innovation. A dynamic pricing model, along with an improving digital marketing platform, is expected to drive sales volume and maintain consistent production levels.Moreover, LEN is mainly focused on becoming a pure-play homebuilder and a financial services company. To this end, it plans to spin off all or parts of non-core businesses and create a joint venture to provide single-family homes for rent. The company will now be an asset-light asset management business with a limited balance sheet.Other Key PicksBeazer Homes USA BZH designs, constructs and sells single-family and multi-family homes under the Beazer Homes, Gatherings and Choice Plans names.BZH shares have gained 7.9% in a month.

The Monthly Housing Market Index (HMI) reading jumped five points to 55 in June from May, according to the National Association of Home Builders (“NAHB”) report released on Monday. Low existing homes for sale and strong underlying demand for housing, along with refining supply chain efficiency, raise optimism.This marks the sixth month in a row of confidence increase and also the first time that the index has touched 50 since July 2022 despite headwinds like persistent shortage of skilled labor and tight credit market that continue to vex builders.The June 2023 reading was, however, down from the year-ago period level of 67. Yet, all three HMI components grew sequentially this month. Current sales conditions increased five points to 61 from May. Buyer traffic rose four points to 37 and sales prediction over the next six months moved north by six points to 62.Various homebuilding companies have been registering gains from the positive momentum of the industry. Notable among them are M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. MDC, M/I Homes, Inc. MHO, PulteGroup PHM, Toll Brothers, Inc. TOL and Beazer Homes USA, Inc. BZH.Other important positive takeaways from the June survey highlighted that builders are slowly reducing sales incentives. This depicts the mounting optimism in the demand for single-family homes. Although 56% of builders offered incentives to buyers in June, this percentage has dropped since December 2022.Again, the share of builders reducing home prices to boost sales declined to 25% in June, which was down from 27% in May and 30% in April. Notably, the metric was at its peak level of 36% in November 2022. The average price reduction in June was 7%, indicating a positive change compared to December 2022’s 8%.Fed’s Hawkish PauseThe Fed's determination to curtail inflation through interest rate hikes and quantitative tightening had impacted the homebuilding market badly last year, resulting in a slowdown in sales across the country and accelerated mortgage rates. Now, mortgage rates in the United States have dropped for the second straight week. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 6.69% for the week ended Jun 15, per Freddie Mac data, down from 6.71% last week. A year ago, the rate averaged 5.78%.The pullback comes a day after the Fed decided to forgo another hike in its benchmark interest rate, leaving it in a target range of 5%-5.25%.Story continuesHomebuilding Industry PerformanceOverall, the U.S. housing market seems to be doing well, defying headwinds like low inventory level and a tight loan market.So far this year, the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry has widely outperformed the broader market (S&amp;P 500), as you can see below. The industry falls within the top 7% (17 out of more than 250 industries) of the Zacks Industry Rank, which hints at further growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchKey Homebuilding StocksAdding some homebuilding stocks to your portfolio seems to be a judicious move at this point, given solid demand.

Investors following this style of investing are usually not interested in betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. Instead, they believe that ""buying high and selling higher"" is the way to make far more money in lesser time.Everyone likes betting on fast-moving trending stocks, but it isn't easy to determine the right entry point. These stocks often lose momentum when their future growth potential fails to justify their swelled-up valuation. In that phase, investors find themselves invested in shares that have limited to no upside or even a downside. So, betting on a stock just by looking at the traditional momentum parameters could be risky at times.A safer approach could be investing in bargain stocks with recent price momentum. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system) helps identify great momentum stocks by paying close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.PulteGroup (PHM) is one of the several great candidates that made it through the screen. While there are numerous reasons why this stock is a great choice, here are the most vital ones:A dash of recent price momentum reflects growing interest of investors in a stock. With a four-week price change of 9%, the stock of this homebuilder is certainly well-positioned in this regard.While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. PHM meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 30% over the past 12 weeks.Moreover, the momentum for PHM is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.34. This indicates that the stock moves 34% higher than the market in either direction.Story continuesGiven this price performance, it is no surprise that PHM has a Momentum Score of A, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.In addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped PHM earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, PHM is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. PHM is currently trading at 0.99 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 99 cents for each dollar of sales.So, PHM appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.In addition to PHM, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.However, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past.

Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to post earnings of $2.62 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $10.66 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +5%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.01 indicates a change of +3.3% from what Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Johnson &amp; Johnson is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Johnson &amp; Johnson, the consensus sales estimate of $24.66 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.7%. The $98.86 billion and $101.11 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +4.1% and +2.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryJohnson &amp; Johnson reported revenues of $24.75 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.6%. EPS of $2.68 for the same period compares with $2.67 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23.57 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.01%. The EPS surprise was +6.77%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Johnson &amp; Johnson is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Johnson &amp; Johnson. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.64 a share, just 30 days from its upcoming earnings release on July 20, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $2.64 Most Accurate Estimate and the $2.62 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Johnson &amp; Johnson has an Earnings ESP of 0.88%.JNJ is part of a big group of Medical stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Eli Lilly (LLY) as well.Eli Lilly is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on August 3, 2023. LLY's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.98 a share 44 days from its next earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Eli Lilly is $1.97, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.76%.Story continuesJNJ and LLY's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

SRDX announced that the FDA has approved its new medical device — SurVeil drug-coated balloon (DCB). The SurVeil DCB will now be available in the United States to treat percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). The device is threaded into a blood vessel, which is then inflated to open blocked or narrowed areas in the same.The approval is based on data from a 24-month pivotal clinical study that evaluated SurVeil DCB for non-inferiority to Medtronic’s MDT IN.PACT Admiral DCB. Data from the study demonstrated the sustained durability of SurVeil DCB for safety and effectiveness that was non-inferior to MDT’s IN.PACT Admiral DCB.Almost 81.8% of patients treated with SurVeil DCB attained freedom from device and procedure-related death as well as major target limb amputation compared to 83.2% of those treated with IN.PACT Admiral DCB. Less than 15% of patients needed repeat revascularization procedures for both DCBs.It’s important to note that while both SurVeil DCB and IN.PACT Admiral DCB use paclitaxel drug coatings, the latter has a 75% higher drug load of paclitaxel compared with the former.Medtronic’s IN.PACT Admiral DCB is being used for treating percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for several years. The device is also a market leader in its category in certain regions, especially Europe. A non-inferior study result for SurVeil DCB, with a substantially lower drug dose, should help in overcoming competition from IN.PACT Admiral DCB.Price PerformanceShares of Surmodics rallied 16.1% on Jun 20, following the FDA approval for SurVeil DCB. Surmodics stock has lost 18.2% in the past year compared with the industry’s 20.4% decline. The S&amp;P 500 Index has risen 17% in the same time frame.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFDA Review HistorySRDX completed submission of a pre-market approval (PMA) application to the FDA for SurVeil DCB in 2021. In January, the company announced a negative regulatory outcome. It stated that the FDA rejected the PMA application, requesting additional biocompatibility and labeling. The adverse regulatory outcome had an unfavorable impact on the company’s business outlook, leading to several layoffs.Story continuesAlthough Surmodics adopted several cost-cutting measures following this setback, it was in discussion with the FDA for regulatory pathway for a potential approval for SurVeil DCB. In March, the company received formal feedback from the FDA related to its proposed approach to submit a PMA application.Based on the regulatory authority’s feedback, Surmodics submitted an amended PMA application during the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The approval came earlier than the scheduled time, which was in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 (September end).Please note that SurVeil DCB is already approved in Europe for similar indication since 2020.Commercialization PlanSurmodics has a deal in place with Abbott Laboratories ABT for commercialization of SurVeil DCB. Per the terms of the agreement, Abbott has exclusive worldwide commercialization rights for SRDX’s DCB.SRDX is responsible for manufacturing and supply of the product to Abbott. It will also record these sales as product revenues. The company will receive a share of profit on third-party sales made by ABT.Per the deal, Surmodics is eligible to receive a milestone payment of $27 million from Abbott, following the FDA approval for SurVeil DCB. SRDX expects revenues in the range of $24.0-$24.5 million related to the milestone payment in the third quarter.Industry ProspectsPer a report by InsightAce Analytics, the DCB market was valued at $600.3 million in 2019 and is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 16.7% during 2020-2028. According to the same report, application of DCBs for treating PAD patients is likely to almost double by 2030 from the 2021 level.Factors like the prevalence of peripheral and coronary artery diseases, and growth in demand for minimally invasive procedures are likely to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest regulatory clearance raises optimism for Surmodics.Notable DevelopmentEarlier this month, Surmodics announced its receipt of the FDA’s 510(k) clearance for its Pounce LP (Low Profile) Thrombectomy System. The company expects to initiate limited market evaluation (LME) for the Pounce LP Thrombectomy System by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2024.SRDX is planning the commercialization of SurVeil DCB, following the completion of the LME. The Pounce Thrombectomy System was intended for the non-surgical removal of thrombi and emboli from the peripheral arterial vasculature in 3.5-6 mm thick vessels.In April, Surmodics reported fiscal second-quarter 2023 results, wherein it experienced a solid uptick in the overall top line. The company registered robust revenues from its Medical Device segment. It also recorded growth in Product sales, and Research, development and other revenues.During the quarter, Surmodics saw strong contributions from sales of its Pounce and Sublime products, indicating their continued solid demand.The same month, the company announced the enrollment of the first patient in PROWL, the Pounce Thrombectomy System Retrospective Registry. PROWL is an open-label, retrospective, multi-center U.S. registry of the Surmodics Pounce system for the non-surgical removal of emboli and thrombi in the peripheral arterial vasculature.Also, in April, Surmodics announced the first usage of the company’s Sublime radial access microcatheter, which is currently in limited market evaluation. The full suite of Sublime microcatheters will be launched in fiscal 2024.Surmodics, Inc. PriceSurmodics, Inc. PriceSurmodics, Inc. price | Surmodics, Inc.

He even learned to cook their favorite dishes, including tarator, a cold cucumber soup, and moussaka, a Bulgarian casserole made from potatoes and ground beef.""I think I've been doing OK,"" joked Gillenwater, a senior government affairs program director. ""Actually, I think I've been doing better than OK on the food front.""The gift of timeLast year, Medtronic enhanced its parental leave benefits for U.S. employees, including offering up to 24 weeks paid leave for birthing mothers. Non-birthing parents, like Gillenwater, who adopt or add a child through surrogacy can get up to 12 total weeks of paid leave.Todd said the time away from work has ""meant the world"" to his family as everyone got acclimated to the new living situation - and to each other.""I don't know how we would have done it without that,"" Gillenwater said of the policy.Part of Gillenwater's leave was covered by Medtronic global family care leave, which is available to all eligible employees globally and provides up to six weeks paid leave for a variety of reasons.""We want to support employees at every career and life stage,"" said Vice President of Global Benefits and Payroll Denise King. ""In addition to supporting new parents taking time away, we're equally committed to supporting employees who need to step away to care for an aging parent.""Intentions and serendipityThe Gillenwaters have been married for 29 years. The couple always knew they'd like to adopt children and about eight years ago, they started the laborious journey of background checks, meetings with social workers, and mountains of paperwork. The financial lift of adopting children was lessened thanks to adoption reimbursement offered by Medtronic in the U.S. The policy also helps with donor and surrogacy costs as employees grow their family.Story continuesWhen the couple finally received a call from the adoption agency in May 2022 that a pair of siblings in Bulgaria was up for international adoption, they reviewed the documents and a few photos of Ani and Plamen - it was love at first sight.""It was a relief knowing the company was providing that time off and again, really putting the Mission into action,"" Gillenwater said.Now at home for six months, Gillenwater said the foursome is finding their groove of doing ""regular family things.""Plamen plays soccer and Ani always comes home from preschool with dirty knees from playing in the sandbox. The kids do homework, and practice English together, and Gillenwater toils in the kitchen perfecting one Bulgarian dish after the next for his family.Gillenwater said he's ""very much looking forward to Father's Day"" on June 18 - his very first.Support in moments that matterFamily Care Leave (Global): Up to six weeks paid leave every 24 months. This can be used for things such as caring for a family member with a serious health condition, or bonding with a new child.Enhanced Parental Leave (U.S.): The Medtronic enhanced parental leave provides up to 24 weeks paid leave (previously 14-16 weeks) for birthing mothers. Non-birthing parents and employees who adopt or add a child through surrogacy can get up to 12 total weeks of paid leave.

The first two days of the world's biggest air show saw bumper orders from Indian airlines looking to cash in on a rapid rebound in travel since the pandemic and forecasts for continued strong growth in the world's most populous country. In a sign of robust demand elsewhere, industry sources told Reuters on Wednesday that European planemaker Airbus was also putting the finishing touches to a deal with Mexican low-cost carrier Viva Aerobus for 90 narrowbody jets, though the deal would fall outside the show. But recovery from the pandemic has been more problematic for suppliers, which are still grappling with rising costs, parts shortages and a scarcity of skilled labour.That has raised concerns whether Airbus and arch rival Boeing will be able to hit ambitious goals to ramp up output in order to meet delivery targets for customers.This week's orders from India alone - for 500 Airbus narrowbody jets from budget carrier IndiGo and a 470-plane deal for both Airbus and Boeing jets finalised by Air India - add almost 1,000 planes to the industry backlog.SHORTAGES Pratt &amp; Whitney, a unit of RTX - formerly known as Raytheon Technologies, has had a particularly tough time due in part to problems with its GTF engine that have led to the grounding of several planes. The company said on Wednesday the groundings peaked at 10% of the GTF-powered fleet in the first half of this year, and that percentage would trend lower through the rest of the year.Story continuesThe GTF is one of two engine options to power Airbus's top-selling A320neo narrowbody aircraft. Pratt &amp; Whitney President Shane Eddy, who has faced a backlash from airlines over durability problems and a shortage of spare engines, told the air show he was seeing ""solid progress"" in the supply chain.The company has the capacity in place to support maintenance demand but faces shortages of materials, he added. Planemakers also face tight labour markets as they strive to lift production, but Airbus said on Wednesday it had filled more than 7,000 of the 13,000 positions it aims to add this year. The European company, and U.S. rival Boeing, continued to sign new deals at the air show, stoking a debate about whether new fuel-efficient planes will help airlines reduce carbon emissions or whether this will be outweighed by more flights. Aircraft leasing company Avolon signed a memorandum of understanding to order 20 widebody Airbus A330neo aircraft. Boeing, meanwhile, won an order for four 737 MAX jets from India's Akasa Air, confirming an earlier Reuters story, while Luxembourg’s flag carrier Luxair also ordered four 737 MAXs.(Reporting by Tim Hepher, Joanna Plucinska, Allison Lampert, Valerie Insinna Editing by Mark Potter)]"

His answer is a lesson in leadership. But one piece, in particular, resonated with me:“You have to be transparent with literally everything, no matter how uncomfortable the data is or the conversation is. You have to tell everybody everything, including the media. And you’re going to get whacked along the way, and that’s life. But for us to regain trust, number one with our own people, and then with the flying public, they were going to have to believe us. And that was the culture we were going to carry forward.”The general media critique was that Boeing had compromised safety for the sake of quarterly profits. But Calhoun sees it differently:“We had a culture problem. But I’ll characterize it quite a bit differently than the media liked to characterize it. The idea that any human being makes a trade of quarterly profits over safety is just a flawed notion…It’s just not what happened. What I do think I found was an organization and a company and a culture that was having a hard time being honest with one another, with where programs stood, how much time was required, what things still needed to be completed. As a result, leadership became disconnected from the ground troops.”I write a lot in this newsletter about how leadership has changed in recent decades. But while many things have changed, some haven’t. Calhoun says he learned the value of transparency from the iconic leader of the last century, former GE CEO Jack Welch.Story continues“The one thing you could count on from Jack was pure reality and pure clarity every step of the way. He told you everything he thought about your business, what he had heard from the people he visited with in Crotonville the day before. He just went at you … He kept you ahead of the game.”I pointed out there are other parts of the Welch management legacy that haven’t weathered as well. His response:“It was a different time and a different context. Leaders have to change and adapt to the circumstances we’re faced with. Do I think Jack would have adapted and led in these changed circumstances as well as he did back then? I think the answer is yes.”You can listen to the full interview on Apple or Spotify. More news below. And be sure to read Shawn Tully’s fascinating analysis of the “Trillion Dollar Club” and the challenge it poses to today’s stock market investors.Alan Murray@alansmurrayalan.murray@fortune.comThis story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

You can skip our detailed analysis of the utility sector and its outlook, and go directly to read 5 Best Utility Dividend Stocks To Buy. The utility sector in the US is responsible for providing essential services such as electricity, water, and natural gas to residential, commercial, and industrial consumers. Utility stocks are considered to be defensive investments as they provide stable dividends and exhibit lower volatility compared to other sectors. In 2022, when inflation was at its record high, the Dow Jones Utility Average lost about merely 1.4%, compared with an 18% decline in the S&amp;P 500. In addition to this, electricity sales in the US showed an upward trend in the US last year, showing a 3.6% year-over-year growth in the first eight months of the year, as we reported in our article 12 Cheap Utility Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.Many utility companies in the US are regulated by the government to ensure the provision of essential services in a fair, reliable, and safe manner. Regulators also oversee and approve utility rates and returns on equities. While utility companies may argue for higher returns in high-interest rate periods, regulators become cautious about approving rate increases as they could burden consumers with higher costs. Karl Dunkle Werner and Stephen Jarvis’research published by the Energy Institute at Haas showed that due to higher costs, utility consumers could potentially be paying between $2 billion to $20 billion annually compared to what they would pay. Moreover, electric and gas utilities tracked by S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights requested $12.4 billion in rate increases in 2022 through October. One reason for this is that utility companies often require significant capital investments to maintain and upgrade their infrastructure and comply with environmental regulations.Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) may aid in achieving this potential. According to a report published by Goldman Sachs, the impact of the IRA could lead to a staggering $11 trillion in infrastructure investments by 2050. The report further mentioned that by 2032, there will be a total investment opportunity of $2.9 trillion across different sectors for energy system transformation in the US. This translates to an average annual investment of $290 billion.Story continuesAlso read: 10 Best Electric Utility Stocks To Buy NowAs we mentioned above, utility stocks are generally considered defensive investments because of the stable demand for the sector’s services and products. This means that these stocks can be great options to weather this market uncertainty. Analysts are also projecting a bullish outlook on the sector this year. Timothy Winter, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, spoke with Forbes earlier this year and highlighted the significance of utility stocks in this clean energy era. He said:“Utilities are growing earnings at stronger than historical rates (5%-7% versus 3%-4%) as they continue to ramp up investment to transform from fossil fuel to clean energy. This requires new wind, solar, and battery storage as well as other new technologies (green hydrogen, carbon capture), upgraded transmission to move power around and handle intermittent wind/solar, upgrade distribution for solar panels, EV charging, and electrification.”Another quality that makes utility stocks stand out is their stable dividends. Nearly all utility companies pay regular dividends to shareholders because of their consistent revenue streams. Some of the best dividend stocks in the utility sector include NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES), and Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D).12 Best Utility Dividend Stocks To BuyHigh-voltage power lines.

A degraded hydrogen seal was discovered in the main generator during the start-up and pre-operational testing, leading to further delay in the project.Vogtle Nuclear Power Plant Expansion - BackgroundThe Vogtle nuclear power plant, located southeast of Augusta, GA, has been undergoing expansion with the addition of Unit 3 and Unit 4 reactors. The project has faced numerous delays and cost overruns, significantly impacting its timeline and budget. Unit 3, which is currently under scrutiny, was expected to start commercial operations in June 2023.Delay Due to Degraded Hydrogen SealThe degraded hydrogen seal in VogtleUnit 3’s main generator caused the utility company to delay the reactor's commercial operation by at least another month. The estimated in-service date has now been set for July 2023. It is important to note that this issue pertains to the generator and not the reactor itself.Progress and Challenges in Unit 3 TestingDespite the setback caused by the degraded hydrogen seal, Georgia Power reported that Unit 3 operated as designed during the pre-operational testing and start-up sequence. Power-ascension testing, which measures the reactor's performance at various power levels, is approximately 95% complete. However, it is worth mentioning that Unit 3 has experienced a series of complications and risks of delays throughout its construction.Impact on Vogtle Plant Expansion ProjectThe Vogtle plant expansion project has been affected by significant delays and cost increases, causing the budget to exceed $16 billion. The recent delay in Unit 3's commercial operation adds to the project's challenges.These setbacks disrupt the timeline and escalate capital costs, as additional repairs and adjustments are necessary to address the issues. Furthermore, such delays hamper the role of new nuclear reactors in meeting renewable energy goals and reducing carbon emissions.Story continuesConclusionThe inevitable delay and cost overrun for Georgia Power's Vogtle Unit 3 highlights the complexities and risks involved in building new reactors. In order to avoid such instances in the future, Georgia Power needs to ensure nuclear power's safety, reliability and efficiency for the energy transition.Zacks Rank and Key PicksSouthern Company is an American utility firm that provides electricity to customers across southern United States.

The fund’s underperformance in the quarter was primarily because of the security selection and allocation effects. Holdings in Consumer Discretionary, Industrials, and Energy detracted from relative performance. On the other hand, holdings in Information Technology and Health Care, as well as an underweight exposure in Energy, contributed towards the relative performance of the strategy in the quarter.

165,80105bd0-2b50-39a7-afb9-1a3e8bed91af,CI,2023-06-21,Here's Why Investors Should Hold Cigna (CI) Stock for Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-investors-hold-cigna-163100134.html,1687278660,STORY,['CI'],"[The Cigna Group CI continues to be aided by two solid growth platforms, acquisitions and a solid financial position. A solid 2023 guidance also acts as an additional tailwind for the stock.Zacks Rank &amp; Price PerformanceCigna presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The stock has gained 5.2% in the past month compared with the industry’s 3.2% growth. The Finance sector and the S&amp;P Index have gained 3.6% and 5%, respectively, in the past month.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFavorable Style ScoreCI is well-poised for progress, as evidenced by its impressive VGM Score of A. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum. The score is a weighted combination of all three factors.Solid Surprise HistoryCigna’s earnings outpaced estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 6.6%.Robust Growth ProspectsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for CI’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $24.81 per share, indicating an improvement of 6.6% from the year-earlier reading, while the same for revenues stands at $188.9 billion, implying a 4.6% increase from the prior-year actual.The consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $28.27 per share, suggesting 13.9% growth from the 2023 estimate. The same for revenues stands at $225.5 billion, which indicates a rise of 19.4% from the 2023 estimate.Optimist Guidance for 2023This year, Cigna anticipates adjusted revenues at a minimum of $188 billion, which indicates growth of at least 4.1% from the 2022 reported figure.Adjusted earnings per share are predicted to be a minimum of $24.70, which suggests minimum growth of 6.1% from the 2022 figure.Business TailwindsCigna derives a majority of its revenues from premiums and pharmacy services. A rising customer base also enhances premiums, which remains the most significant revenue-generation component for any health insurer like Cigna. The company expects medical customers to grow by at least 1.3 million customers in 2023. Express Risk, Cigna’s pharmacy benefits business, should continue to drive pharmacy revenues by the strength of its supply chain, care and clinical management programs.Story continuesCigna’s performance continues to benefit from the strength of its two growth platforms, namely Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. A solid specialty pharmacy services suite drives the growth of the Evernorth platform, while the Cigna Healthcare unit benefits from an expansive customer base within its U.S. Government and U.S. Commercial businesses.The U.S. Commercial business should benefit from its competitive position and strong customer growth. U.S. Government business and International business should continue their growth trajectory with high-quality plans and geographic expansion. An aging U.S. population is expected to sustain the solid demand for its Medicare plans, which falls under the Government business.In addition to the solid inflow of premiums, the Cigna Healthcare unit benefits from continuous product expansions and new collaborations or contract extensions with renowned healthcare systems.CI resorts to acquisitions to bolster its suite of solutions and capabilities, as well as step into newer geographies and solidify its presence in existing markets. The company is on track to implement its Centene contract beginning in 2024. Cigna’s collaboration with VillageMD should act as a catalyst for its value-based care programs in the future. This would add to its existing offerings and benefit Cigna Healthcare and Evernorth’s clients.A growing cash balance and robust cash-generating abilities will continue to empower Cigna in undertaking business growth investments and prudently deploying capital via share repurchases and dividend payments. In February 2023, management approved a 10% hike in the quarterly dividend. The company expects to generate an operating cash flow of at least $9 billion in 2023.Key ConcernsThere are a few factors that have been impeding the stock’s growth lately.The company has been experiencing an increase in pharmacy and other service costs, medical costs and other benefit expenses. Such costs tend to weigh on the company’s margins. Its high leverage also poses a concern for shareholders. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive growth in the long term.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the Multi-line Insurance space are Assurant, Inc. AIZ, Enact Holdings, Inc. ACT and Old Republic International Corporation ORI. Each of these companies currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

167,0efea2c1-0dca-350f-96e6-b787d3c1d6ea,NOC,2023-06-21,Kratos (KTOS) to Pair Valkyrie With AI in Alliance With Shield,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kratos-ktos-pair-valkyrie-ai-152500934.html,1687274700,STORY,"['KTOS', 'BA', 'LMT', 'NOC']","[Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions, Inc. KTOS recently formed an alliance with Shield AI to merge artificial intelligence (“AI”)-based piloting systems with former’s unmanned aircraft XQ-58 Valkyrie. The alliance aims at promoting unmanned aircraft operations in the absence of GPS and communications.Rationale Behind the AllianceThe integration of AI algorithms with unmanned vehicle will allow better management of complex task leading to overall operational efficiency and capability of unmanned vehicles. Also, the continuous monitoring of changing condition in a mission would provide more security for uncrewed jets.Real-time data analysis by the AI encourages trajectory optimization, reducing the operational cost of an unmanned vehicle. AI Pilots enabled jet to carry out tactical missions without GPS and communications interference, thus ensuing optimal safety of jets.With that being said, the integration of Kratos’s Valkyrie XQ-58 with AI pilot would bring about a revolution in the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) segment of the defense landscape and would certainly meet the needs of changing dynamics of warfare capabilities. This would result in the steady flow of contracts for Kratos, thus boosting its revenue-generation prospects from the unmanned vehicle businesses.Growth ProspectsOngoing technology advancement needs in carrying out combat missions is fueling a rapid increase in defense spending by nations across the globe. In such a scenario, increased spending on autonomous capabilities like UAV has been witnessed and will likely gain more traction in the days ahead.Per the report from Markets and Markets, the UAV market is poised to witness a CAGR of 7.9% over 2022-2027 period. This reflects on expanding market opportunities for companies like KTOS that enjoy an established position in the UAV manufacturing.In this context, it is imperative to mention that Kratos manufactures nearly 150 jet drones annually, thus entailing significant demand and order line up from United States Air Force, Navy, Army, Marine Corps and others. The pairing of AI pilot with its Valkyrie would unlock strategic benefits for KTOS by staying at the forefront of innovation. Other defense majors that may benefit from the increasing demand for UAV’s are:Story continuesNorthrop Grumman NOC: It is a leader in autonomous systems and offers an impressive portfolio of UAVs.

168,1148c128-7ede-315f-954f-234bb6c6fd7e,NOC,2023-06-21,Raytheon (RTX) to Complete Upgraded F135 Engine in 2024,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/raytheon-rtx-complete-upgraded-f135-112200139.html,1687260120,STORY,"['RTX', 'NOC', 'BAESF', 'LMT']","[Raytheon Technologies Corp. RTX recently announced that its business unit, Pratt &amp; Whitney, is on schedule to complete preliminary design review (PDR) for the F135 Engine Core Upgrade (ECU) and move into the detailed design phase in early 2024. Once accomplished, this upgraded F135 will be installed in the Block 4 upgrade of the F-35 fighter jets.This upgrade has been funded through a $115 million contract awarded to Raytheon in December 2022 and an additional funding provided in the fiscal 2023 Defense Appropriations bill.Benefits of the UpgradeThis upgrade will give the F135 engine the capabilities it needs to meet and exceed the F-35 jet’s growing requirements for power and thermal management while improving durability and restoring life to the engine.Notably, the F135 ECU is the fastest, most cost-efficient and lowest-risk path to support Block 4 upgrade for all global F-35 operators. It is projected to yield $40 billion in lifecycle cost savings by avoiding disruptive and costly air vehicle changes and leveraging the current global sustainment infrastructure.To this end, it is imperative to mention that Lockheed Martin’s LMT F-35 jets already enjoy a steady flow of orders from the U.S. Army, seven international partner countries and eight foreign military sales customers. Notably, Lockheed has delivered 899 F-35 airplanes since the program's inception, with 340 jets in the backlog as of Mar 26, 2023.This reflects the solid demand that F-35 jets enjoy in the combat aircraft market, which in turn also boosts the demand for F135 engine. The latest upgrade, once completed in 2024, should further bolster F135’s demand, thereby supporting Raytheon’s future revenue growth.Future ProspectsIn March 2023, the Department of Defense chose to upgrade the F135 instead of replacing it with an entirely new engine. With the U.S. government's current inventory target being 2,456 F-35 aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy, we may expect more production contract for F135 engines, especially for the upgraded ones. This, in turn, is expected to boost RTX’s earnings in the days to come.Story continuesSuch a solid inventory target will also benefit other defense majors like Northrop Grumman NOC and BAE Systems Plc BAESY that are involved in the production of F35 jets.Northrop Grumman: The company renders its expertise in carrier aircraft and low-observable stealth technology for the F-35 program. A pioneer in the development of manned combat aircraft, NOC has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft.Northrop Grumman has a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC’s 2023 sales indicates a year-over-year improvement of 4.7%.BAE Systems: This defense major’s short takeoff and vertical landing experience, along with air systems sustainment, supports F-35’s combat capabilities. The company provides an electronic warfare suite for F-35, which includes fully integrated radar warning (targeting support and self-protection) to detect and defeat surface and airborne threats.BAE Systems boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 13.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BAESY’s 2023 sales indicates an increase of 24.8% from the previous year’s reported figure.Price MovementIn the past year, shares of Raytheon have risen 9.9% compared with the industry’s growth of 13.4%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankRaytheon currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

169,f5b7cefb-2425-326d-b150-b71d60bb1e57,NKE,2023-06-21,"Michael Jordan, 10 Richest Black Americans and Their Stock Picks",Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/michael-jordan-10-richest-black-121620195.html,1687349780,STORY,"['NKE', 'MCD', 'KO', 'PLTR']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at Michael Jordan, some of the richest black Americans and their stock picks. To see more of them, you can go directly to see Michael Jordan, 5 Richest Black Americans and Their Stock Picks.At the moment this article is being written, the date is June 19, 2023, also known as Juneteenth. This date marks the historic occasion of the emancipation of enslaved Black Americans back in 1865. From that time till today, Black Americans have come a long way, but they still continue to fight against systemic discrimination and racism. In a global environment such as this, every time a Black American breaks free to ascend beyond the glass wall, they issue a cause for celebration. The existence of several Black American billionaires today is one such cause for celebration.In our list below, we go over some of the most famous and successful Black Americans alive today, ranging from actors and singers like Tyler Perry and Rihanna to athletes such as Tiger Woods and LeBron James. These individuals have paved a tireless path for themselves over the past few decades, breaking all barriers and establishing a name for themselves in their respective fields through various activities. They include their business ventures, as in the case of Rihanna, for example, and even brand endorsements from mega-corporations like McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), as in the case of LeBron James and other athletes. And, of course, a source of wealth that is of immense importance is also the investments each of these individuals has, whether in private companies or public ones or even in real estate and sports teams.The Charlotte Hornets SaleA sports team that has offered immense wealth and growth to one of the billionaires on our list is the Charlotte Hornets, owned by basketball legend Michael Jordan. However, news this June has revealed that Jordan is actually moving towards the sale of his majority stake in this prized asset while he continues to retain minority ownership of the team. According to CNBC, Jordan will be raking in $3 billion from this sale to investors Gabe Plotkin and Rick Schnall, when he initially had bought the majority stake in the team in 2010 for $275 million. Provided the sale does go through, these figures mean that Jordan will be exiting his majority stake in the team after making 10 times his original investment.Story continuesIf the sale goes through, other assets that will be passed on include the Hornets Sports &amp; Entertainment Group, the G League team, the Greensboro Swarm esports team, and the Hornets Venom GT. The sale will also include the transfer of the Spectrum Center, where the Charlotte Hornets play. However, before anything can be confirmed, the NBA Board of Governors has to approve the sale.How The List Of America's Richest Black Billionaires Has ChangedJordan's decision to sell the Charlotte Hornets probably does not surprise those who keep updated on the prices of sports franchises. The opportunity to cash in on billions of dollars when you initially put in an investment of millions would tempt anyone. The fact of the matter remains that trends will always keep shifting, and so will the markets. This means that those who can keep up with these changes will be the ones who benefit in the long run. When we covered the richest Black Americans back in our 2021 article, some names such as Rihanna, LeBron James, Alexander Karp, and Tiger Woods were not included. Between 2021 and 2023, these individuals have also risen to the top, becoming part of the select few within the Black American community who have managed to achieve the status of being a billionaire.Rihanna became the youngest self-made female billionaire in the US in 2022 after the immense success of her makeup company, Fenty Beauty. LeBron James, a stellar NBA player, also achieved his billionaire status in 2022, raking in most of his wealth from his business ventures and endorsements with major companies like NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), as mentioned above. Alexander Karp has been a billionaire since at least 2015 after having founded the successful Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR), and finally, Tiger Woods, a professional golf player, was certified as a billionaire by Forbes in 2022 as well.At the same time, Kanye West seems to have dropped off our list because he lost several multi-year deals worth billions of dollars. These include the Adidas deal for the Yeezy sneaker brand and the Gap, CAA, and Balenciaga deals. The above shows how the list of Black billionaires in the US is ever-changing but also ever-expanding, and that in itself is a significant achievement for Black Americans today. To commemorate Juneteenth and now the historic success of these individuals, we have compiled a list of the richest Black Americans today while also highlighting their stock picks.Michael Jordan, Richest Black Americans and Their Stock PicksOur MethodologyTo pick the individuals for our list, we checked the net worths of the richest Black Americans as of 2023, using Forbes' data. We shortlisted the 10 richest Black Americans and ranked them based on their net worth, from the lowest to the highest value.Michael Jordan, Richest Black Americans and Their Stock Picks10. Tyler PerryNet Worth: $1 billionTyler Perry is a well-known Black American director, actor, producer, and writer. He began his career in entertainment in the 1990s, starting with live theatre and gradually moving to film and television by the 2000s.While Perry may be best known for his role in the Madea franchise, which grossed over $660 million, a significant portion of his wealth has been coming from his business ventures in the media sector. Perry has a huge stake in a renowned cable network, BET, and reports this June have been stating that he may be acquiring this network alongside VH1. Both of these networks are owned by Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA), implying that this would be the stock Perry is most inclined towards.A significant portion of Perry's wealth is also derived from his ownership of his films and Tyler Perry Studios, which is the biggest film-production studio in the US as of this February.9. LeBron JamesNet Worth: $1 billionLeBron James is an NBA player and the first active NBA player to become a billionaire. He currently plays for the Los Angeles Lakers. The key to James' wealth is not his basketball career alone. Rather, the fact that he has been taking equity in the brands he works with has helped James achieve his billionaire status today.The brands James has equity in include Beats by Dre, owned by Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Blaze Pizza. He has also invested in Fenway Sports Group, a move that made him a part owner of the Boston Red Sox, Liverpool Football Club, and some other sports teams.James has also been part of several brand endorsements for companies like McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE).8. Tiger WoodsNet Worth: $1.1 billionTiger Woods is a professional golfer, a career through which he has earned about $1.8 billion. This includes a PGA Tour-record $121 million in prize money. He is the second active athlete to become a billionaire, after LeBron James.Woods has invested his money mostly in two homes on Jupiter Island alongside a golf-course design business and a high-end mini-golf chain, Popstroke. He has also benefitted from numerous endorsements from companies like Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE).7. RihannaNet Worth: $1.4 billionRobyn ""Rihanna"" Fenty is one of the most famous singers in the US. By now, Rihanna is known for more than just her music in light of her acting and business careers. While her role in the media and entertainment industry of the US has certainly paved the way for her success and current wealth, the largest portion of her fortune comes from the success of her cosmetics line, Fenty Beauty.In 2022, Fenty Beauty's revenue doubled. The company is co-owned by Rihanna and LVMH Moet Hennesy Louis Vuitton SE (EPA:MC). Rihanna's 30% stake in the SavagexFenty lingerie line has also helped rake in the cash.

Avis Budget shares rise as the company's stock receives an upgrade from Morgan Stanley. Nike stock slips as analysts warn of inventory challenges. Yahoo Finance Live breaks down some of the trending tickers of the day.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Let's take a look at some of those individual movers of the day. First up, we've got to take a look at Alibaba shares closing the day lower off just around 4 and 1/2% after the company announced that Daniel Zhang will be stepping down as CEO and chairman. Eddie Wu, one of Alibaba's co-founders, will take over as CEO. And Joe Tsai will succeed Zhang as a chairman.Now, Zhang will continue to lead Alibaba's cloud division as the e-commerce giant plans to split its business here into six business units. But you can see the reaction, Diane, in shares today. And I think the takeaway here from investors is that they want to see growth here before they are eager to jump back into a name like Alibaba.DIANE KING HALL: Also, this was a surprise. So Wall Street certainly doesn't like a surprise like this, especially at the top of the food chain. I mean, one good thing for, you know, when you're talking about, say, Jason Wu, he was tied to Jack Ma. So there is a close relationship there. So maybe he can handle this kind of shifting of the restructuring, if you will. But we've certainly seen Alibaba take a knock when you're looking at it whether you're talking about year to date or on a year ago basis, down double digits from a year ago when you talk about that kind of China crackdown on the internet names like Alibaba.All right. Shares of Avis Budget Group riding higher. That stock rallying 9%. This after Morgan Stanley upgrading the vehicle rental company to overweight from equal weight, raising its price target to 230 bucks from 182. Analyst Adam Jonas says, Avis has shown it's-- able to not only extract higher revenues but also lower costs and subsequently higher margins from their operations. This is kind of like seeing it as a normalizing of the rental vehicle market.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: Yeah. Certainly, we have seen that demand is high here for travel. People are out there renting cars. When it comes to Avis so specifically, another thing that jumped out to me from this note here from Jonas was he was saying that Avis has a proven track record of managing fleet costs or managing those risks there and keeping a lid on costs. Obviously, that would be good news here for investors for the bottom line here of Avis.His new price target of 230 bucks that you just mentioned, that would imply about a 13% jump from the closing price yesterday. So we saw a bit of a move higher here today, up just about 9%. But he still thinks there's a little bit more runway here, with shares closing just around 224.Let's take a look at Nike, one of the worst performers in the Dow today, closing off about 3 and 1/2%. A couple of Wall Street analysts trimming their expectations for fourth quarter earnings next week. So Nike telling investors in its last quarter that it thought that it had turned a corner on inventory. But a note out here from Morgan Stanley, the team there today, warning that Nike's inventory comeback might not be as strong as they had initially anticipated. The inventory growth 16% last quarter. That was a massive improvement from the quarter before.But we know that retailers across the industry still struggling with those higher inventory prices.DIANE KING HALL: Right. And some of the concern really in particular about this is its wholesale client, meaning Foot Locker. So we know Foot Locker talked about its inventory issues. So now, Morgan Stanley seeing the knock-on effect there as well. And also, UBS analyst talking about Nike sneaker sales slowing as well. So we're certainly seeing some damage. That stock getting dented today.]"

Yahoo Finance markets reporter Josh Schafer details how much retail theft is weighing on sales figures and how investors could actually benefit.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]- Inventory shrinkage is a big issue for retailers, mostly at the hands of organized retail crime. Now Target CEO, Brian Cornell, telling Yahoo Finance last month that the problem is getting worse. And warning that it could cost target $500 million in profits this year. But despite that, there's one analyst who's saying that this big problem will turn from a headwind to a tailwind later this year. Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer is here with more on that.And Josh, explain this to me. This is a note out here from the team at UBS. But what are they saying, just in terms of how we are going to see this potentially benefit maybe some investors at some point?JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, so the way shrinkage works, right, I think we should start there, overall, you're talking about essentially the companies are losing money and losing profits. So if we were to see shrinkage go down, that $500 million, if we wanted to use that number in theory, at some point, would come back to target, right. So at a high level, that's what UBS is looking at.And really what they're calling here is they're calling peak shrinkage. They're saying this is the most shrink we're going to get, we're reaching it right now. And something interesting they pointed to in that call was a graph showing how often shrink is mentioned on earnings calls.So when you take a look at the past decade or so, when we're talking about shrink, you can see there when it reaches sort of peak, it then falls off, pretty significantly, the mentions do, and so does the actual shrink reporting that we then see in the following quarter.So UBS essentially saying, you've heard a lot about shrink in the last couple of quarters, specifically the last quarter. You heard it from the likes of Walmart, Target, the dollar stores, Dollar General, Dollar Tree. They're now saying that they think that that's going to fall off in the next couple of quarters, so end of '23 probably, into '24, and then you see those profits come back. So if you were to sort of make that right trade now, then the profits come back, the gross margin goes back up, and it's a positive tailwind for the company.Story continues- Kind of the expectation would be to buy the rumor, sell the news, or a situation like that. And I do notice more luxury retailers are trying to address that problem with how they're handling crowds who-- or I wouldn't call it crowds for luxury retailers. But--[LAUGHTER]- Their numbers looking pretty good though.- But, you know, how they're managing consumers coming into their stores, to deal with that issue. But, of course, the big retailers can't necessarily do that. And they've been kind of stopping staff from addressing issues that can lead to the shrink.But I want to pivot a little bit and talk Nike. I saw shares under pressure today. This coming after analysts warn of inventory issues. So tell us about this.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, I mean, when you're talking about shrink, you're also kind of talking about inventory in some ways, right. It's a little bit different for Nike, but we're staying with the trend here on inventory. And for Nike, it's been a story over the last couple of quarters of just, they've had very high inventory. A lot of retailers have had very high inventory.For Nike, specifically, what the street has been concerned about is when you go back a month to that Foot Locker earnings call, they talked a lot about sales probably falling through the end of the year. They already have a lot of inventory. Who buys a lot of Nike shoes? Foot Locker. About 70% of their sales are Nike. So that was one thing that analysts were pointing out today.But interesting to see that they think overall Nike might be able to hold up in this environment. Essentially saying that they think that North American sales are going to be down, North American inventories might be under pressure. But they might have some success in what they're doing outside of North America. And that could maybe buoy what might be a little bit of a decline here in the States.- We will see. We get those results, what? Thursday?JOSH SCHAFER: Next Thursday.- Next Thursday, all right. So coming up here in just over a week. Right, Josh Schafer, thanks.]"

The company reported strong results, with its annual contract value (ACV) advancing 14% to $2 billion in 2022, supported by broad‐based growth across all major industries and geographies. This, in our opinion, exemplifies the significant value ANSYS’s software provides, enabling its customers (that include automotive, aerospace, consumer goods, energy and health care firms) to save time and money by testing products before the design process is complete. The applications for ANSYS’s software suite have expanded over the years, as even the simplest products have increased in complexity, continuously elevating the need for simulation. Meanwhile, the market for ANSYS products remains underpenetrated, with only a fraction of design engineers currently utilizing simulation software. Given the scale of its user base, high switching costs, network effects, technological leadership and overall reputation across many disciplines (from fluid dynamics to electromagnetics), we believe the company is uniquely positioned to further increase its market share, as simulation becomes more ubiquitous across industries and product types.""Story continuesEngineering, Construction, CompanyPhoto by ThisisEngineering RAEng on UnsplashANSYS, Inc.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the stock market outlook, skip over to 5 Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 2023. Wall Street analysts are still largely split when it comes to their forecasts for the S&amp;P 500 index, despite the year being halfway through. The difference in opinion among analysts has grown even more since the benchmark index emerged from its lengthiest bear market since 1948. Goldman Sachs raised its end of year target for the S&amp;P 500 from 4,000 to 4,500, noting that their 2023 earnings-per-share projections remain unmodified. Goldman Sachs speculates that a soft landing will be delivered by the Federal Reserve, despite the brutal interest rate hikes over the last year to counter inflation. The firm believes that market sectors that are underperforming so far have the potential to keep pace with market leaders. The mega-cap tech stocks are dominating the market this year, and the profits from artificial intelligence can potentially prolong the current stock market upswing. On the other hand, Morgan Stanley reiterated its negative stance on the stock market, noting that the bear market is not over and an earnings recession is projected to hinder any further gains. Michael Wilson, the chief equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, expects the S&amp;P 500 to sink to 3,900 by year-end. On May 23, Reuters polled 43 Wall Street strategists and they believe that the S&amp;P 500 index is expected to experience a decline by the end of 2023. These strategists think that investor sentiment will be negatively impacted due to high interest rates, banking failures, and disappointing earnings. They expect the S&amp;P 500 index to close at 4,150 at the end of 2023. The substantial gains this year are predominantly attributed to the growth and technology sectors, which led to significant market rallies and offset some of the instability caused by collapsing regional banks. According to Jonathan Golub, head of U.S. equity strategy and quantitative research for Credit Suisse, the S&amp;P 500 will likely close at 4,050 at the end of this year. He told Reuters: Story continues""It's just a very uninspiring, low-growth backdrop, with tight monetary policy and earnings that will be down this year versus last."" Data from Refinitiv suggests that the forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of the S&amp;P 500 is presently 19, compared to 17 recorded at the end of 2022 and exceeding the long-term average of approximately 16. UBS Global Wealth Management has a year-end S&amp;P 500 target of 3,800, and Nadia Lovell, a senior U.S. equity strategist at UBS, said: ""Historically, when you've seen this level of valuation, it's normally associated with re-acceleration in earnings and also an outlook for double-digit earnings growth going forward. We don't see that happening."" Market expectations are increasingly varied. For example, RBC Capital, citing improved earnings expectations, limited layoffs, and rebounding corporate sentiment, raised its end of year S&amp;P 500 price target to 4,250 from 4,100. Bloomberg cited Lori Calvasina, head of US equity strategy at RBC Capital, who commented: “While our new target still reflects a fairly neutral view on the direction of stocks through year end, when asked we do acknowledge more upside risks than downside risks. We’ve also been struck by how many bearish leaning investors have been asking us to walk them through the bull case and explain why stocks have been so resilient.”Amid the mixed market sentiment on Wall Street, some of the worst performing S&amp;P 500 stocks include DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH), Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP), and Newell Brands Inc. (NASDAQ:NWL). Our MethodologyFor this list, we screened the S&amp;P 500 stocks and chose the 20 worst performing companies based on highest decline in share prices year-to-date as of June 16, 2023. We have ranked the list in ascending order of the year-to-date share price drop. 20 Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 2023Image By peshkov - Adobe StockWorst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 202320. MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 23.08%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) provides financial services, dealing in insurance, annuities, employee benefits, and asset management services worldwide. The company was founded in 1863 and is headquartered in New York. On May 3, MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) reported a Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $1.52 and a revenue of $16.12 billion, falling short of Wall Street estimates by $0.34 and $720 million, respectively. However, on May 25, MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET)’s board authorized a $1 billion increase in the share repurchases, making the total share repurchase authorization outstanding approximately $4 billion.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 43 hedge funds were long MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET), with combined stakes worth $812.4 million. Richard S. Pzena’s Pzena Investment Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 4.18 million shares worth $242.3 million. Like DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH), Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP), and Newell Brands Inc. (NASDAQ:NWL), MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) is one of the worst performing S&amp;P 500 stocks in 2023. 19. International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. (NYSE:IFF)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 23.94%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. (NYSE:IFF) manufactures and markets cosmetic active and natural health ingredients that are used in consumer products. It operates through four segments – Nourish, Scent, Health &amp; Biosciences, and Pharma Solutions. International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. (NYSE:IFF) shares declined nearly 24% year-to-date as of June 16, making it one of the worst performing S&amp;P stocks.On May 8, International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. (NYSE:IFF) reported a Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $0.87, missing Wall Street estimates by $0.02. The revenue of $3.03 billion fell 5.3% as compared to the prior-year quarter, but outperformed market consensus by $50 million. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. (NYSE:IFF) was part of 41 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 39 in the earlier quarter.

(NYSE:IFF) in its Q1 2021 investor letter:“We are still getting used to the higher multiples that investors will pay for larger market cap and pure play companies such as IFF. We do understand the market’s rationale. IFF’s products account for a small percentage of the customers’ cost while playing critical roles in the products’ performance. With some operating leverage, the company can probably grow FCF at 4-6% a year. This brings the total return close to the long-term return of the S&amp;P 500 index of 10%. Through trial and error, we have come to appreciate how scale, higher market share, route densities, switching costs, and collaborative relationships amongst major industry players can contribute to sustained high returns on invested capital.”18. The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 24.08%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) is a power generation and utility company using coal, gas, hydro, wind, solar, biomass, and renewable sources.

The revenue increased 13.7% year-over-year to $3.24 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $400 million. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 44 hedge funds held stakes worth $1.1 billion in The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES), compared to 44 funds in the prior quarter holding stakes worth $1.3 billion. Massif Capital made the following comment about The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“We currently have roughly 13% of the portfolio allocated to two utilities: The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) and Polaris (PIF). We invested in AES in December 2020 at an average entry price of $21.3 and invested in PIF in July 2020 at an average entry price of 16.36 CAD. We are currently underwater on PIF and making money in AES. Our near-term outlook for both positions is mixed. AES had a solid year in 2022, up 13%; it has telegraphed growth in earnings and cash flow through 2025 and seems to be hitting its targets. We will have to see what the year holds for utilities and AES, but another year like last year, and the firm will be touching our full value expectations.”17. U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 25.07%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) was founded in 1863 and is headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It is a financial services company that operates through Corporate and Commercial Banking, Consumer and Business Banking, Wealth Management and Investment Services, Payment Services, and Treasury and Corporate Support segments.

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which had been a long-term stakeholder of U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), sold all its shares during the first quarter of 2023. Mairs &amp; Power Growth Fund made the following comment about U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“Financials were roiled in the quarter thanks to the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failures. Even though the Fund has a similar weight to Financials as the index, our bank stocks—U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Charles Schwab (SCHW)—fell more than the Financials sector and hurt relative performance. We have performed a thorough analysis of our banking stocks and believe that they will exit this banking event intact, and a few may even benefit from the sector turmoil.The largest detractors from relative performance in the quarter were US Bank, Charles Schwab, UnitedHealth Group (UNH), and Hormel (HRL). The first two got caught up in the previously mentioned bank scare. With the selloff in the quarter, we have added to US Bank selectively, but more so to JPMorgan as it appears better positioned to gather deposits in the current environment.”16. Organon &amp; Co. (NYSE:OGN)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 25.51%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33Organon &amp; Co.

(NYSE:OGN), compared to 37 funds in the preceding quarter. Steven Boyd’s Armistice Capital is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 3.20 million shares worth $75.2 million. Miller Value Partners made the following comment about Organon &amp; Co. (NYSE:OGN) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Organon &amp; Co. (NYSE:OGN) was the top detractor for the quarter, falling 30.0%2. Organon reported 2Q22 revenue of $1.59 billion, -0.6% Y/Y, ahead of consensus of $1.54 billion, and Adjusted EPS of $1.25, -27.3% Y/Y, in-line with analyst expectations.

Management revised FY22 guidance for revenue of $6.1-6.3 billion, compared to previous guidance for revenue of $6.1-6.4 billion, to reflect persisting foreign exchange (FX) headwinds, and Adjusted EBITDA margin of 32-34%, compared to prior guidance for a margin of 34-36%, which incorporates ~$110 million of in-process research and development (IPR&amp;D) and milestone expenses from business development.

Off the heels of last year’s outstanding performance, the Fund’s Energy stocks were down -16%. Financials were down -5%, primarily due to Truist Financial Corporation (NYSE:TFC) (bank), as banks sold off due to the failure of SVB Financial Group. Consumer Discretionary finished the quarter up but was pulled down by the -9% performance of RH (home products store).”14. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 27.11%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 77CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is a health services provider in the United States. It operates through Health Care Benefits, Pharmacy Services, and Retail/LTC segments. On May 25, CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) disclosed that only 21% of its Medicare Advantage members are enrolled in plans that have a star rating of four or higher, which will result in its net income dropping between $800 million to $1 billion in 2024.

John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors is the biggest position holder in the company. Greenlight Capital made the following comment about CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Second, we will discuss Oak Street Health (OSH), which we closed out after costing us 0.8% (net) during the quarter. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is buying OSH for $39 per share, or about $10 billion. When shorting, there is always the risk that someone with deep pockets will buy out the company at a silly price, or maybe even at twice a silly price. CVS is worth $115 billion (or it was the day they announced the deal; subsequently, CVS’s shares have fallen and it’s now worth $93 billion), so it can afford to piss away $10 billion.OSH is in value-based care, which has become a trendy segment of the market. Most of the “value” comes from doing a more thorough and aggressive job of documenting how sick a patient is, so as to maximize Medicare payments. OSH operates 169 clinics (costing between $1.5-$2 million to build) in mostly lower income neighborhoods and employs 600 doctors. CVS projects that in 2026 the pro forma entity will have 300 clinics and “embedded EBITDA” of $2 billion, plus over $500 million of synergies.In 2022, OSH generated less than $1 million of adjusted revenue per doctor2 and lost $500 million (almost $3 million per clinic). Even if it triples the number of doctors by 2026, it will need over $1 million of “embedded EBITDA” per doctor, implying margins shifting from a loss to nearly 100%. Obviously, this can’t happen, as the doctors need to be paid and there are other substantial costs. The amazing thing is that when rumors of this deal circulated, we reached out to CVS management and had a call where we walked them through the math… and they went ahead with the deal anyway. When the proxy came out, it revealed that OSH conducted an auction and, like a late-night eBay shopper who had one too many glasses of wine, CVS raised its uncontested bid several times… Rant over.”13. Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 28.08%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA), the American pharmaceutical giant, is one of the worst performing S&amp;P 500 constituents so far in 2023. The share price plummeted 28% year-to-date as of June 16, 2023. On May 4, Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) reported a Q1 GAAP EPS of $0.19 and a revenue of $1.9 billion, topping Wall Street estimates by $1.94 and $730 million, respectively. While revenue exceeded market consensus, it experienced a decline of 69% compared to the same period in 2022, mainly due to lower sales volume.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 40 hedge funds were bullish on Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA), down from 52 funds in the prior quarter. Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 6.5 million shares worth $1 billion. Baron Health Care Fund made the following comment about Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) is a leader in the emerging field of mRNA-based vaccines and therapeutics and was one of the three main producers of the COVID vaccine. Shares fell during the quarter. We believe as COVID shifts away from pandemic status and becomes an increasingly commercial market (rather than government funded), there is increasing investor uncertainty around what a booster market could look like, which is pressuring shares. Looking beyond COVID, we think Moderna has the potential to disrupt the biopharmaceutical industry, from infectious disease vaccines to oncology, and we remain shareholders.”12. Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 28.23%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) is a California-based based company that designs and manufactures home energy solutions for the solar industry in the United States and internationally. Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) shares have lost 28.23% in value since the beginning of this year till June 16, consequently making it to our list of the worst performing S&amp;P 500 stocks in 2023. Although Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) reported better than forecasted Q1 adjusted earnings and revenues, the company guided Q2 revenues below Wall Street estimates. Enphase expects Q2 revenue to range between $700 million to $750 million, falling short of the market consensus of $760 million. The gross margin in Q2 is expected to be 41% to 44%, which is lower than Q1.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 55 hedge funds were long Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH), compared to 63 funds in the prior quarter. John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 590,709 shares worth $124.2 million.Aristotle Atlantic Large Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) designs, develops, manufactures and sells home energy solutions in the U.S. and internationally for the solar industry.

Enphase introduced the world’s first microinverter system in 2008 and has expanded its offerings to include battery storage systems and proprietary technologies that provide energy monitoring and control services for solar energy systems. It sells its products and solutions directly to solar system distributors, large installers and strategic partners.We see Enphase having a substantial market share that is gained through a premium product offering, superior customer service and the development of a large and diverse network of solar installers and distributors. The company’s products and services address a growing residential solar market. Coupling battery backup systems with existing and newly installed residential solar systems could accelerate the company’s revenue and earnings growth over the next several years, in our view. Additionally, commercial and international expansion offer additional revenue and earnings upside. Enphase also plans to expand manufacturing capacity in the U.S. during 2023 to benefit from tax incentives related to domestic production included in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).”11. V.F.

The stock has declined nearly 34% year-to-date as of market close on June 16, making EPAM Systems, Inc. (NYSE:EPAM) one of the worst performing S&amp;P 500 constituents. On June 5, EPAM Systems, Inc. (NYSE:EPAM) trimmed its Q2 and FY23 outlook because of further downturn in short-term demand. For FY23, the company forecasts revenues between $4.650 billion to $4.80 billion, down from the earlier guidance of $4.95 billion to $5.00 billion. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 34 hedge funds were bullish on EPAM Systems, Inc.

(NYSE:EPAM) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“The portfolio’s returns in the roaring IT sector were hampered by software-engineering company EPAM Systems, Inc. (NYSE:EPAM) and payment-services provider Network International. EPAM signaled a more cautious outlook for growth and cost pressures related to the geographic reconfiguration of its East European engineering workforce in the wake of the war in Ukraine. UAE-based Network International indicated that challenging macroeconomic conditions in Africa may hinder near-term growth. In Communication Services, detractors included Safaricom, the leading mobile-network operator and payment-services company in Kenya, where the currency has weakened amid high inflation and a sizable current account deficit.Buying Globant didn’t increase our portfolio weight in IT services, as the purchase was funded by reducing two other industry holdings, EPAM and Tata Consultancy Services, for which valuations had become less attractive. EPAM’s share price fell sharply in early 2022 after Russia invaded Ukraine, given that close to 60% of the company’s staff was working in the affected countries of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. We were patient through this period as EPAM management restructured its workforce; only 30% are now based in these three countries. Despite the disruption, productivity remained comparable to pre-war times, and EPAM managed to retain nearly all of its customers. As a result, the stock recovered from its lows last year, offering an opportunity to trim our position.”8.

The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 33.61%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 87The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) specializes in wealth management, securities brokerage, banking, asset management, custody, and financial advisory services.

D E Shaw is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 12.2 million shares worth $642.7 million. Generation Investment Management Global Equity Strategy made the following comment about The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“Your portfolio has been relatively insulated from recent banking troubles. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is the only financials company in your portfolio (forming 2.37% of it). The company’s share price has suffered. We are watching the situation closely. Regulators have responded quickly to the turmoil. After a few weeks when people were withdrawing deposits from small banks across America, the rush seems to have slowed.We do not have strong views on whether the banking turmoil will tip the global economy into recession. We are not economists, and in any case the global economy has rarely been so hard to predict. Forecasters are trying to weigh up a large number of highly unusual variables: a land war in Europe, the fallout from massive fiscal stimulus in 2020– 21 and high inflation. In this environment all judgments about the macro economy are uncertain.”6. Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 35.78%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) provides financial products and services, operating through Commercial Bank, Retail Bank, Wealth Management, and Finance segments. On June 13, the company announced that it is going to disengage from the mortgage banker finance business by the end of 2023. Comerica highlighted the reduction of seasonal and cyclical fluctuations in its loan portfolio, enhancing the efficiency of capital utilization, and improving the stability of its liquidity as potential benefits of the exit. As of June 16, Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) stock has declined nearly 36% year-to-date. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 46 hedge funds were bullish on Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA), compared to 37 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is the largest stakeholder of the company, with a position worth $137.8 million. In addition to DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH), Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP), and Newell Brands Inc. (NASDAQ:NWL), Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) is one of the worst performing S&amp;P 500 stocks this year. Third Avenue Value Fund made the following comment about Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“The largest detractors from Fund performance during the quarter included two banks, Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) and Deutsche Bank. As it relates to the Fund specifically, events within U.S. banking applied most directly to our investment in Comerica, a U.S. super-regional that does have a large portion of corporate deposits and is not classified as a globally systemically important bank (“G-SIB”), which means it has not recognized certain mark-to-market securities losses in its regulatory capital. Comerica was a 2.6% position at the beginning of the quarter, prior to a roughly 34% stock price decline during the quarter. After purchasing more shares following the stock price decline, the Fund’s position in Comerica was approximately 2.3% at quarter end. While the general contagion fears and bank depositor behavior remain a fluid situation today, we took some confidence from immediate, forceful and targeted actions by the Fed, FDIC and Treasury. In our view, the Fed’s Bank Term Funding Program (“BTFP”) seems a well-tailored and appropriate near-term liquidity solution that allows banks to obtain immediate liquidity, collateralized by the par value of securities, to meet any near-term deposit outflows. At the time of this writing, early signs are that the deposit flight from regional banks is calming rapidly and depositor psychology is improving, though this could change. To the extent that calming continues, our suspicion is that there may be very attractive bargains to be had among regional banks. More will be known in the coming days and weeks as information regarding deposit flows emanates post-quarter end. That said, there will remain some mystery around the extent of the bargains on offer because increases in FDIC funding, increases in regulatory capital requirements, more stringent liquidity stress testing, and changes to the list of banks subject to G-SIB regulatory regimes are all on the table now. It is also very likely that deposit costs, which had been rising very slowly, will rise much more rapidly as commercial banks work harder to entice depositors to stay put. None of these developments, if they eventuate, are likely to impact banks’ returns and earnings in a positive way.More broadly, the Third Avenue Value Fund owned investments categorized as financials totaling 15.94% by weight, at quarter end. This category includes non-bank financials such as Old Republic, a U.S. property and casualty insurer and title insurance business, Lazard, an advisory business and asset management firm, and Ashmore, a U.K. asset management firm specializing in emerging markets credit. The Fund’s actual bank exposure at quarter end totaled 9.52% and comprises Bank of Ireland, Deutsche Bank and Comerica, in order of position size…” (Click here to read the full text) Click to continue reading and see 5 Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 2023.  Suggested articles:Top 20 Countries with the Highest Oil Consumption10 Best GARP Stocks That Pay Dividends15 Biggest Journalism Companies in the US Disclosure: None. 20 Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 2023 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Analysts Are Still Upbeat About His Potential,Footwear News,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/0ef8f365-142a-3ba0-8d9e-c5726a9535ad/vf-corp%E2%80%99s-new-ceo-is-a.html,1687288580,STORY,['VFC'],"[Analysts were overall upbeat Tuesday as they reacted to the VF Corporation’s appointment of Bracken Darrell as its new president and CEO.Darrell, who most recently served as president and CEO of Logitech International S.A, joins during a turbulent time for the footwear giant, which owns Vans, The North Face, Timberland and Supreme, among other brands. VF in May reported that yearly revenue for 2023 was down 2 percent from the prior year. At the time, executives announced that fiscal year 2024 would be a transitional year for VF to set it up for profitable growth in 2025 and beyond.More from Footwear NewsVF Corp. Taps Bracken Darrell as President, CEO as It Looks to Turn Around BusinessTimberland Hires 28-Year Nike Veteran Archie McEachern as Its VP and Chief Merchandising OfficerWith Darrell’s appointment, analysts were overall positive on his potential to turn the company around, despite his lack of experience in the retail and footwear space. The market responded similarly, with shares for VF up slightly when markets opened this morning.Describing the appointment as a “strategic positive” for VF, Goldman Sachs analyst Brooke Roach in a note lauded Darrell’s leadership and turnaround experience and “history of managing diversified portfolios.”Other analysts also called out Darrell’s brand turnaround experience. This is a crucial attribute for rightsizing business at VF Corp., which has been impacted by higher-than-usual inventory levels, executive turnover and a challenging wholesale environment.“Darrell does seem to have a strong track record,” wrote Wedbush analyst Tom Nikic in a Tuesday note to investors. “The biggest question mark is the lack of direct industry experience, as the apparel/footwear industry can be very challenging.” Nikic highlighted two prominent industry challenges: long product development cycles and rapidly changing consumer trends.According to Baird analyst Jonathan Komp, Darrell’s status as an industry “outsider” likely won’t impede his ability to affect change at the company. He noted that Darrell, who studied English in college, was relatively new to the technology industry when he joined Logitech in 2012 and was able to lead the company “through a period of meaningful transition, emphasizing new consumer technology categories, strengthening existing businesses and entering new markets.”Story continuesStifel analyst Jim Duffy also addressed concerns of Darrell being untested in the footwear and retail industries.“While not specific to footwear and apparel, we see the experience in consumer tech and consumer package goods as well as his outspoken commitment to social responsibility a good fit for leadership of the VFC organization,” Duffy wrote.He added that the CEO vacancy has weighed on the company since Steve Rendle left the position in December. Now that this is resolved, the company will need to focus on other areas, such as improving the brand portfolio, building and developing new brands, leveraging a DTC focused supply chain and becoming more agile. The company outlined these priorities in September as part of a long-term plan to gorw business through 2027.In fiscal 2024, VF expects total revenue growth to be between flat and up slightly in constant dollars. First quarter revenues are expected to be down in the high single digits. Earnings per share for the year are expected to land between $2.05 and $2.25.Best of Footwear NewsList of Footwear Company CEOs You Should KnowWith Minimum Wage on the Rise, These Are Some of the Highest Paid Retail JobsWhat Is Nike's Return Policy?

186,93776de9-e9b2-3ad4-9e9e-e00424a2cb6d,PFE,2023-06-21,Top 20 Countries With Highest Drug Consumption,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-20-countries-highest-drug-114850219.html,1687348130,STORY,['PFE'],"[In this piece, we will take a look at the top 20 countries with the highest drug consumption. To skip our primer on drug usage, its economic impacts, and the treatments for different addictions, head on over to Top 5 Countries With Highest Drug Consumption. Drug use is a global problem, and one that has provided users with novel ways to alter their state of mind as technology has progressed. Advances in chemical distillation and industrial equipment have enabled drug cartels to make novel new drugs such as methamphetamine and ecstasy - or purify them to exacting proportions for that elusive high.At the same time, the number of people that use drugs in the world will likely stun you. The population of the United States, according to the latest estimates by the Census Bureau is 332 million. And, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), a stunning 284 million people used drugs in the world as of 2020. As you can see, this is nearly equal to the population of America - one of the most populous nations in the world. This figure, covering drug users aged between 15 and 64 years of age, marked a 26% jump over the decade that ended in 2010. Comparing this with global population growth, which grew by 13% during the same time period, indicates that drug usage has outpaced population growth.Not only does drug use destroy countless lives, but the demand for these substances also affects others caught up in the web of global drug demand. Drug trafficking is one of the cruelest industries in the world, where drug mules from both developed and developing countries are exploited by cartels to smuggle drugs globally. According to data from the State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, there is not one single country that can be identified as a global drug trafficking hub. Instead, there are several that are the worst offenders when it comes to drug production and drug trafficking. In fact, the State Department has identified 22 countries that have either the highest drug trafficking or drug production in the world. This list of worst offenders includes Afghanistan, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Haiti,  India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nicaragua, Pakistan, and Venezuela. As you can check out for yourself, this list of countries which is from a 2022 report, is quite similar to our list of countries with the highest drug trafficking in 2018.Story continuesSo, how many kinds of different drugs (illicit) are there? Well, you're likely to have heard of some of the most common ones such as cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine. However, the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) takes a different look when determining the different kinds of drugs. According to its classification, drugs are primarily categorized into seven categories. These are central nervous system (CNS) depressants, CNS stimulants, hallucinogens, dissociative anesthetics, narcotic analgesics, inhalants, and cannabis. Some examples of the different kinds of drugs within these categories are MDMA, LSD, Oxycontin, heroin, cocaine, marijuana, and even everyday items such as plastic cement, gasoline, paint thinners, and hair sprays.The global prevalence of drug use and abuse has also led to nicknames of countries as 'drug capitals of the world.' Depending on the metric, we can classify several countries as drug capitals. For instance, when it comes to the Middle East, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is thought to be the drug capital. This is because of Captagon, a mood enhancing drug. Estimates show that more than half of the Captagon seized in the Middle East was in Saudi Arabia, after the drug initially gained popularity in the Syrian War as it was used by fighters to increase their endurance. When it comes to being the party drug capital of the world, it's Great Britain that takes the 'crown', particularly due to the high usage of cocaine in both Scotland and England. However, Scotland is also called the drug death capital of the world, as the highest number of drug deaths per 100,000 people in the world take place in the country.Finally, the costs of substance abuse are equally as staggering as the number of drug users worldwide. Estimates from the Department of Health and Human Services show that alcohol misuse costs the economy $249 billion annually while illicit drug use costs $193 billion. America also has the highest opiod use rate in the world, which in turn has enabled the creation of an $8.4 billion industry that aims to produce drugs to stop opioid abuse and addiction. And, some firms that are making treatments for opioid abuse are Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS), and West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. (NYSE:WST).One such treatment is reSET-O(TM) manufactured by the subsidiary of Novartis, Sandoz. Another is Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NYSE:AMRX) which makes the Naloxone nasal spray for opioid overdose treatment. At its earnings conference for the first quarter of 2023, the firm commented on this spray and shared:Next, let me highlight a few notable upcoming new product launches. First, as discussed last quarter, we are very excited about our ANDA for naloxone nasal spray, our generic version of Narcan which is currently under priority review with the US FDA. We believe this product now over-the-counter, will improve access to a critical life-saving opioid overdose treatment for millions of people across America.With these details in mind, let's take a look at countries with the highest drug consumption in the world.Top 20 Countries With Highest Drug ConsumptionPixabay/Public DomainOur Methodology To compile our list of the countries with the highest drug use we relied on data from the United Nations. Within this set, we first compiled estimates of countries with the highest usage of cocaine, amphetamines, and opioids on the basis of the percentage of use in their populations. Then, for each drug, the countries were ranked and awarded a score corresponding to their ranking. If a country was present on the list of one drug but absent from another, it was assigned a score corresponding to the lowest country on that particular list. Finally, the scores were averaged, and the final list of the countries with the highest drug use is as follows.Top 20 Countries With Highest Drug Consumption20. Republic of BulgariaInsider Monkey's Score: 36The Republic of Bulgaria is a Southeast European country. It has a $86 billion economy in nominal terms which corresponds to a GDP per capita of $12,340. Drug related crimes rank third in the number of crimes committed in the country by type - with car thefts being far more common.19. French RepublicInsider Monkey's Score: 36The French Republic, or France, is one of the most prosperous countries in the world. When comparing opioid, cocaine, and amphetamine use in the country, France ranks quite high in cocaine use, ranking 18th in the global ranking of cocaine users.18. Kingdom of SwedenInsider Monkey's Score: 35The Kingdom of Sweden is a developed Nordic European country. It has a $599 billion economy and one of the highest GDP per capita in the world at $55,295.

However, Latvia ranks at 40 when it comes to amphetamine use.15. Kingdom of Spain Insider Monkey's Score: 28.33 The Kingdom of Spain is another developed European country. The sole reason that it makes it to our list is because of high cocaine usage, which makes Spain the third largest cocaine user in the world - beaten only by Australia and Albania.14.

Some of the committee members wanted a broader recommendation, but others had concerns that there was not enough data about how effective the vaccines are in people over the age of 75 and other high-risk groups.""Those who are at high risk for disease and for high risk for hospitalizations and death were actually not included in the trials,"" said committee member Dr. Helen Keipp Talbot. ""The patient population that participated in the study were younger and healthier and had fewer comorbid conditions, were not immunocompromised and were not living in nursing homes.""The CDC's director needs to sign off on the recommendation before the vaccines can be made available. Both drugmakers have said they expect to be able to supply the shots ahead of the RSV season later this year.RSV usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms but can also lead to serious illness and hospitalization. It is estimated to be responsible for 14,000 deaths in adults aged 65 and older in the United States annually, according to government data.During the meeting, the companies presented data on whether one inoculation could remain effective over the course of two RSV seasons compared with protection seen with an annual shot.The efficacy of Pfizer's vaccine in preventing lower respiratory tract disease with three or more symptoms fell to 78.6% through the middle of a second RSV season from 88.9% at the end of the first season in older adults. Efficacy fell to 48.9% from about 65% for less severe forms of the disease in that age group.Story continuesWith the GSK vaccine, efficacy in preventing severe disease defined by three or more symptoms fell to 84.6% through the middle of the second RSV season, from about 94% at the end of first in older adults. Efficacy of the vaccine in preventing lower respiratory tract disease fell to 77.3% from 82.6% at the end of the first season in older adults.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration last month approved the first RSV vaccine from GSK, branded as Arexvy, and later Pfizer's Abrysvo for people aged 60 and older to protect them from lower respiratory tract disease caused by the virus.Pfizer and GSK have said they expect RSV vaccines to eventually become multibillion-dollar sellers.For this year, GSK has said it expects the U.S. market to be in the range of 10 million to 15 million people, a fraction of the size of the expected flu or COVID-19 market for 2023.At the meeting, GSK said it expects to price its shot between $200 and $295 a dose.

The drugmakers are expected to present new data on how protective their vaccines are over a second year at the meeting.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration last month approved the first RSV shot from GSK, branded as Arexvy, and later Pfizer's Abrysvo for people aged 60 and older to protect them from lower respiratory tract disease caused by the virus.Scientists have long sought a vaccine for RSV, which usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms but can also lead to serious illness and hospitalization. It is estimated to be responsible for 14,000 deaths in adults aged 65 and older in the United States annually, according to government data.Pfizer and GSK have said they expect RSV vaccines to eventually become multibillion-dollar sellers.GSK has said it expects the U.S. market to be in the range of 10 million to 15 million people this year, a fraction of the size of the expected flu or COVID-19 market for 2023.In its late-stage study, Pfizer's vaccine was nearly 67% effective among participants aged 60 and above with two or more symptoms, and 85.7% effective in preventing severe disease defined by three or more symptoms.GSK's vaccine showed overall efficacy of 82.6% and was about 94% effective against severe lower respiratory tract disease associated with an RSV infection.(Reporting by Raghav Mahobe in Bengaluru; Editing by Bill Berkrot)]"

This approval is based on the statistically significant and clinically meaningful radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) data from the Phase 3 TALAPRO-2 trial, which demonstrated a 55% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death in patients with mCRPC with prospectively identified HRR gene mutations (ATM, ATR, BRCA1, BRCA2, CDK12, CHEK2, FANCA, MLH1, MRE11A, NBN, PALB2, or RAD51C) treated with TALZENNA plus XTANDI vs placebo plus XTANDI (HR 0.45; 95% CI, 0.33–0.61; p&lt;0.0001).Metastatic CRPC is a form of prostate cancer that has spread beyond the prostate gland and has progressed despite medical or surgical treatment to lower testosterone. Approximately 10-20% of patients with prostate cancer develop mCRPC within 5-7 years of diagnosis,1 and in the U.S. in 2020, approximately 60-90 thousand of the three million cases of prostate cancer were mCRPC.2 HRR gene mutations are found in approximately 25% of tumors from men with mCRPC and have been associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis.3,4,5,6""Despite treatment advancement in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, the disease can progress quickly, and many patients may only receive one line of therapy. Therefore, new first-line treatment options are needed to reduce the risk of disease progression or death. For patients with mCRPC harboring HRR genetic alterations, outcomes are even worse,"" said Neeraj Agarwal, M.D., FASCO, Professor and Presidential Endowed Chair of Cancer Research at Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, and global lead investigator for TALAPRO-2. ""The FDA’s approval of the talazoparib and enzalutamide combination is based on the findings from the pivotal TALAPRO-2 study, which demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in the risk of progression or death among HRR gene-mutated tumors in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. It represents a treatment option deserving of excitement and attention.""Story continues""Pfizer has a legacy of bringing medicines to patients with genitourinary cancers and helping improve outcomes for patients suffering from advanced prostate cancer,"" said Angela Hwang, Chief Commercial Officer, President, Global Biopharmaceuticals Business, Pfizer. ""As a global standard of care, XTANDI has shown efficacy in three types of prostate cancer, and the addition of TALZENNA demonstrated significant improvements in delaying or preventing radiographic progression-free survival or death in patients with this type of advanced prostate cancer. With today’s FDA approval of TALZENNA plus XTANDI, we are proud to be able to offer this potentially practice-changing treatment to patients and add to their options in managing this aggressive disease.""The Phase 3 TALAPRO-2 trial is a two-part, two-cohort, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that included two patient cohorts: Cohort 1 (all-comers; n=805 and Cohort 2 (those with HRR mutations [HRRm]; n=399). The primary endpoint of the trial was rPFS, and overall survival (OS) was a key secondary endpoint. The results from the TALAPRO-2 Cohort 1 were previously reported and published in The Lancet. A trend in OS favoring TALZENNA plus XTANDI was also observed, though these data are immature. The final TALAPRO-2 OS data will be reported once the predefined number of survival events has been reached and, if appropriate, may be used to support a potential regulatory filing to benefit broader patient populations. The final OS data is expected in 2024.The safety of TALZENNA plus XTANDI in the TALAPRO-2 trial was generally consistent with the known safety profile of each medicine. Serious adverse reactions (ARs) occurred in 30% of patients treated with TALZENNA plus XTANDI. Serious adverse reactions reported in &gt;2% of patients included anemia (9%) and fracture (3%). Discontinuation of TALZENNA occurred in 10% of patients.A marketing authorization application (MAA) for the TALZENNA and XTANDI combination has been accepted for review by the European Medicines Agency. Pfizer has also shared data with other regulatory agencies to support regulatory filings.About TALZENNA® (talazoparib)TALZENNA (talazoparib) is an oral inhibitor of poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), which plays a role in DNA damage repair. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that TALZENNA blocks PARP enzyme activity and traps PARP at the site of DNA damage, leading to decreased cancer cell growth and cancer cell death.TALZENNA is approved in over 70 countries, including the U.S., as a once-daily monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA)-mutated (gBRCAm) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. In the U.S., TALZENNA is now approved in combination with XTANDI® (enzalutamide) for the treatment of adult patients with homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).TALZENNA® (talazoparib) Indication in the U.S. TALZENNA (talazoparib) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA)-mutated (gBRCAm) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Select patients for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for TALZENNA. TALZENNA is indicated in combination with enzalutamide for the treatment of adult patients with homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).TALZENNA® (talazoparib) Important Safety Information WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONSMyelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia (MDS/AML), including cases with a fatal outcome, has been reported in patients who received TALZENNA. Overall, MDS/AML has been reported in 0.4% (3 out of 788) of solid tumor patients treated with TALZENNA as a single agent in clinical studies. In TALAPRO-2, MDS/AML occurred in 2 out of 511 (0.4%) patients treated with TALZENNA and enzalutamide and in 0 out of 517 (0%) patients treated with placebo and enzalutamide. The durations of TALZENNA treatment in these five patients prior to developing MDS/AML were 0.3, 1, 2, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Most of these patients had received previous chemotherapy with platinum agents and/or other DNA damaging agents including radiotherapy.Do not start TALZENNA until patients have adequately recovered from hematological toxicity caused by previous chemotherapy. Monitor blood counts monthly during treatment with TALZENNA. For prolonged hematological toxicities, interrupt TALZENNA and monitor blood counts weekly until recovery. If counts do not recover within 4 weeks, refer the patient to a hematologist for further investigations including bone marrow analysis and blood sample for cytogenetics. If MDS/AML is confirmed, discontinue TALZENNA.Myelosuppression consisting of anemia, neutropenia, and/or thrombocytopenia have been reported in patients treated with TALZENNA . In TALAPRO-2, Grade ≥3 anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia were reported, respectively, in 45%, 18%, and 8% of patients receiving TALZENNA and enzalutamide. Overall, 39% of patients (199/511) required a red blood cell transfusion, including 22% (111/511) who required multiple transfusions. Discontinuation due to anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia occurred, respectively, in 7%, 3%, and 0.4% of patients.Withhold TALZENNA until patients have adequately recovered from hematological toxicity caused by previous therapy. Monitor blood counts monthly during treatment with TALZENNA. If hematological toxicities do not resolve within 28 days, discontinue TALZENNA and refer the patient to a hematologist for further investigations including bone marrow analysis and blood sample for cytogenetics.Embryo-Fetal Toxicity TALZENNA can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential or who are pregnant to use effective contraception during treatment with TALZENNA and for 4 months after receiving the last dose.ADVERSE REACTIONSSerious adverse reactions reported in &gt;2% of patients included anemia (9%) and fracture (3%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 1.5% of patients, including pneumonia, COVID infection, and sepsis (1 patient each).The most common adverse reactions (≥ 10%, all Grades), including laboratory abnormalities, for patients in the TALAPRO-2 study who received TALZENNA in combination with enzalutamide vs patients receiving placebo with enzalutamide were hemoglobin decreased (79% vs 34%), neutrophils decreased (60% vs 18%), lymphocytes decreased (58% vs 36%), fatigue (49% vs 40%), platelets decreased (45% vs 8%), calcium decreased (25% vs 11%), nausea (21% vs 17%), decreased appetite (20% vs 14%), sodium decreased (22% vs 20%), phosphate decreased (17% vs 13%), fractures (14% vs 10%), magnesium decreased (14% vs 12%), dizziness (13% vs 9%), bilirubin increased (11% vs 7%), potassium decreased (11% vs 7%), and dysgeusia (10% vs 4.5%).Clinically relevant adverse reactions in &lt;10% of patients who received TALZENNA with enzalutamide included abdominal pain (9%), vomiting (9%), alopecia (7%), dyspepsia (4%), venous thromboembolism (3%) and stomatitis (2%).Based on animal studies, TALZENNA may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential.DRUG INTERACTIONSCoadministration with P-gp inhibitors The effect of coadministration of P-gp inhibitors on talazoparib exposure when TALZENNA is taken in combination with enzalutamide has not been studied. Monitor patients for increased adverse reactions and modify the dosage as recommended for adverse reactions when TALZENNA is coadministered with a P-gp inhibitor.Coadministration with BCRP inhibitors Monitor patients for increased adverse reactions and modify the dosage as recommended for adverse reactions when TALZENNA is coadministered with a BCRP inhibitor. Coadministration of TALZENNA with BCRP inhibitors may increase talazoparib exposure, which may increase the risk of adverse reactions.USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONSRenal Impairment The recommended dosage of TALZENNA for patients with moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 - 59 mL/min) is 0.35 mg taken orally once daily in combination with enzalutamide. The recommended dosage of TALZENNA for patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr 15 - 29 mL/min) is 0.25 mg taken orally once daily in combination with enzalutamide. No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild renal impairment. TALZENNA has not been studied in patients requiring hemodialysis.Please see full U.S. Prescribing Information and Patient Information for TALZENNA® (talazoparib) at www.TALZENNA.com.

Please check back for the updated full information shortly.About XTANDI® (enzalutamide) and Important Safety InformationXTANDI (enzalutamide) is an androgen receptor signaling inhibitor. XTANDI is a standard of care that has received regulatory approvals for use in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC), metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), and non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) in the United States and for one or more of these indications in more than 100 countries, including the European Union and Japan. More than one million patients have been treated with XTANDI globally.7Warnings and PrecautionsSeizure occurred in 0.5% of patients receiving XTANDI in seven randomized clinical trials. In a study of patients with predisposing factors for seizure, 2.2% of XTANDI-treated patients experienced a seizure. It is unknown whether anti-epileptic medications will prevent seizures with XTANDI. Patients in the study had one or more of the following predisposing factors: use of medications that may lower the seizure threshold, history of traumatic brain or head injury, history of cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack, and Alzheimer’s disease, meningioma, or leptomeningeal disease from prostate cancer, unexplained loss of consciousness within the last 12 months, history of seizure, presence of a space occupying lesion of the brain, history of arteriovenous malformation, or history of brain infection. Advise patients of the risk of developing a seizure while taking XTANDI and of engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious harm to themselves or others. Permanently discontinue XTANDI in patients who develop a seizure during treatment.Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES): There have been reports of PRES in patients receiving XTANDI. PRES is a neurological disorder that can present with rapidly evolving symptoms including seizure, headache, lethargy, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurological disturbances, with or without associated hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES requires confirmation by brain imaging, preferably MRI. Discontinue XTANDI in patients who develop PRES.Hypersensitivity reactions, including edema of the face (0.5%), tongue (0.1%), or lip (0.1%) have been observed with XTANDI in seven randomized clinical trials. Pharyngeal edema has been reported in post-marketing cases. Advise patients who experience any symptoms of hypersensitivity to temporarily discontinue XTANDI and promptly seek medical care. Permanently discontinue XTANDI for serious hypersensitivity reactions.Ischemic Heart Disease: In the combined data of four randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies, ischemic heart disease occurred more commonly in patients on the XTANDI arm compared to patients on the placebo arm (2.9% vs 1.3%). Grade 3–4 ischemic events occurred in 1.4% of patients on XTANDI versus 0.7% on placebo. Ischemic events led to death in 0.4% of patients on XTANDI compared to 0.1% on placebo. Monitor for signs and symptoms of ischemic heart disease. Optimize management of cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia. Discontinue XTANDI for Grade 3–4 ischemic heart disease.Falls and Fractures occurred in patients receiving XTANDI. Evaluate patients for fracture and fall risk. Monitor and manage patients at risk for fractures according to established treatment guidelines and consider use of bone-targeted agents. In the combined data of four randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies, falls occurred in 11% of patients treated with XTANDI compared to 4% of patients treated with placebo. Fractures occurred in 10% of patients treated with XTANDI and in 4% of patients treated with placebo.Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: The safety and efficacy of XTANDI have not been established in females. XTANDI can cause fetal harm and loss of pregnancy when administered to a pregnant female. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with XTANDI and for 3 months after the last dose of XTANDI.Adverse Reactions (ARs)In the data from the four randomized placebo-controlled trials, the most common ARs (≥ 10%) that occurred more frequently (≥ 2% over placebo) in XTANDI-treated patients were asthenia/fatigue, back pain, hot flush, constipation, arthralgia, decreased appetite, diarrhea, and hypertension. In the bicalutamide-controlled study, the most common ARs (≥ 10%) reported in XTANDI-treated patients were asthenia/fatigue, back pain, musculoskeletal pain, hot flush, hypertension, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection, and weight loss.In AFFIRM, the placebo-controlled study of metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) patients who previously received docetaxel, Grade 3 and higher ARs were reported among 47% of XTANDI-treated patients. Discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) were reported for 16% of XTANDI-treated patients. In PREVAIL, the placebo-controlled study of chemotherapy-naive mCRPC patients, Grade 3–4 ARs were reported in 44% of XTANDI patients and 37% of placebo patients. Discontinuations due to AEs were reported for 6% of XTANDI-treated patients. In TERRAIN, the bicalutamide-controlled study of chemotherapy-naive mCRPC patients, Grade 3–4 ARs were reported in 39% of XTANDI patients and 38% of bicalutamide patients. Discontinuations with an AE as the primary reason were reported for 8% of XTANDI patients and 6% of bicalutamide patients.In PROSPER, the placebo-controlled study of non-metastatic CRPC (nmCRPC) patients, Grade 3 or higher ARs were reported in 31% of XTANDI patients and 23% of placebo patients. Discontinuations with an AE as the primary reason were reported for 9% of XTANDI patients and 6% of placebo patients.In ARCHES, the placebo-controlled study of metastatic CSPC (mCSPC) patients, Grade 3 or higher AEs were reported in 24% of XTANDI-treated patients. Permanent discontinuation due to AEs as the primary reason was reported in 5% of XTANDI patients and 4% of placebo patients.Lab Abnormalities: Lab abnormalities that occurred in ≥ 5% of patients, and more frequently (&gt; 2%) in the XTANDI arm compared to placebo in the pooled, randomized, placebo-controlled studies are neutrophil count decreased, white blood cell decreased, hyperglycemia, hypermagnesemia, hyponatremia, and hypercalcemia.Hypertension: In the combined data from four randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials, hypertension was reported in 12% of XTANDI patients and 5% of placebo patients. Hypertension led to study discontinuation in &lt; 1% of patients in each arm.Drug InteractionsEffect of Other Drugs on XTANDI Avoid strong CYP2C8 inhibitors, as they can increase the plasma exposure to XTANDI. If co-administration is necessary, reduce the dose of XTANDI. Avoid strong CYP3A4 inducers as they can decrease the plasma exposure to XTANDI. If co-administration is necessary, increase the dose of XTANDI.Effect of XTANDI on Other Drugs Avoid CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, as XTANDI may decrease the plasma exposures of these drugs. If XTANDI is co-administered with warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), conduct additional INR monitoring.Please see Full Prescribing Information for additional safety information.About Pfizer OncologyAt Pfizer Oncology, we are committed to advancing medicines wherever we believe we can make a meaningful difference in the lives of people living with cancer.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Novartis (NVS) earns a Zacks Rank #2 28 days from its next quarterly earnings release on July 18, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.70 a share.Novartis' Earnings ESP sits at 1.92%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.70 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.67.NVS is just one of a large group of Medical stocks with a positive ESP figure. Pfizer (PFE) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Pfizer, which is readying to report earnings on July 27, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $0.71 a share, and PFE is 37 days out from its next earnings report.Pfizer's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 12.44% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.63.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, NVS and PFE could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

(NASDAQ:PYPL) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:""We first invested in PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), the online and mobile e‐ commerce payments company, during the third quarter of 2015. Over the past decade, we have studied PayPal’s ability to grow its extensive dual network (difficult to replicate, in our opinion) while navigating numerous competitors entering the industry. During our ownership period, the company has increased its payment volumes and made progress on many of its strategic initiatives, including adding partnerships with various companies (e.g., Walmart and American Express). We believe this has made the company a stronger force in the payments ecosystem. More recently, PayPal has shifted from its prior strategy of growing its user base to instead focusing on increasing transactions per user. The company has also seen an ongoing mix shift away from the PayPal branded checkout business toward its non‐branded business Braintree. The non‐ branded business has a lower take rate, as its customers are primarily large enterprises (like Uber, Airbnb and Live Nation) with which bespoke rates are negotiated. In addition, PayPal has experienced recent leadership changes, including the 2022 departure of then‐CFO John Rainey and CEO Dan Schulman’s announced retirement at the end of 2023. We will continue our research on the payments business and take our time to better understand these transitions. In the meantime, we decided PayPal was the best candidate for sale to fund the purchase of a what we believe to be a more optimal investment (which we will discuss at a later date).""Story continuespaypal, buy, rose, business, app, editorial, technology, touch, computer, phablet, mobile, woman, electronic, smartphone, payment, purchase, background, device, online,Denys Prykhodov / Shutterstock.comPayPal Holdings, Inc.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this technology and consulting company have returned +7.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5.4% change. The Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, to which IBM belongs, has gained 10% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.IBM is expected to post earnings of $1.98 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -14.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of $9.31 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +2%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.76 indicates a change of +4.9% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for IBM.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of IBM, the consensus sales estimate of $15.5 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -0.2%. The $61.89 billion and $64.14 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.3% and +3.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIBM reported revenues of $14.25 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +0.4%. EPS of $1.36 for the same period compares with $1.40 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.27 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.15%. The EPS surprise was +7.09%.Over the last four quarters, IBM surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.IBM is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about IBM. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But Jeremy Bryan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Gradient Investments, says Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley could benefit from the AI hype. Bryan also lays out why he is not a fan of Molson Coors and Caterpillar.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]- Well, they're having fun. As investors, potential headwinds for the recent market rally. We're looking at potential stock opportunities and names to steer away from. And to do so we have Jeremy Bryan back with us, Gradient Investments senior portfolio manager. Jeremy, let's get right into this and start with your picks first, who are your faves?JEREMY BRYAN: What we're leaning towards right now is a little bit of a derivative play, if you will. It's Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. And the reason why we say that is that I believe that over the next year, pretty much every new company that's going to be introduced is going to have AI after it. And how these two are going to be affected by that is that I really think that we're at the bottom or bottoming process of the investment banking IPO cycle.And I think if you look at AI right now, it's really favored the incumbents to start, as your Microsofts, your Alphabets, those types of companies. Where I think this evolves to in year 2 and going forward will be new companies that start up that have technologies, services, applications around AI. And I think there will be somewhat of a frenzy to get out and get public as a result of that. And I think the beneficiaries of that are going to be Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.So from that perspective, they have good wealth management, traditional asset management businesses that I think are still going to be relatively healthy. And then a second wave coming from the IPO side, which should benefit them over the next two to three years, I'd be buying these right now.- Jeremy, what is it more specifically, maybe it might be that wealth management exposure there that you just mentioned. But what makes Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs better positioned in your eyes than their big competitors here like a city, like a-- what else do we have? JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, some of those other larger Banks?Story continuesJEREMY BRYAN: Very simply is less banking exposure. Is that they are not-- the Citigroup, Wells Fargo's of the world, a lot of their revenue, a lot of their earnings comes from the traditional banking structure. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, to be honest with you, Goldman Sachs failed at their traditional banking offering. Is that they're really pulling back from that and going back to what their core is, if you will.So that's what we want as an opportunity going forward is much more of that investment banking oriented wealth management side. While Citi and Wells will definitely benefit from those kinds of things, the traditional banking side is what we want to have away from to a certain extent to focus on. And Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs will just benefit to a greater degree from that.- Jeremy, let me ask you a leadership question about both of these banks. So Morgan Stanley, of course, we know their CEO is heading out. They haven't named a successor yet but, one, are you satisfied given that the trajectory of who's possible-- who's being talked about as a potential new CEO. And then of course, Goldman Sachs. They've been in the hot seat David Solomon being criticized for his handling of different things.And one of the things, of course, that Goldman is under the microscope about as is its role with SVB and possibly playing both sides of the coin. You have the government looking at them. Regarding that, does that give you any cause for concern?JEREMY BRYAN: Sure. Always cause for concern but it's more of a monitoring situation. Is that these are not companies that are brand new. By any stretch of the imagination, leadership can certainly have an influence and an impact on what their future trajectory holds. But really the businesses in the exposures generally tend to win out. And if they're truly destroying capital, there will be an adjustment that will have to be made at the top. And we're going to monitor it.We're going to pay attention to it. We understand it as a risk potential factor there. But really what we're buying is that business exposure. And generally these companies have benefited from those. And we don't think enough of their business has changed to really say that that's not going to happen in the future.- All right. Jeremy, let's get to some of your icks here, some of the stocks that you're saying to avoid. Molson Coors was the one that stuck out to me because quite frankly it has been a top performer since the start of the year. Why do you see that momentum fading here in the back half?JEREMY BRYAN: A lot of it has been a controversy from a competitive brand. That's why people have flocked to this in a market share shift. But really that's why we're looking at this and saying, I would not be buying here now as the stock has massively accelerated. This year alone, it's sitting at near five-year high valuations. And from my perspective, it does not change the course while market share could absolutely shift.They may be right in that regard. I don't know yet whether the long-term trajectory has changed or not, we'll find out. But what I do know is that the overall industry is still relatively challenged. The domestic US beer market is still not, what I would call a growth market by any stretch of the imagination. So from that perspective, that's where it becomes a little bit challenging, to say I would be buying here right now.And so from that, if you've made profit in the name great, good, I would be looking to maybe take that profit. And then secondarily, if I did not own a position, which we do not, I would not be looking to add here right now.- Well, you're certainly not contrary to the broader analyst list of where they stand. I mean, look more than half of analysts see it as a hold. So you fall in line with that. But let's talk about your other caterpillars on the list. Explain this one.JEREMY BRYAN: The cyclical trade might run a little too far too fast. That's really-- the thought there is that we've seen a mid-teens, I believe, rebound off of the recent lows here to where the stock has really propelled higher on just a hope that we're done with the fed or those things. But this is a heavy cyclical name and we don't think that that area is ripe for re-acceleration as of yet.And so from our perspective, it's just saying that this is probably not an opportune time to be buying into caterpillar. We think more likely there's downside in the future in the next 6 to 12 months to where if you want to own caterpillar for the long term trends of growth, whether China comes back and does industrial type of things or whether the US continues to build in the infrastructure, we think there's better entry points down the road than there certainly are right now.- All right. Buy the dip. Jeremy Bryan, thank you so much, we appreciate you as usual.]"

(NYSE:TAP) continues to recover from the pandemic and has recently shot up to new multi-year highs. I believe this uptrend should continue, though at a slower pace. Molson Coors is also a post-acquisition deleveraging story similar to Anheuser Busch-Inbev (NYSE:BUD), which I wrote about previously, but Molson Coors is further along the process.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with TAP. Click here to check it out. TAP 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of TAPPeter Lynch Chart of TAPAcquisition and company historyMolson Coors went for scale when Anheuser-Busch Inbev was forced to divest the MillerCoors joint venture business in North America when it acquired SABMiller in 2016 to receive regulatory approval in the U.S. The Beer business is a scale business so this makes sense.Anheuser-Busch gave up SABMiller's ownership of the Miller brands by selling its 58% stake in MillerCoors to Molson Coors for $12 billion. Previously, MillerCoors was owned by SABMiller and Denver-based Molson Coors in a joint venture. Molson Coors took on a large amount of debt to fund the acquisition.After the acquisition, integration was initially problematic as is typical with large mergers and then in 2020 Covid-19 hit, driving the share price down as the company's on premises (bars and restaurants) business dried up. The debt and covid related drop in sales scared the market as investors panicked. There was also the huge popularity of non-beer alcoholic beverages like, Truly and White Claw coolers among younger demographics during that period (which has since abated) as well as the increased adoption of craft beers (which is still going strong, and now looks like a secular trend).Molson-Coors Is In the ZoneRecovering fundamentalsThe company is now putting these problems behind it as the pandemic recovery proceeds, and it readjusts to the competitive threats. Profits margins are coming back and Molson Coors is rapidly deleveraging (the company has paid down about $5.5 billion in debt over the past six and a half years). Dividends, which were cut to cope with the Covid-19 crisis, have been reinstated and profitability is improving. The company is even buying back some stock. As such, the company is much improved fundamentally compared to five years ago.Story continuesMolson-Coors Is In the ZoneMolson Coors' operating margins, which dipped slightly in 2022 as the company fought back for market share, are expected to get back to historical levels.Molson-Coors Is In the ZoneTAP Data by GuruFocusThe table below shows improvements in Molson Coors' revenue and free cash flow from last year. The stock has responded strongly, having climbed over 35% year to date. While earnings per share was negative in the recent quarter due to non-cash charges and adjustments, Wall Street analysts are projecting continued improvement over the next couple of years. The forward price-earnings ratio is about 16, which looks fairly valued in my opinion.Growth Rates (Per Share)Annuals (Year End)Analyst EstimateFiscal Period10-Year5-Year1-YearDec 20Dec 21Dec 22Dec 23Dec 24Dec 25Revenue11.30%-1.10%2.40%9,65410,279.710,70111,13911,14611,218EPS without NRI---124.10%-4.384.62-0.814.154.374.5EBIT13.40%-6.60%-39.70%-369.31,499.3188.11,3751,4201,448EBITDA-1.50%-17.50%-66.70%552.72,285.4872.91,9022,1532,190Free Cash Flow1.90%-9.90%4.60%1,120.91,050.9840.6---Dividends-3.70%-11.50%46.20%0.570.681.521.631.721.79Book Value4.30%-0.70%-5.90%57.0761.8358.67---Price (Total Return)5.30%1.90%35.20%45.1946.3551.52---ValuationA comparative analysis of selected major mass brewers is given below.

According to the price at median price-sales ratio chart below, Molson Coors could be trading at over $100 if it were to trade with its median historical price-sales ratio. However, it is uncertain if the valuation ratios will get back to peak levels any time soon.Molson-Coors Is In the ZoneTAP Data byMolson-Coors Is In the ZoneOn a discounted cash flow basis, using free cash flow as a starting point, the stock looks fairly valued based on the following assumptions:Molson-Coors Is In the ZoneMolson-Coors Is In the ZoneConclusionOverall, Molson Coors looks like it has recovered nicely. It is certainly not the bargain it was last year. However, the stock is still undervalued by my estimates at its current levels, so I believe there is some gas left in the tank to power the brewer to another 20% gain in the next two to three years. Plus, we now have a growing dividend and a significantly deleveraged company which is much safer than before. Once the company reaches a comfortable debt level it can start to buy back stock. I am thus sticking with my investment in the stock for now.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of the utility sector and its outlook, and go directly to read 5 Best Utility Dividend Stocks To Buy. The utility sector in the US is responsible for providing essential services such as electricity, water, and natural gas to residential, commercial, and industrial consumers. Utility stocks are considered to be defensive investments as they provide stable dividends and exhibit lower volatility compared to other sectors. In 2022, when inflation was at its record high, the Dow Jones Utility Average lost about merely 1.4%, compared with an 18% decline in the S&amp;P 500. In addition to this, electricity sales in the US showed an upward trend in the US last year, showing a 3.6% year-over-year growth in the first eight months of the year, as we reported in our article 12 Cheap Utility Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.Many utility companies in the US are regulated by the government to ensure the provision of essential services in a fair, reliable, and safe manner. Regulators also oversee and approve utility rates and returns on equities. While utility companies may argue for higher returns in high-interest rate periods, regulators become cautious about approving rate increases as they could burden consumers with higher costs. Karl Dunkle Werner and Stephen Jarvis’research published by the Energy Institute at Haas showed that due to higher costs, utility consumers could potentially be paying between $2 billion to $20 billion annually compared to what they would pay. Moreover, electric and gas utilities tracked by S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights requested $12.4 billion in rate increases in 2022 through October. One reason for this is that utility companies often require significant capital investments to maintain and upgrade their infrastructure and comply with environmental regulations.Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) may aid in achieving this potential. According to a report published by Goldman Sachs, the impact of the IRA could lead to a staggering $11 trillion in infrastructure investments by 2050. The report further mentioned that by 2032, there will be a total investment opportunity of $2.9 trillion across different sectors for energy system transformation in the US. This translates to an average annual investment of $290 billion.Story continuesAlso read: 10 Best Electric Utility Stocks To Buy NowAs we mentioned above, utility stocks are generally considered defensive investments because of the stable demand for the sector’s services and products. This means that these stocks can be great options to weather this market uncertainty. Analysts are also projecting a bullish outlook on the sector this year. Timothy Winter, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, spoke with Forbes earlier this year and highlighted the significance of utility stocks in this clean energy era. He said:“Utilities are growing earnings at stronger than historical rates (5%-7% versus 3%-4%) as they continue to ramp up investment to transform from fossil fuel to clean energy. This requires new wind, solar, and battery storage as well as other new technologies (green hydrogen, carbon capture), upgraded transmission to move power around and handle intermittent wind/solar, upgrade distribution for solar panels, EV charging, and electrification.”Another quality that makes utility stocks stand out is their stable dividends. Nearly all utility companies pay regular dividends to shareholders because of their consistent revenue streams. Some of the best dividend stocks in the utility sector include NextEra Energy, Inc.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the stock market outlook, skip over to 5 Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 2023. Wall Street analysts are still largely split when it comes to their forecasts for the S&amp;P 500 index, despite the year being halfway through. The difference in opinion among analysts has grown even more since the benchmark index emerged from its lengthiest bear market since 1948. Goldman Sachs raised its end of year target for the S&amp;P 500 from 4,000 to 4,500, noting that their 2023 earnings-per-share projections remain unmodified. Goldman Sachs speculates that a soft landing will be delivered by the Federal Reserve, despite the brutal interest rate hikes over the last year to counter inflation. The firm believes that market sectors that are underperforming so far have the potential to keep pace with market leaders. The mega-cap tech stocks are dominating the market this year, and the profits from artificial intelligence can potentially prolong the current stock market upswing. On the other hand, Morgan Stanley reiterated its negative stance on the stock market, noting that the bear market is not over and an earnings recession is projected to hinder any further gains. Michael Wilson, the chief equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, expects the S&amp;P 500 to sink to 3,900 by year-end. On May 23, Reuters polled 43 Wall Street strategists and they believe that the S&amp;P 500 index is expected to experience a decline by the end of 2023. These strategists think that investor sentiment will be negatively impacted due to high interest rates, banking failures, and disappointing earnings. They expect the S&amp;P 500 index to close at 4,150 at the end of 2023. The substantial gains this year are predominantly attributed to the growth and technology sectors, which led to significant market rallies and offset some of the instability caused by collapsing regional banks. According to Jonathan Golub, head of U.S. equity strategy and quantitative research for Credit Suisse, the S&amp;P 500 will likely close at 4,050 at the end of this year. He told Reuters: Story continues""It's just a very uninspiring, low-growth backdrop, with tight monetary policy and earnings that will be down this year versus last."" Data from Refinitiv suggests that the forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of the S&amp;P 500 is presently 19, compared to 17 recorded at the end of 2022 and exceeding the long-term average of approximately 16. UBS Global Wealth Management has a year-end S&amp;P 500 target of 3,800, and Nadia Lovell, a senior U.S. equity strategist at UBS, said: ""Historically, when you've seen this level of valuation, it's normally associated with re-acceleration in earnings and also an outlook for double-digit earnings growth going forward. We don't see that happening."" Market expectations are increasingly varied. For example, RBC Capital, citing improved earnings expectations, limited layoffs, and rebounding corporate sentiment, raised its end of year S&amp;P 500 price target to 4,250 from 4,100. Bloomberg cited Lori Calvasina, head of US equity strategy at RBC Capital, who commented: “While our new target still reflects a fairly neutral view on the direction of stocks through year end, when asked we do acknowledge more upside risks than downside risks. We’ve also been struck by how many bearish leaning investors have been asking us to walk them through the bull case and explain why stocks have been so resilient.”Amid the mixed market sentiment on Wall Street, some of the worst performing S&amp;P 500 stocks include DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH), Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP), and Newell Brands Inc. (NASDAQ:NWL). Our MethodologyFor this list, we screened the S&amp;P 500 stocks and chose the 20 worst performing companies based on highest decline in share prices year-to-date as of June 16, 2023. We have ranked the list in ascending order of the year-to-date share price drop. 20 Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 2023Image By peshkov - Adobe StockWorst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 202320.

(NYSE:AAP), and Newell Brands Inc. (NASDAQ:NWL), MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) is one of the worst performing S&amp;P 500 stocks in 2023. 19. International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. (NYSE:IFF)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 23.94%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc.

(NYSE:IFF) in its Q1 2021 investor letter:“We are still getting used to the higher multiples that investors will pay for larger market cap and pure play companies such as IFF. We do understand the market’s rationale. IFF’s products account for a small percentage of the customers’ cost while playing critical roles in the products’ performance. With some operating leverage, the company can probably grow FCF at 4-6% a year. This brings the total return close to the long-term return of the S&amp;P 500 index of 10%. Through trial and error, we have come to appreciate how scale, higher market share, route densities, switching costs, and collaborative relationships amongst major industry players can contribute to sustained high returns on invested capital.”18. The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 24.08%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) is a power generation and utility company using coal, gas, hydro, wind, solar, biomass, and renewable sources.

We invested in AES in December 2020 at an average entry price of $21.3 and invested in PIF in July 2020 at an average entry price of 16.36 CAD. We are currently underwater on PIF and making money in AES. Our near-term outlook for both positions is mixed. AES had a solid year in 2022, up 13%; it has telegraphed growth in earnings and cash flow through 2025 and seems to be hitting its targets. We will have to see what the year holds for utilities and AES, but another year like last year, and the firm will be touching our full value expectations.”17. U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 25.07%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) was founded in 1863 and is headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Even though the Fund has a similar weight to Financials as the index, our bank stocks—U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Charles Schwab (SCHW)—fell more than the Financials sector and hurt relative performance. We have performed a thorough analysis of our banking stocks and believe that they will exit this banking event intact, and a few may even benefit from the sector turmoil.The largest detractors from relative performance in the quarter were US Bank, Charles Schwab, UnitedHealth Group (UNH), and Hormel (HRL). The first two got caught up in the previously mentioned bank scare. With the selloff in the quarter, we have added to US Bank selectively, but more so to JPMorgan as it appears better positioned to gather deposits in the current environment.”16. Organon &amp; Co.

CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is buying OSH for $39 per share, or about $10 billion. When shorting, there is always the risk that someone with deep pockets will buy out the company at a silly price, or maybe even at twice a silly price. CVS is worth $115 billion (or it was the day they announced the deal; subsequently, CVS’s shares have fallen and it’s now worth $93 billion), so it can afford to piss away $10 billion.OSH is in value-based care, which has become a trendy segment of the market. Most of the “value” comes from doing a more thorough and aggressive job of documenting how sick a patient is, so as to maximize Medicare payments. OSH operates 169 clinics (costing between $1.5-$2 million to build) in mostly lower income neighborhoods and employs 600 doctors. CVS projects that in 2026 the pro forma entity will have 300 clinics and “embedded EBITDA” of $2 billion, plus over $500 million of synergies.In 2022, OSH generated less than $1 million of adjusted revenue per doctor2 and lost $500 million (almost $3 million per clinic). Even if it triples the number of doctors by 2026, it will need over $1 million of “embedded EBITDA” per doctor, implying margins shifting from a loss to nearly 100%. Obviously, this can’t happen, as the doctors need to be paid and there are other substantial costs. The amazing thing is that when rumors of this deal circulated, we reached out to CVS management and had a call where we walked them through the math… and they went ahead with the deal anyway. When the proxy came out, it revealed that OSH conducted an auction and, like a late-night eBay shopper who had one too many glasses of wine, CVS raised its uncontested bid several times… Rant over.”13.

(NASDAQ:MRNA) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) is a leader in the emerging field of mRNA-based vaccines and therapeutics and was one of the three main producers of the COVID vaccine. Shares fell during the quarter. We believe as COVID shifts away from pandemic status and becomes an increasingly commercial market (rather than government funded), there is increasing investor uncertainty around what a booster market could look like, which is pressuring shares. Looking beyond COVID, we think Moderna has the potential to disrupt the biopharmaceutical industry, from infectious disease vaccines to oncology, and we remain shareholders.”12. Enphase Energy, Inc.

(NASDAQ:ENPH) designs, develops, manufactures and sells home energy solutions in the U.S. and internationally for the solar industry. The company is the world’s leading manufacturer of microinverters that convert solar-generated D.C. energy to A.C. energy usable in homes and buildings. Enphase introduced the world’s first microinverter system in 2008 and has expanded its offerings to include battery storage systems and proprietary technologies that provide energy monitoring and control services for solar energy systems. It sells its products and solutions directly to solar system distributors, large installers and strategic partners.We see Enphase having a substantial market share that is gained through a premium product offering, superior customer service and the development of a large and diverse network of solar installers and distributors. The company’s products and services address a growing residential solar market. Coupling battery backup systems with existing and newly installed residential solar systems could accelerate the company’s revenue and earnings growth over the next several years, in our view. Additionally, commercial and international expansion offer additional revenue and earnings upside. Enphase also plans to expand manufacturing capacity in the U.S. during 2023 to benefit from tax incentives related to domestic production included in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).”11. V.F.

Corporation (NYSE:VFC) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Apparel and footwear company V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC)’s stock declined in Q4 after management lowered guidance based on weaker-than-expected demand in North America, higher promotions and elevated wholesale order cancellations.

For FY23, the company forecasts revenues between $4.650 billion to $4.80 billion, down from the earlier guidance of $4.95 billion to $5.00 billion. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 34 hedge funds were bullish on EPAM Systems, Inc.

(NYSE:EPAM) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“The portfolio’s returns in the roaring IT sector were hampered by software-engineering company EPAM Systems, Inc. (NYSE:EPAM) and payment-services provider Network International. EPAM signaled a more cautious outlook for growth and cost pressures related to the geographic reconfiguration of its East European engineering workforce in the wake of the war in Ukraine. UAE-based Network International indicated that challenging macroeconomic conditions in Africa may hinder near-term growth. In Communication Services, detractors included Safaricom, the leading mobile-network operator and payment-services company in Kenya, where the currency has weakened amid high inflation and a sizable current account deficit.Buying Globant didn’t increase our portfolio weight in IT services, as the purchase was funded by reducing two other industry holdings, EPAM and Tata Consultancy Services, for which valuations had become less attractive. EPAM’s share price fell sharply in early 2022 after Russia invaded Ukraine, given that close to 60% of the company’s staff was working in the affected countries of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. We were patient through this period as EPAM management restructured its workforce; only 30% are now based in these three countries. Despite the disruption, productivity remained comparable to pre-war times, and EPAM managed to retain nearly all of its customers. As a result, the stock recovered from its lows last year, offering an opportunity to trim our position.”8.

During the first quarter, Dollar General reported solid comps, as their core lower-income consumer remained resilient despite rising inflation.”7. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 33.61%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 87The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) specializes in wealth management, securities brokerage, banking, asset management, custody, and financial advisory services.

Similarly, the company expects an even worse year-over-year drop in Q2 revenue, citing a reduced net interest margin (NIM) and a smaller base of interest-earning assets, combined with decreased trading activity.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 87 hedge funds were bullish on The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), compared to 74 funds in the last quarter. D E Shaw is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 12.2 million shares worth $642.7 million. Generation Investment Management Global Equity Strategy made the following comment about The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“Your portfolio has been relatively insulated from recent banking troubles. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is the only financials company in your portfolio (forming 2.37% of it). The company’s share price has suffered. We are watching the situation closely. Regulators have responded quickly to the turmoil. After a few weeks when people were withdrawing deposits from small banks across America, the rush seems to have slowed.We do not have strong views on whether the banking turmoil will tip the global economy into recession. We are not economists, and in any case the global economy has rarely been so hard to predict. Forecasters are trying to weigh up a large number of highly unusual variables: a land war in Europe, the fallout from massive fiscal stimulus in 2020– 21 and high inflation. In this environment all judgments about the macro economy are uncertain.”6. Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA)Year-to-Date Share Price Decline: 35.78%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) provides financial products and services, operating through Commercial Bank, Retail Bank, Wealth Management, and Finance segments. On June 13, the company announced that it is going to disengage from the mortgage banker finance business by the end of 2023.

As of June 16, Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) stock has declined nearly 36% year-to-date. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 46 hedge funds were bullish on Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA), compared to 37 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is the largest stakeholder of the company, with a position worth $137.8 million. In addition to DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH), Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP), and Newell Brands Inc. (NASDAQ:NWL), Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) is one of the worst performing S&amp;P 500 stocks this year. Third Avenue Value Fund made the following comment about Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“The largest detractors from Fund performance during the quarter included two banks, Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) and Deutsche Bank. As it relates to the Fund specifically, events within U.S. banking applied most directly to our investment in Comerica, a U.S. super-regional that does have a large portion of corporate deposits and is not classified as a globally systemically important bank (“G-SIB”), which means it has not recognized certain mark-to-market securities losses in its regulatory capital. Comerica was a 2.6% position at the beginning of the quarter, prior to a roughly 34% stock price decline during the quarter. After purchasing more shares following the stock price decline, the Fund’s position in Comerica was approximately 2.3% at quarter end. While the general contagion fears and bank depositor behavior remain a fluid situation today, we took some confidence from immediate, forceful and targeted actions by the Fed, FDIC and Treasury. In our view, the Fed’s Bank Term Funding Program (“BTFP”) seems a well-tailored and appropriate near-term liquidity solution that allows banks to obtain immediate liquidity, collateralized by the par value of securities, to meet any near-term deposit outflows. At the time of this writing, early signs are that the deposit flight from regional banks is calming rapidly and depositor psychology is improving, though this could change. To the extent that calming continues, our suspicion is that there may be very attractive bargains to be had among regional banks. More will be known in the coming days and weeks as information regarding deposit flows emanates post-quarter end. That said, there will remain some mystery around the extent of the bargains on offer because increases in FDIC funding, increases in regulatory capital requirements, more stringent liquidity stress testing, and changes to the list of banks subject to G-SIB regulatory regimes are all on the table now. It is also very likely that deposit costs, which had been rising very slowly, will rise much more rapidly as commercial banks work harder to entice depositors to stay put. None of these developments, if they eventuate, are likely to impact banks’ returns and earnings in a positive way.More broadly, the Third Avenue Value Fund owned investments categorized as financials totaling 15.94% by weight, at quarter end. This category includes non-bank financials such as Old Republic, a U.S. property and casualty insurer and title insurance business, Lazard, an advisory business and asset management firm, and Ashmore, a U.K. asset management firm specializing in emerging markets credit. The Fund’s actual bank exposure at quarter end totaled 9.52% and comprises Bank of Ireland, Deutsche Bank and Comerica, in order of position size…” (Click here to read the full text) Click to continue reading and see 5 Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 2023.  Suggested articles:Top 20 Countries with the Highest Oil Consumption10 Best GARP Stocks That Pay Dividends15 Biggest Journalism Companies in the US Disclosure: None. 20 Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 2023 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

TSN faces headwinds due to a tough market scenario, marked by escalated costs and hurdles in the Beef segment.These factors dented the company’s second-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein the bottom line deteriorated year over year and lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Management also lowered its revenue guidance for fiscal 2023. This can be accountable to consumers opting for alternatives amid the inflationary landscape.A Glimpse of Q2 &amp; AheadThe company posted an adjusted loss of 4 cents per share, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of 81 cents. The bottom line significantly declined from earnings of $2.29 reported in the year-ago period. Most of the decline in profits was led by reduced earnings in the Beef and Chicken segments. Total sales were $13,133 million, flat compared with the year-ago quarter figure. The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13,602 million. Average price changes had a 3.2% adverse impact on the top line, while total volumes rose 3.3%.Management anticipates sales in the band of $53-$54 billion for fiscal 2023, flat to up 1%. Earlier, it expected sales in the range of $55-$57 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCost &amp; Margin PressureIn the second quarter of fiscal 2023, Tyson Foods’ gross profit came in at $527 million, down from $1,735 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The gross profit, as a percentage of sales, came in at roughly 4%, down from the 13.2% reported in the year-ago quarter. Tyson Foods’ adjusted operating income plunged 94% to $65 million. The adjusted operating margin contracted to 0.5% from 8.9% reported in the year-ago quarter.The company witnessed elevated input costs per pound in all segments except pork. Most of this was a result of inflated costs of raw materials and labor. The company also saw a decline in pricing due to lower outside meat purchases of chicken and decreased supply-chain costs.Story continuesBeef &amp; Chicken Unit HurdlesIn the second quarter of fiscal 2023, sales in Tyson Foods’ Beef segment declined 8.3% to $4,617 million. Volumes dropped 2.9% owing to reduced head processed. The average price fell 5.4% due to lower domestic demand and weaker export markets. The company continued to see increased live cattle costs due to reduced beef herd, which restricted supply.For fiscal 2023, management expects beef segment margins between a 1% loss and a 1% gain due to the deterioration of the current market scenario. For the Beef segment, U.S. Department of Agriculture projects domestic production to fall 4% year over year in fiscal 2023.Although Chicken segment sales increased in the second quarter, the macro environment remained difficult. Commodity prices for chicken cuts were quite lower compared with the year-ago period. Prices of boneless breast meat, tenders, and wings declined more than 50%. Further, the company saw a rise in feed ingredient costs. On its second-quarter earnings call, management stated that the key export markets remain closed due to the high-path avian influenza.Wrapping UpFocus on core strategies, such as driving growth across the core protein platform, bodes well for Tyson Foods. The company’s growth strategy is based on three main pillars. Firstly, it includes driving growth across the core protein platform. Secondly, it aims to fuel growth through its robust brands, which include more than 30 prepared food and snacking brands. Thirdly, Tyson Foods is focused on prudent international expansion.However, we cannot ignore the aforementioned hurdles, at least in the near term.

218,d17c32af-4749-36a6-bf35-3d5acc795a45,MKC,2023-06-21,TreeHouse Foods' (THS) Pricing Initiatives Aid Amid High Costs,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/treehouse-foods-ths-pricing-initiatives-151400688.html,1687274040,STORY,"['THS', 'MKC-V']","[TreeHouse Foods, Inc. THS appears well-positioned thanks to its strategic growth efforts and solid pricing initiatives amid elevated supply-chain costs. The company has been focused on refining its portfolio to stay focused on areas with higher growth potential.  These upsides backed the company’s first-quarter 2023 results, wherein the top and bottom lines increased year over year and cruised ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company continued to gain from robust pricing actions to counter inflation. Despite a dynamic macro landscape, TreeHouse Foods witnessed supply-chain improvements, which helped it enhance services and cater to high customer demand. Notably, quarterly revenues and profits exceeded expectations, as the company benefited from better execution and a more focused portfolio.Encouraging ViewTreeHouse Foods remains well-placed for 2023 due to its focus on greater-margin private-label snacking and beverage categories. For fiscal 2023, TreeHouse Foods expects net sales growth of 6-8% year over year to the $3.66-$3.73 billion band.  Adjusted EBITDA is likely to be in the range of $355-$370 million, up nearly 26% year over year at the midpoint.In the first half of fiscal 2023, TreeHouse Foods anticipates revenues in the range of $1.705-$1.735 billion, suggesting 7.7-9.6% growth from the year-ago period. For the second quarter of 2023, revenues are projected to be in the range of $810-$840 million, indicating flat to 4% growth from the second quarter of 2022. The company expects adjusted EBITDA in the band of $65-$80 million for the second quarter. The adjusted EBITDA margin is likely to be 7.9-9.4% in the second quarter, reflecting a 130-280 basis points improvement.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMain UpsidesThe company has been gaining from its efficient pricing efforts. In the first quarter of 2023, growth in net sales was mainly driven by favorable pricing actions undertaken to recover commodity inflation, along with improved services in most categories that enabled the company to cater to the high demand. Pricing increased 16.7%, aiding organic sales growth of 16.1%. Pricing actions are likely to aid sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2023.TreeHouse Foods has always been focused on expanding its product offerings through acquisitions. On Jun 7, 2023, TreeHouse Foods inked a deal with Farmer Brothers Company to take over its Northlake, TX, coffee facility and its non-Direct Store Delivery coffee business (known as Direct Ship). This buyout will help TreeHouse Foods enhance its coffee business capacity. In April 2023, the company added seasoned pretzel capabilities to its portfolio.On the flip side, TreeHouse Foods concluded the sale of a significant portion of its Meal Preparation business, which included pasta, pourable and spoonable dressing, preserves, red sauces, syrup, dry blends and baking, dry dinners, pie filling, pita chips and other sauces, in October 2022. The divestiture placed TreeHouse Foods well to capitalize on solid demand trends and fuel growth across its higher-margin private-label snacking and beverage categories.Story continuesCost Challenges to be CounteredTreeHouse Foods has been battling with escalated costs for a while now. In the first quarter of 2023, although the gross margin expanded year over year, it continued to bear the brunt of additional costs associated with investments to improve the supply chain and warehouse capacity. Although the supply-chain scenario has been improving, there are still a few categories with scope for enhancement. Management expects these categories to return to the target levels after a few quarters.Nonetheless, the abovementioned upsides are likely to work well for TreeHouse Foods. At its 2023 Investor Day, the company highlighted its annual growth targets for 2024 through 2027. In this regard, the company expects net sales growth between 3% and 5%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 8-10% and free cash flow of more than $200 million.Management intends to achieve these targets by undertaking strategies like fueling category leadership in high-appeal categories, extending strategic customer ties by offering private brand priorities, creating a robust supply chain, operating as a more focused organization and becoming a talent leader and undertaking strict capital allocation.Shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have rallied 12.7% in the past six months compared with the industry’s growth of 0.5%.Solid Staple StocksSome better-ranked consumer staple stocks are The Kraft Heinz Company KHC, McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated MKC and Conagra Brands CAG.The Kraft Heinz Company, a food and beverage product company, currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

221,2e3ffe8d-a461-3db2-b9d3-7e4194c82ff9,TGT,2023-06-21,How inventory shrink could become a tailwind for investors,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/inventory-shrink-theft-impacting-retailers-195228226.html,1687290748,VIDEO,"['NKE', 'TGT']","[While retailers address inventory shrink concerns more and more in earnings calls, could this headwind turn into a tailwind for investors? Yahoo Finance markets reporter Josh Schafer details how much retail theft is weighing on sales figures and how investors could actually benefit.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]- Inventory shrinkage is a big issue for retailers, mostly at the hands of organized retail crime. Now Target CEO, Brian Cornell, telling Yahoo Finance last month that the problem is getting worse. And warning that it could cost target $500 million in profits this year. But despite that, there's one analyst who's saying that this big problem will turn from a headwind to a tailwind later this year. Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer is here with more on that.And Josh, explain this to me. This is a note out here from the team at UBS. But what are they saying, just in terms of how we are going to see this potentially benefit maybe some investors at some point?JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, so the way shrinkage works, right, I think we should start there, overall, you're talking about essentially the companies are losing money and losing profits. So if we were to see shrinkage go down, that $500 million, if we wanted to use that number in theory, at some point, would come back to target, right. So at a high level, that's what UBS is looking at.And really what they're calling here is they're calling peak shrinkage. They're saying this is the most shrink we're going to get, we're reaching it right now. And something interesting they pointed to in that call was a graph showing how often shrink is mentioned on earnings calls.So when you take a look at the past decade or so, when we're talking about shrink, you can see there when it reaches sort of peak, it then falls off, pretty significantly, the mentions do, and so does the actual shrink reporting that we then see in the following quarter.So UBS essentially saying, you've heard a lot about shrink in the last couple of quarters, specifically the last quarter. You heard it from the likes of Walmart, Target, the dollar stores, Dollar General, Dollar Tree. They're now saying that they think that that's going to fall off in the next couple of quarters, so end of '23 probably, into '24, and then you see those profits come back. So if you were to sort of make that right trade now, then the profits come back, the gross margin goes back up, and it's a positive tailwind for the company.Story continues- Kind of the expectation would be to buy the rumor, sell the news, or a situation like that. And I do notice more luxury retailers are trying to address that problem with how they're handling crowds who-- or I wouldn't call it crowds for luxury retailers. But--[LAUGHTER]- Their numbers looking pretty good though.- But, you know, how they're managing consumers coming into their stores, to deal with that issue. But, of course, the big retailers can't necessarily do that. And they've been kind of stopping staff from addressing issues that can lead to the shrink.But I want to pivot a little bit and talk Nike. I saw shares under pressure today. This coming after analysts warn of inventory issues. So tell us about this.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, I mean, when you're talking about shrink, you're also kind of talking about inventory in some ways, right. It's a little bit different for Nike, but we're staying with the trend here on inventory. And for Nike, it's been a story over the last couple of quarters of just, they've had very high inventory. A lot of retailers have had very high inventory.For Nike, specifically, what the street has been concerned about is when you go back a month to that Foot Locker earnings call, they talked a lot about sales probably falling through the end of the year. They already have a lot of inventory. Who buys a lot of Nike shoes? Foot Locker. About 70% of their sales are Nike. So that was one thing that analysts were pointing out today.But interesting to see that they think overall Nike might be able to hold up in this environment. Essentially saying that they think that North American sales are going to be down, North American inventories might be under pressure. But they might have some success in what they're doing outside of North America. And that could maybe buoy what might be a little bit of a decline here in the States.- We will see. We get those results, what? Thursday?JOSH SCHAFER: Next Thursday.- Next Thursday, all right. So coming up here in just over a week. Right, Josh Schafer, thanks.]"

To skip our analysis of the recent market activity, you can go directly to see the 5 Stocks Under $50 Billionaires Are Loading Up On.The global economy has taken massive hits in the recent past starting with the covid-19 pandemic which was followed by the Russia – Ukraine conflict. These major global catastrophes led to supply constraints and other issues which ultimately led to inflationary pressures almost all across the world. The response across the board was an increase in interest rates by the central banks.The U.S. Federal Reserve delivered 10 consecutive interest rate hikes starting from March 2022. These hikes added full 5 percentage points to the interest rate prior to March 2022 and included four interest rate hikes of 75 basis points. In its latest meeting concluded on June 14, the Fed decided to hold off hikes for the time being with the possibility of two 25 bps increases by the end of the year.The increase in interest rates has had a significant impact on equity valuations and there has been significant pressure on stock prices in the past year or so. In times of adversity, it pays to look up to others that have historically performed well in similar circumstances. This is the rationale behind emulating the strategies of billionaires and prominent hedge funds.

Also, the emphasis on margin enhancement initiatives, such as corporate overhead reductions, itinerary optimization, supply chain initiatives and the rationalization of product delivery, bodes well.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNorwegian Cruise benefits from improvements in occupancy. In first-quarter 2023, occupancy was approximately 101.5%, exceeding the company’s expectations of approximately 100%. In the previous quarter, the company reported an occupancy of 87%.

During the first quarter of 2023, total cruise operating expenses came in at $1,280.4 million compared with $735.4 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The company’s expenses in the quarter stemmed from the resumption of cruise voyages and inflationary pressures. The company reported a rise in payroll, fuel and direct variable costs of fully-operating ships. Also, inflationary pressures related to food, perishables and logistics added to the woes. The company anticipates inflation and global supply chain constraints to dent margins in the near term.

Today, we are discussing one such stock, Regions Financial Corporation RF.This Birmingham, AL-based financial holding company, provides retail and commercial, and mortgage banking. Other financial services in the asset management, wealth management, securities brokerage, trust services, mergers and acquisitions advisory services, and other specialty financing are also delivered by RF.It has been increasing its quarterly dividend regularly, with the latest hike of 17.6% to 20 cents per share announced in July 2022. Over the past five years, the company increased its dividend four times, with an annualized dividend growth rate of 10.34%.Considering last day’s closing price of $18.12 per share, RF’s current dividend yield is 4.42%. This is impressive compared with the industry’s average of 2.66% and attractive for investors as it represents a steady income stream.Regions Financial Corporation Dividend Yield (TTM) Regions Financial Corporation Dividend Yield (TTM)Regions Financial Corporation dividend-yield-ttm | Regions Financial Corporation Quote Is the RF stock worth a look to earn a high dividend yield? Let’s check the company fundamentals to understand its risks and rewards for making a proper investment decision.Regions Financial’s liquidity sources aggregated $53.8 billion as of Mar 31, 2023, whereas its long-term borrowings were $2.31 billion. Such higher level of liquidity will likely aid sustainable capital deployment activities in the upcoming period.RF’s senior-unsecured debt enjoys an investment-grade credit rating of BBB+ from Standard &amp; Poor’s, Baa1 from Moody’s and A- from Fitch, rendering access to debt at attractive rates. Also, the company’s strong liquidity profile makes it less likely to default on interest and debt repayments if the economic situation worsens.Story continuesRegions Financial has diversified business and expanded its operations through investments in varied product offerings and acquisitions. In 2021, it acquired Clearsight, Sabal Capital and EnerBank USA, diversifying its revenue sources.Organic growth remains a key strength at Regions Financial, with net interest income (NII) rising over the years. The company’s asset sensitive balance sheet, high interest rates and strong lending pipeline are expected to support its NII and net interest margin in the upcoming period. However, a rise in deposit costs is likely to affect NII in the near term.RF’s balance sheet growth will be supported by an increase in loans.

Flowers are blooming. School is winding down.Many a weary worker or parent or ordinary citizen casts their eyes to the sky and begins to think of … vacation.You've saved all winter for that trip. You want to make sure that you make the most of your down time.So, Doing More Today asked the experts at Regions Next Step for some ideas for saving money when it's time to unplug and, maybe, stick your toes in the sand or visit that city you've wanted to see.6 Tips for Saving on Your Next Vacation:Consider mass transit. Many of the largest cities have affordable, safe and reliable mass transit that goes to places that vacationers want. Cities like Chicago, Washington D.C., Boston, New York and others. Also, many cities have hop-on/hop-off shuttle services that let you see things at your own pace.Hit the local grocery stores. Sampling local cuisine is part of the travel experience. But hitting local grocery stores also gives you local flavor, helps trim your food cost and gives you the opportunity to ask locals about the best places to visit.Take advantage of the free breakfast. If you choose a hotel or lodging that offers a breakfast, this can be an easy to way to not only take care a meal, but also offer a simple snack - like fruit or a yogurt bar - that can tide you over until mealtime.Map out explorations plans. Do a little digging before you leave. Most cities and destinations have things to do that are free, or have free or discounted days/times. These can include museums, parks, local gardens and walking tours.Be in the know of discounts. Discounts are not just for the off season. Rates vary by day of the week. If you have flexibility in your timing, traveling mid-week is often less expensive. Also, many restaurant and destinations feature daily deals. Do research ahead of your adventure.Build or bring your own drink. While the convenience is certainly there, buying your cocktail or beverage of choice from a cute tourist spot or bar is a lesson in markup. No fooling, you could buy your own blender, mix and spirits for the price of a round or two. So where and when you can, BYOB.Story continuesStaycation: Another Great Savings OptionOne of the best ways to save on a trip?

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this global payments processor have returned -1%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, which Visa falls in, has lost 1.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Visa is expected to post earnings of $2.10 per share, indicating a change of +6.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.59 points to a change of +14.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.68 indicates a change of +12.8% from what Visa is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Visa.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for V _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Visa, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $8.05 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $32.52 billion and $36.03 billion estimates indicate +11% and +10.8% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVisa reported revenues of $7.99 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.1%. EPS of $2.09 for the same period compares with $1.79 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.75 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.01%. The EPS surprise was +6.09%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Visa is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Visa. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Verizon’s end-to-end i3-based and Real Time Text (RTT) service allows a 911 center (Public Safety Answering Point, or PSAP) to dynamically determine wireless call routing based on device location and local, real time conditions. The RTT functionality also allows customers to provide messages to first responders prior to their arrival, allowing them to better prepare a response plan and have the necessary resources when arriving on scene. Verizon continues to work with NG911 providers and PSAP authorities across the country to enable this advanced, end-to-end i3 and RTT service.“We know reliable communication is critical, especially in times of emergency,” said Lynn Cox, Chief Network Officer at Verizon. “We are committed to providing the most highly advanced technology available to support first responders and our customers at mission critical moments.”As this emerging technology ramps up, Verizon continues to roll out the interim technology which provides device-based location services for routing 911 calls. Verizon engineers are turning up Location Based Routing for hundreds of PSAPs nationwide. This solution improves 911 call routing by gathering location information from a caller’s handset instead of local cell towers. The improved routing technology saves time and resources, and speeds the ability of first responders to reach the scene of the emergency.PSAPs that are interested in deploying Location Based Routing can contact Verizon engineers at vzw.net.911.rfs@verizon.com.

A value trap poses the risk of investing in what seems like a bargain at the risk of ignoring the bigger picture that may hide red flags.

The telecommunications company has seen its operating margin expand from 20.50% for the quarter ending in December 2022 to 23.04% for the quarter ending in March 2023.Under better circumstances, Verizon shares would seem like a deep value opportunity. Unfortunately for investors, the fundamentals of the company are not just about valuation, they take into consideration financial strength, profitability, growth, outlook, moat, etc. There are severe problems with Verizon's fundamentals that are hard to ignore now, foremost being the risk of financial distress.Story continuesVerizon's fundamentals reveal high riskVerizon has a GF Score of 70 out of 100, which signals poor future performance potential according to a historical study by GuruFocus.Verizon: An Attractive Dividend Hides a Value TrapThe past performance has been poor too as the stock has lost nearly 26% over the past year and is down about 7.5% so far in 2023. The stock has a moderate GuruFocus rank for profitability and a high rank for value, but at the same time a low rank for financial strength growth, growth and momentum.Starting with the number one reason of concern in my opinion, Verizon has an Altman Z-score of 1.25, which places it in the distress zone. This implies bankruptcy is possible in the next two years.Verizon has been issuing new debt at a rapid pace - in fact, over the past three years, it issued $36.8 billion of debt. The debt-to-equity ratio is 1.92, which is quite high, the debt-to-Ebitda ratio is 3.57 and the interest coverage ratio was 6.28 as of March 2023, which seems to be healthy but just barely. I would argue that a deeper look at the interest coverage ratio shows that it has been decreasing severely. The higher the interest coverage ratio, the stronger the company's financial strength. However, Verizon had a peak for its interest coverage ratio back in September 2021 with a figure of 11.12, and ever since the interest coverage dropped for each consecutive quarter. Should investors be worried that the interest coverage of 6.28 for March 2023 is the lowest one for the past one and a half years? I would argue yes, because the company is clearly struggling to maintain liquidity.Verizon has a current ratio of 0.75 and a quick ratio of 0.70. Both of these are well below the threshold value of 1.0 which indicates neutral liquidity. The higher these ratios are above 1.0, the better it is for a company as it has more current assets than current liabilities and therefore it should not have difficulty meeting its current obligations. Lower than 1.0 means the company needs to continuously raise additional liquidity to keep functioning.Verizon also has a very low cash ratio of 0.05. The cash ratio is defined as cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities divided by total current liabilities. The low cash ratio signals that Verizon does not have sufficient cash on hand to pay off its short-term debt. This is a reminder that cash is king for any business in any sector, any industry. You need cash to function.Verizon's low liquidity has likely played a key part in its three-year free cash flow growth rate of -15.4%. A company that is low on cash generates slower free cash flow and may struggle to survive against the possibility of bankruptcy. Verizon also has a three-year revenue growth rate of 0.7%, and Morningstar analysts estimate a three to five year total revenue growth rate of only 0.45%.My takeVerizon is not growing in the grand scheme of things, at least not from the investor's perspective. It is now in financial distress, and may have to cut its dividend to repay its large amount of debt. In fact, the dividend may be part of the problem, as the company's continuous debt issuance is in part to fund the dividend. This is not sustainable and continuously destroys shareholder value.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

To see more of these stocks, you can go directly to see the top 5 Tech Stocks Benefiting From The AI Boom.The world of artificial intelligence (AI) these days is overwhelmingly dominated by discussions on generative AI and its implications. Simply put, generative AI is a form of machine learning through which AI software can produce text, video, images, and more. Basically, generative AI can produce any form of content on the basis of prompts. This form of AI became more widespread and renowned after the launch of ChatGPT and similar generative AI platforms, which revolutionized the AI sector while pulling in major tech companies to become part of the AI race.This form of AI and its impact on the markets was discussed by Jim Stewart, a New York Times columnist, on CNBC's 'Squawk on the Street' on June 16. According to Stewart, big tech companies, especially those that are AI beneficiaries, have been leading the recent stock market rally. These include companies such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Stewart claimed that he was bullish on AI, especially considering the fact that this technology could boost productivity gains across different fields, including journalism.AI and the US Stock MarketIn May, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) joined the group of companies with valuations in trillions of dollars. Many financial professionals today are attributing the gains of the S&amp;P 500 to AI, primarily, with the focus being on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and other big tech companies that have begun incorporating AI and generative AI in their products and services.This overwhelming focus on a select few number of companies that can successfully play the AI boom and come out victorious has led to many investors worrying that the stock market in 2023 will turn into a selection of a few winners and a lot more losers. According to CNBC, the S&amp;P 500 has ""basically been the S&amp;P 7,"" a reference to the fact that only seven major tech companies have been calling the shots so far in 2023, leading the market to heavily rely on them and their gains.Story continues""You Are At The Starting Line Of AI""This reality has led many professionals and corporations to realize that the AI boom is very real and may be here to stay. Companies today will be bound to figure out where they stand in this environment and how they can integrate AI into their business models to reap the benefits of this technological revolution. NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO, Jensen Huang, in an address at the National Taiwan University in May, stated that we are currently at ""the starting line of AI"" and that at this moment, we should run instead of walking. The implications of his statement are many, but perhaps the most obvious lesson to take away from Huang's speech is that companies and individuals today shouldn't be slow to join the AI race - they should try their best to become part of it and ensure they don't end up getting left behind by their competitors.Keeping the above-mentioned market dynamics and developments in mind, we have compiled a list of the top tech stocks to consider investing in to play the AI boom. We included the obvious stock picks because of their contributions to this industry so far, but we also attempted to find other companies that wouldn't be the first to come to your mind when looking at AI beneficiaries today.10 Tech Stocks Benefiting From The AI Boom Pixabay/Public DomainOur MethodologyTo select our stocks, we looked at which companies analysts are expecting to benefit from the AI boom and shortlisted them based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter of 2023. The stocks are ranked based on this metric, from the lowest to the highest number of hedge funds long each of them.Tech Stocks Benefiting From The AI Boom10. Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67On June 13, Keith Bachman at BMO Capital raised his price target on Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL) from $96 to $132. The analyst also holds a Market Perform rating on the stock.Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL) is an information technology company based in Austin, Texas. The company's products and services address enterprise information technology environments across the world.We saw 67 hedge funds long Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $2.9 billion.TD Cowen's John Blackledge expects Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL) to benefit from the current AI boom because its cloud-computing platform can offer it some competitive advantages.First Eagle Investment Management held 20.7 million shares in Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL) at the end of the first quarter, making it the largest shareholder in the company.Ariel Investments mentioned Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Additionally, global leader in enterprise software, Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) traded higher in the quarter, driven by solid quarterly earnings, a material increase in the dividend as well as forward looking guidance that implies a substantial acceleration in organic cloud growth for full year 2023. We believe these results highlight ORCL’s ability to effectively cross-sell and upsell apps and infrastructure, as well as the emergence of the company’s cloud platform as a competitive offering.”9. CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is an information technology company offering cybersecurity products and services. It is based in Austin, Texas.There were 72 hedge funds holding stakes in CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) at the end of the first quarter. Their total stake value in the company was $2.4 billion.CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) may be an interesting stock pick to play the AI boom considering the company has recently announced new AI-powered indicators of attack (IoA) models. These models can combat advanced adversary tradecraft by using machine intelligence to stop breaches.Tal Liani at Bank of America holds a Buy rating on CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) shares as of June 16. The analyst also raised the firm's price target on the stock from $162 to $190.Artisan Partners made the following comment about CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Top contributors to performance for the quarter included graphics semiconductor company Nvidia, Southeast Asian e-commerce platform Sea, Latin American marketplace MercadoLibre, online travel marketplace Airbnb, and endpoint security company CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD). CrowdStrike rebounded as its financial results eased demand-related concerns in its core endpoint business, while adoption in platform adjacencies continued to rise.”CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD), like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), is a tech stock that can benefit immensely during the AI boom.8. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 91Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was spotted in the portfolios of 91 hedge funds in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $4.9 billion.Based in Santa Clara, California, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a semiconductor company that operates globally.Joseph Moore, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, raised his price target on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) shares on June 16 from $97 to $138. The analyst also holds an Overweight rating on the shares.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a chipmaker that TD Cowen's John Blackledge has picked as one of his tech stocks to play the AI boom. This is unsurprising considering the fact that this June, the company revealed its new AI chip in its race with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). The new MI300X chip was described by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) as ""the world's most advances accelerator for generative AI.""Citadel Investment Group held 13.9 million shares in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) at the end of the first quarter, making the fund the most prominent shareholder in the company for that quarter.This is what Horizon Kinetics LLC said about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“It is among what are considered to be the great technology companies, like Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel, that one is apt to see some of the greatest confusion between short-term financial results and share price movements, on the one hand, and long-term financial results. The former are exceedingly difficult to predict. Long term results are relatively easy to predict, because they are bound by the limiting realities of the business model. In the case of AMD, that is the business of being a large-scale semi-conductor manufacturer with a more dominant competitor that has a scale economy advantage.Here’s what people see, remember and act upon. In the past several years, AMD has been the best performing major technology stock. It’s outperformed Apple, Amazon, Google, Meta (Facebook) and Nvidia…” (Click here to read the full text)7. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a diversified software and information technology company based in San Jose, California. The company's flagship product is its Creative Cloud, a subscription service offering members access to its creative products.John Blackledge at TD Cowen sees Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) as a smart AI play because the company has begun rolling out new generative-AI content creation tools.An Outperform rating was reiterated on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) shares on June 16 by Kirk Materne at Evercore ISI. The analyst also raised his price target on the stock from $475 to $590.A total of 99 hedge funds were long Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $7.3 billion.Polen Capital mentioned Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“One area we are watching regarding Alphabet and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is AI systems and their capabilities, including generative AI. Interestingly, both Adobe and Alphabet could see benefits or threats from the emergence of generative AI and large language models (LLMs). Both companies already use generative AI to the benefit of their users in anticipating how content creators edit their work (Adobe) and in how search results are anticipated and generated (Google). At the same time, breakthrough technologies like AI can open the door to additional competition and/or impact a company’s profitability levels. We now see AI systems others are developing, including LLMs and generative AI offerings, that could be more competitive in the future. While we think it remains early days for ChatGPT and the capabilities of these types of LLMs and generative AI programs like DALL-E, the technology seems to be progressing at a fast rate and will at least require a strong response from incumbents.As of now, we believe Alphabet and Adobe are leaders in their own right in these areas and have a clear path to improving their existing offerings with AI advancements, which would allow them to be net beneficiaries of AI. There are also significant barriers to building leading AI offerings in these areas. As a result, our position sizes in Adobe and Alphabet remain sizeable. For Adobe, the status of its pending $20 billion-plus Figma acquisition is also uncertain. There is a good chance, in our view, that it will be blocked by regulators, which would mean the future opportunity to expand its offerings to the developer community (beyond designers) may not occur.”Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), is a smart stock pick to play the AI boom.6. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 131Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) may not be the first big tech company that comes to your mind when looking for AI plays, but with the company's new Vision Pro headset, some believe it may be getting involved in the machine learning space more than before.Analysts at Bernstein hold a Market Perform rating and a $175 price target on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares as of June 14.Our hedge fund data for the first quarter shows 131 hedge funds long Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Their total stake value was $165 billion.Holding 915.6 million shares in the company, Berkshire Hathaway was the largest stakeholder in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) at the end of the first quarter.Silver Ring Value Partners made the following comment about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Exited the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) put options position, as I came to the conclusion that I was wrong about the degree to which the stock is overvalued. While I still believe it’s optimistically priced, the fundamentals over the last few years made me believe that my initial decision to buy the put options was wrong.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Tech Stocks Benefiting From The AI Boom.Suggested articles:Top 10 Generative Artificial Intelligence Companies to Invest InHow to Play The AI Boom And NASDAQ Rally10 Tech Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Philippe LaffontDisclosure: None. 10 Tech Stocks Benefiting From The AI Boom is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

259,f6fdafb4-8fd6-3f0b-b471-7a4c04640682,APD,2023-06-21,Investing in Hydrogen: 7 Top Stocks Poised for Millionaire Status,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-hydrogen-7-top-stocks-223344595.html,1686782024,STORY,"['APD', 'FCEL', 'BLDP', 'ITMPF', 'PLUG']","[Fundamentally, market participants willing to accept volatility risk in exchange for outsized reward possibilities should consider top hydrogen stocks for investment. According to ChatGPT, “[i]nvesting in hydrogen has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential to play a crucial role in the global energy transition.”Indeed, Grand View Research states that the global hydrogen generation market size reached a valuation of $155.35 billion in 2022. Further, experts project that the segment will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.3% from 2023 to 2030. At the culmination of the forecast period, the sector could ring up revenue of $317.39 billion. That’s a compelling reason to consider the best hydrogen stocks to buy.Also, ChatGPT states several attributes for hydrogen, including clean energy transition, energy storage solutions, government support and investment, and emerging market potential. To be sure, the artificial intelligence protocol warns about risks such as regulatory uncertainties. Still, if you’re willing to take a shot, these might be great ideas for high-return hydrogen stocks (according to the chatbot).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPlug Power (PLUG)An image of hydrogen fuel silos standing against a blue skySource: Audio und werbung / ShutterstockBilled as a leading provider of hydrogen fuel-cell solutions for electric mobility and stationary power applications, Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) is one of the riskiest ideas for top hydrogen stocks for investment. In the trailing one-year period, shares stumbled more than 23% of equity value. At the same time, momentum has picked up recently. In the trailing month, PLUG soared nearly 39%.In particular, the bulls bid up the equity based on anticipation of the company’s investor day forum during the midweek session. Prior to the big day, Plug Power CEO Andy Marsh hinted at the enterprise’s expansionary endeavors. Earlier, Marsh stated that “[t]his operational growth supports our near-term revenue goals of $1.4 billion in 2023 and our long-term target of achieving annual sales of $20 billion by 2030.”Story continuesTo be fair, Gurufocus labels PLUG as one of the more troubled opportunities in the market. Specifically, it assigned six red flags associated with the financials. On the other hand, Plug’s recent revenue growth trend is undeniable. For speculators, PLUG may be one of the best hydrogen stocks to consider.Ballard Power Systems (BLDP)Hydrogen Stocks Man hold a fuel dispenser with hydrogen on gas station. h2 combustion engine for emission free eco friendly transport. Plug Power is one such company working on this power source.Source: Alexander Kirch / Shutterstock.comA global provider of clean energy solutions, Ballard Power Systems (NASDAQ:BLDP) has a central vision to deliver fuel cell power for a sustainable planet. Per its public profile, the company’s zero-emission fuel cells are enabling the electrification of mobility, including buses, commercial trucks, trains, marine vessels, passenger cars, and forklift trucks. To be fair, though, BLDP ranks among the riskiest top hydrogen stocks for investment.In the past 365 days, BLDP slipped more than 8%. However, since the January opener, shares popped up nearly 13%. According to TipRanks, Ballard has driven higher in recent sessions because of its announcement of innovative manufacturing technology. The innovation should cut costs and boost production capacity for its next0-generation graphite bipolar plates.To be upfront, Gurufocus also warns that Ballard suffers from shoddy financials, based on negative per-share revenue growth trends as well as margins that sit well below breakeven. However, Ballard also benefits from a cash-rich balance sheet. If you want to speculate, BLDP could be one of the stocks for millionaire status.Air Products and Chemicals (APD)Hydrogen logo on gas stations fuel dispenser, symbolizing H2 combustion engine for emissions-free eco-friendly transport.Source: Alexander Kirch / Shutterstock.comAn industrial gas company, Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE:APD) involves itself in the production and distribution of hydrogen. Also, the company helps accelerate the development of hydrogen infrastructure. According to its corporate profile, Air Products has been in operation for over 80 years. Since the beginning of this year, APD dipped 7% in the charts. Nevertheless, it makes for a solid case for top hydrogen stocks for investment.For one thing, Air Products represents a known commodity. As the Biden administration continues to build out and restore American infrastructure, the company should be a downwind beneficiary. After all, long-established enterprises should command greater influence, respect, and reputation over purely aspirational firms. For investing in hydrogen stocks, APD offers a steady hand.Also, APD enjoys credible financials. Per Gurufocus, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate (on a per-share basis) clocks in at 12.3%, above 60.75% of its peers. Also, its trailing-year net margin is 16.58%, outflanking 86.9%.Nel (NLLSF)An image of a hydrogen fueling station against a blue sky. Best Hydrogen Energy StocksSource: DesignRage / Shutterstock.comProbably not a household name among most American investors, Norway’s Nel (OTCMKTS:NLLSF) nevertheless could rank among the top hydrogen stocks for investment. Per its public profile, Nel is a global company providing solutions for the production, storage, and distribution of hydrogen from renewable energy sources. It performs reasonably well too, gaining over 7% in the over-the-counter market in the past year.Early last month, Nel announced its plans to build a new automated gigawatt electrolyzer manufacturing facility in Michigan. Per its website, when fully developed, the facility will employ more than 500 people and be among the largest electrolyzer manufacturing plants in the world. While perhaps not the most popular name, Nel could eventually become one of the hydrogen stocks for millionaire status.As a heads up to investors, though, Nel’s financials represent a mishmash. Per Gurufocus, the company’s profit margins sit well in negative territory. As well, it might be a tad overvalued. On the other hand, it features a three-year revenue growth rate of 11.3%, above 67% of its peers. Also, it enjoys a cash-rich balance sheet.ITM Power (ITMPF)a symbol with H2 (hydrogen) on it and a fill-up tankSource: Alexander Kirch / Shutterstock.comAnother foreign enterprise among the top hydrogen stocks for investment per ChatGPT, U.K.-based ITM Power (OTCMKTS:ITMPF) is an energy storage and clean fuel company. Per its public profile, ITM designs, manufactures and integrates electrolyzers based on proton exchange membrane technology to produce green hydrogen using renewable electricity and tap water.Though scientifically relevant, ITMPF rates on the speculative side of hydrogen opportunities, having lost more than 20% of equity value since the beginning of this year. As well, prospective investors should note that at the time of writing, shares trade just under a buck. Because it’s a literal penny stock, you should approach ITMPF with extreme caution. That said, the underlying solid oxide electrolyzer cell market should see significant growth in the years ahead.As with other promising but speculative ideas for best hydrogen stocks, ITM Power presents a very mixed bag financially. From an investment standpoint, the deeply negative print for both operating and net margins is worrisome. At the same time, ITM benefits from a cash-rich balance sheet. Thus, it might work out for patient gamblers.FuelCell Energy (FCEL)hydrogen stocks: A detailed image of hydrogen fuel cells.Source: Kaca Skokanova/ShutterStock.comFocused on the development and commercialization of fuel cell power plants for electric power generation, FuelCell Energy (NASDAQ:FCEL) is one of the most popular ideas among the top hydrogen stocks for investment. According to its corporate profile, FuelCell is uniquely positioned to serve customers worldwide with sustainable products and solutions for businesses, utilities, governments, and municipalities.To be sure, FCEL presents significant risks for prospective investors. In the past 365 days, FCEL dropped 16% in equity value. However, in the trailing-year framework, it returned nearly 5%. The security turned in a positive performance recently due to FuelCell’s revenue more than doubling, based on its disclosure for its fiscal second quarter. From a speculator’s view, FCEL could be one of the high-return hydrogen stocks.Still, investors need to be careful. According to Gurufocus, FuelCell’s three-year revenue growth rate sits at 32.4% below zero. Its profit margins also sit in negative territory. However, it does enjoy decent stability in the balance sheet.Linde (LIN)Logo of Linde AG (LIN) in Hanover, Germany - The Linde Group is a multinational chemical companySource: nitpicker / Shutterstock.comA global industrial gas and engineering company, Linde (NYSE:LIN) represents another stable, credible name among top hydrogen stocks for investment. According to its corporate profile, Linde lives its mission of making its world more productive every day by providing high-quality solutions, technologies, and services which are making the customers more successful and help to sustain and protect the planet.In the past 365 days, LIN gained about 24% of its equity value. More gains could be on the horizon as Linde continues to flex its business muscles. In late April of this year, Dow (NYSE:DOW) selected Linde as its clean hydrogen and nitrogen partner for its proposed net-zero carbon emissions ethylene and derivatives complex in Canada. Thanks to Linde’s reputation, more hydrogen-related projects should be forthcoming.Financially, Linde offers a much more palatable profile compared to speculative high-return hydrogen stocks. For instance, the company’s trailing-year net margin clocks in at 13.46%, beating out 81.89% of its peers. Also, Linde hit 8 out of 9 in the Piotroski F-Score, indicating high operational efficiency.PLUGPlug Power$10.69BLDPBallard Power$4.68APDAir Products &amp; Chemicals$288.84NLLSFNel ASA$1.28ITMPFITM Power$0.99FCELFuelCell Energy$2.57LINLinde$374.31On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the history of the entertainment industry, the American film and television industry, evolution of online streaming platforms, impact of Covid-19 on online streaming services and future outlook of streaming and go directly to 10 Best TV Shows of All Time.The entertainment industry has a long and varied history, with roots dating back to ancient civilizations. One of the earliest forms of entertainment was the art of storytelling, which has been a part of human culture for millennia. Theater and drama have also been popular for thousands of years and the ancient Greeks are credited with developing the art of theater, as we know it today. However, the global entertainment industry was revolutionized after the invention of the first motion picture camera in 1891. The first movie theater opened in 1905, radio broadcasts began in 1920 and television broadcasts began in 1928, but it was not until after World War II that television was widely adopted as a form of mass communication around the globe. American Film and Television Industry:The production and distribution of motion pictures and television programs is a nation’s most valuable economic and cultural resource. As we mentioned in our article 15 Most Watched TV Shows of 2023, the film and television entertainment sector in the U.S. provides $21 billion in annual payments to more than 260,000 local businesses across the country. The industry is made up of more than 122,000 companies located in every state in America, 92% of which have less than 10 employees. The film and television sector supported a total of 2.1 million jobs and paid $186 billion in total wages in 2021. The industry also provided $29 billion in public tax revenue and earned $14.4 billion in export revenues for the country in 2021. Evolution of Online Streaming Platforms: The global TV and film industry went through a paradigm shift in the last few years with the evolution of online streaming services. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) began as a DVD rental service in 1997, which allowed consumers to select and receive DVDs by mail. In 2007, the company expanded into online streaming of movies and television shows directly from its streaming platform. Now, after 16 years of redefining global entertainment distribution and even giving us some of the greatest TV shows of all time, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) currently has over 222 million subscribers worldwide, a market cap of over $200 billion and boasted a revenue of $31.6 billion in 2022. Story continuesNetflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) opened the door to a new entertainment distribution and production model and was then followed by other popular streaming platforms, like Amazon Prime by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Disney+ by The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), HBO Max by Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc (NASDAQ:WBD) and many others. Impact of Covid-19 on Online Streaming Services: When the entire world went into a lockdown during the Covid-19 pandemic, people could no longer go to theaters or cinemas and so online streaming platforms became an important source of home entertainment. In 2020, the number of streaming subscriptions across platforms crossed one billion worldwide. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) hit 200 million subscribers for the first time and witnessed a 47% growth in revenue from 2019 to 2021. Meanwhile, global box office revenues, which reached a record $42.3 billion in 2019, plunged by over 70% and reached $12 billion in 2020. This was also the first year that China overtook the U.S. as the country with highest box office revenues. Future Outlook of Streaming:It’s fairly clear that streaming is becoming increasingly popular among viewers worldwide. According to Forbes, binge watchers and casual viewers spent 35% of their total TV time streaming in 2022, up from just 10% in 2020, and they streamed an average of 190 billion minutes per week. In addition to increased viewership numbers, streaming services are also pushing for an increase in the number of subscribers. A recent example of this is Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) cracking down on its subscribers sharing their passwords with others. The move seems to have worked and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) had its four largest single days of U.S. customers signing up since it issued the alert. A report by Lightshed Partners has predicted that subscriptions for streaming platforms will cross 1.25 billion by 2024, driven largely by fresh content offering from existing providers, as well as new entrants in the market. With that said, here is a list of the best TV shows in history.30 Best TV Shows of All TimeCopyright: buchachon / 123RF Stock PhotoMethodology: To collect data for our article, we went through several different sources, such as IMDB, Rolling Stone, Reader’s Digest etc., searching for the top-ranking TV shows of all time, and picked the top 5 shows from every index until we had our list of 30 greatest TV shows. Then we ranked these TV series based on their number of appearances in the aforementioned indexes. If you’re also interested to read about our compilation of best movies, please refer to our article 35 Best New Movies on Netflix. 30. Chernobyl (2019)Chernobyl is an HBO original series that offered a brilliant dramatization of the horrors and chaos following the meltdown of a nuclear plant in the Soviet Union in 1986. With a 95% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, the show has 3 Emmys and 2 Golden Globes to its name. 29. Sesame Street (1969-Present)Sesame Street has always been a show on a mission: to educate and entertain both its young target audience and their exhausted parents through a mix of songs, sketches, and a voice that speaks to kids rather than at them. The show that gave us the Cookie Monster, is available for streaming on HBO Max, owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc (NASDAQ:WBD). It has often been regarded by pop culture as one of the best shows of all time.28. Rick and Morty (2013-Present)Although Rick and Morty is a cartoon show with its vivid splashes of color and its improvisational voice acting, it is a hilarious and original sci-fi comedy meant for a mature audience. Each episode is funny, smart and weird and gets you invested in its world and characters. It is estimated that a single episode of the show costs between $1.2 million to $1.5 million and most of this goes into animation and design. 27. The Office U.K. (2001-2003)The Ricky Gervais-led British show that inspired its more famous American counterpart, The Office, was intended to look as ordinary, as mundane and as unremarkable as possible. Instead, it is one of the greatest comedy shows of the 21st century and though it ran for only 14 episodes, the show’s cultural impact is immense. The Office U.K. is available to watch on PrimeVideo, by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)26. Modern Family (2009-2020)Told from the perspective of an unseen documentary filmmaker, Modern Family is one of the most heartwarming shows in the modern era and tells us the story of the Pritchett family.

Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009)The original Battlestar Galactica, which aired in 1978, only enjoyed one season, but Ron Moore’s more modern version of the show is one of the finest examples of a reboot one can imagine. Fans couldn’t get enough of the Galactica crew and their face-off with the Cylons, humanoid robots bent on destruction. The original series in 1978 cost roughly $1 million per episode, more than double that of a prime-time TV show at the time.24. 30 Rock (2006-2013)With an average audience score of 92% on Rotten Tomatoes, 30 Rock was a comedy sitcom on NBC, centered on a young Liz Lemon, currently head writer for a live comedy-sketch show in New York. The show is loosely based on the backstage shenanigans at Saturday Night Live. 23. Better Call Saul (2015-2022)Spin-offs rarely live up to the original show and so people didn’t exactly have high hopes when a spin-off of the legendary series Breaking Bad was announced. Better Call Saul has exceeded expectations and managed to be considered on par with the all-time great show it was born from. For the final season of the series, Bob Odenkirk, the lead actor, reportedly earned $200,000 per episode. Better Call Saul is one of the best TV series of all time on Netflix. 22. Atlanta (2016-2022)With a perfect 100% rating by the top critics, Atlanta is rated one of the best TV shows of all time on Rotten Tomatoes. Atlanta is a comedy sitcom that boldly experiments with tone, storylines and themes, making an unpredictable show that is different with every episode. Donald Glover won Emmys, both as an actor and director for the show. The show is available to stream on Hulu, a platform majorly owned by The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). 21. Lost (2004-2010)Lost is a sci-fi soap opera adventure, with humor, mystery and interesting characters galore. The show follows the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815 when they crashed on a lush, mysterious island. Lost had a budget of around $4 million per episode. The science fiction drama aired on ABC, the flagship property of the Disney Entertainment division of The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). 20. Fleabag (2016-2019)Fleabag is a British comedy-drama television series starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who portrays a woman living in London and navigating her struggling business and busy dating life, while attempting to keep her dark secrets from overcoming her. Fleabag is available to watch on Amazon Prime, the streaming platform of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). 19. Friends (1994-2004)Perhaps one the most popular TV shows of all time, Friends earned more than 60 Emmy nods in its time. The show revolved around the lives of six friends living in New York City and to this day, is still among the most watched shows in the world. Each of the six stars earned $1 million per episode in the 9th season and by the 10th and final season, they were earning approximately $1.6 million per episode. Although Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) hasn’t made Friends available to watch on Netflix US, it can be streamed in several other countries. 18. The Office U.S. (2005-2013)The U.S. adaptation of the Ricky Gervais-led British original, the show features the staff of a fictitious paper company called Dunder Mifflin, based in Scranton. One of the best comedy series of all time, The Office has a hardcore fan base and is still watched by millions today and is the biggest selling point for Peacock. When season 5 of The Office was filmed, the average budget was in the region of $250,000 to $400,000 per episode.17. Band of Brothers (2001)Band of Brothers in American war drama miniseries, based on the non-fictional book of Stephen E. Ambrose. The show follows the story of the Easy Company from 1942 to the end of World War II. Band of Brothers is one of the best tv series of all time on IMDB and is ranked 4th among the top-rated TV shows on the website. Produced by Steven Spielberg, the show had a whopping budget of around $125 million, averaging $12.5 million per episode. Band of Brothers was originally broadcasted on HBO, owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc (NASDAQ:WBD).16. Schitt’s Creek (2015-2020)The Canadian sitcom, made by the father-and-son duo Dan and Eugene Levy, got more popular with time and hit its heyday when it became streamable on Netflix. The final season of Schitt’s Creek pulled off the incredible feat of sweeping the Emmys and won all 7 comedy awards. 15. Succession (2018-present)Succession is a slow moving but captivating drama, once you have an opportunity to dive into the characters that make up the devious Roy family. In such short years, Succession has made a huge impact on the TV landscape. The show has won multiple Emmys and is one of the top 20 series of all time in our list.14. The West Wing (1999-2006)One of the best political drama series of all time, The West Wing, at its best, delivered brilliant dialogue, powerful performances, and an inspirational look at the American political system. The show has a slew of awards to its name and continues to be one of the most re-watched shows of the era. The West Wing aired on NBC, owned by Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA).13. I Love Lucy (1952-1957)Many sitcoms have come and gone over the years, but Lucy is eternal. The show pushed the boundaries of television in many ways, including creating the multi-camera sitcom and even depicting Lucy’s real-life pregnancy onscreen. For an era when two leads had to be portrayed as sleeping in separate beds, this was quite a bold move. With all the influence that it has had on TV sitcom history, I Love Lucy is easily one of the best series of all time.12. Cheers (1982-1993) Even though viewers weren’t physically present in that iconic bar in Boston, everyone felt a part of the Cheers family by tuning in to the sitcom each week. The show even spawned an equally successful spin-off, Frasier. Cheers got a 98% rating by Critics on Rotten Tomatoes. 11. Star Trek: The Original Series (1966-1969)The most important and influential sci-fi series ever produced, the original series of Star Trek marked the debut of characters like Spock and Captain Kirk, before leading to several blockbuster movies and subsequent TV shows.

Yahoo Finance Live breaks down the numbers.Video Transcript- Well, from online shoppers to two moviegoers, I'm watching Pixar. And really the bomb that was Elemental this past weekend only notched $28.5 million in its domestic debut over the long weekend, the worst opening for Pixar in its 28 year history. We talk a lot about these Pixar films like Disney's Strange World that was in Thanksgiving. Then we had another film, Lightyear, that was a Toy Story prequel last summer.- I know. It didn't do as well as expected.- Didn't do well. It just kept bombing, and it seems like Disney has lost its mojo a bit with Pixar and these animated films. And you wonder how the studio can get it back and move forward.- Yeah, missed opportunity of the magic.- The lost the magic.- Exactly.- Or it's out of its element. That's another one.- Exactly. We got to throw in all the puns here. I mean, yeah. I mean, look, it was a big investment they made in Elemental. I mean, we were talking to $200 million investment to bomb at the box office. Not a good look for Disney at all. And then, yeah, Pixar has come under a lot of scrutiny for some of the things that they're pushing forward.I've seen talk about another Toy Story. And people are like hey, hang on a second wasn't the last one supposed to be Toy Story 3 was supposed to be the last one. And so It's Toy Story 4.- You know that'd do well then. And she just made the (CROSSTALK)- Exactly. They're like, OK, exactly. That's probably what's going to happen.- It's right, but I think that's overall what you're seeing when you think about a holiday weekend. Generally, a holiday weekend for a lot of people is Father's Day weekend as well. Normally, that should be good for moviegoers and movie theaters, but I think a lot of times now you just need a better movie.Like that's what's getting people in. It's not about having a three day weekend or wanting to have a family day. You need to actually have an Oppenheimer or a Barbie that come out a month from now curious to see what those premiers do. And if it's not about the weekend itself, and it's just about the movie being high quality or the movie having a lot of hype.Story continues- I'm a little surprised that like you're disappointed.- I know.- Dismally disappointed. I mean, a lot of parents here, a lot of kids want to go out and see these movies. I'm shocked at these kids, which are not doing that well. Is it more of Ali is it more of a like not a IP generated like I know what I mean? Like sequel generated thing.- I think there are a few issues here. I think one is the fact that Disney had this strategy during the pandemic and really through 2022, to put movies on Disney Plus.- On streaming.- So there is this confusion. OK, what movies are going to be in theaters, which movies are going to be on Disney Plus, and a lot of these kids are seeing the movie. You're really targeting the parents here. So if the parents think it's coming out on Disney Plus, they're not taking their kids.Another thing is marketing. You brought up Oppenheimer and Barbie. That's had stellar marketing, which is why we're talking about it all the time. A lot of these movies, and in particular, Elemental didn't have that musty in the theater type of marketing that I think it could have moving forward.- So marketing. Also, keep in mind, this is a fairly new holiday. We're just the third year in experiencing this as a holiday weekend. So I think families are still trying to figure out what to do with this weekend.- What do we do, right?- Do we travel? Do we go to the movies? How do we play this? Do we do a picnic? A Juneteenth picnic? So I think families are still trying to figure out their footing. What do we do with a weekend like the new third-- we are happy to have a new three day weekend.- But it won't always be, right? Like isn't it going to move-- like so next year, it'll be we're off on a Tuesday, right? So it won't be a three day weekend. I mean, I don't know how--- It's like the 4th of July.- So you wonder how the studios are going to structure their summer movie releases moving forward. Whether this will be a big driver of a weekend or whether 4th of July is going to be the main one.- Always a great roundtable, guys. I think we're going to have to put a pin in our conversation. See what happens next weekend with Elemental and Disney. I don't know. No high hopes.]"
269,806e806c-90dd-3fe6-b24a-19b6af88636c,EXC,2023-06-21,"ComEd Awarded Nearly $15 Million Federal Infrastructure Grant to Enhance Grid Reliability, Help Close Digital Divide on Chicago’s South, West Sides",Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/comed-awarded-nearly-15-million-155700444.html,1687276620,STORY,['EXC'],"[Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act Funding to leverage existing ComEd infrastructure to help increase access to high-speed broadband for 440,000 unserved or underserved households in ChicagoCHICAGO, June 20, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ComEd today announced that it was awarded a $14.5 million Middle Mile Grant by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) that will enhance electric grid reliability and resiliency while also helping to increase broadband connectivity in communities on the south and west sides of Chicago that lack equitable access to affordable broadband.The funding was made available by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), a once-in-a-generation $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure funding opportunity focused on building resilient infrastructure, accelerating an equitable, clean energy transition and creating good-paying jobs in communities. The NTIA made approximately $1 billion available nationwide to reduce the cost of connecting unserved and underserved areas by building out middle mile broadband infrastructure; the Middle Mile Grant application specifically called out investor-owned utilities as one of several entities eligible to apply for this funding.""Advanced communications networks are essential to achieving higher levels of reliability and resiliency of the electric grid, especially as we connect more distributed energy resources like solar and battery storage to the power grid,"" said Michelle Blaise, ComEd’s senior vice president of technical services. ""Like other utilities across the country that are stepping up to the challenge, we are proud to have partnered with community stakeholders to secure federal funding that will leverage our necessary investments in advanced communications networks to create the additional benefit of improving access to high-speed broadband on the west and south sides of Chicago.""Story continuesThe COVID-19 pandemic laid bare the inequities of broadband access, with many of ComEd’s customers shut out from economic opportunities and access to remote services, including telehealth and remote schooling. At the start of the pandemic, according to Kids First Chicago, one in five children under the age of 18 in the City of Chicago lacked access to broadband; despite considerable progress in closing this divide for households with children, as of 2021, nearly 200,000 Chicago households still lack access to broadband.""In an increasingly interconnected world, bridging the digital divide isn't just a matter of equality; it's a fundamental necessity for progress and empowerment, ensuring that no one is left behind in the pursuit of knowledge, opportunity, and social inclusion,"" said Daniel Anello, chief executive officer of Kids First Chicago.For several decades, ComEd has operated and invested in fiber optic infrastructure as part of an advanced communications network that facilitates the automation of the power grid in a way that makes the grid more reliable and secure.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the history of the entertainment industry, the American film and television industry, evolution of online streaming platforms, impact of Covid-19 on online streaming services and future outlook of streaming and go directly to 10 Best TV Shows of All Time.The entertainment industry has a long and varied history, with roots dating back to ancient civilizations. One of the earliest forms of entertainment was the art of storytelling, which has been a part of human culture for millennia. Theater and drama have also been popular for thousands of years and the ancient Greeks are credited with developing the art of theater, as we know it today. However, the global entertainment industry was revolutionized after the invention of the first motion picture camera in 1891. The first movie theater opened in 1905, radio broadcasts began in 1920 and television broadcasts began in 1928, but it was not until after World War II that television was widely adopted as a form of mass communication around the globe. American Film and Television Industry:The production and distribution of motion pictures and television programs is a nation’s most valuable economic and cultural resource. As we mentioned in our article 15 Most Watched TV Shows of 2023, the film and television entertainment sector in the U.S. provides $21 billion in annual payments to more than 260,000 local businesses across the country. The industry is made up of more than 122,000 companies located in every state in America, 92% of which have less than 10 employees. The film and television sector supported a total of 2.1 million jobs and paid $186 billion in total wages in 2021. The industry also provided $29 billion in public tax revenue and earned $14.4 billion in export revenues for the country in 2021. Evolution of Online Streaming Platforms: The global TV and film industry went through a paradigm shift in the last few years with the evolution of online streaming services. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) began as a DVD rental service in 1997, which allowed consumers to select and receive DVDs by mail. In 2007, the company expanded into online streaming of movies and television shows directly from its streaming platform. Now, after 16 years of redefining global entertainment distribution and even giving us some of the greatest TV shows of all time, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) currently has over 222 million subscribers worldwide, a market cap of over $200 billion and boasted a revenue of $31.6 billion in 2022. Story continuesNetflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) opened the door to a new entertainment distribution and production model and was then followed by other popular streaming platforms, like Amazon Prime by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Disney+ by The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), HBO Max by Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc (NASDAQ:WBD) and many others. Impact of Covid-19 on Online Streaming Services: When the entire world went into a lockdown during the Covid-19 pandemic, people could no longer go to theaters or cinemas and so online streaming platforms became an important source of home entertainment. In 2020, the number of streaming subscriptions across platforms crossed one billion worldwide. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) hit 200 million subscribers for the first time and witnessed a 47% growth in revenue from 2019 to 2021. Meanwhile, global box office revenues, which reached a record $42.3 billion in 2019, plunged by over 70% and reached $12 billion in 2020. This was also the first year that China overtook the U.S. as the country with highest box office revenues. Future Outlook of Streaming:It’s fairly clear that streaming is becoming increasingly popular among viewers worldwide. According to Forbes, binge watchers and casual viewers spent 35% of their total TV time streaming in 2022, up from just 10% in 2020, and they streamed an average of 190 billion minutes per week. In addition to increased viewership numbers, streaming services are also pushing for an increase in the number of subscribers. A recent example of this is Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) cracking down on its subscribers sharing their passwords with others. The move seems to have worked and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) had its four largest single days of U.S. customers signing up since it issued the alert. A report by Lightshed Partners has predicted that subscriptions for streaming platforms will cross 1.25 billion by 2024, driven largely by fresh content offering from existing providers, as well as new entrants in the market. With that said, here is a list of the best TV shows in history.30 Best TV Shows of All TimeCopyright: buchachon / 123RF Stock PhotoMethodology: To collect data for our article, we went through several different sources, such as IMDB, Rolling Stone, Reader’s Digest etc., searching for the top-ranking TV shows of all time, and picked the top 5 shows from every index until we had our list of 30 greatest TV shows. Then we ranked these TV series based on their number of appearances in the aforementioned indexes. If you’re also interested to read about our compilation of best movies, please refer to our article 35 Best New Movies on Netflix. 30. Chernobyl (2019)Chernobyl is an HBO original series that offered a brilliant dramatization of the horrors and chaos following the meltdown of a nuclear plant in the Soviet Union in 1986. With a 95% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, the show has 3 Emmys and 2 Golden Globes to its name. 29. Sesame Street (1969-Present)Sesame Street has always been a show on a mission: to educate and entertain both its young target audience and their exhausted parents through a mix of songs, sketches, and a voice that speaks to kids rather than at them. The show that gave us the Cookie Monster, is available for streaming on HBO Max, owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc (NASDAQ:WBD). It has often been regarded by pop culture as one of the best shows of all time.28. Rick and Morty (2013-Present)Although Rick and Morty is a cartoon show with its vivid splashes of color and its improvisational voice acting, it is a hilarious and original sci-fi comedy meant for a mature audience. Each episode is funny, smart and weird and gets you invested in its world and characters. It is estimated that a single episode of the show costs between $1.2 million to $1.5 million and most of this goes into animation and design. 27. The Office U.K. (2001-2003)The Ricky Gervais-led British show that inspired its more famous American counterpart, The Office, was intended to look as ordinary, as mundane and as unremarkable as possible. Instead, it is one of the greatest comedy shows of the 21st century and though it ran for only 14 episodes, the show’s cultural impact is immense. The Office U.K. is available to watch on PrimeVideo, by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)26. Modern Family (2009-2020)Told from the perspective of an unseen documentary filmmaker, Modern Family is one of the most heartwarming shows in the modern era and tells us the story of the Pritchett family. The show has an 85% average audience score on Rotten Tomatoes and is available to watch on Peacock, the streaming platform of NBCUniversal, which, in turn, is owned by the Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA). 25. Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009)The original Battlestar Galactica, which aired in 1978, only enjoyed one season, but Ron Moore’s more modern version of the show is one of the finest examples of a reboot one can imagine. Fans couldn’t get enough of the Galactica crew and their face-off with the Cylons, humanoid robots bent on destruction. The original series in 1978 cost roughly $1 million per episode, more than double that of a prime-time TV show at the time.24. 30 Rock (2006-2013)With an average audience score of 92% on Rotten Tomatoes, 30 Rock was a comedy sitcom on NBC, centered on a young Liz Lemon, currently head writer for a live comedy-sketch show in New York. The show is loosely based on the backstage shenanigans at Saturday Night Live. 23. Better Call Saul (2015-2022)Spin-offs rarely live up to the original show and so people didn’t exactly have high hopes when a spin-off of the legendary series Breaking Bad was announced. Better Call Saul has exceeded expectations and managed to be considered on par with the all-time great show it was born from. For the final season of the series, Bob Odenkirk, the lead actor, reportedly earned $200,000 per episode. Better Call Saul is one of the best TV series of all time on Netflix. 22. Atlanta (2016-2022)With a perfect 100% rating by the top critics, Atlanta is rated one of the best TV shows of all time on Rotten Tomatoes. Atlanta is a comedy sitcom that boldly experiments with tone, storylines and themes, making an unpredictable show that is different with every episode. Donald Glover won Emmys, both as an actor and director for the show. The show is available to stream on Hulu, a platform majorly owned by The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). 21. Lost (2004-2010)Lost is a sci-fi soap opera adventure, with humor, mystery and interesting characters galore. The show follows the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815 when they crashed on a lush, mysterious island. Lost had a budget of around $4 million per episode. The science fiction drama aired on ABC, the flagship property of the Disney Entertainment division of The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). 20. Fleabag (2016-2019)Fleabag is a British comedy-drama television series starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who portrays a woman living in London and navigating her struggling business and busy dating life, while attempting to keep her dark secrets from overcoming her. Fleabag is available to watch on Amazon Prime, the streaming platform of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). 19. Friends (1994-2004)Perhaps one the most popular TV shows of all time, Friends earned more than 60 Emmy nods in its time. The show revolved around the lives of six friends living in New York City and to this day, is still among the most watched shows in the world. Each of the six stars earned $1 million per episode in the 9th season and by the 10th and final season, they were earning approximately $1.6 million per episode. Although Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) hasn’t made Friends available to watch on Netflix US, it can be streamed in several other countries. 18. The Office U.S. (2005-2013)The U.S. adaptation of the Ricky Gervais-led British original, the show features the staff of a fictitious paper company called Dunder Mifflin, based in Scranton. One of the best comedy series of all time, The Office has a hardcore fan base and is still watched by millions today and is the biggest selling point for Peacock. When season 5 of The Office was filmed, the average budget was in the region of $250,000 to $400,000 per episode.17. Band of Brothers (2001)Band of Brothers in American war drama miniseries, based on the non-fictional book of Stephen E. Ambrose. The show follows the story of the Easy Company from 1942 to the end of World War II. Band of Brothers is one of the best tv series of all time on IMDB and is ranked 4th among the top-rated TV shows on the website. Produced by Steven Spielberg, the show had a whopping budget of around $125 million, averaging $12.5 million per episode. Band of Brothers was originally broadcasted on HBO, owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc (NASDAQ:WBD).16. Schitt’s Creek (2015-2020)The Canadian sitcom, made by the father-and-son duo Dan and Eugene Levy, got more popular with time and hit its heyday when it became streamable on Netflix. The final season of Schitt’s Creek pulled off the incredible feat of sweeping the Emmys and won all 7 comedy awards. 15. Succession (2018-present)Succession is a slow moving but captivating drama, once you have an opportunity to dive into the characters that make up the devious Roy family. In such short years, Succession has made a huge impact on the TV landscape. The show has won multiple Emmys and is one of the top 20 series of all time in our list.14. The West Wing (1999-2006)One of the best political drama series of all time, The West Wing, at its best, delivered brilliant dialogue, powerful performances, and an inspirational look at the American political system. The show has a slew of awards to its name and continues to be one of the most re-watched shows of the era. The West Wing aired on NBC, owned by Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA).13. I Love Lucy (1952-1957)Many sitcoms have come and gone over the years, but Lucy is eternal. The show pushed the boundaries of television in many ways, including creating the multi-camera sitcom and even depicting Lucy’s real-life pregnancy onscreen. For an era when two leads had to be portrayed as sleeping in separate beds, this was quite a bold move. With all the influence that it has had on TV sitcom history, I Love Lucy is easily one of the best series of all time.12. Cheers (1982-1993) Even though viewers weren’t physically present in that iconic bar in Boston, everyone felt a part of the Cheers family by tuning in to the sitcom each week. The show even spawned an equally successful spin-off, Frasier. Cheers got a 98% rating by Critics on Rotten Tomatoes. 11. Star Trek: The Original Series (1966-1969)The most important and influential sci-fi series ever produced, the original series of Star Trek marked the debut of characters like Spock and Captain Kirk, before leading to several blockbuster movies and subsequent TV shows. The first season of Star Trek in 1966 had a budget of $190,000 per episode.Click to continue reading and see the 10 Best TV Shows of All Time.Suggested Articles:25 Best TV Shows on Hulu in 202315 Most Anticipated TV Shows of 202335 Best Thriller Movies on NetflixDisclosure: None. 30 Best TV Shows of All Time is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

""Couple this with the reality that protecting their relationship with viewers has become paramount in an increasingly competitive ad marketplace, and you can see why we’re committed to helping our clients solve this complex challenge.""The added intricacy in dynamically serving advertising outside of the traditional linear ad environment, whether on AVOD, FAST or other streaming platforms, can result in problems such as latency, ad repetition, the showing of slate and other unwanted consequences. As a result, both the viewing experience and advertising effectiveness can suffer.To help address these issues, the goal of FreeWheel’s Viewer Experience Lab is two-fold:Conduct quantifiable research to help advertising buyers and sellers understand the impact of different ad experiences on viewer experience and performance, including viewer response to new and evolving ad formats;Develop solutions and interoperable technologies fueled by these new insights that allow video content providers to implement best practices and provide seamless ad viewing experiences in a multi-platform, premium video ecosystem.Story continuesFreeWheel chose MediaScience as an inaugural research partner to provide bespoke research for The Viewer Experience Lab.

Indeed, the sector grappled with unique systemic risks, even as interest rate hikes and economic contraction beat down most stock sectors.With flat growth and declining trends in critical countries, OPEC member states responded to plummeting commodity pricing by introducing unexpected production cuts. However, despite OPEC+ announcing a substantial cut of more than one million daily barrels in May, crude oil ETFs like the United States Brent Oil Fund LP (NYSEARCA:BNO) showed no improvement. Most of these funds have lost around 5% since the cuts, at the time of writing.The industry’s woes have compounded further. Generally, ongoing geopolitical concerns and supply constraints remain the key focus for investors. Thus, as the market grapples with the implications of Russian sanctions and reduced exports, OPEC’s political clashes could escalate this situation.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDespite Russia’s claim that its production-cutting measures are aimed at boosting prices to support military efforts, doubts persist over whether their actions match their words. Industry insiders believe Russia is focusing on the short-term, aiming to maximize production and sell at the highest price possible given sanctions.This scenario casts the entire industry in a game of chicken as each player tries to anticipate the others’ moves to optimize their options and pump revenue higher.Accordingly, many oil stocks have moved lower in recent weeks. Here are three that are still on sale, amid what appears to be a rebound brewing in this space.XLEEnergy Select Sector SPDR Fund$80.93OXYOccidental Petroleum$58.77DVNDevon Energy$50.39Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE)Three wood blocks spelling out ""ETF"". representing best etfsSource: ShutterstockAn effective exchange traded fund (ETF) is tough to top for investors bullish on an entire sector. Notably, ETFs open an avenue for investors to tap into the entire sector’s potential, while mitigating individual company hazards that come with creating a single-stock portfolio.Story continuesThus, if the broad oil sector is on your radar, Energy Selector Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLE) should be at the top of your investing shortlist. Replicating the Energy Select Sector Index, it holds all industry-wide stocks in the S&amp;P 500. Since most of those entries are oil and gas stocks, XLE is an ideal vehicle for industry-wide bets since it closely tracks benchmarks like the Brent crude index.One deterrent to investing directly into benchmarks by choosing funds is the exorbitant fee structure associated with commodity ETFs built on a foundation of complex derivatives. For example, BNO’s fund expense ratio is a staggering 1%, dwarfing XLE’s 0.10%. Accordingly, the XLE ETF is a great way for investors to gain low-cost diversification within this sector.Moreover, XLE’s portfolio of oil and gas stocks offers a unique upside. With a 4.3% trailing-twelve-month dividend yield, XLE’s holdings are a “who’s who” of industry stalwarts that reduces the risk of catastrophic capital loss by casting a wide net in the energy sector and offering exposure to all aspects of the oil and gas industry. Ultimately, this provides portfolio diversification and broader long-term upside potential for investors.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comOccidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is a perennial trader favorite, but is increasingly catching institutional investors’ eye. Heavy-hitter Warren Buffett has been steadily buying into the company throughout the year, now sitting on more than 200 million shares worth $13 billion as of May 31.Occidental embodies Buffett’s value investing ethos and a proactive approach to climate concerns as it offers future-forward sustainable innovations alongside robust operations that remain resilient. A major player in America’s principal oil production regions, the company enjoys a significant and sticky market share due to its presence in these flowing fields.Last quarter, Occidental surpassed production expectations by 2%, maintained spending levels under $6 billion, and hit an impressive 24.58% TTM profit margin. The company’s return on invested capital is 22.34%, blowing the 17.63% industry average away. As always, Warren Buffett stocks are solid picks, and OXY stock isn’t an exception.Devon Energy (DVN)The logo for Devon Energy (DVN) is displayed on a sign outside an office.Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comDividend investors may find Devon Energy Corp’s (NYSE:DVN) hefty 10.8% yield irresistible, and oil enthusiasts can likewise leverage sizable kickbacks to generate a regular cash flow or reinvest into a larger position.Indeed, despite being a prevalent player in less productive fields, Devon has a firm foothold in these regions and anticipates its stellar operational performance will continue.Devon’s downside is its limited growth prospects recently referenced by management. But the company’s consistent cash flow and enduring commitment to shareholder value (as evidenced by a $3 billion buyback program) position it as a solid opportunity for those seeking consistent income while awaiting a potential industry rebound.Even though the company’s growth potential might seem capped due to limited expansion opportunities, Devon’s stable yield offers a solid option for a well-blended growth and income portfolio.On the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held a long position in OXY.

More impressive this jumped 16% from the prior year quarter with earnings at $3.35 a share in Q2 2022.

To see more of these stocks, you can go directly to see the top 5 Tech Stocks Benefiting From The AI Boom.The world of artificial intelligence (AI) these days is overwhelmingly dominated by discussions on generative AI and its implications. Simply put, generative AI is a form of machine learning through which AI software can produce text, video, images, and more. Basically, generative AI can produce any form of content on the basis of prompts. This form of AI became more widespread and renowned after the launch of ChatGPT and similar generative AI platforms, which revolutionized the AI sector while pulling in major tech companies to become part of the AI race.This form of AI and its impact on the markets was discussed by Jim Stewart, a New York Times columnist, on CNBC's 'Squawk on the Street' on June 16. According to Stewart, big tech companies, especially those that are AI beneficiaries, have been leading the recent stock market rally. These include companies such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Stewart claimed that he was bullish on AI, especially considering the fact that this technology could boost productivity gains across different fields, including journalism.AI and the US Stock MarketIn May, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) joined the group of companies with valuations in trillions of dollars. Many financial professionals today are attributing the gains of the S&amp;P 500 to AI, primarily, with the focus being on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and other big tech companies that have begun incorporating AI and generative AI in their products and services.This overwhelming focus on a select few number of companies that can successfully play the AI boom and come out victorious has led to many investors worrying that the stock market in 2023 will turn into a selection of a few winners and a lot more losers. According to CNBC, the S&amp;P 500 has ""basically been the S&amp;P 7,"" a reference to the fact that only seven major tech companies have been calling the shots so far in 2023, leading the market to heavily rely on them and their gains.Story continues""You Are At The Starting Line Of AI""This reality has led many professionals and corporations to realize that the AI boom is very real and may be here to stay. Companies today will be bound to figure out where they stand in this environment and how they can integrate AI into their business models to reap the benefits of this technological revolution. NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO, Jensen Huang, in an address at the National Taiwan University in May, stated that we are currently at ""the starting line of AI"" and that at this moment, we should run instead of walking. The implications of his statement are many, but perhaps the most obvious lesson to take away from Huang's speech is that companies and individuals today shouldn't be slow to join the AI race - they should try their best to become part of it and ensure they don't end up getting left behind by their competitors.Keeping the above-mentioned market dynamics and developments in mind, we have compiled a list of the top tech stocks to consider investing in to play the AI boom. We included the obvious stock picks because of their contributions to this industry so far, but we also attempted to find other companies that wouldn't be the first to come to your mind when looking at AI beneficiaries today.10 Tech Stocks Benefiting From The AI Boom Pixabay/Public DomainOur MethodologyTo select our stocks, we looked at which companies analysts are expecting to benefit from the AI boom and shortlisted them based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter of 2023.

(NASDAQ:CRWD) shares as of June 16. The analyst also raised the firm's price target on the stock from $162 to $190.Artisan Partners made the following comment about CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.

CrowdStrike rebounded as its financial results eased demand-related concerns in its core endpoint business, while adoption in platform adjacencies continued to rise.”CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD), like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), is a tech stock that can benefit immensely during the AI boom.8.

The new MI300X chip was described by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) as ""the world's most advances accelerator for generative AI.""Citadel Investment Group held 13.9 million shares in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) at the end of the first quarter, making the fund the most prominent shareholder in the company for that quarter.This is what Horizon Kinetics LLC said about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“It is among what are considered to be the great technology companies, like Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel, that one is apt to see some of the greatest confusion between short-term financial results and share price movements, on the one hand, and long-term financial results. The former are exceedingly difficult to predict. Long term results are relatively easy to predict, because they are bound by the limiting realities of the business model. In the case of AMD, that is the business of being a large-scale semi-conductor manufacturer with a more dominant competitor that has a scale economy advantage.Here’s what people see, remember and act upon. In the past several years, AMD has been the best performing major technology stock. It’s outperformed Apple, Amazon, Google, Meta (Facebook) and Nvidia…” (Click here to read the full text)7. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a diversified software and information technology company based in San Jose, California. The company's flagship product is its Creative Cloud, a subscription service offering members access to its creative products.John Blackledge at TD Cowen sees Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) as a smart AI play because the company has begun rolling out new generative-AI content creation tools.An Outperform rating was reiterated on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) shares on June 16 by Kirk Materne at Evercore ISI. The analyst also raised his price target on the stock from $475 to $590.A total of 99 hedge funds were long Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $7.3 billion.Polen Capital mentioned Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“One area we are watching regarding Alphabet and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is AI systems and their capabilities, including generative AI. Interestingly, both Adobe and Alphabet could see benefits or threats from the emergence of generative AI and large language models (LLMs). Both companies already use generative AI to the benefit of their users in anticipating how content creators edit their work (Adobe) and in how search results are anticipated and generated (Google). At the same time, breakthrough technologies like AI can open the door to additional competition and/or impact a company’s profitability levels. We now see AI systems others are developing, including LLMs and generative AI offerings, that could be more competitive in the future. While we think it remains early days for ChatGPT and the capabilities of these types of LLMs and generative AI programs like DALL-E, the technology seems to be progressing at a fast rate and will at least require a strong response from incumbents.As of now, we believe Alphabet and Adobe are leaders in their own right in these areas and have a clear path to improving their existing offerings with AI advancements, which would allow them to be net beneficiaries of AI. There are also significant barriers to building leading AI offerings in these areas. As a result, our position sizes in Adobe and Alphabet remain sizeable. For Adobe, the status of its pending $20 billion-plus Figma acquisition is also uncertain. There is a good chance, in our view, that it will be blocked by regulators, which would mean the future opportunity to expand its offerings to the developer community (beyond designers) may not occur.”Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), is a smart stock pick to play the AI boom.6. Apple Inc.

To see more of them, you can go directly to see Michael Jordan, 5 Richest Black Americans and Their Stock Picks.At the moment this article is being written, the date is June 19, 2023, also known as Juneteenth. This date marks the historic occasion of the emancipation of enslaved Black Americans back in 1865. From that time till today, Black Americans have come a long way, but they still continue to fight against systemic discrimination and racism. In a global environment such as this, every time a Black American breaks free to ascend beyond the glass wall, they issue a cause for celebration. The existence of several Black American billionaires today is one such cause for celebration.In our list below, we go over some of the most famous and successful Black Americans alive today, ranging from actors and singers like Tyler Perry and Rihanna to athletes such as Tiger Woods and LeBron James. These individuals have paved a tireless path for themselves over the past few decades, breaking all barriers and establishing a name for themselves in their respective fields through various activities. They include their business ventures, as in the case of Rihanna, for example, and even brand endorsements from mega-corporations like McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), as in the case of LeBron James and other athletes. And, of course, a source of wealth that is of immense importance is also the investments each of these individuals has, whether in private companies or public ones or even in real estate and sports teams.The Charlotte Hornets SaleA sports team that has offered immense wealth and growth to one of the billionaires on our list is the Charlotte Hornets, owned by basketball legend Michael Jordan. However, news this June has revealed that Jordan is actually moving towards the sale of his majority stake in this prized asset while he continues to retain minority ownership of the team. According to CNBC, Jordan will be raking in $3 billion from this sale to investors Gabe Plotkin and Rick Schnall, when he initially had bought the majority stake in the team in 2010 for $275 million. Provided the sale does go through, these figures mean that Jordan will be exiting his majority stake in the team after making 10 times his original investment.Story continuesIf the sale goes through, other assets that will be passed on include the Hornets Sports &amp; Entertainment Group, the G League team, the Greensboro Swarm esports team, and the Hornets Venom GT. The sale will also include the transfer of the Spectrum Center, where the Charlotte Hornets play. However, before anything can be confirmed, the NBA Board of Governors has to approve the sale.How The List Of America's Richest Black Billionaires Has ChangedJordan's decision to sell the Charlotte Hornets probably does not surprise those who keep updated on the prices of sports franchises. The opportunity to cash in on billions of dollars when you initially put in an investment of millions would tempt anyone. The fact of the matter remains that trends will always keep shifting, and so will the markets. This means that those who can keep up with these changes will be the ones who benefit in the long run. When we covered the richest Black Americans back in our 2021 article, some names such as Rihanna, LeBron James, Alexander Karp, and Tiger Woods were not included. Between 2021 and 2023, these individuals have also risen to the top, becoming part of the select few within the Black American community who have managed to achieve the status of being a billionaire.Rihanna became the youngest self-made female billionaire in the US in 2022 after the immense success of her makeup company, Fenty Beauty. LeBron James, a stellar NBA player, also achieved his billionaire status in 2022, raking in most of his wealth from his business ventures and endorsements with major companies like NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), as mentioned above. Alexander Karp has been a billionaire since at least 2015 after having founded the successful Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR), and finally, Tiger Woods, a professional golf player, was certified as a billionaire by Forbes in 2022 as well.At the same time, Kanye West seems to have dropped off our list because he lost several multi-year deals worth billions of dollars. These include the Adidas deal for the Yeezy sneaker brand and the Gap, CAA, and Balenciaga deals. The above shows how the list of Black billionaires in the US is ever-changing but also ever-expanding, and that in itself is a significant achievement for Black Americans today. To commemorate Juneteenth and now the historic success of these individuals, we have compiled a list of the richest Black Americans today while also highlighting their stock picks.Michael Jordan, Richest Black Americans and Their Stock PicksOur MethodologyTo pick the individuals for our list, we checked the net worths of the richest Black Americans as of 2023, using Forbes' data. We shortlisted the 10 richest Black Americans and ranked them based on their net worth, from the lowest to the highest value.Michael Jordan, Richest Black Americans and Their Stock Picks10. Tyler PerryNet Worth: $1 billionTyler Perry is a well-known Black American director, actor, producer, and writer. He began his career in entertainment in the 1990s, starting with live theatre and gradually moving to film and television by the 2000s.While Perry may be best known for his role in the Madea franchise, which grossed over $660 million, a significant portion of his wealth has been coming from his business ventures in the media sector. Perry has a huge stake in a renowned cable network, BET, and reports this June have been stating that he may be acquiring this network alongside VH1. Both of these networks are owned by Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA), implying that this would be the stock Perry is most inclined towards.A significant portion of Perry's wealth is also derived from his ownership of his films and Tyler Perry Studios, which is the biggest film-production studio in the US as of this February.9. LeBron JamesNet Worth: $1 billionLeBron James is an NBA player and the first active NBA player to become a billionaire. He currently plays for the Los Angeles Lakers. The key to James' wealth is not his basketball career alone. Rather, the fact that he has been taking equity in the brands he works with has helped James achieve his billionaire status today.The brands James has equity in include Beats by Dre, owned by Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Blaze Pizza. He has also invested in Fenway Sports Group, a move that made him a part owner of the Boston Red Sox, Liverpool Football Club, and some other sports teams.James has also been part of several brand endorsements for companies like McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE).8. Tiger WoodsNet Worth: $1.1 billionTiger Woods is a professional golfer, a career through which he has earned about $1.8 billion. This includes a PGA Tour-record $121 million in prize money. He is the second active athlete to become a billionaire, after LeBron James.Woods has invested his money mostly in two homes on Jupiter Island alongside a golf-course design business and a high-end mini-golf chain, Popstroke.

You can skip our detailed analysis of non-fungible tokens and the outlook of the industry, and go directly to read 5 Best NFT Stocks to Buy Now. NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are digital assets that represent ownership of a unique item or a piece of content. NFTs utilize blockchain technology, which ensures their authenticity and traceability. While this concept had been around for a few years prior, it was in 2017 that NFTs captured mainstream attention and generated widespread interest through the launch of Cryptokitties, a blockchain-based game. It allowed users to collect, breed, and trade virtual cats represented as NFTs.NFTs are primarily bought and sold through NFT marketplaces, which serve as platforms where creators can list their NFTs for sale, and buyers can browse and purchase those NFTs. Some well-known marketplaces include OpenSea, Rarible, Foundation, and Mintable. Investing in NFTs can be challenging for amateurs as it requires a combination of research, knowledge, and personal preferences. The best NFTs for beginners would be those that are unique, well-executed, and have the potential to grow because the market is highly volatile and subject to rapid changes.In 2021, a significant surge in interest, adoption, and activity surrounding NFTs was observed. Numerous high-profile NFT sales and collaborations with mainstream artists, musicians, athletes, and brands captured broad interest and media coverage. One notable example was the sale of Beeple's artwork, ""Everydays— The First 5000 Days,"" which fetched $69 million at auction in March 2021. This sale made headlines and solidified NFTs as a viable platform for digital art. However, high-interest rates and inflation last year brought the sustainability and long-term value of the NFT market into question. In December 2022, NFT sales dropped to their lowest level since July 2021, as reported by Bloomberg. Reuters also mentioned DappRadar data in its report, highlighting that NFT sales fell to $3.4 billion in the third quarter of 2022, from $8.4 billion in the prior-year quarter.Story continuesDespite such performance last year, the overall NFT market showed signs of recovery in 2023. According to DappRadar, a total of 19.4 million NFTs were sold during the first quarter of 2023, up 8.5% from the previous quarter. The report also mentioned that the trading volumes climbed $4.7 billion during the quarter, showing a 137% growth from the preceding quarter. In addition to this, the development of user-friendly marketplaces and improved infrastructure contributed to growing sales. For example, Blend, a new peer-to-peer perpetual lending platform, made over $442 million in sales in May. Launched on May 1, Blur now represents 65% of the overall NFT market share, as reported by Fortune.The gradual rise of digital art and collectibles has fueled the growth of the NFT market. According to Market Research’s report, the NFT market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 27.6% from 2022 to 2032, gaining a value of $342.5 billion. The report also highlighted that the market was valued at $38.2 billion in 2022.NFTs also grabbed the attention of some major companies and brands. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) auctioned its NFTs for over $575,000 in 2021. Similarly, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) launched a limited edition of McRib NFTs in 2021 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of its pork sandwich. NIKE, Inc.

Although sales came in slightly lower than expectations, strong gross margins drove a solid earnings beat. MAT maintained its full-year revenue outlook but lowered its EPS guide to account for Fx headwinds and greater promotions and discounts on high price-point items. We remain encouraged by management’s execution on its strategy to grow market share, improve profitability and generate higher levels of cash flow. We continue to view MAT as an undervalued asset with attractive growth prospects, particularly with the reintroduction of the Disney Princess and Frozen toy lines, Trolls, the global launch of Monster High, and product support around the highly anticipated Barbie movie in 2023.”7. DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37A sports betting company, DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG) is next on our list of the best NFT stocks to buy now. The company's NFT market allows users to access, view, or sell their NFTs bought through the company. The marketplace is particularly popular among those looking to trade sports collectibles.In the first quarter of 2023, DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG) generated $770 million in revenues, which showed an 84.7% growth from the same period last year. The company also reported a 39% year-over-year growth in its Monthly Unique Payers (MUP) to 2.8 million on average.DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG) is gaining positive ratings from Wall Street analysts following its strong quarterly earnings. In June, both BTIG Research and Jefferies Financial Group raised their price targets on the stock to $31 and $35, respectively.As of the close of Q1 2023, 37 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database owned stakes in DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG), up from 32 a quarter earlier. The total value of these stakes is over $1.1 billion.Baron Funds made the following comment about DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“We re-initiated a position in former Fund holding DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG), a leading online sportsbook, digital casino, and daily fantasy sports operator. DraftKings’ mobile applications offer consumers the ability to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and play hundreds of real-money casino games. The company has spent the past three years building a proprietary technology stack that improves the customer experience and delivers best-in-class breadth of bet types (such as parlays, same-game parlays, and player props). State-level online sports betting (OSB) and iCasino legalization, along with a multi-year consumer adoption timeline in active states, has supported a 90% revenue growth rate for DraftKings since 2020. The opportunity for OSB legalization remains significant, with under 50% of the U.S. population currently having legal mobile sports betting. We expect 65% to 80% of the population will eventually have access to OSB. ICasino is currently legal in just seven states representing roughly 13% of the population. ICasino product adoption in legalized states has been robust, with the average user spending twice as much as a sports bettor. While the pace of legalization for iCasino has been slower, we believe additional states will pass regulation in the coming years.As U.S. states began to legalize sports betting, the DraftKings management team moved quickly to build widespread brand awareness. DraftKings is the #2 operator in both OSB and iCasino by a wide margin, and has demonstrated improving market share trends across almost all states. When a new state legalizes sports betting, DraftKings has a first mover advantage as many of its customers are converted from the DraftKings daily fantasy sports offering. The quality of their sportsbook product along with increasingly targeted promotional spending results in strong customer retention and high lifetime values. In states where iCasino is legal, DraftKings can cross-sell OSB customers. DraftKings’ scale and product advantages are creating a flywheel that will enable the company to continue to out-invest the competition in acquisition marketing, retention, and research and development. The high barriers to entry are resulting in a consolidated industry that will eventually lead to a highly profitable business. This is evidenced by older-vintage state contribution margins that are already approaching 40%. Longer term, we believe DraftKings can generate EBITDA margins between 20% and 30% with strong free-cash-flow conversion.”6. Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) is a California-based IT service management company that provides a wide range of services, including cloud and cybersecurity. In the first quarter of 2023, the company reported revenue of $290.2 million, up 36.8% from the same period last year. Its operating cash flow for the quarter came in at $36.4 million, which represented 13% of its total revenue. The company also generated roughly $14 million in free cash flow.In 2021, Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) announced that its Cloudflare Stream platform supports NFTs. The platform allows users to host and deliver video content associated with NFTs. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) are some other major companies expanding their NFT exposure.At the end of March 2023, 41 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database reported having stakes in Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET), up from 40 in the preceding quarter. These stakes are collectively worth $774.7 million.Baron Funds mentioned Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We also added to Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) during the quarter, the leading cloud-based networking and software infrastructure provider. Despite facing a macro-driven elongation of deal cycles, the company reported solid quarterly results with 42% year-over-year revenue growth, while also guiding to 37% growth for 2023. The company’s speed of innovation enables it to continuously grow its opportunity set as it adds more products to its platform, solving additional problems for customers from network services to zero-trust. Its scale-based competitive advantages enable it to be the low-cost provider in the industry, while also having significant volumes of data to power its AI models and improve its product over time. Once it gets customers on board, Cloudflare is then able to cross-sell them additional networking and security solutions at high marginal profitability, as they are served on the same underlying infrastructure and thus the company doesn’t need to spend once more on customer acquisition. This creates a virtuous cycle that should enable Cloudflare to become an important part of the infrastructure layer of organizations over time, in our view.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best NFT Stocks to Buy Now. Suggested articles:12 Best Short Squeeze Stocks to Buy Now11 Best Health Insurance Stocks to Buy10 Reliable Dividend Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up OnDisclosure.

Tariq Hassan, McDonald's USA Chief Marketing and Customer Experience Officer, sits down with Yahoo Finance Live at the 2023 Cannes Lions Festival to discuss strategies to reinvigorate the brand and connect with younger customers.Video Transcript[UPBEAT MUSIC][SHIP HORN BLOWING]BRAD SMITH: Welcome back. Yahoo Finance here at Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity. And joining us now, we've got a great one for you, folks, Tariq Hassan who is the Chief Marketing Officer and Chief Customer Experience Officer at McDonald's. You know him, you love the arches. Thanks so much for taking some time for us.TARIQ HASSAN: Thanks for having me. Pleasure to be here.BRAD SMITH: Absolutely. All right, without kind belaboring this, we got to ask because everybody wants to know about Grimace. Can we talk about Grimace for a hot second?TARIQ HASSAN: --talk. It's about Grimace, right? And Yahoo Purple.BRAD SMITH: It is.TARIQ HASSAN: We're in color.BRAD SMITH: And so, I mean, yeah. I think about Grimace. I think about my own Philadelphia sports fandom. We grew up with some questionable mascots growing up. We had the Phillie Phanatic, we had Gritty. People wonder what they are. People wonder what Grimace is.BRIAN SOZZI: What does Grimace represent?TARIQ HASSAN: Yeah so Grimace-- well, first of all, Grimace represents joy and happiness, right, in the way he shows up. But a lot of debate over what Grimace actually is, even in our own culture and a little bit of lore.But the lore is that he represents a taste bud.BRAD SMITH: So it is a he?TARIQ HASSAN: Well--BRIAN SOZZI: You were right, Brad. I didn't realize it was a taste bud. I'm an '80s kid. I [INAUDIBLE].TARIQ HASSAN: So he's supposedly a taste bud but he's joy, right? I mean, if you think about the happiness, and the joy he brings, and he's kind of like McDonald Land friend glue, keeps everybody together and optimistic. And we love bringing him back. People are having a great time.Story continuesBRIAN SOZZI: So I've seen grimace really explode on social media over the past few weeks. How does that translate into the business of McDonald's? Do you see a pickup in traffic because of this? Really, you've hit a cultural moment with this character.TARIQ HASSAN: You hit on the bigger issue which is the leverage of culture in general that we're driving the business with and I use that word very specifically because it's one thing to connect with your audience, but like at the end of the day, our responsibility is also to drive the business and make sure we're showing up for our franchisees and growing the business.What we uncovered actually a few years ago when Morgan first launched Travis Scott and our famous orders was an awakening of the brand. People reconnecting and realizing that there was a value to this brand that frankly, I think, we had forgotten and we'd lost a bit of our swagger.But what really untapped for us was the power of culture. And that's a big word, everyone uses it. But we set that as our North Star to really become a cultural icon. And we talk about meeting culture at the intersection of Commerce, to your point about driving the business.But that's a big word. So what do we do with it? And we talk about in four areas. For a food company, so of course you're going to impact the taste of culture. We want to live in the culture of our fans. We're leveraging data to create value, which creates long-term relationships and with a digital-first generation, that is culture with them.And then we're McDonald's, so we shouldn't just be participating in culture, we should be creating it. Which means if you're going to do it externally, that gives you a thought to how you have to build that culture internally. And that's really what's been the driver of the business for the last 2 and 1/2 years.BRAD SMITH: You mentioned the Travis Scott collaboration, that was just one of many. It seems like there's one that's coming out every other week at this point. But they are some of the most famous musicians, entertainers, people who are already circulating within homes on a daily basis and around the world. And so from a McDonald's perspective, from a business person's perspective, how does that translate into quantifiable returns for the brand?TARIQ HASSAN: Yeah. Well, first of all, it starts with who you choose to work with. And for us, while the list of who you rattled off are some great folks, what's fantastic about them is we're not working with them because they're celebrities, we're actually working with them because they're actually fans of the business already.And that's why you're seeing we don't just partner with them, we actually collaborate with them and we're turning the pen over to them. So in the case of Travis Scott, you know, involved in the design, package design, involved in the merch design. BTS, same thing. Mariah.And the thing is, all those meals are theirs, right? And so what you're really doing is tapping into the fact that everyone's got their meal that's their favorite and this gives you a chance to tap into these celebs that you love as fans and taste a little of their favorites. And what we are seeing is absolute translation into the sales and the growth of the business.BRIAN SOZZI: What's next on the partnership front?TARIQ HASSAN: Oh, you're going to come at me on that, are you? So here's what I will tell you, it's not another famous order. You probably have seen your last famous order for a little while. We had a great experience with that.You're going to see us continue to tap into that childhood loss that you saw us do last fall with the adult Happy Meal and with cactus plant flea market. We're going continue to play in that space. And you're seeing it today with Grimace. And that was a really good way of me dodging telling you specifically what's next.BRIAN SOZZI: So why--TARIQ HASSAN: Because I got to surprise and delight--BRIAN SOZZI: Why target-- I guess, you're kind of targeting me? I'm guess an aging millennial, why such a focus on that demographic and why are you so confident you can get that customer back in the door?TARIQ HASSAN: So here's what's great, we're actually targeting multicultural youth. And we had a real down cycle on how we were doing with that segment. So that 17 to 34 or 17 to 24 kind of range that's really important and really, also thinking about the multicultural youth.And you think about the youth market today, the most diverse market we've ever seen as a generation. But what we're doing is we're tapping in and understanding that fan relationship and then we're wrapping the executions around things that have a little more universal appeal.So that Happy Meal experience, no matter what generation you were, you understood it and you related to it. You wrap a cactus plant flea market over, you connect with the youth market. You tap into the [? insight ?] around the Happy Meal and I remind you of your youth.And so it's really a reflection of how this brand just has an incredible universal emotional connection with folks and you just got to wrap it up in a way that anyone can find their way to connect with it.BRAD SMITH: At the same time, people think of an environment like this where the recession word is thrown out there in every other conversation seems like. And they're trying to find value in their purchases, especially in the food that they're putting into their bodies, that they're going out and giving to their family as well. During a time where consumers are looking to McDonald's, how does that either elevate the marketing spend or cause you to be more judicious about where you're spending?TARIQ HASSAN: Yeah, look, I think the good news is, for us, we are a brand that people have always expected that affordability and value and we show up for our customers to deliver that for them. But we're living in some pretty unprecedented times in terms of what that inflation looks like.And so we continue to ensure that we've got offerings on the menu, whether that's our value meal offerings, or how we think about pricing and relationship to the market and ensuring that we're listening to our customers. Even the way we approach our pricing strategy is through the lens of understanding what our customers are willing to deal with in this environment. And make sure we're there for them.And we're accelerating through this time where others are struggling. And the scale of our organization allows us to pass on that benefit to our customers. And that's something we're going to continue to do, frankly, recession or not.BRIAN SOZZI: As you look into the presidential election cycle next year, we're getting a lot of different range of opinions. A lot of marketers are telling us we're going to continue to be out there front and center. Others, I think, have suggested to us they're going to pull back. From a McDonald's standpoint, where do you stand? Do you want to see an ad for a Big Mac placed next to, let's say, an article on a Biden-Trump re-election run?TARIQ HASSAN: Look, I think, for us, whether it's an election year or not, we line the brand up around some pretty specific brand safety approaches and values for the brand. And we line those up against the media strategy for everything we do.We're a brand that-- like 90% of the country walks through our doors every year. And so we are one of the most democratized brand in the country which means we just have to be in a place where we represent that relationship to everyone.On the whole, we don't tend to spend a lot in the news space. Frankly, it's just not where our customers are and it's frankly not where the values of the brand sit. And so I think unlike certain brands that are maybe trying to figure out how they juggle that, we know where that place is where we meet our fans, where they're contextually thinking about us, and those are the places we're going to be.What I will tell you is we don't envision any kind of slowdown in how we're approaching the growth of the business and continue to support it because it's working and we're seeing it both in terms of our sales, but also, what we're seeing in terms of fan affinity for the brand.BRAD SMITH: Are the chicken sandwich wars done?TARIQ HASSAN: No. Make no mistake. And we're really thrilled. We continue to steal share in that side of the business. It is going to be as robust as the burger business is. As you look at the consumption of chicken in the country, it continues to grow. We are not taking our eye off the ball. We got a great sandwich in McCrispy.BRIAN SOZZI: Well you have a different philosophy, I think, in chicken sandwiches. You have the spice in a dressing on top of the chicken. Everybody else breads it in. You know, I consume these products.TARIQ HASSAN: Well, remember we carry too, right? If you're a long-time lover of a McChicken like I am, that's got that great peppery batter right on it, but then the crispy chicken gets you into the larger patty and a whole meat sandwich that people just love. And so we think we're going continue to play there. And of course, we've got our famous nuggets which nobody comes--BRIAN SOZZI: Brad, he did his job. He sold me on a sandwich.BRAD SMITH: Facts and [? McNuggets ?] at the same time. Thanks so much for joining us.TARIQ HASSAN: Hey, it's a real pleasure to be able to talk to you guys, thanks so much.BRAD SMITH: That's McDonald's Chief Marketing Officer and Chief Customer Experience Officer, Tariq Hassan, joining us here at Cannes Lyon Festival of Creativity. We'll toss it back to you in New York.RACHELLE AKUFFO: All right, that was Yahoo Finance's Brad Smith and Brian Sozzi there, speaking with McDonald's USA Chief Marketing and Customer Experience Officer, Tariq Hassan.]"

Rowe Price released its outlook for global financial markets for the balance of 2023 and the message is reluctantly bearish for the short term, with more room for optimism over the longer term. Contributing factors making the near term uncertain include:Stubborn inflation, despite some recent slowingTightening financial conditions and higher interest ratesA risk of recessions in many developed marketsReduced lending after the failure of several U.S. regional banksThe resilience of many world economies is being tested as the effects of a steep U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hiking cycle and a shift from quantitative easing to quantitative tightening are still being felt.  Labor markets remain strong and are an important signal for investors to watch as any softening could increase the risk of a recession.  As always, company earnings are an important focus.  Although equity markets have delivered gains in the first half of 2023, earnings estimates may be too high for a weakening economy, putting further pressure on equity valuations.  Bonds, which suffered badly in 2022 alongside stocks, present potentially attractive opportunities in high yield, bank loans, and sovereign and local currency debt in certain emerging markets.QUOTESArif Husain, Head of International Fixed Income and Chief Investment Officer""The market is trying to reconcile two very different scenarios – one where the U.S. economy remains fairly strong and the Fed doesn't cut rates, and one where the Fed has to cut by several percentage points.  In Europe, I expect both the European Central Bank and the Bank of England to raise rates despite the associated economic risks.  The Fed and other central banks in developed markets will lower rates eventually, but the timing is tricky.  Rates are likely to remain higher for longer.  Some emerging markets may be on the verge of rate cuts, but they are only attractive on a very selective basis.""Story continuesSébastien Page*, Head of Global Multi-Asset and Chief Investment Officer""Whenever the Fed has slammed on the brakes, someone's head has gone through the windshield.  This time it was some U.S. regional banks.  Stock valuations aren't broadly attractive right now, but small- and mid-cap stocks are trading at significant discounts to their historical averages, with small-caps priced like it's 2008.  In an uncertain environment, market dislocations are inevitable.  With both stocks and bonds, skilled active management can help navigate market volatility by taking advantage of opportunities and avoiding riskier exposures. My takeaway fits in a fortune cookie: stay invested, stay diversified.""Justin Thomson, Head of International Equity and Chief Investment Officer""Some major economies delivered a welcome boost to global growth in the first half of 2023.  Falling energy prices helped eurozone economies avoid recession, while China lifted COVID restrictions faster than expected.  A weak yen helped Japan's export sector.  But much of the momentum has faded, with the exception of Japan, where corporations have seen a return of pricing power and positive governance reforms have taken root.  Artificial intelligence (AI) should continue to drive investment in a range of tech sectors.  There is an AI arms race underway, and the strong tech companies are likely to get stronger.""ABOUT T.

301,58e81c68-9f48-3b41-b9eb-74f5ed40b38f,UPS,2023-06-21,Column: A Teamsters strike against UPS could remake the union movement for the better,LA Times,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/column-teamsters-strike-against-ups-120031109.html,1687348831,STORY,"['SBUX', 'UPS']","[Unionized UPS workers have voted to authorize a strike if the Teamsters and the company don't agree to a new contract before the existing pact expires July 31. (Nam Y. Huh / Associated Press)Over the last year, unionization drives by Starbucks baristas and Amazon warehouse workers have all but monopolized the attention of the labor organizing world.That may be why the most important development in the field has operated under the radar until very recently. We're talking about the contract talks between United Parcel Service and about 340,000 members of the Teamsters union.The negotiations have already yielded an overwhelming vote by the members to strike if no deal is reached by July 31, when the current contract expires. Hand-wringing about the impact of a UPS strike has intensified lately, since the shutdown of a company that handles an estimated 6% of the nation's gross domestic product (according to UPS) could have dire economic consequences.Sean O'Brien has made it clear that we are not going to take any concessions.Viviana Gonzalez, Teamster stewardWhat's more important, however, is the impact that a successful negotiation or a strike could have on the health of American organized labor.It would demonstrate that workers have truly gained leverage over employers after three pandemic years and a year of inflation fueled by corporate profiteering. It could also demonstrate the value of union solidarity in the face of determined resistance by employers.As I've reported before, the notion that American workers have gained an edge over employers in the pandemic's wake has been wildly overstated.Labor expert Theresa Ghilarducci of the New School points us to a recent survey by Oxfam showing that among the 38 developed nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the U.S. ranked at or near the bottom on measures of wage policies including minimum wages (36 out of 38), rights to organize (32nd) and worker protections (dead last at 38).Employers have fared much better, thank you. That includes UPS, where the pandemic burnished the financial picture. UPS revenue grew to $100.3 billion last year from $74.1 billion in 2019, and profit grew to $11.6 billion from $4.5 billion in 2019.Story continuesIn other words, the company's profit margin nearly doubled, to 11.6% last year from 6% in the year before COVID. If there's an argument against distributing more of that largesse to the workforce that made that growth possible, let's hear it.Given U.S. law and past practice, piecemeal organizing drives in discrete workplaces such as Starbucks stores always face an uphill battle.Read more: Column: Wage growth doesn't drive inflation. So why is the Fed out to crush workers? Starbucks has managed to fight many of its barista unionization efforts to a draw by exploiting the indifferent and time-consuming system of labor law enforcement in the U.S. The coffeehouse company has engaged in what a National Labor Relations Board judge found in March to be ""hundreds of unfair labor practices,"" but his ruling came more than a year and a half after the offenses were committed; the enforcement process still hasn't concluded.The Teamsters can't be manipulated as easily, since the union is bargaining for its entire UPS membership, companywide. That said, previous Teamster leaders have been overly indulgent toward the company; some of their historical concessions are on the negotiation table right now. Today's Teamster leadership, moreover, won their seats by promising specifically to take a hard line with UPS.That stance has already yielded accords on numerous noneconomic issues. The most important may be the company's agreement to install heat shields and air conditioning in its delivery vehicles, in which summertime temperatures can soar higher than 100 degrees; scores of UPS drivers have reportedly succumbed to heat-related injuries.Last summer, driver Esteban Chavez Jr. died from what his family maintains was heat stroke suffered while delivering packages in Pasadena. (The question, of course, is why it took union negotiations for UPS to address this issue.)""We have a new person in charge,"" says Viviana Gonzalez, a UPS driver for nine years and a steward for Covina-based Teamsters Local 396. She's referring to General President Sean O'Brien, a former UPS employee who won his Teamsters post in 2021 by defeating a candidate handpicked by former President James P. Hoffa.""Sean O'Brien has made it clear that we are not going to take any concessions,"" Gonzalez told me. She says the workforce takes pride in having kept UPS operating through the pandemic — ""without us, you didn't get food, medicine, essential stuff"" — but sentiment is widespread that the company hasn't sufficiently acknowledged the workers' role during that difficult period.The most interesting aspect of the current contract negotiations may be the union's demand to eliminate a lower, second tier of drivers who do the same work as other drivers but for lower pay. The main difference in their duties is that they work Tuesday through Saturday, rather than weekdays.Read more: Column: America vanquished the 'ancient atrocity' of child labor. Republicans are bringing it backCreating the so-called 22.4 drivers (named for the contract section that covers them) allowed the company to extend delivery services into the weekend without paying the full-time workforce extra for weekend duty or overtime.Full-time drivers earn an average of about $95,000. The 22.4 drivers earn less per hour while receiving comparable health and pension benefits.Earlier contracts gave the company more flexibility to hire part-time workers, to the point where about half of all the Teamster members at UPS are part-timers. The company says a part-time workforce is ""essential to our success,"" because the average workday encompasses ""alternating bursts of activity and slack time.""UPS also portrays part-time opportunities as ""ideal for many people"" who want time to ""advance their education and pursue their passions.""That sounds a lot like the argument by gig firms such as Uber and Lyft, which assert that classifying their drivers as independent contractors affords them the ""flexibility"" they value in their lives, even if it means giving up the job protections and benefits that come from classification as ""employees."" For the companies, it means lower costs, so you be the judge.At UPS, the part-timers earn less than half the average hourly wage that full-timers receive.Serious labor leaders know that two-tier and part-time employment is poison for workers' interests. Managements have long ""assumed that full-timers wouldn't fight for more full-time opportunities and better pay for part-time workers, while the younger part-time work force wouldn't fight for better pensions or reduced subcontracting of full-time jobs,"" Teamster officials Matt Witt and Rand Wilson observed in a 1999 retrospective about the last UPS strike, in 1997.That two-week strike ended with one of the best contracts the Teamsters ever achieved with UPS. After a string of mediocre contracts signed by union leaderships racked with internal dissension, the union in 1997 took a more militant stance toward UPS and, perhaps more important, leadership made a concerted effort to engage members in the contract negotiating campaign.The issues then, as now, included the company's reliance on part-timers — who often worked as many hours as full-timers, but were paid less. During the four years preceding the 1997 contract talks, more than 80% of new hires were classified as part-time. The striking workers benefited from their positive public image, which immunized them from a company advertising campaign aimed at portraying them as greedy.Read more: Column: Julie Su would be a perfect Labor secretary. That's why Big Business hates herThe strike's success bore lessons for organized labor generally, chiefly that successful bargaining was the best advertisement for union membership. ""You could make a million house calls, run a thousand television commercials, stage a hundred strawberry rallies, and still not come close to doing what the UPS strike did for organizing,"" AFL-CIO President John Sweeney told the umbrella union's national convention a month later.As it happens, however, the glow faded. Organized labor continued its steady decline in membership and influence. At UPS, the Teamsters allowed the company to implement the 22.4 classification in 2018, even though 54% of the voting membership rejected the contract.Then-President Hoffa ruled the contract to have been ratified, citing a union rule that permitted him to do so if voting turnout had dipped below 50% or the ""no"" votes didn't exceed two-thirds. Turnout had been only 44%.The strike vote doesn't mean that a walkout is inevitable, obviously. But the vote is a signal that UPS management ignores at its peril. The most important question may be on which side of the scale the Biden administration places its thumb.In November, when railroad managements balked at union contract proposals calling for more sick days — proposals the financially flush railroads were well able to afford, thanks to record profits — Biden sided with the railroads. Then, as now, the rhetoric was all about the ""crippling"" effects of a strike.Biden has been portraying himself as a pro-labor president. The truth is that he has been a better friend to labor than any of his predecessors since Franklin D. Roosevelt. That makes the UPS situation a test he can't afford to lose. He should celebrate the Teamsters' solidarity in demanding a fair share of UPS profits. Make no mistake: If there's a strike, it will be because UPS management wanted it to happen.Get the latest from Michael HiltzikCommentary on economics and more from a Pulitzer Prize winner.Sign me up.This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

ROCK is riding high on strong performance of the Infrastructure segment and value creation strategies.Gibraltar’s first-quarter 2023 earnings and sales surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 12.9% and 1.4%, respectively. Also, the bottom line grew 16.7% year over year. The uptrend was backed by strong contributions from the Renewables, Agtech and Infrastructure segments.Shares of ROCK have rallied 44.9% in the past year, outperforming the Zacks Building Products - Miscellaneous industry’s growth of 37%. Earnings estimates for 2023 have moved north to $3.56 per share from $3.55 per share over the past 60 days. This depicts analysts' optimism over the company’s growth prospects. Solidifying this prospect, the company has a strong VGM Score of A, backed by a Value Score of B and a Growth Score of A.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, this manufacturer and distributor of building products has been facing headwinds in the form of supply chain risks, project delays as well as inflation and seasonal fluctuations.Let us delve deeper into the factors.Factors Favoring ROCKGibraltar is strongly focused on its Three-Pillar Strategy — Business Systems, Portfolio Management and Organizational Development. The company continues to accelerate the implementation of three pillars through portfolio management initiatives, improvement of the business system and strengthening the organization. In first-quarter 2023, the company’s overall growth was attributed to material cost alignment, field operations efficiency, price management, business mix, 80/20 initiatives and the share repurchase program.Gibraltar’s Infrastructure segment is gaining traction on impressive growth trends. In first-quarter 2023, the segment’s net sales grew 8.7% to $18.7 million and backlog increased 38% year over year. The result was backed by increased infrastructure spending and continuous market participation efforts. The adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 800 basis points (bps) and 760 bps, year over year, respectively.Also, the solid potential of Renewables and Agtech segments is encouraging for ROCK’s top-line growth. In the first quarter of 2023, the backlog of the Residential segment increased 34% sequentially. The company expects the year-over-year backlog to be positive through 2023. Also, a strong project pipeline driven by produce and cannabis projects is expected to increase the backlog of the Agtech segment in the upcoming quarters.Story continuesFactors Impeding GrowthGibraltar has been facing supply chain issues over the last few quarters. It continues to witness material and labor supply-related challenges. In the first quarter of 2023, the company continued to witness project delays and disrupted solar project schedules. The company is still dealing with panel supply issues in the U.S. solar industry, as 80% of the key materials and components for panels are produced in China. The trend is likely to be the same for 2023.Also, an increase in raw material costs is a growing concern for Gibraltar. During 2022, the company witnessed higher costs related to labor and material and the same continues in 2023. In the first quarter of 2023, the Residential segment’s adjusted operating margin and EBITDA margin declined 230 basis points (bps) and 190 bps, respectively due to increased prices and material costs, persisting alignment of price and material cost and resumption of normal seasonal demand pattern.Seasonal influences affect the company’s demand patterns, with lower sales typically in the first and fourth quarters due to reduced activity in the building industry owing to inclement weather.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksGibraltar currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some top-ranked stocks that investors may consider from the Construction sector are Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. MLM, Vulcan Materials Company VMC and Watsco, Inc. WSO.Martin Marietta currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). MLM delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 31%, on average.

In the first quarter of 2023, the community count increased to a company record of 234 communities, reflecting an increase of 19% from the prior-year quarter’s level of 197.

WBA is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, backed by the strength of new partnerships. Progress made in the company’s all four strategic priorities sounds promising. The addition of Summit Health accelerates the build-out of Walgreens’ healthcare growth engine. The company’s long-term growth model buoys optimism. However, escalating costs and a highly leveraged balance sheet are worrisome.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 14.2% compared with the 22.3% fall of the industry and the 19% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned pharmacy-led health and beauty retail company has a market capitalization of $28.19 billion. WBA surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an average earnings surprise of 2.48%.Let’s delve deeper.Factors at PlayNew Alliances Seem Strategic: In April 2023, Walgreens entered into a partnership with the Dublin-based biotech company, Prothena Corporation. The collaboration aims to accelerate patient identification and recruitment for Prothena’s ongoing ASCENT-2 multiple ascending dose clinical trial.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the same month, the U.S. Healthcare segment of Walgreens and VillageMD announced the expansion of Village Medical at Walgreens into Colorado, with three new primary care practices, two in Fort Collins and a third in Longmont. In March 2023, Walgreens, in partnership with DoorDash and Uber, announced free, Same Day Rx Delivery of medications for the prevention and treatment of HIV. The latest offering is available to eligible patients within 15 miles of thousands of participating Walgreens retail pharmacies nationwide.Progressing Well With Strategic Priorities: In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, Walgreens continued to transform the method of delivering healthcare through physical stores and digital channels. The company has opened its ninth automated micro fulfillment center, now supporting about 3,000 total stores.Story continuesFurther, the addition of Summit Health is likely to be transformational for the company as it creates one of the largest integrated provider platforms in the United States, delivering quality affordable care for all patient populations, regardless of insurance or payer type. Summit will accelerate the U.S. Healthcare segment to scale and profit.Long-Term Growth Model Looks Encouraging: Following the announcement to acquire Summit Health-CityMD, the company raised its U.S. Healthcare fiscal year 2025 sales goal to $14.5-$16.0 billion, from $11.0-$12.0 billion expected previously. The segment is also expected to achieve positive adjusted EBITDA by the end of fiscal year 2023.Looking beyond 2023, the company increased clarity into its long-term growth algorithm, building to low-teens adjusted EPS growth in the fiscal year 2025 and beyond.DownsidesQ2 Negatives: During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, Pharmacy sales were affected by a 3.5% headwind from AllianceRx Walgreens. The International segment was also impacted by an adverse currency impact of 7.5% in the fiscal second quarter. Moreover, escalating costs and contraction of gross margin remain a concern.Leveraged Balance Sheet with Heavy Payout Load: Total debt at the end of second-quarter fiscal 2023 was $13.04 billion, much higher than the corresponding cash and cash equivalents of $1.09 billion. With a short-term payable of $4.2 billion, the company displays weak solvency.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Walgreens’ 2023 earnings per share has moved from $4.50 to $4.45 in the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $136.1 billion.

In April 2023, the company signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Navajo Tribal Utility Authority. The agreement aims at exploring opportunities to develop up to 1 Gigawatt (GW) of green energy projects within the Navajo Nation in the states of New Mexico and Arizona.AGR plans to spend capital to maintain and upgrade its infrastructure and facilities.

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.47%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.72%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 5.08%.Heading into today, shares of the oil and gas exploration and production company had lost 1.51% over the past month, lagging the Oils-Energy sector's gain of 2.68% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 5.36% in that time.Occidental Petroleum will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Occidental Petroleum to post earnings of $1.07 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 66.14%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $7.28 billion, down 32.19% from the prior-year quarter.OXY's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $4.84 per share and revenue of $29.84 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -48.24% and -19.57%, respectively.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Occidental Petroleum. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 6.47% lower within the past month. Occidental Petroleum is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Investors should also note Occidental Petroleum's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 12.01. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 13.64, so we one might conclude that Occidental Petroleum is trading at a discount comparatively.Story continuesInvestors should also note that OXY has a PEG ratio of 0.55 right now.

323,10ceec45-0b52-3740-bd29-7ffbb965d26f,OXY,2023-06-21,3 Oil Stocks Still on Sale as the Sector Rebounds,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-oil-stocks-still-sale-131155890.html,1686748315,STORY,"['CL=F', 'OXY', '^GSPC', 'DVN']","[Global volatility didn’t spare oil stocks in 2023. Indeed, the sector grappled with unique systemic risks, even as interest rate hikes and economic contraction beat down most stock sectors.With flat growth and declining trends in critical countries, OPEC member states responded to plummeting commodity pricing by introducing unexpected production cuts. However, despite OPEC+ announcing a substantial cut of more than one million daily barrels in May, crude oil ETFs like the United States Brent Oil Fund LP (NYSEARCA:BNO) showed no improvement. Most of these funds have lost around 5% since the cuts, at the time of writing.The industry’s woes have compounded further. Generally, ongoing geopolitical concerns and supply constraints remain the key focus for investors. Thus, as the market grapples with the implications of Russian sanctions and reduced exports, OPEC’s political clashes could escalate this situation.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDespite Russia’s claim that its production-cutting measures are aimed at boosting prices to support military efforts, doubts persist over whether their actions match their words. Industry insiders believe Russia is focusing on the short-term, aiming to maximize production and sell at the highest price possible given sanctions.This scenario casts the entire industry in a game of chicken as each player tries to anticipate the others’ moves to optimize their options and pump revenue higher.Accordingly, many oil stocks have moved lower in recent weeks. Here are three that are still on sale, amid what appears to be a rebound brewing in this space.XLEEnergy Select Sector SPDR Fund$80.93OXYOccidental Petroleum$58.77DVNDevon Energy$50.39Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE)Three wood blocks spelling out ""ETF"". representing best etfsSource: ShutterstockAn effective exchange traded fund (ETF) is tough to top for investors bullish on an entire sector. Notably, ETFs open an avenue for investors to tap into the entire sector’s potential, while mitigating individual company hazards that come with creating a single-stock portfolio.Story continuesThus, if the broad oil sector is on your radar, Energy Selector Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLE) should be at the top of your investing shortlist. Replicating the Energy Select Sector Index, it holds all industry-wide stocks in the S&amp;P 500. Since most of those entries are oil and gas stocks, XLE is an ideal vehicle for industry-wide bets since it closely tracks benchmarks like the Brent crude index.One deterrent to investing directly into benchmarks by choosing funds is the exorbitant fee structure associated with commodity ETFs built on a foundation of complex derivatives. For example, BNO’s fund expense ratio is a staggering 1%, dwarfing XLE’s 0.10%. Accordingly, the XLE ETF is a great way for investors to gain low-cost diversification within this sector.Moreover, XLE’s portfolio of oil and gas stocks offers a unique upside. With a 4.3% trailing-twelve-month dividend yield, XLE’s holdings are a “who’s who” of industry stalwarts that reduces the risk of catastrophic capital loss by casting a wide net in the energy sector and offering exposure to all aspects of the oil and gas industry. Ultimately, this provides portfolio diversification and broader long-term upside potential for investors.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comOccidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is a perennial trader favorite, but is increasingly catching institutional investors’ eye. Heavy-hitter Warren Buffett has been steadily buying into the company throughout the year, now sitting on more than 200 million shares worth $13 billion as of May 31.Occidental embodies Buffett’s value investing ethos and a proactive approach to climate concerns as it offers future-forward sustainable innovations alongside robust operations that remain resilient. A major player in America’s principal oil production regions, the company enjoys a significant and sticky market share due to its presence in these flowing fields.Last quarter, Occidental surpassed production expectations by 2%, maintained spending levels under $6 billion, and hit an impressive 24.58% TTM profit margin. The company’s return on invested capital is 22.34%, blowing the 17.63% industry average away. As always, Warren Buffett stocks are solid picks, and OXY stock isn’t an exception.Devon Energy (DVN)The logo for Devon Energy (DVN) is displayed on a sign outside an office.Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comDividend investors may find Devon Energy Corp’s (NYSE:DVN) hefty 10.8% yield irresistible, and oil enthusiasts can likewise leverage sizable kickbacks to generate a regular cash flow or reinvest into a larger position.Indeed, despite being a prevalent player in less productive fields, Devon has a firm foothold in these regions and anticipates its stellar operational performance will continue.Devon’s downside is its limited growth prospects recently referenced by management. But the company’s consistent cash flow and enduring commitment to shareholder value (as evidenced by a $3 billion buyback program) position it as a solid opportunity for those seeking consistent income while awaiting a potential industry rebound.Even though the company’s growth potential might seem capped due to limited expansion opportunities, Devon’s stable yield offers a solid option for a well-blended growth and income portfolio.On the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held a long position in OXY.

On the flip side, we remain concerned about the current economic uncertainty, which continues to cast a negative impact on Align Technology’s dental procedures. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past year, Align Technology has outperformed its industry. The stock has gained 40.9% compared with the industry’s 24.2% rise.Align Technology’s first-quarter 2023 earnings and revenues exceeded the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. The sequential increase in first-quarter revenues reflects stability across all regions for the Clear Aligner business and a favorable average selling price (ASP) for the Clear Aligner and Systems and Services segments.Non-case revenues increased year over year, driven by continued growth from the Invisalign Doctor subscription program and the Vivera Retainers. During the quarter, the EMEA region witnessed an increase in Clear Aligner cases for teenagers compared to the prior-year quarter. This reflects the increased utilization and recent introduction of Invisalign moderates across the region, which outpaced the year-over-year growth rate of Invisalign First.Align Technology, Inc. PriceAlign Technology, Inc. PriceAlign Technology, Inc. price | Align Technology, Inc. QuoteThe teen segment, which represents the largest portion of the 21 million annual orthodontic case starts, registered 182,000 teens and kids starting treatment with Invisalign Clear Aligners during the first quarter. The numbers increased both year over year and sequentially.The initial adoption of Invisalign Comprehensive was well-received in the market. The company is confident about a largely untapped market opportunity for digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry. The company expects 2023 to be a crucial year for innovation.On the flip side, during first-quarter 2023, across the Clear Aligner operating segment, revenues were down year over year, primarily due to lower volumes and lower ASPs, including unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by higher non-case revenues. Invisalign ASPs for comprehensive treatment were almost flat on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to a product mix shift, unfavorable foreign exchange and higher discounts.Story continuesSystems and services revenues decreased 9.7% sequentially, primarily due to seasonally lower scanner volume. On a year-over-year basis, System and Services revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $5.8 million.The contraction of both margins is worrisome. Align Technology’s operating expenses reported during the quarter increased due to higher incentive compensation and continued investments in sales and R&amp;D activities.The volatility surrounding inflationary pressure and other macroeconomic headwinds continue to pose challenges for the company.Meanwhile, Align Technology faces significant competition from traditional orthodontic appliance (or wires and brackets) players such as 3M’s Unitek, Danaher Corporation’s Sybron Dental Specialties and Dentsply International. The company also competes with products similar to Invisalign Technology, such as products from Ormco Orthodontics, a division of Sybron Dental Specialties.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are CONMED CNMD, Merit Medical Systems, Inc. MMSI and Boston Scientific Corporation BSX.CONMED, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), has an estimated long-term growth rate of 19.4%.

HQY has been gaining from its unique investment platform. The optimism led by a solid first-quarter fiscal 2024 performance and strength in Health Savings Accounts (HSA) are expected to contribute further. However, data security issues and a tough competitive landscape are major downsides.Over the past year, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has lost 9.5% compared with the 18.3% decline of the industry and against 17.1% growth of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned provider of technology-enabled services platforms for healthcare savings and spending decisions has a market capitalization of $5.34 billion. The company projects 22% growth for the next five years and expects to witness continued improvements in its business. HealthEquity’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average earnings surprise being 9.1%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Let’s delve deeper.Unique Investment Platform: We are optimistic about HealthEquity’s multiple cloud-based platforms, accessed by its members online via a desktop or mobile device. Individuals can make health-saving and spending decisions and pay healthcare bills, among other activities, via these platforms. These platforms provide users access to services HealthEquity provides as well as services provided by third parties selected by HealthEquity or its Network Partners. Among other features, HealthEquity’s HSA platform has the capability to provide users with medical bills upon adjudication by a health plan, including details such as the amount paid by insurance.Strength in HSA: HealthEquity’s total number of HSAs, as of Apr 30, 2023, rose 9.3% year over year. HealthEquity reported 556,000 HSAs with investments as of Apr 30, 2023, up 9.9% year over year. Total Accounts, as of Apr 30, 2023, were up 3.8% year over year. This uptick included total HSAs and 6.9 million other consumer-directed benefits (CDBs). Total HSA assets were up 10.1% year over year at the end of Apr 30, 2023.Story continuesStrong Q1 Results: HealthEquity saw solid top-line and bottom-line performances in first-quarter fiscal 2024. The top line benefited from robust contributions from all its revenue sources. The expansion of both margins was also seen.DownsidesStiff Competition: HealthEquity faces stiff competition in the Medical Services market, which is rapidly evolving and fragmented. The company’s success depends to a substantial extent on the willingness of consumers to increase their use of HSAs and other CDBs, and its ability to increase engagement and demonstrate the value of its services to existing and potential clients, Network Partners and members.Data Security Issues: HealthEquity deals with a high level of sensitive personal data and information. Any security breaches might result in the loss of sensitive information, theft or loss of actual funds, litigation or indemnity obligations to the customers. The company’s ability to ensure the security of its technology platforms and, thus, sensitive customer and partner information is critical to its operations.Estimate TrendHealthEquity has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for fiscal 2024. Over the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings per share has moved 3.4% north to $1.80.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues is pegged at $237.8 million, suggesting a 15.4% rise from the year-ago reported number.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

PACB, popularly known as PacBio, announced a clinical research study with Radboud University Medical Center (Radboudumc) to explore genetic causes of rare and genetic diseases. The study is also expected to explore the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of using PacBio’s HiFi sequencing technology for routine clinical use.PacBio and Radboudumc aim to discover the genetic origins of rare and genetic diseases via collaboration.The latest research collaboration is expected to significantly strengthen PacBio’s global sequencing business.Rationale Behind the CollaborationPer PacBio’s estimates, presently, the genetic basis of 50% of rare diseases remains unsolved due to the lack of accuracy and depth of current testing workflows. PacBio’s management believes that the study, designed to make significant discoveries in medical genetics, will likely enable it to better understand the critical gap by using its Revio sequencing systems to identify key variants at scale with higher accuracy.Management also feels that the research, which has the potential to help revolutionize patient care each year, will also deepen PacBio’s understanding of the practical application of long-read sequencing technology in routine clinical use.Radboudumc’s management feels that by studying the potential consolidation of standard molecular tests into a clinical workflow with PacBio HiFi whole genome sequencing (WGS), the project would be able to explore PacBio’s technology as a potential first-line assay. This is likely to pave the way for a more efficient and effective diagnostic process in the future.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Grand View Research, the global WGS market was valued at $1,645.2 million in 2022 and is anticipated to expand at a CAGR of approximately 20.1% between 2023 and 2030. Factors like the growing prevalence of genetic disorders and mutations that lead to cancer progression and the possibility of identification and diagnosis of targeted diseases are expected to drive the market.Story continuesGiven the market potential, the latest tie-up is expected to significantly strengthen PacBio’s global business.Notable DevelopmentsLast month, PacBio announced its first-quarter 2023 results, wherein it saw a robust increase in its overall top line, including strong revenues from Instrument and Consumables. Solid performances in the Asia-Pacific and Europe, the Middle East and Africa regions were also witnessed.In April, PacBio announced the availability of its new high-throughput (HT) Nanobind DNA Extraction kits.

OFIX, a prominent spine and orthopedics company, recently made the full commercial launch of its WaveForm A interbody implant for Anterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion (ALIF) procedures. The WaveForm A interbody implant claims to seamlessly integrate with the company's Meridian ALIF system to treat patients with degenerative disc disease.This latest development is part of the company’s product innovation initiative.More on Meridian With WaveForm AThe WaveForm A interbody features a proprietary wave-like design, providing a balance of strength, porosity and stability, along with a large implant graft aperture for bone graft material. This unique balance enables improved bone packing, reduced stiffness and enhanced imaging properties.Per Dr. Tayyab of Girard Orthopaedic Surgeons, advanced implants like WaveForm A interbody can help stimulate a better bone growth response, thereby giving greater confidence to the surgeon about a successful fusion.On the other hand, the Meridian ALIF system is designed to be a modular instrument and implant system to streamline the ALIF procedure and provide diverse fixation options for single to multilevel ALIFs in a fewer number of sets.

The growth is expected to be primarily driven by the increasing prevalence of ALIF procedures, advancements in MedTech research and development, adoption of advanced healthcare technologies and the growing demand for minimally invasive surgeries.Story continuesAccordingly, we believe the latest commercial launch of WaveForm A to be well-timed and strategic.Recent Developments by OFIXRecently, Orthofix invested in the realignment of the Bone Growth Therapies division sales and sales management teams to expand the organization and to bring more dedicated focus to each of the spine and fracture management channels. This positioned the company well to take advantage of the anticipated cross-selling opportunities in spine following the merger and to expand market share in fracture management following the launch of AccelStim. Within the spine channel, the company generated growth from SpineStim and CervicalStim, the only PMA-approved cervical Bone Growth Stimulator device in the U.S. market.In the last-reported first quarter, Orthofix announced the full commercial launch of the Mariner Deformity Pedicle Screw System, an extension of the company’s foundational Mariner technology platform, which will address the unique clinical requirements of complex adult deformity in spine cases.In addition, the company expanded access solutions for the $1.8 billion minimally invasive spine procedures market with the full launch of the Lattus Lateral Retractor System (which optimizes the lateral procedure to provide access to challenging anatomy during surgery) and the Fathom Pedicle-Based Retractor System (which allows the surgeon to control the precise length of each blade and dial in a customized lateral medial tilt, providing a rigid construct to address each patient’s unique anatomy).Price PerformanceIn the past year, Orthofix has underperformed in its industry.

329,e7026e55-06e1-3a72-8c48-16b04231e460,BSX,2023-06-21,Here's Why You Should Buy Boston Scientific (BSX) Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-buy-boston-scientific-151900727.html,1687274340,STORY,['BSX'],"[Boston Scientific Corporation BSX is gaining from strong improvement in organic sales, indicating a solid rebound in the legacy business despite several macroeconomic issues. The raised 2023 guidance increases investors’ confidence, indicating that the company is well-poised to handle the industry-wise trend. However, unfavorable currency movements and stiff competition are a concern.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has gained 49.7% against a 19.1% plunge of the industry and a 19.1% rise of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned manufacturer of medical devices and products has a market capitalization of $78.09 billion. The company’s long-term projected growth of 11.5%.Let’s delve deeper.Factors At PlayMedSurg Market Share Gain Impressive: Following the pandemic-led mayhem, Boston Scientific registered faster recovery within the MedSurg segment than rest of its business arms.Within Urology, BSX continues to expand market share globally. In the first quarter, sales increased 16% year over year organically. All franchises grew double digits, fueled by strength in key products including LithoVue and Rezum.In Endoscopy, sales increased 11% organically with broad-based strength across all regions and franchises. The company’s single-use imaging franchise grew double digits. Within Nuromodulation, organic growth was 14% in the reported quarter. Boston Scientific’s pain business grew high single digits, with strong SCS performance driven by its innovative Alpha portfolio with fast therapy in cognitive suite of digital tools supporting patient activation.Impressive Value-Adding Acquisitions: We are impressed with Boston Scientific’s recent acquisitions that have added numerous products (though many are under development) with immense potential. This, in turn, will likely boost the top line in the long term.In April 2023, Boston Scientific closed the Apollo Endosurgery acquisition, which furthers the company’s category leadership strategy within the growing area of endoluminal surgery with differentiated technologies like OverStitch and xTAC along with an entry into the adjacent endobariatric market.In February 2023, the company closed its majority stake investment in Acotec (a local Chinese company and prominent name in the field of drug-coated balloons in the region and many other peripheral and potentially cardiology procedures). This helped BSX fortify its presence in the Chinese market. It continues to expect double digit growth in China for the full year.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRaised Guidance: Boston Scientific updated its full-year guidance and provided second-quarter 2023 projections. Full-year net sales growth is expected in the range of 8.5-10.5% on a reported basis (earlier estimate was 5-7% growth). Net sales growth is expected in the range of 8-10% on an organic basis. The full-year adjusted earnings per share is expected in the range of $1.90-$1.96. For the second quarter of 2023, revenue growth is projected in the range of 6.5-8.5% on a reported basis (suggesting an increase of 7-9% organically). Adjusted earnings are expected in the range of 48-50 cents per share.DownsidesExposure to Currency Movement: With Boston Scientific generating 47% of its sales from the international market, it continues to be highly exposed to currency fluctuations. Unfavorable currency movements have been a major dampener over the last few quarters, as in the case of other important MedTech players too.Competitive Landscape: The presence of a large number of players has made the medical devices market highly competitive. The company participates in several markets, including Cardiovascular, CRM, Endosurgery and Neuromodulation, where it faces competition from large, well-capitalized companies such as Johnson &amp; Johnson, Abbott, Medtronic, Stryker, Smith &amp; Nephew and Edwards Lifesciences, apart from several other smaller companies.Estimate TrendsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Boston Scientific’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $1.95 per share, indicating a 2.6% increase from the 2022 reported number.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues is pegged at $13.89 billion, suggesting a 9.5% rise from the 2022 figure.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are CONMED CNMD, Merit Medical Systems, Inc. MMSI and Dentsply Sirona XRAY.CONMED, carrying Zacks Rank #2, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 19.4%. The company’s earnings surpassed estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, missed once and met in another, recording a negative average surprise of 10.54%.CNMD’s shares have risen 52.9% in the past year compared with the industry’s 22.8% growth.

This reflects a solid 11.1% improvement from the prior long-term outlook made by America’s largest jet maker in 2021.Highlights of the OutlookBoeing projects global demand for new commercial planes to reach 42,595 by 2042, indicating an improvement of 3.9% from 2022’s figure. Overall, the global fleet is projected to double to more than 48,500 in the next 20 years. In particular, new single-aisle airplanes will account for more than 75% of all new deliveries, totaling more than 32,000 airplanes, reflecting an increase of 3.2% from the 2022 outlook.Market opportunities for commercial services are now projected to be worth $3.8 trillion over the next 20 years, which implies a solid 5.6% hike over the prior 20-year forecast.What Led to the Increased View?Overcoming the woes of pandemic, commercial air travel has been improving in the recent past, buoyed by increased economic activities. Moreover, the growth of low-cost carriers (LCC) has been driving down fares, thereby making travel more accessible.This in turn has been bolstering the commercial aerospace along with the aftermarket aviation services market, which played the role of the key growth catalyst, boosting Boeing’s jet market outlook.Notably, global air traffic in February 2023 (measured in revenue passenger kilometers or RPKs) rose 55.5% compared with February 2022. Globally, traffic is now at 84.9% of the February 2019 levels. Looking ahead, passenger traffic is projected to return to 2019 levels over the course of the next 12-18 months. Such favorable projections must have encouraged Boeing to upgrade its 20-year commercial market outlook.Stocks to GainConsidering the aforementioned discussion, we may safely conclude that with the release of Boeing’s latest outlook, the spotlight is primarily on major commercial jet maker stocks. These include Boeing and Airbus, which constitute more than 50% of the global commercial jet market, along with a few more, which hold solid growth prospects and hence should find a place on investors’ watchlist.Story continuesBoeing develops, produces, and markets commercial jets, along with providing related support services.

333,2e228f1f-711a-3c79-91af-737e311b1fd8,KO,2023-06-21,10 Best NFT Stocks to Buy Now,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-nft-stocks-buy-120943143.html,1687349383,STORY,"['DKNG', 'NET', 'MAT', 'COIN', 'FNKO', 'KO', 'MCD']","[In this article, we discuss 10 best NFT stocks to buy now. You can skip our detailed analysis of non-fungible tokens and the outlook of the industry, and go directly to read 5 Best NFT Stocks to Buy Now. NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are digital assets that represent ownership of a unique item or a piece of content. NFTs utilize blockchain technology, which ensures their authenticity and traceability. While this concept had been around for a few years prior, it was in 2017 that NFTs captured mainstream attention and generated widespread interest through the launch of Cryptokitties, a blockchain-based game. It allowed users to collect, breed, and trade virtual cats represented as NFTs.NFTs are primarily bought and sold through NFT marketplaces, which serve as platforms where creators can list their NFTs for sale, and buyers can browse and purchase those NFTs. Some well-known marketplaces include OpenSea, Rarible, Foundation, and Mintable. Investing in NFTs can be challenging for amateurs as it requires a combination of research, knowledge, and personal preferences. The best NFTs for beginners would be those that are unique, well-executed, and have the potential to grow because the market is highly volatile and subject to rapid changes.In 2021, a significant surge in interest, adoption, and activity surrounding NFTs was observed. Numerous high-profile NFT sales and collaborations with mainstream artists, musicians, athletes, and brands captured broad interest and media coverage. One notable example was the sale of Beeple's artwork, ""Everydays— The First 5000 Days,"" which fetched $69 million at auction in March 2021. This sale made headlines and solidified NFTs as a viable platform for digital art. However, high-interest rates and inflation last year brought the sustainability and long-term value of the NFT market into question. In December 2022, NFT sales dropped to their lowest level since July 2021, as reported by Bloomberg. Reuters also mentioned DappRadar data in its report, highlighting that NFT sales fell to $3.4 billion in the third quarter of 2022, from $8.4 billion in the prior-year quarter.Story continuesDespite such performance last year, the overall NFT market showed signs of recovery in 2023. According to DappRadar, a total of 19.4 million NFTs were sold during the first quarter of 2023, up 8.5% from the previous quarter. The report also mentioned that the trading volumes climbed $4.7 billion during the quarter, showing a 137% growth from the preceding quarter. In addition to this, the development of user-friendly marketplaces and improved infrastructure contributed to growing sales. For example, Blend, a new peer-to-peer perpetual lending platform, made over $442 million in sales in May. Launched on May 1, Blur now represents 65% of the overall NFT market share, as reported by Fortune.The gradual rise of digital art and collectibles has fueled the growth of the NFT market. According to Market Research’s report, the NFT market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 27.6% from 2022 to 2032, gaining a value of $342.5 billion. The report also highlighted that the market was valued at $38.2 billion in 2022.NFTs also grabbed the attention of some major companies and brands. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) auctioned its NFTs for over $575,000 in 2021. Similarly, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) launched a limited edition of McRib NFTs in 2021 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of its pork sandwich. NIKE, Inc.

(NASDAQ:MAT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Toy manufacturer, Mattel, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAT) also weighed on relative returns in the quarter. Although sales came in slightly lower than expectations, strong gross margins drove a solid earnings beat. MAT maintained its full-year revenue outlook but lowered its EPS guide to account for Fx headwinds and greater promotions and discounts on high price-point items. We remain encouraged by management’s execution on its strategy to grow market share, improve profitability and generate higher levels of cash flow. We continue to view MAT as an undervalued asset with attractive growth prospects, particularly with the reintroduction of the Disney Princess and Frozen toy lines, Trolls, the global launch of Monster High, and product support around the highly anticipated Barbie movie in 2023.”7. DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37A sports betting company, DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG) is next on our list of the best NFT stocks to buy now. The company's NFT market allows users to access, view, or sell their NFTs bought through the company. The marketplace is particularly popular among those looking to trade sports collectibles.In the first quarter of 2023, DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG) generated $770 million in revenues, which showed an 84.7% growth from the same period last year. The company also reported a 39% year-over-year growth in its Monthly Unique Payers (MUP) to 2.8 million on average.DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG) is gaining positive ratings from Wall Street analysts following its strong quarterly earnings. In June, both BTIG Research and Jefferies Financial Group raised their price targets on the stock to $31 and $35, respectively.As of the close of Q1 2023, 37 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database owned stakes in DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG), up from 32 a quarter earlier. The total value of these stakes is over $1.1 billion.Baron Funds made the following comment about DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“We re-initiated a position in former Fund holding DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG), a leading online sportsbook, digital casino, and daily fantasy sports operator. DraftKings’ mobile applications offer consumers the ability to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and play hundreds of real-money casino games. The company has spent the past three years building a proprietary technology stack that improves the customer experience and delivers best-in-class breadth of bet types (such as parlays, same-game parlays, and player props). State-level online sports betting (OSB) and iCasino legalization, along with a multi-year consumer adoption timeline in active states, has supported a 90% revenue growth rate for DraftKings since 2020. The opportunity for OSB legalization remains significant, with under 50% of the U.S. population currently having legal mobile sports betting. We expect 65% to 80% of the population will eventually have access to OSB. ICasino is currently legal in just seven states representing roughly 13% of the population. ICasino product adoption in legalized states has been robust, with the average user spending twice as much as a sports bettor. While the pace of legalization for iCasino has been slower, we believe additional states will pass regulation in the coming years.As U.S. states began to legalize sports betting, the DraftKings management team moved quickly to build widespread brand awareness. DraftKings is the #2 operator in both OSB and iCasino by a wide margin, and has demonstrated improving market share trends across almost all states. When a new state legalizes sports betting, DraftKings has a first mover advantage as many of its customers are converted from the DraftKings daily fantasy sports offering. The quality of their sportsbook product along with increasingly targeted promotional spending results in strong customer retention and high lifetime values. In states where iCasino is legal, DraftKings can cross-sell OSB customers. DraftKings’ scale and product advantages are creating a flywheel that will enable the company to continue to out-invest the competition in acquisition marketing, retention, and research and development. The high barriers to entry are resulting in a consolidated industry that will eventually lead to a highly profitable business. This is evidenced by older-vintage state contribution margins that are already approaching 40%. Longer term, we believe DraftKings can generate EBITDA margins between 20% and 30% with strong free-cash-flow conversion.”6. Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) is a California-based IT service management company that provides a wide range of services, including cloud and cybersecurity. In the first quarter of 2023, the company reported revenue of $290.2 million, up 36.8% from the same period last year. Its operating cash flow for the quarter came in at $36.4 million, which represented 13% of its total revenue. The company also generated roughly $14 million in free cash flow.In 2021, Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) announced that its Cloudflare Stream platform supports NFTs. The platform allows users to host and deliver video content associated with NFTs. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) are some other major companies expanding their NFT exposure.At the end of March 2023, 41 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database reported having stakes in Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET), up from 40 in the preceding quarter. These stakes are collectively worth $774.7 million.Baron Funds mentioned Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We also added to Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) during the quarter, the leading cloud-based networking and software infrastructure provider. Despite facing a macro-driven elongation of deal cycles, the company reported solid quarterly results with 42% year-over-year revenue growth, while also guiding to 37% growth for 2023. The company’s speed of innovation enables it to continuously grow its opportunity set as it adds more products to its platform, solving additional problems for customers from network services to zero-trust. Its scale-based competitive advantages enable it to be the low-cost provider in the industry, while also having significant volumes of data to power its AI models and improve its product over time. Once it gets customers on board, Cloudflare is then able to cross-sell them additional networking and security solutions at high marginal profitability, as they are served on the same underlying infrastructure and thus the company doesn’t need to spend once more on customer acquisition. This creates a virtuous cycle that should enable Cloudflare to become an important part of the infrastructure layer of organizations over time, in our view.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best NFT Stocks to Buy Now. Suggested articles:12 Best Short Squeeze Stocks to Buy Now11 Best Health Insurance Stocks to Buy10 Reliable Dividend Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up OnDisclosure.

Brad Smith, Brian Sozzi, and now we're joined by the chief marketing officer of Coca-Cola, Manolo Arroyo. Great to have you here.MANOLO ARROYO: Thank you. Thanks for the invite.BRAD SMITH: Absolutely. All right. Well, first, you've got the Coca-Cola in your hand. I mean, you're too cool for school right now. You're staying ice cold out here as we're seeing this sun start to open up a little bit more. You talk about the reach of the consumer base and the number of people that play into that marketing function as influencers, too, whether direct or indirect.And one of those indirect ones has been Warren Buffett. You've also had indirect ones such as former presidents of the United States. So for better or worse, it's kind of going into a next or even amid a polarizing time right now, where one influencer can be looked at or perceived differently than another. How does Coca-Cola manage its own brand perception despite who's talking about it?MANOLO ARROYO: I think the critical component is to have clarity of what you stand for. And you always start by being extremely respectful to the heritage of what the brand has done in the past. This is one of the most, if not the most, inclusive brand in the planet. It stands for phenomenal human values such as optimism, happiness, freedom, peace, at the time in which we-- the world needed peace. We claim peace being peace. And-- and that got us to where we are.Now, if you sticking to just the old territory, you won't be expanding the meaning that would make the relevance require, so to trigger transition or conversion from non-consumers into consumers. And that's where you need to craft very carefully how you're going to go about it. We have identified a series of potential triggers of that conversion.Story continuesFor some humans are about consumption occasions. Why is that the case? While everyone understands that maybe why you should drink a Coke and what are the benefits as a product, a lot of times you don't understand where and when it's appropriate. You're missing the context. And that works for quite some people. An example of that is connecting Coca-Cola to meals, you know, meals occasions. We're getting significant new incidents of new consumers coming into the franchise through association with meals.The second bucket is around passion points. We all have different passion points. And that's where topics like music, gaming, traveling, sports play a significant role in driving some of that conversion. For a portion of population today, particularly Gen Z, in some markets, ESG, your level of commitment on ESG, it matters and for others it's innovation. So we're playing with all of those different conversion drivers or factors that will ultimately allow us to accelerate what we're trying-- going after, which is basically growth. The name of the game for us is growth.BRIAN SOZZI: This year, how much will you spend on marketing? How does it and how does that compare to next year? And then if this brand is in fact about optimism and peace, how are you thinking about your budget next year for election season when we might see an election that is anything but peaceful and optimistic?MANOLO ARROYO: Well, we don't disclose specifically our marketing budget. But as you can imagine, there's official sources out there. And you could think it's in the multibillion-dollar magnitude. Now, bear in mind that one piece is what we invest in marketing. And then there's the other piece that is equally important, which is what our bottlers invest in marketing, which is a similar, roughly the same amount. So that gives you a tremendous marketing muscle.Factor in that not only the paid media but what we define as owned media or earned media. And part of that is 30 million outlets, which we serve and we touch every single week of the year in every one of the countries that exist out there except three. More than 10 million callers in those 30 million outlets, thousands and thousands of trucks that are moving there-- they're moving outdoor connection points that we're leveraging in our marketing. So the ecosystem of engagement points that allow us to reach millions and millions of consumers is just-- it's just phenomenal.Now, your question on the US. US represents, roughly speaking, I'm going to just around the number, around 15% of our business. And it's obviously, from a marketing perspective, important and very critical, because it's extremely visible. And it's a market that we see tremendous growth potential, tremendous growth potential. We're seeing in the last couple of years very interesting dynamics, not only in Coca-Cola trademark, but across the whole portfolio. We're seeing explosive growth in Fairlife, in Sprite, in hydration, so really off to a great start in the US.Now, next year, it'll be a very important year. As it relates to public or political potential controversy and how we play there is very simple answer. We don't play in that.BRIAN SOZZI: But do you want to see an ad for Coke products next to stories, for example, on a digital property regarding the election? And how do you handle that?MANOLO ARROYO: Obviously, we-- from a brand safety standpoint, we have very, very clear guidelines, very clear guidelines. We're going to stay away from any major controversy, because there's a principle here, as I mentioned before. We are the most inclusive brand. This brand is for everyone. In our employees, we have not only-- our company employees are, with our bottling employees, we reach close to a million employees around the world.So our diversity of opinions from a political, sexual preference, ideology, you name it, it's-- it's as wide and as big as the population in any given country, including the US. And we work on everyone. We've always welcome everyone.Now, we can't avoid the people have their own opinion. And that's got to be respectful. Our employees do as well. But when it comes to our marketing communications, we are taking a position of inclusion. That's where we stand for. It's a value that transcends in our view what's out there. And it's more important, because, ultimately, we're saying is we're a simple beverage, which is a brand we're just a soft drink. And don't expect too much of a soft drink. Just, I mean, who are we, right? So just enjoy it. Have fun. Have fun. And enjoy the pleasure of it.BRAD SMITH: Well, one thing that people are having increasingly more fun with is some of your canned cocktails right now. We've seen a couple of those being passed around here, especially as people are getting saucy at Cannes this year. When you think about how much you would like to allocate towards that part of your growing business in either marketing spend or just consumption as a metric that you're tracking, what does success look like?MANOLO ARROYO: You mean in our latest experiments in the portfolio?BRAD SMITH: Yes.MANOLO ARROYO: We've been experimenting over the last-- we started three years ago, actually-- September or September 2020 actually. And we're very, very happy with the results of those experiments. We're still in the learning of-- in the process of learning how the category plays. We see our clear potential. We still are shaping the line of sight of how that could become potentially and how big it could become for us in our portfolio. We still are in the process of having those discussions internally and basically firming up our investment and our plans for the future.But we see it as a promising category, because that's where the consumer is going. And whether you like it or not-- and this is maybe unknown-- if you go to the archives of our archives, in Coca-Cola, the materials that associate, not only Coca-Cola, but some of the-- other brands, Sprite for example, to different beverage options in those consumption occasions.So it's not something new. We've been doing some of that since--BRIAN SOZZI: Did Sprite had alcohol at one point?MANOLO ARROYO: Not in the product itself, but communicating, for example, you know, we got 1960s communication materials of Sprite with vodka. And obviously, you know, Cuba libre, rum and Coke, it's been part, as you may have heard, of our legacy for decades. At different points of time, the levels of activation only in the outlets and only in the trade where it sells and is authorized to sell that have been having different degrees of execution depending on the country as well.But moving forward, we see particularly not in-- maybe not in the whole world, but in certain markets, we see that the consumer is going there. The credentials and the credibility of our brands to play a role there or rights to win, we define, are very clear.BRAD SMITH: Well, you'll be pleased to know that rum and Coke is one of my go-to cocktails that is out there.MANOLO ARROYO: Why do you like it?BRAD SMITH: Why do I like it? Because it's the Coke. It's the Coke. It sets off the drink.MANOLO ARROYO: It's great not because of the rum, It's because of the Coke.BRAD SMITH: It's because of the Coke.MANOLO ARROYO: It's the right answer.BRIAN SOZZI: I'll just say no comment. It's because the Coke.MANOLO ARROYO: I love it.BRAD SMITH: Manolo Arroyo, chief marketing officer of Coca-Cola joining us here at Cannes. We'll send it back to you.SEANA SMITH: All right. Our thanks to Brad and Brian over at the Cannes Lions Festival in the south of France.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 5 Stocks That Pay Dividends Monthly. The popularity of dividends experienced fluctuations over the years due to economic conditions, market trends, and investor preferences. However, paying dividends has been a long-standing practice in the financial world as they remained a fundamental component of investment returns. Dividend income represented nearly 41% of the S&amp;P 500’s total returns from 1930 to 2022, as we reported in our article, 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know. This shows that dividend income, in addition to capital appreciation, has played a significant role in the market’s overall returns.Last year was a challenging period for the market as it was hit by tightening monetary policies and growing inflation. Resultantly investors flocked toward dividend-paying stocks to meet their financial needs and obligations. They mainly focused on companies with strong dividend growth histories because of income reliability and a sense of stability. This proved to be the right decision as the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by a wide margin last year. The S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Index, which tracks the performance of high-yield stocks, lost about 1% in 2022, compared with an 18% decline in the broader market.Also read: 25 highest-paying monthly dividend stocksRegardless of their strong performance last year, dividends experienced an uncertain market sentiment in 2023. The advancements and expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) have brought growth tech stocks into the limelight all over again. As of June 19, the tech-heavy NASDAQ gained about 31.8%, outshining the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index, which is up 3.71% this year so far. However, this does not suggest that the dividend era is over. Global dividend payments grew by 12% in the first quarter of 2023 to a record of $326.7 billion, as reported by Janus Henderson. The report further mentioned that this dividend growth was mainly driven by the largest contribution from special dividends in nine years.Story continuesAnalysts are also giving a strong outlook for dividend stocks this year especially companies with long dividend growth streaks. Chris Senyek, a chief investment strategist at Wolfe Research, spoke with Barron’s about the significance of dividend stocks in the current environment. Here are some comments from the analyst:“During economic slowdowns or recessionary environments, our favorite yield-focused strategy is buying companies with a long track record of consistently increasing dividends. This cohort of stocks has generally outperformed heading into and out of recessions.”The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) are some popular companies with decades-long dividend growth track records.

(Nasdaq: NUWE), a medical technology company focused on transforming the lives of people with fluid overload, today announced it has entered into a Supply and Collaboration Agreement with DaVita Inc. (NYSE: DVA) to pilot Aquadex ultrafiltration therapy to treat adult patients with congestive heart failure and related conditions within select U.S. markets. Today, DaVita provides extracorporeal therapies such as continuous renal replacement therapy and apheresis to patients across a network of hospitals and outpatient clinics.Pairing the Aquadex system with DaVita’s care team could expand access to ultrafiltration therapy to millions of heart failure patients in the U.S. suffering from fluid overload and reduce related healthcare costs for providers and payers.“We are honored that DaVita is collaborating with Nuwellis to pilot a services model alongside Aquadex,” said Nestor Jaramillo, Jr., President and CEO of Nuwellis. “We believe DaVita’s clinical infrastructure could potentially help accelerate the clinical adoption of ultrafiltration when first-line medical treatments are ineffective. Our clinical and commercial teams are excited and ready to begin working together on the pilot program to introduce ultrafiltration to a broader patient population.”“Ultrafiltration therapy using Aquadex is a novel solution for patients suffering from fluid overload – a key driver of negative outcomes in heart failure patients. It offers clinicians the opportunity to restore fluid balance and alleviate heart failure symptoms precisely and gently,” said John Jefferies, MD, Chief Medical Officer of Nuwellis. “We believe the pilot with DaVita can support the role ultrafiltration can play in heart failure patient management and could enable accelerated commercial expansion of this therapy. Near-term, there’s value in providing these services in acute settings for hospital patients. Nuwellis also sees a future path to treating heart failure patients earlier, in outpatient settings.”Story continuesThe pilot program is expected to launch by the end of the third quarter 2023 and extend through May 31, 2024. Via the pilot, ultrafiltration therapy using Aquadex would be available at a combination of DaVita’s hospital customers and outpatient center locations, with both companies collaborating on the roll-out of the therapy, clinician training, and patient support. At the conclusion of the pilot, DaVita has the option to extend the supply agreement with Nuwellis for continued provision of both inpatient and outpatient ultrafiltration services for up to 10 years.In conjunction with the agreement, Nuwellis issued DaVita a warrant for approximately 1.3 million shares of Nuwellis Inc. common stock. The warrant is subject to certain vesting milestones and a blocker that prevents the warrant from being exercised for a number of shares that would represent greater than 19.9% ownership in Nuwellis. Nuwellis has also granted DaVita registration rights and rights to participate in future equity financings of Nuwellis, in each case conditioned on DaVita electing to extend the Supply and Collaboration Agreement after completion of the pilot. Details of the Supply and Collaboration Agreement may be found in Nuwellis’ Current Report on Form 8-K, to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission later today.About NuwellisNuwellis, Inc.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Graco Inc. GGG, Ingersoll Rand Inc. IR, Crane Company CR and Flowserve Corporation FLS.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Finding Opportunities in General Industrial ManufacturingGeneral Industrial Manufacturing is a pretty broad umbrella and it would be incorrect to say that the current environment is supportive of all the players.After all, despite the pause in rate hikes, we do have hawkish comments from the Fed that there may be another 50 bps of increase to digest. The Fed doesn’t want to stop until it has achieved the targeted 2% inflation rate, but its wait-and-see approach is positive for the economy because if all goes well, the pause may come to a halt. At least that’s the hope.From the data currently available, we know that manufacturing PMI in May remains below 50%, an indication of contraction in the manufacturing sector.However, new orders data from the Census Bureau shows an increase for manufactured goods, driven by orders for military aircraft. Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, considered a proxy for business spending plans, rose 1.4% in April (latest available data), up from a 0.6% decline in March. This number has fluctuated in a close range since August of 2022, reflecting the prevailing economic uncertainty.Capacity utilization was 0.1% below estimates (and the long-term average) in May, but still quite strong at 79.6%. Manufacturing capacity utilization was slightly lower at 78.4%. Production increased 0.2%. Inventories increased at manufacturers by 0.5%, wholesalers -0.1% and retailers 0.1%. The numbers indicate an element of caution at manufacturers and distributors.Story continuesUS GDP growth of 1.6% in the first quarter was also an improvement over the 0.9% managed in the December quarter, according to the BEA.Therefore, overall economic conditions, a big driver of industrial manufacturing appears neutral with significant uncertainty persisting.The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) see a challenge with respect to the workforce. Given the rapid adoption of technology in manufacturing, there is the need to recruit more skilled workers and reskill the existing workforce. The skills gap can affect production efficiency despite available technology. However, adopting the latest technology holds the promise of improved productivity, efficiency, and quality, thereby leading to cost savings. Therefore, technology adoption should be considered a positive and will be an important factor deciding competitiveness going forward.Infrastructure development, whether public or private, increases demand for industrial goods. Therefore, the government’s initiatives to boost road and rail, energy systems, telecom infrastructure are positive for the industry. As regards private/commercial construction activity, there is an ongoing drive to complete projects, as unfinished inventory is still considerable. New starts are going slow in residential (for a number of reasons) and at a virtual halt in commercial because of plummeting demand.Overall, the manufacturing sector is undergoing many changes because of the renewed focus on reshoring, environmental factors, consumer preferences and government policy changes.Also, the supply chain issues that companies struggled with in the past year are moderating, with production becoming easier to that extent. Companies are also reconsidering the efficacy of a just-in-time model given these concerns.Here are four stocks from the industry that caught my attention:Graco Inc.Graco designs, manufactures and markets equipment and systems used to measure, move, control, spray and dispense fluid and powder materials. This Minneapolis, MN-based company with manufacturing operations across the U.S, Europe and China caters to end customers in the Asia Pacific, the Americas, and Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA).Graco has three operating segments. Industrial provides pre-engineered and equipment packages for paints, sealants, adhesives and other fluids to wood and metal products, automotive and vehicle assembly, components production, aerospace, construction, farm, rail, marine, recreational vehicles and other customers.

Contractor provides sprayers used to paint structures like walls and product models.In the last quarter, the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 21.3%.

At these levels, the estimates represent growth of 16.4% in 2023 followed by 4.5% in 2024.Ingersoll Rand Inc.Davidson, NC-based Ingersoll Rand provides mission-critical technologies in air, fluid, energy, specialty vehicle, and medical fields. It operates through two segments. The Industrial Technologies and Services segment offers air and gas compression, fluid transfer equipment and power tools. The Precision and Science Technologies segment specializes in pumps, gas boosters, automated liquid handling systems and other components.

ROCK is riding high on strong performance of the Infrastructure segment and value creation strategies.Gibraltar’s first-quarter 2023 earnings and sales surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 12.9% and 1.4%, respectively. Also, the bottom line grew 16.7% year over year. The uptrend was backed by strong contributions from the Renewables, Agtech and Infrastructure segments.Shares of ROCK have rallied 44.9% in the past year, outperforming the Zacks Building Products - Miscellaneous industry’s growth of 37%. Earnings estimates for 2023 have moved north to $3.56 per share from $3.55 per share over the past 60 days. This depicts analysts' optimism over the company’s growth prospects. Solidifying this prospect, the company has a strong VGM Score of A, backed by a Value Score of B and a Growth Score of A.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, this manufacturer and distributor of building products has been facing headwinds in the form of supply chain risks, project delays as well as inflation and seasonal fluctuations.Let us delve deeper into the factors.Factors Favoring ROCKGibraltar is strongly focused on its Three-Pillar Strategy — Business Systems, Portfolio Management and Organizational Development. The company continues to accelerate the implementation of three pillars through portfolio management initiatives, improvement of the business system and strengthening the organization. In first-quarter 2023, the company’s overall growth was attributed to material cost alignment, field operations efficiency, price management, business mix, 80/20 initiatives and the share repurchase program.Gibraltar’s Infrastructure segment is gaining traction on impressive growth trends. In first-quarter 2023, the segment’s net sales grew 8.7% to $18.7 million and backlog increased 38% year over year. The result was backed by increased infrastructure spending and continuous market participation efforts. The adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 800 basis points (bps) and 760 bps, year over year, respectively.Also, the solid potential of Renewables and Agtech segments is encouraging for ROCK’s top-line growth. In the first quarter of 2023, the backlog of the Residential segment increased 34% sequentially. The company expects the year-over-year backlog to be positive through 2023. Also, a strong project pipeline driven by produce and cannabis projects is expected to increase the backlog of the Agtech segment in the upcoming quarters.Story continuesFactors Impeding GrowthGibraltar has been facing supply chain issues over the last few quarters. It continues to witness material and labor supply-related challenges. In the first quarter of 2023, the company continued to witness project delays and disrupted solar project schedules. The company is still dealing with panel supply issues in the U.S. solar industry, as 80% of the key materials and components for panels are produced in China. The trend is likely to be the same for 2023.Also, an increase in raw material costs is a growing concern for Gibraltar. During 2022, the company witnessed higher costs related to labor and material and the same continues in 2023. In the first quarter of 2023, the Residential segment’s adjusted operating margin and EBITDA margin declined 230 basis points (bps) and 190 bps, respectively due to increased prices and material costs, persisting alignment of price and material cost and resumption of normal seasonal demand pattern.Seasonal influences affect the company’s demand patterns, with lower sales typically in the first and fourth quarters due to reduced activity in the building industry owing to inclement weather.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksGibraltar currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some top-ranked stocks that investors may consider from the Construction sector are Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. MLM, Vulcan Materials Company VMC and Watsco, Inc. WSO.Martin Marietta currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). MLM delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 31%, on average.

In the first quarter of 2023, the community count increased to a company record of 234 communities, reflecting an increase of 19% from the prior-year quarter’s level of 197. The upside can be attributed to a decline in direct cost, solid margins and returns from the new communities.The company witnessed solid growth in the Texas and Southeast markets, driven by the relative affordability, strong employment rates and continuous population expansion despite the recent economic slowdown. Given the extent of existing land pipeline, the company expects a 20-25% year-over-year growth in community count by the end of 2023, with a potential range of 250-260 communities.During the first quarter of 2023, the company reported 2,022 net new contract homes, up 61% compared with the previous quarter’s levels. The upside was backed by solid demand in both February and March. As of Mar 31, 2023, the company's backlog consists of 1,920 sold homes valued at $714 million.

344,c4674aa1-bee3-3f03-b637-a9269702dc7b,GE,2023-06-21,Modi Looks to Solidify India’s Tech Ambition With US Visit,Bloomberg,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/modi-looks-solidify-india-tech-130001316.html,1687332046,STORY,"['GOOGL', 'AAPL', 'GE']","[(Bloomberg) -- Narendra Modi arrives in the US on his first official state visit with India’s geopolitical clout higher than at any point since he took power in 2014. He’ll be looking to leverage that to become an indispensable partner for American tech ambitions.Most Read from BloombergRussia Latest: Zelenskiy Adviser Says Wagner Remains in UkraineSilence Cloaks Kremlin After Russian Mutiny Against PutinPrigozhin Turns Forces Back in Deal With Kremlin to Drop ChargesPutin Faces Historic Threat to Absolute Grip on Power in RussiaGoldman Sachs Is Cutting About 125 Managing Directors GloballyThe trip will be a high-profile affair, complete with a banquet at the White House and an address to the US Congress, making Modi the first Indian prime minister to speak in front of the legislature twice. Beside meeting US President Joe Biden, he is catching up with private-sector leaders including Tesla Inc.’s Elon Musk, who said he’s planning to visit India next year.“It was a fantastic meeting with the prime minister,” Musk said, according to video of his remarks published by ZeeNews India. “I’m actually incredibly excited about the future of India. I think India has more promise than any large country in the world.”For Biden, India offers a diplomatic and military counterbalance to China’s power in the region, at a time when the US is distancing itself from its biggest trade partner and the world’s manufacturing powerhouse. Both nations see Beijing as a threat, with Biden expanding Trump-era export curbs to China and Modi’s government banning hundreds of Chinese apps in the wake of a border clash that left 20 Indian soldiers dead in 2020.High on the agenda will be removing regulatory constraints to doing business, particularly in the tech space. As the Biden administration seeks to prevent China from obtaining advanced chips and other technology, the US and India are working on ways to promote semiconductor manufacturing in India, according to officials aware of details who asked not to be named since discussions were private.Story continuesOn Tuesday, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said there’s no “more consequential” partner than India when it comes to issues like artificial intelligence, quantum computing, resilient supply chains, clean energy, semiconductors and climate change.“We know that India’s going to be a strategic partner for decades to come,” he said at a news conference.Modi’s ambition for India to become a player in chip manufacturing looks far more credible today, after US imports of chips from the South Asian nation multiplied more than 38 times in the first quarter. Apple Inc. tripled iPhone production in India over the past fiscal year as it seeks to reduce its reliance on Beijing, while memory maker Micron Technology Inc., which is under investigation in China, is close to receiving government approval on a $1 billion semiconductor plant.Read more: Apple India iPhone Output Soars to $7 Billion in China ShiftMusk said after his meeting with Modi that Tesla is likely to make a significant investment in India “as soon as humanly possible.”“India as a consumer of technology is now being replaced by an India which is at the table, wanting to frame the standards along with like-minded nations for the future of technology,” Rajeev Chandrasekhar, a minister who often speaks on behalf of the government’s tech policy team, told Bloomberg News in a recent interview.India’s domestic markets, meanwhile, are thriving. Equity benchmarks are at all-time highs as global investors have piled $8.7 billion into local shares this quarter. Bonds too are set to see a third month of foreign inflows as the central bank is seen taking a long pause on interest rates. The gush of money coming into local assets has helped make the rupee Asia’s second-best performing currency this year.The technological cooperation with the US is also spilling over to defense. General Electric Co. and Hindustan Aeronautics are set to sign an agreement during Modi’s visit to produce engines for India’s fighter jets. The two sides will have a flexible licensing agreement allowing for the transfer of technology.“The US is quite choosy about whom it shares military technology with,” said Manjari Chatterjee Miller, a senior fellow at the US-based Council on Foreign Relations. “A deal allowing GE to produce jet engines in India — it will show how seriously the US is taking the partnership.”US national and business leaders have heaped praise on India even while the government keeps sky-high import tariffs on a range of sectors. To bring more advanced manufacturing within its borders, India has combined these import duties on smartphones with subsidies designed to get assemblers like Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. and Wistron Corp. to set up shop locally.It’s worked: Hon Hai plans a $700 million plant for iPhone parts and Samsung Electronics Co. is also looking to expand production.Read more: Foxconn Commits to New Electronics Manufacturing in India“India presents a unique crucible for technology — successes there are guaranteed to succeed anywhere else in the world,” Sanjay Gupta, the head of Alphabet Inc.’s Google in India, said at an industry event.Although India has had some early success with smartphone assembly, helping Apple export more than $7 billion of its devices from the South Asian nation in the last fiscal year, many components are still imported from China. While India’s $10 billion push to make chips is just beginning, questions remain about whether the nation can provide the uninterrupted power and water supply needed by companies that make the most-cutting edge chips, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.Modi’s trip comes at a pivotal time for India’s tech ecosystem, where a new digital law is being crafted in consultation — and sometimes in conflict — with big names like Google, Meta Platforms Inc. and Twitter. Draft legislation expected within weeks will help determine exactly how big an opportunity India presents to overseas players.Even as Internet firms pour billions of dollars into the nation on the prospect that it’s a China-sized opportunity without the censorship deployed by the Communist Party, India is also among the top nations requesting content removal.

348,7af62b8d-1c38-368f-90fc-e0e446f50c1b,UNH,2023-06-21,U.S. Health Insurers Are Tumbling: Should You be Worried?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-health-insurers-tumbling-worried-122500656.html,1687263900,STORY,"['UNH', 'HUM', 'MOH']","[The market hasn't been kind to the U.S. health insurance industry, commonly referred to as Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), over the past week. During this period, the HMO industry fell 7.2% against the 0.6% rise in the overall medical sector. The Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite has also jumped 0.9%. Investors are concerned about the rising costs being witnessed by the health insurers.Let’s delve deeper.Early last week, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated UNH leadership pointed out at the Goldman Sachs Global Healthcare Conference that seniors are now undergoing elective surgeries, which were delayed due to the pandemic. This will likely result in higher-than-expected medical costs. Although inpatient figures are somewhat balanced, outpatient levels are witnessing a spike due to pent-up demand. Companies providing surgery services and medical equipment are expected to gain from this.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAfter that, major industry players, including UnitedHealth, Humana Inc. HUM, Centene Corporation CNC and Molina Healthcare, Inc. MOH, witnessed a serious drop in share prices. Later that week, Humana signaled a higher-than-expected increase in non-inpatient utilization trends. HUM expects its benefit expense ratio for the year to drift toward the upper limit of the guidance range of 86.3-87.3%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDemand for procedures like hip and knee surgeries is rising, which will leave fewer premiums in hand after paying for the procedures for the health insurers. This will increase the medical loss ratio of the industry players, which concerns investors.Now the question follows: should we be worried about these rising medical costs?Increasing medical costs are nothing new for health insurers. These companies diversify their operations to reduce the risk associated with such events. For example, UnitedHealth’s Optum Health unit is likely to witness higher utilization, especially in ambulatory surgery operations from the resumption of the procedures.Story continuesAlthough the rising number of elective surgeries can have a short-term impact on health insurers’ earnings, the effect is bound to diminish in the long run. Also, the situation is expected to provide the industry players with a window to hike the insurance rates.Humana, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), reaffirmed its 2023 adjusted earnings guidance at $28.25 per share minimum, which indicates an 11.9% jump from the 2022 figure, despite expecting increased medical costs now. This signals growing strength in its operations, especially in its Medicaid business line. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The growing premium base stemming from membership growth will keep aiding the health insurers. Centene, based in Saint Louis, MO, can be one good example of this. Furthermore, numerous contract wins and its data analytics solutions operations are likely to boost its results.The HMO companies already have their respective cost-curbing measures in place to improve efficiency and margins. This will likely offset the impact of rising medical costs. A similar approach was adopted by Molina Healthcare, which included streamlining organizational structure and boosting the speed and quality of decision-making. This helps the company to improve its profitability.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 5 Stocks That Pay Dividends Monthly. The popularity of dividends experienced fluctuations over the years due to economic conditions, market trends, and investor preferences. However, paying dividends has been a long-standing practice in the financial world as they remained a fundamental component of investment returns. Dividend income represented nearly 41% of the S&amp;P 500’s total returns from 1930 to 2022, as we reported in our article, 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know. This shows that dividend income, in addition to capital appreciation, has played a significant role in the market’s overall returns.Last year was a challenging period for the market as it was hit by tightening monetary policies and growing inflation. Resultantly investors flocked toward dividend-paying stocks to meet their financial needs and obligations. They mainly focused on companies with strong dividend growth histories because of income reliability and a sense of stability. This proved to be the right decision as the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by a wide margin last year. The S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Index, which tracks the performance of high-yield stocks, lost about 1% in 2022, compared with an 18% decline in the broader market.Also read: 25 highest-paying monthly dividend stocksRegardless of their strong performance last year, dividends experienced an uncertain market sentiment in 2023. The advancements and expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) have brought growth tech stocks into the limelight all over again. As of June 19, the tech-heavy NASDAQ gained about 31.8%, outshining the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index, which is up 3.71% this year so far. However, this does not suggest that the dividend era is over. Global dividend payments grew by 12% in the first quarter of 2023 to a record of $326.7 billion, as reported by Janus Henderson. The report further mentioned that this dividend growth was mainly driven by the largest contribution from special dividends in nine years.Story continuesAnalysts are also giving a strong outlook for dividend stocks this year especially companies with long dividend growth streaks. Chris Senyek, a chief investment strategist at Wolfe Research, spoke with Barron’s about the significance of dividend stocks in the current environment. Here are some comments from the analyst:“During economic slowdowns or recessionary environments, our favorite yield-focused strategy is buying companies with a long track record of consistently increasing dividends. This cohort of stocks has generally outperformed heading into and out of recessions.”The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) are some popular companies with decades-long dividend growth track records.

352,635b2ba4-380d-330a-add8-253481f61fc3,PG,2023-06-21,Brown-Forman (BF.B) to Sell Finlandia Vodka to Coca-Cola HBC,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brown-forman-bf-b-sell-152200616.html,1687274520,STORY,"['BF-B', 'CCHGY', 'PG', 'CELH']","[Brown-Forman Corporation (BF.B) inked a deal to sell the Finlandia vodka brand to Coca-Cola HBC AG for $220 million, subject to customary closing conditions. The transaction is likely to close in the second half of this year.BF.B had acquired Finlandia from Altia Corp. in 2004. The divestiture comes after Brown-Forman’s dwindling prospects for Finlandia stemming from its suspension of operations in Russia, which was a key market for the vodka brand.Coca-Cola HBC has served as Finlandia’s distributor for 17 long years. This deal will help Coca-Cola HBC to focus on its core non-alcoholic ready-to-drink portfolio.What Else Should You Know?Brown-Forman has been gaining from the premiumization of its portfolio and aggressive brand investments. Continued strength in its brands, mainly Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey, bodes well.BF.B’s underlying sales for fiscal 2023 were aided by the company’s portfolio strength and growth across all geographic regions. The company’s overall sales in the United States advanced 3% on a reported and organic basis. The rise was driven by volume gains for Woodford Reserve, owing to the rise in distributor inventories, and higher pricing across Jack Daniel’s portfolio, as well as the launch of the Jack Daniel’s and Coca-Cola Ready-to-Drink (RTD).The developed international market reported sales growth of 4%, with organic sales rising 10%. The improvement can be attributed to volume gains for Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey and Jack Daniel’s RTDs. Additionally, higher pricing for Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey has aided the results.The emerging markets registered 18% net sales growth, whereas organic sales improved 24%, backed by the growth of Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey in the United Arab Emirates and Brazil, as well as the continued double-digit growth of New Mix in Mexico. Net sales in the Travel Retail channel advanced 41% on a reported basis and 43% on an organic basis due to higher volumes for the majority of the portfolio, as travel trends continued to rebound.In fiscal 2023, net sales for Jack Daniel’s family of brands were up 4% on a reported basis and 9% on an organic basis. The brand’s sales were driven by solid demand, higher pricing and the estimated increase in distributor inventories. Strength in Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey in the international markets and the Travel Retail channel were major growth drivers.Story continuesNotably, Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey reported sales growth of 3% and organic growth of 8%. Sales benefited from strong consumer demand and higher pricing. The continued consumer interest in flavor and convenience boosted the performance of Jack Daniel’s RTD, Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Honey and Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Fire.Premium bourbon brands reported sales growth of 23% and organic sales growth of 24% in fiscal 2023, driven by double-digit growth in Woodford Reserve and Old Forester. An estimated rise in distributor inventories, along with higher volumes and pricing, boosted sales for Woodford Reserve and Old Forester. Jack Daniel’s RTDs/Ready-to-Pours benefited from the introduction of the Jack Daniel’s and Coca-Cola RTD, as well as the launch of Jack Daniel’s Bonded Tennessee Whiskey, resulting in year-over-year sales growth of 11% and 16% on an organic basis. New Mix reported sales growth of 53% and organic sales growth of 45%, driven by market share gains in Mexico, as well as higher volumes and prices.Brown-Forman’s tequila portfolio witnessed year-over-year sales growth of 10% each on a reported basis and an organic basis. This was driven by double-digit sales growth for the el Jimador and Herradura brands. Sales increased 11% on a reported basis and 10% on an organic basis for the Herradura brand, driven by higher prices and volumes in Mexico, and volume growth in the United States partly due to an estimated increase in distributor inventories. el Jimador reported year-over-year sales growth of 13% on a reported basis and 14% on an organic basis, driven by growth across all geographic regions, particularly in emerging markets and the United States.The company has also been on track with its long-term pricing strategy, which aims to increase prices year over year to grow sales as part of its revenue growth management initiatives.Driven by these factors, the company delivered a solid year-over-year performance in fourth-quarter fiscal 2023. Earnings per share (EPS) of 43 cents advanced 36% year over year. Net sales of $1,046 million increased 5% year over year on a reported basis and 4% on an organic basis.Consequently, management issued an upbeat fiscal 2024 view. It anticipates organic sales growth of 5-7% for fiscal 2024. The company is optimistic about organic sales and organic operating income growth. BF.B anticipates trends to normalize after two consecutive years of double-digit organic sales growth. Based on the aforementioned assumptions, Brown-Forman expects the organic operating income to increase 6-8% year over year, driven by lower supply-chain disruption costs, partly offset by continued input cost pressures. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 4.8% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 3.2% growth.Stocks to ConsiderWe highlighted some better-ranked stocks from the broader Consumer Staples space, namely Conagra Brands CAG, Celsius Holdings CELH and Procter &amp; Gamble PG.Conagra Brands, operating as a consumer-packaged goods food company, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Huntington Bancshares (HBAN) earns a Zacks Rank #3 30 days from its next quarterly earnings release on July 20, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.37 a share.By taking the percentage difference between the $0.37 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.35 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Huntington Bancshares has an Earnings ESP of 5.38%.HBAN is one of just a large database of Finance stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is SL Green (SLG).SL Green, which is readying to report earnings on July 19, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $1.35 a share, and SLG is 29 days out from its next earnings report.SL Green's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 1.61% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.33.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, HBAN and SLG could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

355,d2cccf98-0d75-35c7-ac4b-d36c64e7f03a,MAC,2023-06-21,Macerich (MAC) Gains 16.3% in 3 Months: Will the Trend Continue?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/macerich-mac-gains-16-3-130700518.html,1687266420,STORY,['MAC'],"[In the wake of the pandemic, there is renewed enthusiasm among customers for in-person shopping experiences. As a result, The Macerich Company’s MAC portfolio of premium assets in the United States has been witnessing healthy leasing activity.Also, this retail real estate investment trust’s (REIT) focus on mixed-use developments, omni-channel retailing and capital-recycling moves have enabled it to ride the growth curve so far.Given this backdrop, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have soared 16.3% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 6.6%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWith a rebound in retail demand, retailers are continuing to rent out more physical store spaces, benefiting retail REITs like Macerich. This healthy retailer demand has aided leasing activity in recent quarters and helped the company backfill its spaces, which is encouraging.During the first quarter of 2023, Macerich signed 256 leases encompassing 949,000 square feet. On a comparable center basis, this reflected a 59% increase in the amount of square footage leased and a 20% rise in the number of deals signed year over year.Also, the portfolio tenant sales per square foot for spaces less than 10,000 square feet in the trailing 12 months ended Mar 31, 2023, came in at $866 compared with $843 a year ago.Amid this rebounding retail real estate market, we expect this leasing momentum to gather pace in the upcoming period, boding well for the company.In recent years, omni-channel retailing has gained popularity and has become the focal point for many retailers. In line with this, MAC’s efforts to enhance its asset quality and grow its successful tie-ups with premium retailers by increasing its adoption of the omni-channel model are likely to pay off well.Moreover, the company has been focusing on the re-use and mixed-use of its properties through the recapture and repositioning of anchor tenants. In May 2023, it acquired the remaining 50% interest in five former Sears boxes from its joint venture partner — Seritage Growth Properties — and took full ownership of these parcels.This move provides MAC the flexibility to undertake redevelopment opportunities at these properties and enrich them with premium in-demand retailers, driving sales and traffic.In the same month, Macerich and Wish You Were Here Group, a renowned, multi-concept hospitality company, announced that the south wing of Scottsdale Fashion Square will house the upscale, experiential restaurant concept — Élephante.The move will mark Élephante’s first location outside Los Angeles. It will encompass 12,000 square feet of Macerich’s top-performing shopping center, aiming to provide a multidimensional experience to the Scottsdale community.With mixed-used assets gaining traction in recent years, Macerich’s efforts to ring in premium brands at its properties to drive more footfall and boost sales augur well. Per the first-quarter 2023 Investor Presentation, for 2023-2024, management expects to spend an average of $160 million per year on development and redevelopment projects.Further, Macerich’s aggressive capital-recycling program to enhance the overall quality of its portfolio highlights its prudent capital-management practices and releases the pressure off its balance sheet.As of May 4, 2023, MAC had around $645 million of liquidity. This included $475 million of available capacity on its $525 million revolving line of credit. Its well-laddered debt maturity profile and ample financial flexibility have positioned it well to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities and are expected to continue to do so in the future.Nonetheless, given the conveniences of online shopping, higher e-commerce adoption is still a concern for the company. Also, limited consumers’ willingness to spend amid macroeconomic uncertainty and a high interest rate environment add to its woes.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Kite Realty Group Trust KRG, Tanger Factory Outlet Centers SKT and Saul Centers BFS, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Kite Realty Group’s 2023 funds from operations (FFO) per share has moved marginally upward over the past month to $1.96.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Tanger Factory Outlet’s current-year FFO per share has been raised 1.6% over the past two months to $1.87.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Saul Centers ongoing-year FFO per share has moved 1.3% northward over the past month to $3.05.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents FFO — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

356,602519f8-538a-3183-ba71-b5fd9590194c,DHI,2023-06-21,Revival in Homebuilders' Market: A Boon for ETFs and Stocks?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/revival-homebuilders-market-boon-etfs-171600212.html,1687281360,STORY,['DHI'],"[A resurgence of optimism has been seen in the homebuilder's market, with builder confidence reaching positive territory for the first time in almost a year, as per the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo housing market index update.From 50 in May, the index rose to 55 in June, marking a continuous half-year increase in builder sentiment. Several factors contribute to this positive trend, including increased foot traffic from potential homebuyers, a less-hawkish Fed, minimal competition from the resale market, and an improved supply chain.Notably, most homebuilding stocks like PulteGroup PHM, Toll Brothers TOL, MI Homes MHO and Beazer Homes USA BZH have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while D.R. Horton Inc. DHI has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Return of Stable TrafficIn 2022, the Fed's aggressive measures against inflation led to a rapid rise in mortgage rates, causing a retreat of homebuyers. However, buyers seem to have accepted the increased borrowing costs this year and have returned to the market.The increased traffic of prospective buyers has been reflected in the NAHB gauge, which saw a four-point increase in June. The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage — the preferred home loan for purchases — was 6.69% last week, slightly up from the 52-week average of 6.26%, per Freddie Mac. However, to attract price-conscious buyers, many builders are offering rates much lower than that through their financing arms.Impact of Limited Resale InventoryThe increase in mortgage rates has an additional advantage for builders. Higher rates limit the number of homeowners willing to sell their property, which directly benefits new homebuilders by reducing competition from existing homes. This low interest rate lock-in effect is resulting in tight resale inventories and encouraging buyers to focus on new homes.Sales of new single-family houses in the United States unexpectedly jumped 4.1% sequentially to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 683,000 in April 2023, the highest level since March last year, and compared to forecasts of 665,000. No wonder, most renowned companies like D.R. Horton Inc. and KB Home KBH reported upbeat results in the just-concluded earnings season (read: Housing ETFs Up on D.R. Horton's Upbeat Earnings).Story continuesSales Forecasts and Homebuilders' OutlookGiven these positive conditions, most major builders have increased their sales forecasts for the remainder of the year. The NAHB measures for current sales conditions and sales expectations six months from now showed increases in June.Improving Supply ChainAnother positive aspect for builders is an improving supply chain. With the decreasing costs of lumber and more available hiring options, some companies, such as Lennar Corp. LEN, suggest that the issues regarding supply chain disruptions are largely behind them, per a Yahoo Finance article. However, tight lending standards amid bank failures are causes for concern.ETFs in FocusAgainst the above-mentioned backdrop, investors may tap housing ETFs like iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF ITB and SPDR S&amp;P Homebuilders ETF XHB. ITB and XHB have gained, respectively, 6.4% and 8.5% past month (as of Jun 19, 2023).Disclaimer: This article has been written with the assistance of Generative AI.

Coach Staley, Aflac U.S. President Virgil Miller and UVA women's basketball coach Amaka ""Coach Mox"" Agugua-Hamilton participated in a special event where 5 patients each received their own social robot as part of Aflac's 28-year, $168-plus million philanthropic commitment supporting children with cancer and blood disorders.""The past year working with Aflac confirmed for me that caring on purpose is in Aflac's DNA and I am honored to continue working with the organization to help close the gaps on and off the court,"" Coach Staley said. ""Aflac and I have a shared passion for giving back to our communities, particularly when it comes to cancer, sickle cell and children. It was great to be back in Charlottesville to deliver My Special Aflac Duck and bring joy to these patients.""In consultation with more than 100 children, families and medical professionals, Aflac teamed up with Empath Labs to create My Special Aflac Duck, a social robot that helps provide social-emotional support to pediatric cancer and sickle cell patients above the age of 3 through interactive technology.

Created by Aflac in collaboration with Coach Staley, the list aims to address some of the equity issues in women's college sports, including investment equity, fan experience and community engagement. Aflac committed to several actions to address these gaps for female athletes, their fans and their communities, including efforts to bring awareness to coach and player achievements, enhancements to the on-site experience and the creation of opportunities that help athletes and coaches further establish themselves as role models by helping communities. The My Special Aflac Duck event is one example of how Aflac and Coach Staley are giving back.Story continues""Aflac started the My Special Aflac Duck program five years ago to bring comfort and joy to young patients and their families when they need it the most,"" said Aflac U.S. President Virgil Miller.

Amid this, Federal Realty FRT is well-poised to benefit from its portfolio of premium assets in the United States.A diversified tenant base, a focus on essential retail and mixed-use assets, and the balance-sheet strength of the company augur well. However, high e-commerce adoption is likely to weigh on Federal Realty. Macroeconomic uncertainty and a high interest rate environment add to its woes.This retail real estate investment trust’s (REIT) properties are located in the first-ring suburbs of the nine major metropolitan markets of the United States, mainly in the key coastal markets from Washington DC to Boston, MA, San Francisco and Los Angeles.Due to the strong demographics and infill nature of its properties, Federal Realty has been able to maintain a high occupancy level over the years. Occupancy rates in the portfolio increased 140 basis points (bps) year over year to 92.6% as of Mar 31, 2023.With solid consumer spending and the rebound in the retail industry, the retail REIT is poised to benefit from its superior assets in premium locations and experience improving the leasing environment. We estimate the leased occupancy rate for 2023 to be 94.8%.The company has a well-diversified tenant base of retailers, including TJX Companies, Kroger and CVS Corporation. This minimizes risks related to any particular retail industry and assures a stable source of rental revenues. For 2023, we estimate the company’s rental income to grow 3.9% year over year.Federal Realty’s efforts to explore the mixed-use development option, which has gained immense popularity in recent years, will enable it to tap growth opportunities in areas where people prefer to live, work and play. Moreover, FRT’s expansion efforts into premium markets, and initiatives to redevelop and reposition its assets seem encouraging.On the balance sheet front, Federal Realty exited first-quarter 2023 with $1.3 billion of total liquidity. The annualized net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 6.0 and the fixed charge coverage ratio was 3.6 as of Mar 31, 2023. Its investment-grade credit ratings render the company favorable access to the debt market. With a strong balance sheet, FRT is well-positioned to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT shareholders and Federal Realty is committed to the same. Backed by healthy operating fundamentals, we expect funds from operations (FFO) to increase 4.7% in 2023. The company’s quarterly cash dividend of $1.08 per share is expected to be sustainable, given the company’s solid operating platform, FFO growth projections and balance sheet strength compared with industry counterparts.Analysts seem bullish about this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 FFO per share has moved upward over the past three months to $6.49, indicating a favorable outlook for FRT.Moreover, shares of Federal Realty have risen 6.4% over the past month, outperforming its industry's growth of 5.6%.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research However, given the conveniences of online shopping, high e-commerce adoption is concerning for Federal Realty. Online retailing will remain a popular choice among customers, adversely impacting the market share for brick-and-mortar stores.A slowdown in the economy and the depletion of savings can limit consumers’ willingness to spend to some extent in the coming quarters amid macroeconomic uncertainty and a high interest rate environment. The likelihood of tenant bankruptcies in the near term can affect the company’s profitability.A high interest rate environment is concerning for Federal Realty. Elevated rates imply high borrowing costs for the company, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate. Our estimate for 2023 interest expenses suggests a year-over-year increase of 17.2%. The dividend payout may become less attractive than the yields on fixed-income and money-market accounts amid high interest rates.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are Acadia Realty Trust AKR and Saul Centers BFS, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Acadia Realty Trust’s 2023 FFO per share has been revised marginally north over the past two months to $1.23.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Saul Centers’ 2023 FFO per share has been revised 1.3% north over the past month to $3.05.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents FFO — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This acquisition will add 1,295 new water and 1,254 wastewater customers to Illinois American Water’s customer base.Illinois American Water has been expanding its high-quality services in Illinois since 2020 and has been partnering with 12 communities across Illinois through acquisitions and making essential investments in upgrading aging infrastructure.The aging water and wastewater infrastructures of the Village of Tolono also need investments for upgrades and maintenance. Illinois American Water is planning to invest nearly $17 million in the first five years of ownership to upgrade the Village of Tolono’s water and wastewater systems.Consolidation – A Must for Widely Scattered IndustryOne of the primary headwinds in the water industry is that there are too many small operators with limited financial capabilities. Due to financial constraints, at times the essential upgrades are deferred, causing infrastructure failure.Per the American Society of Civil Engineers (""ASCE""), more than 50,000 community water systems and 16,000 community wastewater systems in the United States are currently providing water solutions to customers.Per the ASCE findings, due to the delay in essential pipeline repairs and maintenance, 6 billion gallons of treated water is lost every day in the United States. Owing to the many small operators in the industry and a lack of adequate funds, essential infrastructural upgrades and repairs get delayed at times.The acquisition of small units by larger utilities ensures necessary investments in infrastructure upgrades and the continuation of high-quality customer service. American Water Works is the largest, most geographically diverse and most publicly traded water and wastewater utility company that continues to widen its market footprint through strategic acquisitions.American Water Works is quite active in acquiring small units in its service territories as well as expanding operations. Till Mar 31, 2023, the company completed five acquisitions in two states, which added 1,400 new customers. The pending 27 acquisitions as of Mar 31, 2023, when completed, will add another 48,200 customers.Story continuesInvestments for Water SpacePer the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, an estimated $744 billion in investment is necessary to maintain and expand drinking water and wastewater services to meet demand over the next 20 years. Water utilities are gradually consolidating and investing in essential upgrades to their aging assets.American Water Works is making regular investments to maintain its infrastructure. It aims to invest in the range of $14-$15 billion in the 2023-2027 period and $30-$34 billion for the 10 years of 2023-2032.Other water utilities like Essential Utilities WTRG, California Water Service Group CWT and Middlesex Water MSEX have well-chalked-out capital investment plans to strengthen their infrastructure.Essential Utilities plans to invest $1.1 billion in 2023 and $3.3 billion through 2025 to improve water and natural gas systems and better serve customers using improved information technology.California Water Service plans to invest more than $725 million in capital expenditures through 2024.Middlesex Water plans to invest $266 million during 2023-2025 to strengthen its water and wastewater infrastructure and provide services to customers in a safe, reliable and efficient manner.Price PerformanceOver the last month, American Water Works’ stock gained 3.2% compared with the industry’s growth of 2.8%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankAmerican Water Works currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But generally speaking, it is expected that the market will grow at rates somewhere in the mid-to-high teens in annual percentage terms. That suggests that even the more conservative stocks in the EV battery sector should offer handsome rewards over time.The thought of reasonable growth with minimal downside appeals to the more conservative investor, who avoids risk in general. Indeed, there’s nothing wrong with that. In high-growth sectors, I’d have to agree that it’s better to conserve and protect capital, than to go all-out with outlandish bets that may turn disastrous.With that said, let’s take a look at three stock picks that offer substantial growth, but relatively limited downside. These are among the top EV battery stocks I think best fit the portfolios of most conservative investor types.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsALBAlbermarle$227.24FCXFreeport-McMoRan$40.08LACLithium Americas$20.99Albemarle (ALB)Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screenSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.comAlbemarle (NYSE:ALB) doesn’t manufacture batteries, but instead supplies the lithium required in the development of EV batteries. It’s also the largest lithium miner in the world. Thus, conservative investors will like the company’s scale and global footprint, as it provides greater geographic and product diversification. Currently, Albermarle has key operations in the U.S., Chile, and Australia.As a rule, a more diversified portfolio is a safer portfolio, and safety is attractive to conservative investors. Although Albemarle is large and relatively safe, it isn’t without issues. One of the key drawbacks some conservative investors may focus on, for example, is the company’s seemingly high beta of 1.54. The greater the beta of a company (with 1.0 being the baseline), the greater the stock’s expected volatility relative to the overall market.But volatility is a part of commodity investing. Lithium prices took off on a sky-high trajectory in 2022. That was a boon for Albemarle and other lithium companies. However, lithium prices then plunged from November to April. Since then, lithium prices have doubled. You see where I’m going with this.Story continuesThat said, over that period, Albemarle hasn’t lost much ground. This stock is one that’s shown the ability to preserve investor capital and grow considerably in good times. That’s the kind of risk/reward bet investors should want to take right now.Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)Freeport-McMoRan Stock's Long List of Catalysts Boosts Its Buy StatusSource: 360b / Shutterstock.comFreeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) is another commodity stock for investors to consider. However, the company doesn’t mine lithium at all. Instead, it mines gold, copper, and molybdenum, all of which are used in making EV batteries.Thus, FCX stock is arguably a more diversified investment than Albemarle. Gold, of course, moves in inverse relation to overall economic concerns in financial markets and dollar concerns. That can potentially buffer losses when EV applications are in lower demand and prices might otherwise fall. But at the same time, Freeport-McMoRan has a beta of 1.99, which means it is roughly twice as volatile as the average stock.Thus, FCX stock isn’t without risk. That said, the company’s share price has held quite steady over the past two-and-a-half years. Further, Freeport-McMoRan shares include a dividend that conservative investors will appreciate. While relatively small (yielding roughly 1.6%), it’s still a dividend, and provides relative stability and amplifies total returns in bull markets.Lithium Americas (LAC)a lithium mine, ATLX stockSource: ShutterstockConstruction recently began at Lithium Americas’ (NYSE:LAC) Thacker Pass lithium mine in March. Thacker Pass sits on the largest lithium deposit in the United States and the second largest in the world, based on proven reserves. Conservative investors who are also politically conservative will appreciate the national security aspect of Lithium Americas as an investment. The less the U.S. has to rely on foreign lithium, the better.Activities at the site are expected to begin in the second half of 2023. Lithium Americas also operates two sites in Argentina. The first, the Cauchari-Olaroz mine, is targeting initial lithium production this month. The other, in the Pastos Grandes Basin, is targeting a construction decision by Q4.LAC stock is volatile relative to general stocks with a beta of 1.58. However, this stock also has among the best risk/reward profiles of the three stocks on this list. Thus, as far as conservative EV battery stocks are concerned, Lithium Americas is one to buy right now.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Check out a video of the announcement here.The Gatorade Player of the Year award recognizes athletes not just for their excellence on the playing surface, but for their commitment in the classroom and impact in their community.

""Ava led her team to a second straight Class 5 championship, pitching a one-hitter in both title games, and punching out 15 batters in this year's state final. She averaged 1.7 strikeouts per inning as a senior and never lost a high school game against excellent competition in the Lone Star State. She's a hard-thrower who hits her spots and overpowers hitters while mixing speeds and displaying pin-point control. Also a dangerous hitter, she drove in 65 runs and slugged almost .900 this past season, and she elevates her game as the stakes get higher. She's one of the most productive high school players of the past two decades.""Story continuesThe state's returning Gatorade Player of the Year, the 5-foot-7 senior right-handed pitcher and first baseman led the Lions to a 44-1 record and a second straight Conference 5A state championship this past season.

She concluded her prep softball career with an 81-0 record and 830 strikeouts in the circle.Brown has volunteered with her local chapter of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and as a youth softball coach.Brown has maintained a 3.55 in the classroom. She has signed a national letter of intent to play softball on scholarship at the University of Florida this fall.In addition to excellence on and off the field of play, Gatorade Players of the Year also pay it forward for the next generation. As part of Gatorade's Play it Forward initiative, Brown will receive a grant to give to a 501c3 youth sports charity, which includes Gatorade's social impact partners – Athlete Ally, Laureus USA, Move United, Women's Sports Foundation and Up2Us Sports – supporting Gatorade's ambition to fuel the future of sport.  ""We are recognizing Ava as the top high school softball player in the nation because of her dedication to excel as an athlete, a student and a leader within her community,"" said Gatorade Portfolio president and general manager Michael Del Pozzo. ""This award is about more than just on the field play, and we look forward to seeing what Ava continues to achieve on and off the field.""Each year, a selection committee evaluates the nation's top talent to choose one state winner from each of the 50 states as well as Washington D.C., in 12 different sports: football, girls volleyball, boys and girls cross country, boys and girls basketball, baseball, softball, boys and girls soccer, and boys and girls track &amp; field.
