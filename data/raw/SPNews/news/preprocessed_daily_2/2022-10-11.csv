0,2563474a-62ee-315c-bad4-65554a5712d1,SCHW,2022-10-11,The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charles-schwab-corporation-schw-reports-140002726.html,1665410402,STORY,['SCHW'],"[The market expects The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 17, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.04 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +23.8%.Revenues are expected to be $5.39 billion, up 18% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.25% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for The Charles Schwab Corporation?For The Charles Schwab Corporation, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.08%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that The Charles Schwab Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that The Charles Schwab Corporation would post earnings of $0.91 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.97, delivering a surprise of +6.59%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.The Charles Schwab Corporation doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, Morgan Stanley (MS) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.50 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -26.5%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $13.2 billion, down 10.5% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Morgan Stanley has been revised 1.8% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.59%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Morgan Stanley will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We retain conviction. Despite turbulent markets, Schwab attracted over $120 billion of net new client assets in the recent quarter. Rising interest rates should lead to increased profits on the company’s nearly $600 billion of interest earning assets as well.”9. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)1623 Capital’s Stake Value: $7.18 millionPercentage of 1623 Capital’s 13F portfolio: 4.47%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99ServiceNow, Inc.

(NYSE:NOW) with combined stakes worth $5.2 billion, up from 90 funds in the prior quarter worth $7.5 billion.. Fisher Asset Management held shares worth $693.89 million in ServiceNow, Inc.

Their products are a key element of driving the digital transformation nearly every large company is undergoing. At the recent JP Morgan investor day, CEO Jamie Dimon explained that while the company could reduce expenses if needed should the economy slow, that their spending on digital transformation would continue as this spending was critical to the company managing costs and maximizing revenue over time. As an example of this type of spending, Dimon specifically pointed to ServiceNow, calling out that the company’s products now oversaw the single largest collection of JP Morgan data and highlighted that working with them had saved JP Morgan $50 million over the past few years.While we have high expectations for ServiceNow’s long-term growth rate, at the company’s investor day in late May they offered an increased growth outlook for the next five years as they target even higher levels of growth than we have been expecting.”8. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)1623 Capital’s Stake Value: $7.2 millionPercentage of 1623 Capital’s 13F portfolio: 4.5%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 252Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a leading online retailer and one of the highest-grossing e-commerce aggregators. During Q2 2022, The Motley Fool's 1623 Capital held a total stake value of $7.2 million in the retail giant, making up 4.5% of its portfolio value.Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Amazon Web Services and SK Telecom announced that the two companies will co-develop a new set of computer vision services at the Mobile World Congress held on September 29 in Las Vegas. The end-goal of this collaboration is to make it easier and more cost effective for customers to build, use, and scale computer vision applications, which enhance productivity.On September 29, Citi analyst Ronald Josey reiterated a Buy rating on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) with a $185 price target, stating that the company's refreshed device line-up furthers its connected home vision. According to the analyst, Amazon remained his top pick due to its Prime Early Access Sale ahead of the Holiday season, improved Prime member engagement, steady Web Services growth, and progress on cost efficiencies.At the end of Q2 2022, 252 hedge funds were eager on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and held stakes worth $30 billion in the company. As of June 30, Fisher Asset Management owns more than 46 million shares of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and is the most prominent investor in the company.Here is what Lakehouse Capital specifically said about Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its investor letter:“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) proved resilient in the face of ongoing macro pressures and delivered a strong quarterly result along with “better-than-feared” guidance for the third quarter. Net sales increased 7% year-on-year (10% constant currency) to $121.2 billion, while operating profit declined 57% to $3.3 billion. The drop in operating profit was attributable not only to external macro factors, such as elevated shipping and fuel costs, but also lower productivity and efficiency costs as a result of some overcapacity on the back of its recent investment cycle. It was pleasing to see that the company has begun to make progress on the more controllable costs, particularly productivity and staffing, with headcount, for example, down almost 100,000 over the quarter. We continue to believe Amazon is well positioned to manage these short-term issues and remains on track to deliver significant profit improvements over the next twelve months.Management also confirmed that they have not seen any deterioration in Prime membership growth or retention following the 17% increase in Prime fees put through earlier in the year. This is not surprising to us, as in our view, the price increase was more than justified given the tremendous amount of customer value that has been added since the last price increase was implemented back in 2018, which includes the doubling of its fulfilment network and workforce, significant expansion of free same-day delivery and considerable investments in video and music content. Ultimately, we remain positive about Amazon’s future and believe that the company’s scale and market leadership will continue to drive growth for many years to come.”7. Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX)1623 Capital’s Stake Value: $7.29 millionPercentage of 1623 Capital’s 13F portfolio: 4.54%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) is an American multinational company that specializes in Internet connection and data centers. The company’s data centers provide services to more than 260 of the world’s fortune 500 companies and has over 10,000 customers. Securities filings for Q2 2022 reveal that Motley Fool’s 1623 Capital held stakes worth $7.29 million in Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX), representing 4.54% of the total 13F portfolio.JPMorgan analyst Richard Choe maintained an Overweight rating on Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) with an $850 price target after hosting a meeting with management on August 28. Based on the analyst's remarks, Equinix has continued to see strong demand trends from both, enterprise and cloud service providers, and its pricing actions will add to its revenue growth. Although Choe believes that higher costs will offset some revenue gains, an improved efficiency and operating leverage may benefit funds due to operations growth.38 hedge funds that Insider Monkey tracks owned shares in Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) at the end of the second quarter of 2022 with AEW Capital Management owning 373,148 shares.Here is what Baron Real Estate Income Fund has to say about Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Equinix, Inc. is a network dense global data operator of over 240 data centers in 69 metros and 30 countries. Its customers place high value on the ecosystem of customers that Equinix has curated within its data centers over many years so that they are able to interconnect within the data center facility instead of having data travel through the public internet (latency sensitive applications as well as data security considerations). Customers value the global network with 90% of customers in multiple metropolitan areas and 75% in multiple geographic regions.Equinix has a diverse but valuable customer base with no single customer greater than 2.6% of recurring monthly revenues. COVID-19 has accelerated digital transformation priorities for many organizations, and we believe that Equinix will be poised to benefit from: i) organic growth through new bookings and pricing power (the majority of incremental bookings are from existing customers); ii) growth of high margin cross-connect revenue (approximately 20% of total); and iii) continued geographic expansion through development and select M&amp;A. We believe the combination of these factors will allow the company to grow annual cash flow in the high singledigit range.”6. Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (NYSE:BR)1623 Capital’s Stake Value: $8 millionPercentage of 1623 Capital’s 13F portfolio: 5%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 17Broadridge Financial Solutions is a public corporate services and financial technology company that offers proxy statements, annual reports, and other financial data to public companies. Motley Fool’s 1623 Capital owns 56,300 shares of Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (NYSE:BR) as of Q2 2022, worth approximately $8 million.Earlier this September, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (NYSE:BR) announced a partnership with Coinbase, offering interoperability between Coinbase Prime and Broadridge Trading and Connectivity Solutions' NYFIX order-routing network. This solution allows NYFIX clients to route order flow to Coinbase Prime via the FIX protocol, while simultaneously allowing buy-side traders to source crypto liquidity from Coinbase and trade right from their OMS.According to Insider Monkey’s database, 17 hedge funds were bullish on Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (NYSE:BR) at the end of Q2 2022, the same as the previous quarter. D. E. Shaw is the leading position holder in the company, with 206,587 shares worth $26.50 million.Much like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Visa, Inc. (NYSE:V), The Motley Fool's 1623 Capital holds significant investments in Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (NYSE:BR).Here is what Wedgewood Partners specifically said about Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (NYSE:BR) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (NYSE:BR) grew its core recurring revenue at a +6% organic rate driven by the increase in the number of open equity and ETF positions at its platform customers. We think this increase in position count was a pleasant surprise compared to the downturn in asset prices seen during most of the quarter. Broadridge customers include large online brokerage providers that have expanded into the mass market. As more investors carry more positions and instruments (regardless of size) Broadridge’s services are necessary to connect these investors with corporate governance communications from issuers and other service providers. All told, we think the expansion of capital markets is a healthy long-term trend that Broadridge should continue to benefit from.” Click to continue reading and see The Motley Fool's Latest Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks.  Suggested articles:10 Best Auto Stocks To Invest In13 Best Semiconductor Stocks To Buy10 Best Dividend Growth StocksDisclosure: None.

2,e570e1ce-2df8-3526-b0a4-731635466468,SCHW,2022-10-11,More money in the bank for insiders who divested US$175m worth of The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) shares last year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/more-money-bank-insiders-divested-130043974.html,1665406843,STORY,['SCHW'],"[Even though The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) stock gained 3.4% last week, insiders who sold US$175m worth of stock over the past year are probably better off. Selling at an average price of US$79.21, which is higher than the current price might have been the right call as holding on to stock would have meant their investment would be worth less now than it was at the time of sale.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Charles Schwab Charles Schwab Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Founder &amp; Co-Chairman, Charles Schwab, sold US$19m worth of shares at a price of US$69.43 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$74.31). We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 0.2% of Charles Schwab's holding.All up, insiders sold more shares in Charles Schwab than they bought, over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeI will like Charles Schwab better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Charles Schwab Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Charles Schwab shares. Specifically, Founder &amp; Co-Chairman Charles Schwab ditched US$34m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of Charles SchwabI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Charles Schwab insiders own about US$8.7b worth of shares (which is 6.2% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Do The Charles Schwab Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And our longer term analysis of insider transactions didn't bring confidence, either. On the plus side, Charles Schwab makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Charles Schwab.

The selloff spread to the foreign-exchange market as investors tallied up the damage from the sweeping curbs the US is imposing on companies that conduct technology business with China.The Biden administration measures erect barriers of entry to China’s market by limiting the ability of US firms to sell equipment and tech to their Chinese counterparts. There are concerns that the restrictions could spread if Washington widens the initiative to include other countries, while questions also remain over the scope and final impact of the moves.“It is difficult to call a bottom on the performance of the chip sector,” said Gary Dugan, chief executive officer of the Global CIO Office. “The big story is that the West is becoming profoundly more concerned about security around any form of technology. We see no reason to re-enter the sector for the moment despite the profound poor performance.”US chip stocks were on track to decline for a third day, with Nvidia Corp., Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Qualcomm Inc. and Texas Instruments Inc. all down more than 1% before the bell. Chip-tool maker ASML Holding NV traded down 2.3% in Amsterdam, bringing three-day losses to more than 11%.The US measures include restrictions on the export of some types of chips used in artificial intelligence and supercomputing, and also tighter rules on the sale of semiconductor equipment to any Chinese company. Washington also added more Chinese firms to a list of companies that it regards as “unverified,” which means US suppliers will face new hurdles in selling technologies to those entities.Story continuesThe US announced the export curbs Friday, and there have been suggestions that similar actions may be deployed in other countries to ensure international cooperation. The announcement spurred a two-day rout of over 9% in the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index that saw it close Monday at its lowest level since November 2020. Markets in Korea, Japan and Taiwan were shut that day for holidays.Samsung lost as much as 3.9%, the most in a year. South Korea’s SK Hynix Inc., one of the world’s largest makers of memory chips that has facilities in China -- is part of a supply network that sends components around the world. Its shares slid 3.5% before paring losses.The current rout has already wiped out more than $240 billion from chip stocks worldwide since Thursday’s close, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The selloff extended to currency markets, with the South Korean won sliding as much as 1.8% versus the greenback while the Taiwan dollar declined 0.7%.The curbs are a “big setback to China” and “bad news” for global semiconductors, Nomura Holdings Inc. analyst David Wong wrote in a note Monday. China’s localization efforts may also be “at risk as it may not be able to use advanced foundries in Taiwan and Korea,” he wrote.The US measures seek to stop China’s drive to develop its own chip industry and advance its military capabilities. The impact could extend well beyond semiconductors and into industries that rely on high-end computing, from electric vehicles and aerospace to gadgets like smartphones.The fallout is already being felt. KLA Corp. will stop offering some supplies and services from Wednesday to China-based customers including SK Hynix to comply with the recent US regulations, Reuters reported, citing a person familiar with the situation.Shares of Chinese chipmakers extended their recent losses on Tuesday, with Morgan Stanley saying that the broader restrictions around supercomputers and multinational capital investment in China could be “disruptive.”Chinese state media and officials have responded to Biden’s move in recent days, warning of economic consequences and stirring speculation about potential retaliation.“With the latest measure, it would become difficult for China to manufacture and develop semiconductors because most semiconductor equipment are dominated by US and its allies,” such as Japan and Netherlands, Chae Minsook, an analyst at Korea Investment &amp; Securities, wrote in a report. “It is impossible to maintain the chip industry without adopting advanced equipments.”(Updates throughout)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekA Digital Drive to Reform the $11 Trillion Global Gold MarketExxon’s Exodus: Employees Have Finally Had Enough of Its Toxic CultureThis Is What the Gas Station of the Future Will Look LikeHow Gamers Beat NFTsTaking ‘Abrasive’ and ‘Nice’ Out of Performance Reviews©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

To skip our detailed analysis of these stocks and Singer's investment insights, you can go directly to see Activist Investor Paul Singer's 5 Latest Stock Picks.Once dubbed 'the world's most feared investor', Paul Elliot Singer is the founder, president and co-CEO of Elliott Management. Known for his high-profile, and often combative, deal-making, his hedge fund has a reputation for seeking out and successfully exploiting market weakness. Having started Elliott Management in 1977, after a brief stint in corporate law, with $1.3 million in seed capital, Singer’s market ventures have been consistently successful, with average annual returns of almost 14%. Although the 78-year-old is not as flashy or public as activists such as Carl Icahn, his corporate ventures have spanned sectors from technology and telecommunications to entertainment, and energy, helping him amass a fortune worth roughly $4.3 billion, alongside a spot on the list of the richest people according to Forbes.Elliott Management, since the day it was founded, has been focused on distressed securities. While it started as a hedge fund focusing on convertible arbitrage, Paul Singer slowly steered the fund’s focus toward companies and later countries facing financial trouble. In the 1990s, Paul Singer’s firm bought up troubled sovereign debt from countries including Peru and Argentina that brought in multi-million-dollar repayments. These methods, which sometimes included corporate debt plays, earned him the title of “doomsday investor” in a 2018 article by The New Yorker magazine. A more recent excursion came March this year amidst the chaos on the nickel market on March 8, 11 days after the outbreak of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, where the activist fund founded by Paul Singer claimed more than $450 million in damages from the London Metal Exchange for having used an illegal method intended to interrupt trade.Story continuesSinger, who was born and raised in New Jersey, and studied psychology at the University of Rochester before getting a J.D. from the Harvard Law School in 1969, has been credited among those who accurately predicted the 2008 Financial Crisis — a period where he made significant profits from credit default swaps that bet leveraged companies would crash.At the end of June, Singer's Elliot Management reported managing $8.67 billion in its investment portfolio. The fund liquidated all of its holdings in 10 companies and reduced its stake in 4 companies. In contrast, the fund made 9 additions to its portfolio while increasing its stakes in 11 different names. Elliot Management's top 10 holdings at the end of the second quarter included names like Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC), Peabody Energy Corporation (NYSE:BTU) and Suncor Energy Inc. (NYSE:SU).Activist Investor Paul Singer's 8 Latest Stock PicksPaul Singer of Elliott ManagementOur MethodologyThe following data is gathered from Elliott Management’s latest 13F filing with the SEC. At Insider Monkey, we track the portfolios of about 895 hedge funds as of the close of the second quarter of 2022. For this article, we selected the 8 stocks that Paul Singer added to Elliott Management’s most recent 13F filing with the SEC for the quarter ending June 30.Activist Investor Paul Singer's 8 Latest Stock Picks8. Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC)Elliott Management’s Stake Value: $53.1 millionPercentage of Elliott Management’s 13F Portfolio: 0.61%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) is an American computer hard disk drive manufacturer and data storage company that designs, manufactures and sells data technology products, including storage devices, data center systems and cloud storage services. The company sells its products under the following brands: Western Digital, G-Technology, SanDisk and WD. According to Elliot Management’s 13F filings, the fund owned 1.18 million shares of Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) worth $53.1 million at the end of Q2 2022, representing 0.61% of the investment firm's portfolio.On September 19, Barclays analyst Tom O'Malley lowered the price target on Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) to $40 from $55 and kept an Equal Weight rating on the shares. The analyst lowered global hard disk drive unit forecasts for both this year and next to reflect continued consumer weakness. Despite the overall weakness, the analyst believes that pricing has held up, which is a reflection of mix shift to nearline. However, while this is a near-term positive, O'Malley thinks that this is unlikely to persist.According to the company’s Q4 earnings report released on August 5, Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) recorded earnings per share of $1.78, beating market estimates by $0.06. Additionally, the company’s revenue for the quarter came in at $4.53 billion.At the close of Q2 2022, 43 hedge funds were bullish on Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC). These funds held collective stakes worth $894.4 million in the company. This is compared to 45 positions in the previous quarter with stakes of $1.03 billion. Lyrical Asset Management was the most significant shareholder in Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) at the end of Q2, with a stake value of $177.15 million.Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC), Peabody Energy Corporation (NYSE:BTU) and Suncor Energy Inc. (NYSE:SU) are some of the significant names along with Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) that Paul Singer added to his portfolio.7. Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO)Elliott Management’s Stake Value: $33 millionPercentage of Elliott Management’s 13F Portfolio: 0.38%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO) is an American video game holding company that operates as a developer, publisher, and marketer of interactive entertainment for consumers around the globe. Based in New York City, it owns two major publishing labels, Rockstar Games and 2K, which operate internal game development studios. The stock was a new addition to Paul Singer's Q2 2022 portfolio. His hedge fund held a stake worth approximately $33 million by the close of the quarter.According to BofA analyst Omar Dessouky, the leaked footage of Grand Theft Auto 6 is ""slightly negative"" for shares of Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO) because it provides further proof that the game is still not ready for a 2023 release. Additionally, Dessouky suggests that valuable intellectual property from Rockstar may have been stolen in the leaks as well. He kept a Neutral rating on the shares of the company, alongside a $130 price target.As of Q2 2022, 66 of the 895 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were bullish on Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO), holding shares worth $2 billion. Simon Sadler’s Segantii Capital was the largest shareholder with ownership of 23,500 shares valued at $287.94 million.Here is what Madison Funds specifically said about Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO) is a leading publisher of video games. Take-Two has a reputation for the high quality of its games, having published industry favorites such as Grand Theft Auto and NBA2K.The video game industry itself has shed much of its boom-and-bust patterns to become a steadier, more predictable business with high barriers to entry, established title franchises, and high levels of recurring, in-game revenue streams. The company has been investing heavily to step up the number of new title launches over the next few years, a favorable set-up which we believe is not fully reflected in its stock price.”6.

The electric vehicle maker delivered 21,185 cars during the first six months of 2022 vs. 9,510 for the same period in 2021, while its gross profit increased 49% for the period as the result of higher sales of Polestar 2, partially offset by product and market mix.

The analyst believes Polestar's key strength lies in its ""intimate partnership"" with Geely and Volvo, which created an asset-light business model, thus reducing manufacturing and supply risk, and ultimately allowing the company to focus on design, expansion and brand building. The analyst adds that Polestar Automotive Holding UK PLC (NASDAQ:PSNY), unlike many other start-ups, has already delivered more than 50,000 vehicles worldwide since its start of production the previous year.On August 16, Polestar Automotive Holding UK PLC (NASDAQ:PSNY) confirmed plans to put the Polestar electric roadster concept into production.

(NYSE:AYI) By 49%?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-undervaluing-acuity-brands-inc-133510564.html,1665408910,STORY,['AYI'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE:AYI) as an investment opportunity by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Acuity Brands The ModelWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$484.2mUS$508.6mUS$517.7mUS$526.6mUS$536.0mUS$545.8mUS$556.0mUS$566.5mUS$577.3mUS$588.3mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x1Est @ 1.72%Est @ 1.79%Est @ 1.83%Est @ 1.86%Est @ 1.89%Est @ 1.9%Est @ 1.91% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$453US$445US$423US$403US$383US$365US$348US$331US$316US$301(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$3.8bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 1.9%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$588m× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (6.9%– 1.9%) = US$12bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$12b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$6.1bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$9.9b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$157, the company appears quite undervalued at a 49% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Acuity Brands as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.177. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

Market pundits fear that the Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance to tame inflation might push the economy into a recession.Also, the recent drop in the U.S. unemployment rate to 3.5% in September from 3.7% a month earlier has fueled concerns that the Fed will be aggressive in its approach to tighten monetary policy and cool the economy. Rising borrowing costs would definitely hit consumer spending activity.Well, the S&amp;P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the NASDAQ Composite indices have declined 23.6%, 19.4%, and 31.9%, respectively, year to date. So, as investors modify their portfolios to cope with the ongoing challenges and continued monetary policy tightening, market pundits are placing their bets on value stocks.Value style is considered one of the best practices when it comes to picking stocks. Value investing is essentially about selecting stocks that are fundamentally sound but have been beaten down by some external factors. Such stocks are poised to bounce back as and when investors recognize the inherent value of companies. Certainly, the value investment strategy best suits investors with a long-term horizon.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength. Still, a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, the Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) ratio is one of the key metrics. Greif, Inc. GEF, Unum Group UNM, Centene Corporation CNC and MaxLinear, Inc. MXL boast a low P/CF ratio.This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis – the lower the number, the better. One of the important factors that make P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company's financial health.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same.Positive cash flow indicates an increase in a company’s liquid assets. It gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.However, solely based on the P/CF metric, an investment decision may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and consider price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio, and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.Story continuesThe Bargain Hunting StrategyHere are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the nine stocks that qualified the screening:Greif, a global leader in industrial packaging products and services, sports a Zacks Rank #1. It has an expected EPS growth rate of 10% for three-five years. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 22.4%, on average. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.    The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Greif's current financial-year sales and EPS suggests growth of 15.9% and 43%, respectively, from the year-ago period.

13,43b6eef3-7c3f-3781-98f5-42b92a9d0e61,USB,2022-10-11,Analysts Estimate Bank of America (BAC) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-bank-america-bac-140002951.html,1665410402,STORY,"['BAC', 'USB-PQ']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Bank of America (BAC) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 17, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis nation's second-largest bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.80 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -5.9%.Revenues are expected to be $23.63 billion, up 3.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.23% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Bank of America?For Bank of America, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.75%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Bank of America will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Bank of America would post earnings of $0.77 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.73, delivering a surprise of -5.19%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Bank of America doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, U.S. Bancorp (USB) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.16 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -10.8%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $6.27 billion, up 6.9% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for U.S. Bancorp has been revised 1.5% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.84%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that U.S. Bancorp will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Studies can be delayed or terminated when organizations are not able to get enough people to participate or when patients drop out of the trial.Senior citizens, rural populations, women and people of color in the U.S. are often left out of clinical research because they lack awareness of trials and access to facilities.Walmart is currently working with Laina Enterprises, a virtual clinical trial management platform, the retailer said in a press release.Rival Walgreens said in June it had launched clinical trial services to increase diversity in test subjects. A company spokesperson said Walgreens is in talks with ""many leading pharmaceutical companies"" to help with patient recruitment, virtual or hybrid clinical trials and diversity initiatives.According to a database of U.S. clinical trials seen by Reuters, Walgreens worked with the University of North Texas Health Science Center starting in 2018 for a study on African American HIV patients.Walmart has previously said it wants to focus more on its high-margin businesses including healthcare, financial services and advertising.Story continues""Walgreens is making a push to utilize their stores to reach their more diverse population in their clinical trials, so it seems feasible that that's something that Walmart may eventually want to do as well,"" said Carri Chan, a professor at Columbia Business School.Walmart opened Walmart Health locations in Dallas, Georgia in 2019 and now has 24 locations including in Arkansas, Florida and Illinois. In September, Walmart said it would partner with UnitedHealth Group to provide preventative healthcare to elderly populations and telehealth services for all age groups.Meanwhile, CVS Health began offering clinical trials in 2021. CVS Health Clinical Trial Services General Manager Tony Clapsis told Reuters drug companies bear much of the costs, although some costs might get picked up by Medicare, Medicaid or a commercial health plan.CVS has since conducted studies to track the emergence of COVID-19 variants while under contract to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, according to its website.It also is working on a flu study and collaborating with Pfizer to recruit 600 participants for a study to determine the long-term effects of COVID-19, according to patient recruitment listing seen by Reuters.

WHRI initially is focused on inclusion in studies on treatments for chronic conditions and innovative treatments that should include members from these communities.""At Walmart, we want to help ensure all our customers have access to high quality, affordable, and convenient healthcare resources, including innovative research,"" said Dr. John Wigneswaran, Walmart’s Chief Medical Officer. ""We know our customers are interested in participating in healthcare research, but many have not had access until now. We are already making an impact for our customers and for medical research, by raising patient trust and engagement in their care.""For decades, clinical trials have not been representative of the population at large and often recruit participants who live near research centers, have the time, and have the financial ability to participate.1 According to Food and Drug Administration data, in 2020 75% of trial participants were white, 11% were Hispanic, 8% were Black, and 6% were Asian.2 Walmart is focused on studies that can have a health equity impact in the communities it serves and represent all populations. With 90% of Americans living within 10 miles of a Walmart, the retailer can offer solutions to care by meeting customers and patients where they live and work.Walmart is working with a wide range of study partners, including clinical research organizations, pharmaceutical companies and leading academic medical centers, including CTI Clinical Trial &amp; Consulting Services and Laina Enterprises. WHRI is already demonstrating strong results, with a referral rate 3x the industry benchmark.Story continues""The efforts by Walmart in research are innovative and impactful – it is clear that the intention behind their foray into this space is to genuinely make a difference for patients of all ages, race and gender in their ability to access research,"" said Bill Hawkins, Chairman of the Board, Duke University Health. ""This initiative will support individual patient health as well as the health of numerous communities home to Walmart stores.""To help make it easier for research patients to simplify their care, Walmart launched MyHealthJourneySM, a digital tool that lets patients take control of their own data through easy access to their eligible medical records and insurance information online in one place. With MyHealthJourneySM, patients receive reminders for care services and research opportunities to help them keep their health on track.""Walmart's research initiative aligns with North Carolina A&amp;T's strategic plans to further expand its local, regional and national community engagement activities in order to reduce social, economic and health disparities within African American populations,"" said Dr. Raymond Samuel, Professor of Biology, North Carolina A&amp;T State University; Center of Outreach in Alzheimer’s Aging and Community Health; Past Project Director, Hampton University-based Minority Men’s Health Initiative (MMHI). ""Walmart's interest in ensuring that DEIA is at the core of its effort to increase customer access to clinical trials is in synergy with the historical commitment of NC A&amp;T to enhancing the well-being of its communities.""Walmart’s Healthcare Research Institute is an extension of Walmart’s long-standing commitment to helping expand access to patients and underrepresented populations. The retailer has demonstrated this through low-cost medicines such as, $4 generic medication program and private label Relion® insulin, high-quality healthcare at Walmart Health Centers and Vision Centers, partnerships and programs to address Social Determinants of Health, and now the opportunity to enroll in healthcare research.Patients can learn more about healthcare research and opportunities that may be right for them at www.walmarthealthcareresearchinstitute.com.References:Chaudhari N, Ravi R, Gogtay NJ, Thatte UM.

The thinking is that the early bird catches the dollars,"" said Carol Spieckerman, president at consultancy Spieckerman Retail.Walmart Inc is holding a ""Rollbacks and More"" sale event from Oct. 10-13 to counter Amazon's discount days, with deals on everything from Hot Wheels toys to luggage.Kohl's Corp and Best Buy Co Inc's 48-hour sale also runs on the same days as Amazon's event, while Target Corp's ""Deal Days"" were from Oct. 6-8, avoiding a clash with Amazon.""The middle- to upper-income consumer is likely to take more advantage of the current deals to get a jump on the holiday season ... at the lower end of the income spectrum, those consumers may hold off and buy closer to need,"" Telsey Advisory Group analyst Joseph Feldman said.Inflation and early discounting is also expected to slow holiday spending for the year. U.S. online holiday sales are expected to rise this year at their slowest pace since at least 2015 and grow only 2.5% to $209.7 billion, according to Adobe Analytics.The early start to the holiday shopping season, however, does not come as a surprise.Major retailers such as Target and Walmart have been giving big discounts for months to get rid of excess inventory that piled up as consumer's cut back on discretionary spending. Some of them even had competing deals when Amazon held its Prime Day sales in July.Story continuesAt the time, Amazon raked in about $12 billion in sales, according to Adobe.""This holiday season, retailers are resorting to blunt force promotions to coax shoppers,"" Spieckerman said.(Additional reporting by Uday Sampath in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta)]"

And impact is our aim.Walmart, Monday, October 10, 2022, Press release pictureSo, we asked ourselves: How might we do even more good, for more communities, more often? And how do we answer the call from customers and associates to create more opportunities to direct their own giving to the causes they care most about?The answers to these questions brought us to something totally new.Today, just in time for the holiday season, we're launching a new way of giving designed to spark collective action - and big impact - in support of communities nationwide.We call it Spark Good.Spark Good makes giving - and getting - easier than ever. It brings a robust suite of giving resources to one convenient location on Walmart.com, providing easy access to programs and tools for nonprofits while empowering customers and associates to rally support for the causes that matter most to them.Two exciting programs, Round Up and an enhanced registry make it easier to tailor giving.Spark Good Round Up allows customers to round up their purchase total and donate their change at checkout on Walmart.com and in the Walmart app to a public charity of their choice. It's easy to use and customizable. Whereas most round up programs enable customers to give to a pre-determined charitable partner, Spark Good Round Up puts the community at its center, and the customer in the driver seat.Spark Good Registry works just like a baby or wedding registry, where public charities can create and manage registries for products they want and need, making it easier for customers to ensure their giving supports areas that will make the greatest impact. What was previously Registry for Good, Spark Good Registry is now more customizable for charities enabling them to send charitable receipts and thank their donors.Story continuesThese are just a few of the exciting resources available to nonprofits and customers through Spark Good.An impact dashboard will enable customers to see how Walmart and others in their community are supporting their favorite charities. To get things started, Walmart is offering a $50 gift card to the first 2500 local public charities to become verified on the Spark Good platform or enroll in Spark Good Round Up.We are committed to continuing our long history of strengthening communities, because we believe that when we come together, we can Spark Good.Visit Walmart.com/SparkGood to learn more.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Walmart on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: WalmartWebsite: http://corporate.walmart.com/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: WalmartView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/719622/Spark-Good-A-New-Way-To-Give-Back-Just-in-Time-for-the-Holidays]"

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Bear Market Stocks to Buy Now. The ongoing hawkish interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and inflationary pressures from high oil prices and the Russian invasion of Ukraine have decimated the stock market and led to a bearish rally that has resulted in major stock indexes bleeding one third of their value year to date just as they had started to recover from the coronavirus pandemic.Such an environment merits a cautious investment approach and careful stock picking, as it requires the investor to sift out companies with stable cash flows or products that are expected to withstand recessionary pressures. The latter is especially important since interest rate hikes will lead to a recession - and analysts right now only differ about its timing.Ken Fisher, the founder of the renowned hedge fund Fisher Investments, shared his thoughts and commented that even though the market is wary of consistent interest hikes, it increases the motivation for banks to lend. Mr. Fisher outlined that:So let me just say that when I was very young before I was an adult, Milton Friedman was saying that the central banks fiddling with interest rates thinking they can predict what that will do to the economy is beyond ridiculous and mostly, it doesn't allow you to impact the economy very directly. When I was young, the deposit base the banks lend off of was overwhelmingly, time deposits cost them money, and the spread between what they took money in at and what they lend it out at was a form of a gross margin, and the bigger that spread, the eager they became to lend the more that it was small i.e. the flattened or inverted yield curve, the less they were. But today 93% of U.S. bank lending base is interest free, free money, so the more the Federal Reserve raises rates, the more it increases the incentive of banks to lend. Which is, again, something I don't see why they don't understand that. But if you look at this period, the more inflation's gone up, the more corporate margins have gone up. Analogous not understood. Share buybacks remain strong, corporate bond spread. . . uh commercial lending through September's up 11% year over year.Story continuesWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some top bear stocks, with the top three in our list being Walmart Inc.

That is, insiders bought more stock than they sold.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Marsh &amp; McLennan CompaniesThe insider Marc Oken made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$837k worth of shares at a price of US$167 each. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of US$152. It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company. In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock when an insider has bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price. Marc Oken was the only individual insider to buy during the last year.You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

It's great to see that Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$184m.

An upgrade or downgrade can quickly move a stock’s price and lift or lower an analyst’s target price. The target price can also guide investors as to the potential long-term appreciation or depreciation of a stock.But the best analysts are only right about 50% of the time. And what does an investor do when the same analyst is the most optimistic or pessimistic among fellow analysts about several stocks in a particular sector?Take a look at what one analyst says are the three residential real estate investment trust (REIT) stocks with the highest upside and how some of his peers view the same stocks.Camden Property Trust (NYSE: CPT) is a Houston-based residential REIT that owns and manages over 240,000 square feet of apartment complexes in major cities across the U.S. Some of its apartment complexes also contain ground-floor retail space, offices or mixed-use space.Camden Property Trust pays a dividend of $3.76, which has grown 25% over the past five years with no cuts or eliminations. It presently yields about 3.1%.Barclay’s analyst Anthony Powell recently maintained an overweight position on Camden Property Trust while lowering the target price from $174 to $169. From its recent price, that represents a potential upside of 43%, the highest among residential REITs.Evercore ISI Group analyst Steve Sakwa was not quite as optimistic, lowering his price target twice within two weeks, from $158 to $147. But that’s still a 25% upside from Camden Property Trust’s recent price.Don't Miss: Bezos-Backed Startup Lets You Buy Shares Of This 3-Bedroom Home For As Little As $100Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc. (NYSE: MAA) is another residential REIT that owns and manages over 101,000 units in nearly 300 communities across 16 states.The Germantown, Tennessee-based REIT pays an annual dividend of $5 per share, currently yielding about 3.3%. The dividend has grown by 43% over the past five years, with no cuts or eliminations.Story continuesBarclay’s Powell also recently maintained an overweight position on Mid-America Apartment Communities and raised its price target from $211 to $215. This presents a potential upside of 41% from its recent price.However, analyst Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho Bank was far less sanguine, maintaining a neutral position and nudging the price target down from $178 to $177.Equity Residential (NYSE: EQR) is a Chicago-based REIT that boasts over 300 apartment buildings located in large urban areas, such as Boston, New York, Washington, D.C, Seattle, San Francisco and Denver.Equity Residential pays an annual dividend of $2.50, which currently yields about 3.8%. The dividend has grown 24% over the past five years with no cuts nor eliminations over that time.Barclay’s Powell also maintained an equal-rate position on Equity Residential, while raising the price target from $83 to $88. That increase now presents Equity Residential with a potential upside of 35%.But Powell’s target price was much higher than several other analysts who wrote about Equity Residential. Sakwa of Evercore ISI Group sees $81 as a more realistic target price, and John Kim of BMO Capital Markets even downgraded Equity Residential from outperform to market perform, while slicing his target price from $88 to $74. That only equates to 13% of upside potential from its recent price.So where does that leave investors? The most prudent advice is to consider analyst opinions as a guide to potential appreciation but still assess stocks by their fundamentals and/or technical indicators before making any purchases.Read next: This Little-Known REIT Is Producing Double-Digit Returns In A Bear Market: How?See more from BenzingaThese 3 REITs Are Paying Huge DividendsCan These REITs Keep Paying 9% Dividend Yields?Don't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

While the stock has lost 19% over the past four weeks, there is light at the end of the tunnel as it is now in oversold territory and Wall Street analysts expect the company to report better earnings than they predicted earlier.Guide to Identifying Oversold StocksWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Why a Trend Reversal is Due for EQRThe heavy selling of EQR shares appears to be in the process of exhausting itself, as indicated by its RSI reading of 26.74. So, the trend for the stock could reverse soon for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.The RSI value is not the only factor that indicates a potential turnaround for the stock in the near term. On the fundamental side, there has been strong agreement among the sell-side analysts covering the stock in raising earnings estimates for the current year. Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for EQR has increased 0%. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Moreover, EQR currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.

There, you're taking a look at some of those casino stocks. Whether it's Sands or Wynn Resorts, all of them are down this morning, early in trade.Melco Resorts, MGM Resorts also lower here, as we're seeing some mixed major averages here. But what was also pointed out within this for Citigroup, they cut their estimate for the gaming revenue in October to 5.5 billion [INAUDIBLE]-- I believe I pronounced that correctly-- from 7 billion, citing some of the disappointing revenue that I mentioned during the first nine days of this month.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, there's a lot of hope that you've got reopening happening in China slowly, but surely, and some of the restrictions on Macau have been removed. So then it's a disappointment here that there would be this kind of a cut to the forecast here. And that's what the folks over at Citigroup are saying. They say despite the solid National Day Golden Week visitation, recovery was probably impacted by the recent COVID-19 outbreak in China. So it just continues to be a problem for hospitality, and in particular, for gaming in Macau.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, I'll just quickly mention in this sphere, too, of gaming, I'm watching sports, the sports betting space this week. There's a key conference later in the week. DraftKings CEO Jason Robins will be speaking at this conference. To my knowledge, this would be his first public comments perhaps on anything related to Disney and ESPN. That popped the stock last week. I'd put that on the watch list.JULIE HYMAN: And you also have to wonder, many of those other companies that we just mentioned also have sports betting, digital betting. So we'll see if this, then, helps them recover a little bit from some of the declines today.]"

It had shed 1.4% against the yuan to 8.78 , a near three-week low.""During the session we expect continued pressure on the rouble against the backdrop of lower supply of foreign currency from exporters,"" Banki.ru analyst Bogdan Zvarich said in a note.The rouble has been supported by capital controls and a collapse in imports since Western sanctions were imposed over Russia's actions in Ukraine and companies left the market in droves.Addressing parliament on Tuesday, Bank of Russia Deputy Governor Alexei Zabotkin said that capital controls, which have been partially eased since Russia sent troops into Ukraine, could be brought back in full ""if acute risks to financial stability materialise again"".Already blighted by Western sanctions, Russia's economy now faces a more self-inflicted blow, with President Vladimir Putin's military mobilisation drive threatening to undermine productivity, demand and recovery.Promsvyazbank analyst Yevgeny Loktyukhov pointed to escalation in Ukraine and a pullback in oil prices as a reason for the rouble's slide.Brent crude oil, a global benchmark for Russia's main export, was down 2.3% at $94.0 a barrel at 1410 GMT.Russian stock indexes, which were dragged sharply lower by Gazprom in the previous session, were mixed.The dollar-denominated RTS index shed 1% to 954.0 points, while the rouble-based MOEX Russian index was up 1.2% at 1,939.3 points.Excluding Gazprom, the market was gaining for the second day running, said Dmitry Skryabin, portfolio manager at Alfa Capital.The European Union's eighth sanctions package had turned out to be less severe than expected in terms of a ban on ferrous metals products, he added.

That simple,"" Dominic Schnider told CNBC.Crude oil could hit $125 a barrel as Russia's response to a US-led price cap plan threatens to tighten the global market even further, a top UBS commodities strategist has said.Moscow has said it's prepared to cut its oil output if the G7 nations carry through with the price cap, warning the measure will end up primarily hurting those behind the plan.Dominic Schnider, head of commodities at UBS Global Wealth Management, said that could pull another 1 million barrels a day at a time when the oil market is already facing a supply squeeze from the OPEC+ decision to slash its production targets.""The Russians were clear: 'If you force us to accept the price cap, we're simply not going to deliver crude to you,"" Schnider said in a Tuesday interview with CNBC,""And so I think that kind of situation means, maybe, from a global supply perspective, there's an additional 1 million barrels at risk here.""As we get further draws, you're going to see prices going up. That simple. And we're looking at $110-$125, that's for us our point of gravity when it comes to crude oil,"" he added.Brent crude futures were down about 2% at $94.24 at last check Tuesday, thanks to worries that a recession and a fresh COVID-19 breakout in China will hit demand. US benchmark WTI crude futures were 2.4% lower at $88.97.The G7 nations — Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, and the US — have agreed to set a price cap on Russian oil in an effort to target Moscow's revenues and curb its ability to fund its war against Ukraine.But they face a tough task in persuading the likes of China and India, both big buyers of Russian crude, to join up to the price cap plan.Story continuesMeanwhile, the US is caught up in growing hostilities with OPEC+ and its de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, after the producer group last week decided to cut output by 2 million barrels a day.The move is seen as a snub to the Biden administration's efforts to stem price rises for oil, and therefore US gasoline — and led to the White House accusing OPEC+ of ""aligning with Russia"".Schnider agreed that the OPEC+ cuts are likely to push oil prices higher over the coming months, which would then make the G7's push to impose a Russian oil price cap by the end of 2022 more difficult.While the group is still ironing out the details of the price cap, such as penalties for those who don't adopt it, officials have floated a range of $40-$60 a barrel.""It complicates. I mean, Europe still wants to get rid of some — depending on how you calculate — oil and products. That means it's between two-and-a-half and up to three million barrels. You need to find these barrels. That's number one,"" Schnider said.""We are still quite concerned if that kind of rotation in trade flows — how is that going to really work out? Because the Russians were clear,"" he added.But he noted that the US still has some options to help ease the tightness in the market, which includes tapping into its Strategic Petroleum Reserve for additional releases of oil.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

(NYSE:LPI) institutional owners must be relieved by the recent gain",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/losing-15-past-laredo-petroleum-105049429.html,1665485449,STORY,['CL=F'],"[A look at the shareholders of Laredo Petroleum, Inc. (NYSE:LPI) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 81% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Last week's US$110m market cap gain would probably be appreciated by institutional investors, especially after a year of 15% losses.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Laredo Petroleum, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Laredo Petroleum ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Laredo Petroleum?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Laredo Petroleum does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Laredo Petroleum's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Laredo Petroleum. The company's largest shareholder is BlackRock, Inc., with ownership of 14%. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.9% and 6.7% of the stock. Furthermore, CEO Mikell Pigott is the owner of 0.7% of the company's shares.On further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 10 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.Story continuesWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Laredo PetroleumWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.We can report that insiders do own shares in Laredo Petroleum, Inc.. It is a pretty big company, so it is generally a positive to see some potentially meaningful alignment. In this case, they own around US$25m worth of shares (at current prices). If you would like to explore the question of insider alignment, you can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 12% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Public Company OwnershipPublic companies currently own 4.5% of Laredo Petroleum stock. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 5 warning signs for Laredo Petroleum (1 is potentially serious!) that you should be aware of before investing here.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

""And we should have gotten that right starting in March. It's almost too late to get it right because obviously, this is a longer-term investment.""Energy prices have gained sharply after Russia invaded Ukraine in February as Russia is a major exporter of oil and gas. Fears of a worsening energy crunch heightened in recent months after Russia started cutting natural-gas supplies to Europe — a development Dimon called ""pretty predictable.""""In my view, America should have been pumping more oil and gas,"" he told CNBC.The US is the world's largest producer of oil, producing 18.9 million barrels of the fuel a day, per the Energy Information Administration. But the US is also the world's largest consumer of oil, so exports are limited.By comparison, the de facto OPEC leader and major exporter Saudi Arabia produces 10.8 million barrels of oil a day but consumes just 3.2 million barrels daily, exporting the rest, the EIA said.And while the US has huge energy reserves, the industry's exports are hitting maximum levels and can't be boosted overnight, US shale producers told the Financial Times in the past few months.Dimon's comments came days after OPEC and its allies agreed to slash oil output, in response to a weaker global economy.

Describing the issue as a ""critical"" one, he said ""this should be treated almost as a matter of war at this point, nothing short of that,"" he added.In the same interview, Dimon gave a gloomy forecast of the economy, predicting a recession for the US in the next six to nine months.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

The selloff spread to the foreign-exchange market as investors tallied up the damage from the sweeping curbs the US is imposing on companies that conduct technology business with China.The Biden administration measures erect barriers of entry to China’s market by limiting the ability of US firms to sell equipment and tech to their Chinese counterparts. There are concerns that the restrictions could spread if Washington widens the initiative to include other countries, while questions also remain over the scope and final impact of the moves.“It is difficult to call a bottom on the performance of the chip sector,” said Gary Dugan, chief executive officer of the Global CIO Office. “The big story is that the West is becoming profoundly more concerned about security around any form of technology. We see no reason to re-enter the sector for the moment despite the profound poor performance.”US chip stocks were on track to decline for a third day, with Nvidia Corp., Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Qualcomm Inc. and Texas Instruments Inc. all down more than 1% before the bell. Chip-tool maker ASML Holding NV traded down 2.3% in Amsterdam, bringing three-day losses to more than 11%.The US measures include restrictions on the export of some types of chips used in artificial intelligence and supercomputing, and also tighter rules on the sale of semiconductor equipment to any Chinese company. Washington also added more Chinese firms to a list of companies that it regards as “unverified,” which means US suppliers will face new hurdles in selling technologies to those entities.Story continuesThe US announced the export curbs Friday, and there have been suggestions that similar actions may be deployed in other countries to ensure international cooperation. The announcement spurred a two-day rout of over 9% in the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index that saw it close Monday at its lowest level since November 2020. Markets in Korea, Japan and Taiwan were shut that day for holidays.Samsung lost as much as 3.9%, the most in a year. South Korea’s SK Hynix Inc., one of the world’s largest makers of memory chips that has facilities in China -- is part of a supply network that sends components around the world. Its shares slid 3.5% before paring losses.The current rout has already wiped out more than $240 billion from chip stocks worldwide since Thursday’s close, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The selloff extended to currency markets, with the South Korean won sliding as much as 1.8% versus the greenback while the Taiwan dollar declined 0.7%.The curbs are a “big setback to China” and “bad news” for global semiconductors, Nomura Holdings Inc. analyst David Wong wrote in a note Monday. China’s localization efforts may also be “at risk as it may not be able to use advanced foundries in Taiwan and Korea,” he wrote.The US measures seek to stop China’s drive to develop its own chip industry and advance its military capabilities. The impact could extend well beyond semiconductors and into industries that rely on high-end computing, from electric vehicles and aerospace to gadgets like smartphones.The fallout is already being felt. KLA Corp. will stop offering some supplies and services from Wednesday to China-based customers including SK Hynix to comply with the recent US regulations, Reuters reported, citing a person familiar with the situation.Shares of Chinese chipmakers extended their recent losses on Tuesday, with Morgan Stanley saying that the broader restrictions around supercomputers and multinational capital investment in China could be “disruptive.”Chinese state media and officials have responded to Biden’s move in recent days, warning of economic consequences and stirring speculation about potential retaliation.“With the latest measure, it would become difficult for China to manufacture and develop semiconductors because most semiconductor equipment are dominated by US and its allies,” such as Japan and Netherlands, Chae Minsook, an analyst at Korea Investment &amp; Securities, wrote in a report. “It is impossible to maintain the chip industry without adopting advanced equipments.”(Updates throughout)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekA Digital Drive to Reform the $11 Trillion Global Gold MarketExxon’s Exodus: Employees Have Finally Had Enough of Its Toxic CultureThis Is What the Gas Station of the Future Will Look LikeHow Gamers Beat NFTsTaking ‘Abrasive’ and ‘Nice’ Out of Performance Reviews©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

For a preview of what to expect, let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Semenova. These are always-- it's always a good bellwether, right, about where things are in terms of the economy. As we said, never been more uncertain.ALEXANDRA SEMENOVA: Yeah, absolutely, Akiko. Those four banks, among the six largest in the US by assets, are set to be the opening act of the earnings season, with Goldman Sachs and Bank of America set to release results next week. And some of the themes that we'll be watching closely are a slowdown in investment banking revenues, potential layoffs across their businesses, how demand for loans is holding up with higher interest rates, and any potential warnings about the economy that CEOs may deliver on earnings calls.And this quarter, profits are expected to shrink, especially compared to a really robust 2021 for Wall Street. Profits are also likely to take a hit from higher loan loss provisions. Those are funds set aside by banks for any potential sour loans if customers don't make their payments. The six largest US banks are estimated to set aside a collective $4.5 billion this quarter. That's according to a Financial Times report today. And this is also a turnaround from a year ago, when banks actually benefited from releasing those reserves, as we were recovering from the pandemic.One notable thing to note, too, is that banks typically benefit from higher interest rate environments. Those often give them a nice boost on their net interest income. But investment banking revenue is likely to offset that. And some other things to look out for, too, are any comments that bank executives make. Jamie Dimon is always an interesting one on his earnings calls with his storm cloud warnings. Credit Suisse and the broader-- what that means for the broader industry. And also Bank of America and Morgan Stanley are estimated to lose a combined $500 million on Elon Musk's Twitter deal.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, worth noting the bar pretty low, going into earnings season, not just within banks, but overall. Thanks so much for that. I know you're going to tracking those results really closely.]"

(NYSE:CRM) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:""Salesforce is a recent investment which I wrote about in my H1 2021 letter. As of today, the investment, if not the share price, has worked out as hoped. Given the utility-like nature of its business, it is the kind of investment I thought would do well in a market panic, but alas it was not to be. The investment thesis rested on three legs: an enormous moat based on the ubiquity of its software in most of the world’s largest companies, robust growth driven by the growing need for digitisation as well as the huge potential of Slack, and steady progress towards a mature operating margin of 40%.The company has performed well against all three measures. I do not see any obvious threat to its moat. Judged by the growing number of “multi-cloud” deals it has announced, it seems to be deepening its relationships with its customers rather than vice versa. Growth has tracked higher than the 18% p.a. I assumed at the time of our investment. Moreover, I continue to be optimistic about Slack. Revenue growth has accelerated since its acquisition by Salesforce, and it is yet to see the full benefit of becoming the main way that customers access Salesforce’s suite of applications.

Through an agreement between the Kauai Island Utility Cooperative (KIUC) and a U.S. utility and power generation company, the WKEP will utilize state land and water for the following main objectives: renewable energy production via hydroelectric generation, renewable energy production via solar photovoltaic (PV) generation, pumped hydroelectric and battery storage, and irrigation delivery to support diversified agriculture.Flowserve vertical turbine pumps will enable the sophisticated engineering design of the hydropower and pumped storage components of the project. Upon WKEP’s completion, the project is expected to equip Kauai with 25% of its electricity needs. Specifically, the pumped hydropower will provide twelve hours of daily storage – a significant improvement to the standard storage from existing solar battery facilities which provide up to only five hours. This extended duration will allow the island to run on 100% renewable energy for longer periods of time without requiring sunlight. ""We are excited to be a part of this meaningful project. Through our purpose to make the world better for everyone, we are well positioned to support Hawaii’s ambitious goals on the path to zero emissions,"" said Tamara Morytko, president, Flowserve pumps division.

A business that's potentially in decline often shows two trends, a return on capital employed (ROCE) that's declining, and a base of capital employed that's also declining. Basically the company is earning less on its investments and it is also reducing its total assets. So after glancing at the trends within Flowserve (NYSE:FLS), we weren't too hopeful.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Flowserve:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.059 = US$205m ÷ (US$4.6b - US$1.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).So, Flowserve has an ROCE of 5.9%.  Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Machinery industry average of 10%. View our latest analysis for Flowserve roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Flowserve compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Flowserve.What Can We Tell From Flowserve's ROCE Trend?There is reason to be cautious about Flowserve, given the returns are trending downwards. Unfortunately the returns on capital have diminished from the 7.4% that they were earning five years ago. And on the capital employed front, the business is utilizing roughly the same amount of capital as it was back then. Since returns are falling and the business has the same amount of assets employed, this can suggest it's a mature business that hasn't had much growth in the last five years. So because these trends aren't typically conducive to creating a multi-bagger, we wouldn't hold our breath on Flowserve becoming one if things continue as they have.Story continuesThe Bottom LineIn the end, the trend of lower returns on the same amount of capital isn't typically an indication that we're looking at a growth stock. Long term shareholders who've owned the stock over the last five years have experienced a 36% depreciation in their investment, so it appears the market might not like these trends either. Unless there is a shift to a more positive trajectory in these metrics, we would look elsewhere.Flowserve does come with some risks though, we found 4 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 2 of those make us uncomfortable...If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

52,e69b442b-0219-30f5-861d-02826f600b19,MSFT,2022-10-11,Why businesses are embracing industry clouds,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-businesses-embracing-industry-clouds-180000941.html,1665424800,STORY,"['MSFT', 'INGR']","[For St. Luke’s University Health Network, using what’s known as an industry cloud turned out to be a big advantage during the pandemic.Health care provider St. Luke’s, whose network includes 13 hospitals and 322 outpatient facilities in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, lets patients schedule appointments online. Demand surged after COVID-19 vaccines began rolling out, recalls vice president and chief information officer Chad Brisendine.“Let’s say we [normally] had 1,000 people hitting our scheduling system,” Brisendine says. “That went to, like, 7,000 people all of a sudden.”Fortunately, St. Luke’s, headquartered in Bethlehem, Pa., was prepared, having moved much of its workload to Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare before the pandemic. Previously, it would have taken a day, a week, or longer for the nonprofit to scale up to meet such demand, Brisendine notes. But the St. Luke’s cloud team quickly took it in stride.“As that capacity started to be needed, they just applied it directly from the cloud,” Brisendine says. “When you have these quick workloads where you need to be able to scale up your infrastructure, the cloud makes it really great because it has all of the resources available.”St. Luke’s is one of a growing number of organizations turning to industry clouds, which specialize in business processes for a particular sector. This change looks like a tech trend, but in fact, it’s all about strategy. By using these vertical offerings for tasks that have little or nothing to do with their secret sauce, companies can focus on what sets them apart.Industry clouds gained momentum over the past three to five years, says Brian Campbell, a principal with Deloitte Consulting’s strategy practice. So-called hyperscalers such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure have played a large role.“There was a real push in the market for the benefit of, first, the infrastructure—in a sense, the compute and storage—and then the emergence of all of these different services that each of them served up,” Campbell says. “And then really over the last two years, the next frontier of going from a lot of the IT and functional benefit to the actual heart of your business and the specificity of the industry processes.”Story continuesOn that note, Campbell offers an analogy. “We talk about it as not needing to do open heart surgery to be able to accomplish the promise of industry clouds,” he says. “It’s almost the ability to put an exoskeleton onto the core and be able to make those improvements in different areas without having to open everything up.”Businesses sound bullish about industry clouds. In a recent Deloitte survey of 500 senior cloud decision-makers from a variety of industries throughout the U.S., 74% of leaders polled completely agreed that industry clouds would be an enabler and catalyst for transformation and automation of industry-specific business processes.Besides hyperscalers, enterprise resource planning (ERP) players, independent software vendors (ISVs), and customer relationship management (CRM) providers are investing heavily in the space, Campbell observes.“Because the frontier that all of the Fortune 1000 is moving to is, ‘All right, we’ve focused a lot on our back office, we’ve got to focus on front of house,’” he says, noting that Deloitte has invested in industry clouds as a systems integrator, business adviser, and software provider. “Especially given the environment that everyone’s in today, given that that’s where the winners and losers are going to be separated from one another.”Microsoft has done two things with its industry clouds, says Alysa Taylor, corporate vice president, industry, apps, and data marketing, at the company based in Redmond, Wash. “We have organized all of our assets to be very specific to use cases within the industry,” Taylor explains. “Then we have certain clouds that have a subscription model that allow you to have additive access to things like the data models and very unique industry connectors.” So far, Microsoft has released those subscriptions for financial services, health care, manufacturing, nonprofits, retail, and sustainability.For St. Luke’s, the move began in 2018, the year after it created a digital strategy plan with Microsoft. Part of that plan was leveraging cloud services to be more secure, agile, and flexible, Brisendine remembers. “How do we get rid of things that we think we don’t need to be doing as a core strategy and a core discipline? At the end of the day, we don’t necessarily need or want to be managing infrastructure.”So far, St. Luke’s has sent almost 80% of its workload to the cloud. After shifting many of the 1,000-plus applications it manages, it became one of the first health care organizations to migrate Epic, its major ERP platform, Brisendine says. “We did a lot of that work in 2020 and 2021, when we shifted a couple of thousand servers over.”What’s left? Applications requiring more bandwidth than the cloud can currently handle, such as those providing images of X-rays. At the same time, St. Luke’s modest margins gave it a compelling reason to manage costs by using cloud services, Brisendine says.St. Luke’s has brought disparate systems together into a common data model that provides a holistic view of patients and their medical history, Taylor says. “That saves them time and money. It takes the IT burden off of them, but it also helps preventative medicine and, in severe cases, saves lives.”Using industry clouds lets businesses focus on what makes them unique. “The way that we’ve described it is: Make sure that your secret sauce is most prevalent,” Campbell says. “Those are the areas that you’re really going to hang your strategy, hang your customer experience, hang your differentiation to the market on.”Industry clouds also offer “building blocks to then be able to customize even further, to achieve that differentiation faster, and be able to do it in a more innovative way over time, versus one and done,” Campbell adds.Ingredion, a provider of plant-based ingredients to food and beverage, pharmaceutical, and other industries, is also going the industry cloud route. The company, based in Westchester, Ill., began creating a data repository in 2018 to analyze how environmentally and socially sustainable it is and to track the progress of All Life 2030, its wide-ranging sustainability plan.Much of that work was done manually and scattered across almost 70 locations worldwide, with Azure as the data link. Then Microsoft approached Ingredion with its Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability, says Ingredion chief information officer Bob Border.To start building a system that standardized and automated data collection, while also making that information faster and easier to analyze, Ingredion fed data on previous decisions its U.S. operations had made about Scope 1 and 2 emissions into a tool called Microsoft Sustainability Manager. (Scope 1 and 2 emissions are those that an organization makes directly and indirectly, while Scope 3 are those for which it bears indirect responsibility.) The goal: to see if using Sustainability Manager might have delivered different outcomes.“We’re learning a little bit more about it as they’ve been developing and deploying this platform, and we do see benefits,” Border says. “Especially when we get to Scope 3, we definitely see some large benefits, although we’re already starting to see some benefits from Scope 1 and Scope 2.”Although Ingredion doesn’t have a formal industry cloud strategy, it’s keeping an eye out for new opportunities after this first foray. “Because it should save us some work, which could end up being some savings,” Border says. “So we’ll always look at the value of doing things from an industry perspective versus building ourselves.”Border’s advice for other organizations weighing a move to industry clouds: Understand how your data is being used so it doesn’t fall into the wrong hands.“Some of the industry clouds we looked at, it’s kind of a black box,” he says. For example, a cloud provider might use artificial intelligence on your data to create a formulation for you. “Well, what happens with that data?” Border asks. “Now some of my products are in this formulation engine that my competitor might be using.”Brisendine’s first tip is to decide whether you plan to manage your own infrastructure—and if so, what the plan is. He also recommends using financial transparency tools—in addition to those provided by Microsoft and other vendors—to monitor cloud resources. Doing an audit of your security tools is crucial, too.And if you are managing your own infrastructure, give your team time to learn how to build it. To help everyone get comfortable with the cloud, St. Luke’s also moved lighter workloads first, Brisendine says. “I would definitely say start small and grow big into it.”For St. Luke’s, probably the biggest lesson was around modernizing applications. And the business and IT must be strongly aligned on strategy, Campbell warns. “Without that, don’t go here.” Oh, and the time to embrace industry clouds is now: “If you’re looking at this space even 18 to 24 months from now, you’re going to be on the back foot of where your industry is.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.com.]"

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Stocks for Long-Term Growth.Growth stocks are taking a beating in 2022 due to higher borrowing costs that are delaying expansion plans and negatively impacting margins. However, for long-term investors, this is a buying opportunity. Investors that have a long-term time horizon and are closely observing secular trends can still find stocks in a bear market that can experience strong growth. Secular growth industries include clean energy, electric vehicles, biotech, cloud computing, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence among others. These are all industries that are reshaping the world and are therefore expected to experience long-term growth. For instance, the digital transformation of industries is expected to grow the cloud computing industry from an estimated $480 billion in 2022 to $1.7 trillion by 2029 at a compound annual growth rate of 19.9% over the forecasted period. The global biotech industry was worth $1 trillion in 2021 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 13.9% from 2022 to 2030. As businesses go digital, cybersecurity is becoming a major concern for businesses. The global cybersecurity market is expected to be worth $155.8 billion in 2022 and then grow at a compound annual growth rate of 13.4% through 2029 to reach a value of $376.3 billion.These are only a few industries that are expected to experience healthy growth over the next decade. In this article, we will uncover some of the best stocks for investors to own for long-term growth. Some of the best long-term stocks to own include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).Our MethodologyTo determine the 12 best stocks to own for long-term growth, we looked for companies that belonged to secular growth industries. We narrowed down our selection to companies that have the potential to grow significantly, based on their relevant growth catalysts.

Growth has temporarily slowed over the past year as the company laps difficult YoY comparisons caused by the rapid adoption of their virtual sales call solution during the pandemic. Several large deals also encountered unexpected delays in late 2021. Despite these short-term headwinds, we remain confident in Veeva’s future growth prospects and high-quality business model (~40% free cash flow margins supported by largely recurring subscription revenues).

If you want to jump ahead to the top five stocks in this list, then take a look at 5 Best Video Game Stocks to Buy Now.The advent and growth of consumer technology and gadgets have revolutionized entertainment. Before the computer or gaming consoles became popular or advanced, entertainment means were limited primarily to physical or contact sports. Now, advanced gaming consoles, personal computers, and gadgets offer consumers new and immersive entertainment mediums.This growth has also led to optimistic estimates for the video game industry. For instance, a research report from Markets Research Future estimates that the gaming market will grow at a strong compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13% to be worth a staggering $547 billion by the end of 2030. Another report from KBV Research estimates that the market will grow at a similar CAGR of 12% to sit at $413 billion by 2028 end.The report goes on to further outline that this growth will be driven by the uptick in internet and cellular connections and government initiatives for projects such as smart cities. It further explains that not only did Asia Pacific drive the gaming industry in 2021, particularly due to strong Chinese spending in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic, but the region will also continue to drive this growth into the future.Finally, gaming companies themselves are evolving with time, as the traditional brick and mortar model that led to physical game disk sales is being replaced by an online model. This model removes the cost of manufacturing and printing disk drives for video games and lets the game developers directly provide their products to their customers - a process that allows them to improve their gross margins by reducing the cost of products sold.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the hot gaming stocks right now, and some companies likely to catch your eye include Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).Story continuesconsole, gaming, entertaiment, nintendo, videoBarone Firenze / Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyIn order to pick the top video game companies in the industry, we took a broad look at the different companies operating and then sifted out the relevant ones based on a variety of factors such as the quality of video game titles in their portfolio, relevant market events, and financial performance.

57,1306e3dd-4a37-373a-b1e9-acb32051a642,MSFT,2022-10-11,Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-corporation-msft-trending-stock-130001847.html,1665406801,STORY,['MSFT'],"[Microsoft (MSFT) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this software maker have returned -11.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -8.4% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Microsoft belongs, has lost 9.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Microsoft is expected to post earnings of $2.31 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.3%.The consensus earnings estimate of $10.06 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +9.2%. This estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.63 indicates a change of +15.6% from what Microsoft is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Microsoft is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MSFT _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Microsoft, the consensus sales estimate of $49.71 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +9.7%. The $219.26 billion and $248.76 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10.6% and +13.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMicrosoft reported revenues of $51.87 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.4%. EPS of $2.23 for the same period compares with $2.17 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $52.31 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.86%. The EPS surprise was -2.19%.Over the last four quarters, Microsoft surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Microsoft is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Microsoft. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Studies can be delayed or terminated when organizations are not able to get enough people to participate or when patients drop out of the trial.Senior citizens, rural populations, women and people of color in the U.S. are often left out of clinical research because they lack awareness of trials and access to facilities.Walmart is currently working with Laina Enterprises, a virtual clinical trial management platform, the retailer said in a press release.Rival Walgreens said in June it had launched clinical trial services to increase diversity in test subjects. A company spokesperson said Walgreens is in talks with ""many leading pharmaceutical companies"" to help with patient recruitment, virtual or hybrid clinical trials and diversity initiatives.According to a database of U.S. clinical trials seen by Reuters, Walgreens worked with the University of North Texas Health Science Center starting in 2018 for a study on African American HIV patients.Walmart has previously said it wants to focus more on its high-margin businesses including healthcare, financial services and advertising.Story continues""Walgreens is making a push to utilize their stores to reach their more diverse population in their clinical trials, so it seems feasible that that's something that Walmart may eventually want to do as well,"" said Carri Chan, a professor at Columbia Business School.Walmart opened Walmart Health locations in Dallas, Georgia in 2019 and now has 24 locations including in Arkansas, Florida and Illinois. In September, Walmart said it would partner with UnitedHealth Group to provide preventative healthcare to elderly populations and telehealth services for all age groups.Meanwhile, CVS Health began offering clinical trials in 2021. CVS Health Clinical Trial Services General Manager Tony Clapsis told Reuters drug companies bear much of the costs, although some costs might get picked up by Medicare, Medicaid or a commercial health plan.CVS has since conducted studies to track the emergence of COVID-19 variants while under contract to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, according to its website.It also is working on a flu study and collaborating with Pfizer to recruit 600 participants for a study to determine the long-term effects of COVID-19, according to patient recruitment listing seen by Reuters.

59,10a31604-7049-3fa3-9649-05cb7ab4e9d5,WBA,2022-10-11,Walgreens Earnings Preview: Can WBA Stock Rebound?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walgreens-earnings-preview-wba-stock-235111954.html,1665445871.0,STORY,"['WBA', 'CVS']","[Walgreens Boots Alliance WBA has largely struggled while competitor CVS Health CVS has been somewhat of an investment darling over the last few years. WBA investors are hoping the stock can rebound.WBA’s fiscal fourth quarter earnings release on Thursday, October 13 will be closely monitored as many businesses struggle amid rising inflation and tougher operating environments.OverviewTrading 42% off its 52-week highs, it will be important to see if Walgreens was able to have another strong quarter despite inflationary concerns. WBA has beaten earnings expectations for eight consecutive quarters. Another earnings beat during the economic downturn could boost investors’ confidence in WBA stock. But despite the run of beats, earnings estimates have continued to decline. This means that investors will want to see some upbeat guidance more than anything else.Investors will also want to pay attention to WBA’s international growth and the continued benefits of the merger with Britain’s biggest pharmacy chain, Alliance Boots. Upon completing the merger in 2014, Walgreens Boots Alliance is now an integrated healthcare company, and pharmacy retailer servicing millions of customers and patients daily. The Walgreens Boots Alliance merger created the world’s first pharmacy-led, health and well-being enterprise.Last quarter Boots UK sales grew 13.5% and its German wholesale business grew 6.8%.Performance At current levels, WBA stock could be approaching oversold territory and an earnings beat along with positive guidance could give the stock a much-needed boost.WBA is down -38% year to date, with much of the painful decline transpiring over the last quarter as inflationary concerns began crippling the stock along with the broader market. WBA’s YTD performance lags the S&amp;P 500’s -24% and competitor CVS’s -13%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUnfortunately, WBA’s lackluster performance started before rising inflation begin hindering the broader market. WBA stock is down -41% over the last three years to underperform the benchmark’s +24% and CVS’s impressive +41%.Story continuesWBA stock is up +127% over the last 25 years vs. the benchmark’s +380%. Despite the purgatory-like performance of the stock, WBA could possibly bounce back if Wall Street starts to find real value.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValuationCurrently trading around $31 a share, WBA has a forward P/E of 6.6X. This is on par with the industry average. This is also much lower than its decade high of 25.5X and median of 12.4X.WBA also has an EV/EBITDA of 6.5X, which is lower than the industry average of 7.3X, and competitor CVS’s 7.2X. This is an indicator that WBA has very sustainable levels and a solid cash position.  WBA is starting to look attractive relative to its past and its EV/EBITDA is promising when considering rising inflation and operation costs. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOutlookThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for WBA’s fiscal Q4 earnings is $0.78 a share, which would represent a 33% decrease from fiscal Q4 2021. Sales are also expected to decline 5% at $32.49 billion. It is important to note that estimates for the quarter have declined over the last two months.Year over year, WBA is projected to see earnings slump 5% in 2022, with its FY23 earnings set to fall another 8%. Sales are also expected to be down 3% in FY22 but rise 1% in FY23 to $133.82 billion.Operations costs appear to be weighing on the company’s earnings as indicated in WBA’s FY23 outlook. This is something investors will also want to pay attention to during the quarterly release regarding its FY23 guidance. WBA is expected to have 5% earnings growth over the next five years.Bottom Line  Although Walgreen Boots Alliance is starting to look more attractive from a valuation perspective there could be more risks ahead. WBA currently lands a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) in correlation with downward earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter, FY22, and FY23.WBA may eventually have more upside but there could be more turbulence ahead. Competition from CVS has weighed on WBA stock over the years. While CVS is expected to see earnings growth for this year and FY23, operation costs appear to be weighing on WBA’s earnings and the stock.One thing is for certain, WBA could use another earnings beat and strong guidance in hopes of an eventual rebound.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

WBA is slated to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results on Oct 13, before market open.In the fiscal third quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 1.05%. WBA’s earnings outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 13.37%.Let’s look at how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at Play   Walgreens is likely to have gained from continued strategic executions on both the United States and the international front. The quarter’s top line is likely to have benefited from the new Walgreens Health business, which brings equitable, personalized, whole-person healthcare to local communities across America.In May 2022, Walgreens sold 6 million shares of AmerisourceBergen Corporation common stock pursuant to Rule 144 at $150 per share. The company earlier announced its plans to use the proceeds from the sale, amounting to nearly $900 million for debt paydown and the continued support of its strategic priorities. This strategic development is likely to have contributed to the company’s fiscal fourth-quarter performance and improved its debt position.The company, on its third-quarter earnings release, noted that the partial monetization of AmerisourceBergen shares has been augmenting its balance sheet and was consistent with the company’s efforts to generate shareholder value.United StatesWalgreens is likely to have registered growth in U.S. retail pharmacy business, banking on demand for vaccinations and tests amid the ongoing series of contagious virus spread. In the fiscal third quarter, U.S. digital sales grew 25% on top of 95% growth a year ago.In the United States, Walgreens Boots’ expanded partnership with ALTO US, a provider of loss prevention and tech-enabled security services, should have contributed to the fiscal fourth-quarter top line. Meanwhile, its initiative to work together across more than 2,200 stores should have a positive impact on retail shrink in the quarter under review.Story continuesWalgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseWalgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. QuoteIn this regard, we note that the company delivered 4.7 million COVID vaccinations in the fiscal third quarter. As of early April, Walgreens has been offering additional boosters to adults aged 50 and older, and certain immunocompromised individuals. In March-end, Walgreens began offering Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccine boosters to adults aged 50 and older, and certain immunocompromised individuals, post FDA’s authorization and recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These are likely to have driven the pharmacy performance in the United States in the to-be-reported quarter.In terms of COVID testing, in the fiscal third quarter, WBA completed 3.9 million in-store tests. The company’s expanded access to offering Pixel by Labcorp, and at-home PCR kits at no cost through curbside and in-store pickup has been seen to gain strong customer acceptance over the past few months. This, too, should have contributed to the top line in the fiscal fourth quarter.The U.S. retail business is likely to have gained from favorable retail comparable sales growth, as it did in the past few quarters. In terms of health and wellness, the company is expected to have registered positive outcomes on growing strength in at-home COVID-19 testing, and cough, cold and flu.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Walgreens’ United States revenues is pegged at $26.44 billion, suggesting a decline of 8.1% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.InternationalIn the last reported quarter, the international business registered an ongoing rebound and strong execution across its retail portfolio, particularly in Boots U.K. The trend is expected to have continued in the fiscal fourth quarter, driven by the strong demand for COVID-19 and monkeypox testing and vaccinations, online healthcare services, and beauty brands.

More than 200 stores nationwide have joined the movement. There's pressure on the coffee giant to engage that's growing from both workers, shareholders, and regulators. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan. With a broad state of play right now and in many ways, Friday was a big step--ALEXIS KEENAN: It was.AKIKO FUJITA: --in sort of resolving where we are.ALEXIS KEENAN: Yeah, so let's talk about what happened. But first, let's kind of look at the state of affairs for Starbucks and this unionization push by its baristas across its retail stores in the US. You have among its 900-- or 9,000, rather, corporate owned US stores, about 220 of them have unionized so far. Also, the number of union votes that have been held as of Thursday, 309 ballot counts, 248 of those ending in yes votes to unionize, 54 of those saying no, and 7 under a challenge right now.But Friday was significant, and there's two reasons for that. One is that it was the first time that workers in Arkansas have chosen to go ahead and petition to unionize. And that brings the number of states that actually have unionized stores to 38 among the 50 states. And it also, Friday, was the first time that the NLRB, the National Labor Relations Board, ruled that Starbucks illegally fired one of its workers. And that was for taking part in unionization activity.So that's kind of a big deal, right, for the Labor Board to say, for the first time, among a lot of complaints that have been filed-- there are 35 filed so far-- that, yes, Starbucks was in the wrong here. And as a consequence, what Starbucks is going to have to do is, it's going to, A, reinstate that employee's job, give that employee back pay, but also have a meeting with the Starbucks workers there. And this is Ann Arbor, Michigan, by the way.Story continuesThe Starbucks workers, its management, as well as government, has to take part in the talks, where it's going to have to read a notice about what exactly was illegal about its actions. So it's going to have to have this sort of mea culpa and get everybody together and say, these are your rights. Now, as for Starbucks' part, we reached out to Starbucks. We haven't heard back yet, but the company has told Bloomberg that these claims that were in this complaint for this Ann Arbor worker, they called them categorically false.So, just a lot of changes here for Starbucks. And the company is continuing to fight these challenges, these efforts by their workers across the country to unionize. So just a bit of pressure here, particularly on Friday. So kind of a big turn with this NLRB decision coming down.AKIKO FUJITA: And you talk about the various pressure points that are mounting against Starbucks. Another one coming from the New York City comptroller. What do we know about that?ALEXIS KEENAN: Right, so I will have to get back to you with more information on that. I haven't been focusing on that as much, Akiko. But certainly, the-- New York has wanted Starbucks to go ahead and follow the rules that the National Labor Relations Board lays out for these push-- these petitions by workers to follow what is required under law for these elections to take place.AKIKO FUJITA: OK, staying on top of it for us. Alexis Keenan, thanks so much for that.]"
66,06f4f6ba-843d-3c92-9e49-f77a1d24e861,SBUX,2022-10-11,Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Investors Are Less Pessimistic Than Expected,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/starbucks-corporation-nasdaq-sbux-investors-140023714.html,1665410423,STORY,['SBUX'],"[With a price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 24x Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) may be sending very bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 13x and even P/E's lower than 8x are not unusual. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.Recent times have been advantageous for Starbucks as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. See our latest analysis for Starbucks peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Starbucks.Is There Enough Growth For Starbucks?In order to justify its P/E ratio, Starbucks would need to produce outstanding growth well in excess of the market.Retrospectively, the last year delivered an exceptional 45% gain to the company's bottom line. EPS has also lifted 29% in aggregate from three years ago, mostly thanks to the last 12 months of growth. So we can start by confirming that the company has actually done a good job of growing earnings over that time.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 6.7% each year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 9.6% per year, which is noticeably more attractive.With this information, we find it concerning that Starbucks is trading at a P/E higher than the market. Apparently many investors in the company are way more bullish than analysts indicate and aren't willing to let go of their stock at any price. There's a good chance these shareholders are setting themselves up for future disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Starbucks' P/E?We'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.We've established that Starbucks currently trades on a much higher than expected P/E since its forecast growth is lower than the wider market. Right now we are increasingly uncomfortable with the high P/E as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support such positive sentiment for long. This places shareholders' investments at significant risk and potential investors in danger of paying an excessive premium.Don't forget that there may be other risks. For instance, we've identified 3 warning signs for Starbucks  (2 don't sit too well with us) you should be aware of.Of course, you might also be able to find a better stock than Starbucks. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that sit on P/E's below 20x and have grown earnings strongly.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?

(NYSE:PM) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Philip Morris International The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Philip Morris InternationalIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive Chairman of the Board, Andre Calantzopoulos, sold US$8.3m worth of shares at a price of US$111 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$84.00. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.In the last year Philip Morris International insiders didn't buy any company stock.

73,9b40c602-8f1f-375c-b771-6072728a98ba,PM,2022-10-11,Why Philip Morris (PM) Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-philip-morris-pm-could-161004236.html,1665418204,STORY,['PM'],"[If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report, you should consider Philip Morris (PM). This company, which is in the Zacks Tobacco industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.When looking at the last two reports, this seller of Marlboro and other cigarette brands has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 12.38%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the last reported quarter, Philip Morris came out with earnings of $1.48 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.24 per share, representing a surprise of 19.35%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.48 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.56 per share, delivering a surprise of 5.41%.Price and EPS SurpriseWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Philip Morris. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesPhilip Morris has an Earnings ESP of +0.58% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on October 20, 2022.When the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

78,045eea7c-eaf2-33f3-8476-9d3d373c24b6,GS,2022-10-11,"The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 74% of the company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-group-inc-nyse-120117654.html,1665489677,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD']","[If you want to know who really controls The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 74% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Goldman Sachs Group, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Goldman Sachs Group?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Goldman Sachs Group does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Goldman Sachs Group, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Goldman Sachs Group. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.4% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.1% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 6.3% of the company stock.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Goldman Sachs GroupThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$500m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 25% stake in Goldman Sachs Group. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

For a preview of what to expect, let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Semenova. These are always-- it's always a good bellwether, right, about where things are in terms of the economy. As we said, never been more uncertain.ALEXANDRA SEMENOVA: Yeah, absolutely, Akiko. Those four banks, among the six largest in the US by assets, are set to be the opening act of the earnings season, with Goldman Sachs and Bank of America set to release results next week. And some of the themes that we'll be watching closely are a slowdown in investment banking revenues, potential layoffs across their businesses, how demand for loans is holding up with higher interest rates, and any potential warnings about the economy that CEOs may deliver on earnings calls.And this quarter, profits are expected to shrink, especially compared to a really robust 2021 for Wall Street. Profits are also likely to take a hit from higher loan loss provisions. Those are funds set aside by banks for any potential sour loans if customers don't make their payments. The six largest US banks are estimated to set aside a collective $4.5 billion this quarter. That's according to a Financial Times report today. And this is also a turnaround from a year ago, when banks actually benefited from releasing those reserves, as we were recovering from the pandemic.One notable thing to note, too, is that banks typically benefit from higher interest rate environments. Those often give them a nice boost on their net interest income. But investment banking revenue is likely to offset that. And some other things to look out for, too, are any comments that bank executives make. Jamie Dimon is always an interesting one on his earnings calls with his storm cloud warnings. Credit Suisse and the broader-- what that means for the broader industry. And also Bank of America and Morgan Stanley are estimated to lose a combined $500 million on Elon Musk's Twitter deal.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, worth noting the bar pretty low, going into earnings season, not just within banks, but overall. Thanks so much for that. I know you're going to tracking those results really closely.]"

Yeah, we're going into the kitchen and into the well, wherever you're storing your ketchup and mustards at. Into the pantries, perhaps.After Goldman Sachs made a bullish call on the company, upgrading it to buy from neutral with a $43 price target. They're saying that this is one of the consumer staples out there where higher margins-- profit margins. It's not fully baked in at this point. So for anybody who's looking to stock up on some ketchups or some mustards, perhaps Kraft Heinz is that option.But there's so many other categories that Kraft Heinz has been able to really deliver for investors, especially as consumers are really monitoring where they can either buy in bulk, in some cases or just get that value that they had seen over many years. And you go back to some of the household names that have the largest brand equity. We'd seen that in some of the other fashion and apparel calls out there in the street, and Kraft Heinz is certainly one of those right now with the largest brand equity too.- Yeah, we told folks last week when those Conagra earnings numbers hit, we said, watch what they said. Look what they said on prices. They had a lot of success despite people becoming more mobile again, pushing through price increases. And that is the same theme that we are seeing in this upgrade from Kraft Heinz, which is, despite price increases, they're expecting all of these price increases that Kraft took-- just like Conagra, they are likely to stick in coming quarters.Now, that comes against a backdrop of CEO Miguel Patricio. Probably doesn't get enough credit for taking this-- getting this company off life support. Being-- I think he's past his two-year mark as CEO, but he's out there cutting a lot of costs from this business. So if you have higher prices, lower costs, that's a pretty good setup for profits.]"

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.75%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.32%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 0.1%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the world's largest oilfield services company had gained 7.41% over the past month. This has outpaced the Oils-Energy sector's gain of 1.45% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 8.4% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Schlumberger as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be October 21, 2022. In that report, analysts expect Schlumberger to post earnings of $0.54 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 50%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $7.12 billion, up 21.85% from the year-ago period.SLB's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $2.02 per share and revenue of $27.25 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +57.81% and +18.86%, respectively.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Schlumberger should also be noted by investors. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant. Schlumberger is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Story continuesValuation is also important, so investors should note that Schlumberger has a Forward P/E ratio of 21.12 right now. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 20.37, which means Schlumberger is trading at a premium to the group.We can also see that SLB currently has a PEG ratio of 0.54. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Oil and Gas - Field Services industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 0.65 as of yesterday's close.The Oil and Gas - Field Services industry is part of the Oils-Energy sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 36, which puts it in the top 15% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank includes is listed in order from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors.

He says the streaming giant's upcoming ad-supported tier is critical to accelerating revenue expanding Netflix's serviceable available market and driving greater profitability. Anmuth estimates there will be 7.5 million ad-supported subs in the US and Canada. That generates $1.2 billion in '23 and $4.6 billion in additional revenue by '26, a 13% upside.The JP Morgan analyst has a neutral rating on the stock, a $240 price target.

Morgan. The analyst said the streaming giant may attract over 7.5 billion subscribers to its ad-based tier for U.S. and Canada markets in 2023, which would translate to $600 million in ad sales. By 2026, the firm expects numbers to grow to 22 million subscribers  and $2.65 billion in ad sales.The equity sports a promising technical setup that could create even more tailwinds, after a recent pullback put the stock within one standard deviation of its 70-day moving average. According to data from Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, NFLX has seen five similar signals over the past three years. One month after 80% of these occurrences, the security was higher, averaging a 6.5% return. A similar move from its current perch would put Netflix stock above the $243 level, toppling pressure from the 150-day moving average.nflx oct 10Though NFLX is distancing itself from its May lows, with a floor emerging at the $220 region, it still has a ways to go if it wants to close the two massive bear gaps it suffered this year.

The stock sits just on the cusp of ""oversold,"" sporting a 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 31.Short-term options traders have been much more put-heavy than usual, and an unwinding of pessimism here could add an additional layer of support for the security.

Let's fire off a few calls on the day on this Monday morning. I'm locking-- I'm locking in on a good note out of JPMorgan on Netflix. Another note out here explaining the potential financial windfall from an ad-tier service, which Netflix is expect to launch next year.And they're correctly pointing out this-- this is analyst Doug Anmuth noting, quote, ""The Netflix narrative shifted from slow to no subscriber growth in the current business, to advertising and paid sharing coming in 2023."" And you can see that in the stock price, Netflix shares up about 22% in the past three months, has really caught fire. Overall, still down 63% year-to-date.But still, a lot of optimism around the financial potential of this ad service. Anmuth is putting this at potential almost $3 billion by 2026, and maybe 22 million subscribers, just on this ad service alone, by 2026. Next year, looking at a potential $600 million ad sales from the service.BRAD SMITH: Right, a tier that they moved up, in terms of the launch. And saying, now, we're pointing now to November to actually bring the launch into market. And it's really going to be a question of when the subscribers really kind of en-mass start to latch onto what that new offering could give them, in terms of an experience that is lower price. Perhaps, yeah, you're still gonna get some ads. We know that, of course.But that's been successful for launch of even the streaming landscape years back. We think back 10 years ago, even when Hulu had some of their ad-supported tiers, that's really what got some of the introductory members into these streaming services back then.And so now for Netflix, knowing that they've already really capitalized on that high end of pricing mechanisms, now it's just trying to retain and not churn as many users. And so we could see potentially some of those users kind of downgrading the pricing, at least, that they're willing to pay at this point.Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: I mean, the expectations game for Netflix has been the like roller coaster. It's been so fascinating, right.? As you mentioned, at the beginning, like really people not expecting anything from the company. And now, as modeling for its ad platform has leaked, we've seen the expectations really go back up again. So it's hard to see where this goes, if it's really gonna meet or exceed those new more sanguine estimates.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, it's a big tailwind that didn't exist for Netflix coming into this year, that's for sure.JULIE HYMAN: Yes.BRAD SMITH: They're gonna have to compete as well. Disney even looking at exploring some of their own ad-supported tiers within Disney+. That could be a major competitor for a company that's already seen massive subscription adoption and has quickly catapulted itself into one of the most powerful streaming services. And that's even pre-""a massive bundle"" from Disney, too]"

Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely to see if they had a hand to play in the recent price move. In this article, we decided to focus on TJX Companies'  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for TJX Companies How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for TJX Companies is:62% = US$3.4b ÷ US$5.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.62 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.TJX Companies' Earnings Growth And 62% ROETo begin with, TJX Companies has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 30% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Needless to say, we are quite surprised to see that TJX Companies' net income shrunk at a rate of 2.6% over the past five years. We reckon that there could be some other factors at play here that are preventing the company's growth. For example, it could be that the company has a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance.Story continuesSo, as a next step, we compared TJX Companies' performance against the industry and were disappointed to discover that while the company has been shrinking its earnings, the industry has been growing its earnings at a rate of 31% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is TJX fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is TJX Companies Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?In spite of a normal three-year median payout ratio of 38% (that is, a retention ratio of 62%), the fact that TJX Companies' earnings have shrunk is quite puzzling. It looks like there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.Moreover, TJX Companies has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 37% of its profits over the next three years. As a result, TJX Companies' ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 68% for future ROE.SummaryOverall, we feel that TJX Companies certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a high ROE and and a high reinvestment rate. We believe that there might be some outside factors that could be having a negative impact on the business. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future.

(NASDAQ:AMGN), the pharmaceutical company focused on biotechnology-based therapeutics, was also a top contributor for the quarter. The company reported solid results, with a variety of products, such as bone-strengthening drugs Prolia and EVENITY, contributing to overall revenue growth. Amgen continued to increase the market share for cholesterol drug Repatha (a catalyst we had originally identified), delivering record quarterly sales as the drug’s usage expands with high-risk patients who have not yet had a cardiovascular event, and as barriers for prescribers, healthcare systems and patients are removed. In addition, we believe the company is poised to gain market share with its biosimilars (akin to generic versions of biologic drugs), also a previously identified catalyst. Biosimilars accounted for over $2 billion in revenue in 2021, and we believe this has the potential to more than double by the end of the decade, accelerated by six additional biosimilars (for a total of 11 products on the market). This includes the upcoming launch in the U.S. of arthritis treatment Amjetiva in January 2023. Meanwhile, the company is advancing its robust pipeline of early- and late-stage assets, with several phase III results due this year. These developments have caused us to remain enthusiastic about Amgen’s ability to build on its decades of success developing novel treatments using biopharmaceuticals.”Pressmaster/Shutterstock.comStory continuesAmgen Inc.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, click 5 Best Gold Mining Stocks to Buy Now. As per a Bloomberg report dated October 9, investors in the West are dumping their gold assets, while Asians see the tumbling prices as a buying opportunity and are loading up on cheap gold jewelry and bullion. Aggressive interest rate hikes make gold less attractive as an investment vehicle, which is why a large amount of gold is making its way from the West to meet the rising demand in Shanghai and Istanbul, among other Asian countries. Given logistical constraints, precious metals are not reaching the East fast enough. Resultantly, gold and silver are trading at extraordinarily high premiums in some Asian markets, compared to the global benchmark rates. As Asians snap up large quantities of gold when the rate weakens in the West, the global prices remain somewhat stable. Upon a rally in precious metals, gold usually makes its way back to Western countries as Asians cash out. Gold plummeted to under $1,700 per ounce last week, as per reports on October 10. Jittery traders are seeking refuge in the US dollar amid fears that intense monetary policies by global central banks will push major world economies into a recession. As investors seek out interest-paying investments like high-yield bonds, there is a buying opportunity in gold in order to benefit from a future rally. Some of the best gold mining stocks include Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE:KGC), and B2Gold Corp. (NYSE:BTG). Our Methodology We selected the following gold mining stocks based on growth fundamentals, dividend profiles, positive analyst coverage, and strong hedge fund sentiment as of June 2022. We have arranged the list of the best gold mining stocks according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. 12 Best Gold Mining Stocks to Buy NowPhoto by Ricardo Gomez Angel on UnsplashBest Gold Mining Stocks to Buy Now12.

After declining 33% from the beginning of the year, we purchased SSR Mining, an intermediate gold company with four producing mines located in the United States, Turkey, Canada, and Argentina. In 2021, the company expects to produce 720,000 to 800,000 gold-equivalent ounces with all-in sustaining costs of $1,050 to $1,110 per ounce. At current gold prices, we expect SSR Mining to generate meaningful free cash flow this year, adding to its cash balance. Currently, the company’s balance sheet is very strong and liquid with $470 million in net cash, $1.2 billion in net working capital, and $3.9 billion in tangible book value.

Life During and After Superstorm Sandy,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/storm-hit-life-during-superstorm-131000016.html,1665407400,STORY,['PEG'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / October 10, 2022 / Right before Superstorm Sandy hit the state of New Jersey, I remember getting a call from my wife Valerie. ""Will this storm hit us?"" she asked, nervous and 6 months pregnant with our twin sons.Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG), Monday, October 10, 2022, Press release picture""Yes right up the middle of the state,"" I responded. At the time, I was the planner for the Metropolitan Division and was responsible for all the circuits in the division, including circuit design and managing circuit load. Although we were given a warning about five days before Sandy came in, we couldn't have predicated the extreme damage that would result from the storm.That was the beginning of a journey that involved 15 straight 16-hour overnight shifts. The first night shift is always the hardest. Sometimes, you're up for 30 hours. Your body has to adjust to being up at night and sleeping during the day. It didn't help that when I went home there was no power.Like many others, my home's power went out right after Sandy hit, and it was out for almost two weeks. Thankfully, my wife was able to stay with her aunt who had only lost power for two days. I was glad my wife was able to go somewhere familiar, safe and that had power for all her needs during pregnancy. As for me, after my shift, I would go home and use candles for light. The only thing we had for heat was hot water, so I would shower for warmth and then curl up in three blankets to sleep until my next shift.That pattern continued for the next 15 days as we worked to restore our customers. My main responsibility was reviewing the outages and creating materials packets for the Mutual Aid crews that contained maps and information about damages at specific locations. Many roads were flooded and gas was hard to come by, with long lines at all the gas stations. Eventually, I had to get a hotel room because the job site was almost 90 minutes away from my home.Hard work, a lot of coffee, and team work that got me through that storm. It wasn't until mid-November that I was working normal shifts again. It was such an intense period. It was only 15 days, but it felt like months.Story continuesMy house got power back the second week of November. Unfortunately, right after we got power back there was a huge snowstorm, a nor'easter, which knocked the power out once again.To top it off, as things were starting to return to normal - around Thanksgiving - my wife went into premature labor at only 33 weeks pregnant. There was another snow storm that morning, so it took me almost three hours to get to the hospital. The boys, Sean and Bryan, were almost seven weeks premature and had to spend 15 days in the NICU. Fifteen seems to have been our number in 2012.I'm grateful to have worked for PSE&amp;G for 21 years, starting as an intern right out of college at New Jersey Institute of Technology. I always feel like my bosses are looking out for my career and my family. When my sons were born, PSE&amp;G was extremely supportive. Along with the twins, my wife was in the hospital after the birth of our sons because there were some complications. I was allowed to work some days from home, this was far before work from home was even thought of. It's hard to work a normal eight-plus hour day and have time to go to the hospital. Thankfully, the boys are doing great now, and they're even learning to ride bikes.Today, I work storms as operations support. It's amazing how many different people you meet, and the comradery in the late shifts is great. You're there every day for 16 hours, working to restore customer's power. Those late shifts through a storm, sometimes feel like going through a war together. Going through the storms is like a badge of honor. But we do it, because at the end of the day, we want to help customers.Learn more about PSE&amp;G hereView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG) on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG)Website: http://www.pseg.comEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG)View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/719614/Will-the-Storm-Hit-Life-During-and-After-Superstorm-Sandy]"

It had shed 1.4% against the yuan to 8.78 , a near three-week low.""During the session we expect continued pressure on the rouble against the backdrop of lower supply of foreign currency from exporters,"" Banki.ru analyst Bogdan Zvarich said in a note.The rouble has been supported by capital controls and a collapse in imports since Western sanctions were imposed over Russia's actions in Ukraine and companies left the market in droves.Addressing parliament on Tuesday, Bank of Russia Deputy Governor Alexei Zabotkin said that capital controls, which have been partially eased since Russia sent troops into Ukraine, could be brought back in full ""if acute risks to financial stability materialise again"".Already blighted by Western sanctions, Russia's economy now faces a more self-inflicted blow, with President Vladimir Putin's military mobilisation drive threatening to undermine productivity, demand and recovery.Promsvyazbank analyst Yevgeny Loktyukhov pointed to escalation in Ukraine and a pullback in oil prices as a reason for the rouble's slide.Brent crude oil, a global benchmark for Russia's main export, was down 2.3% at $94.0 a barrel at 1410 GMT.Russian stock indexes, which were dragged sharply lower by Gazprom in the previous session, were mixed.The dollar-denominated RTS index shed 1% to 954.0 points, while the rouble-based MOEX Russian index was up 1.2% at 1,939.3 points.Excluding Gazprom, the market was gaining for the second day running, said Dmitry Skryabin, portfolio manager at Alfa Capital.The European Union's eighth sanctions package had turned out to be less severe than expected in terms of a ban on ferrous metals products, he added.

That simple,"" Dominic Schnider told CNBC.Crude oil could hit $125 a barrel as Russia's response to a US-led price cap plan threatens to tighten the global market even further, a top UBS commodities strategist has said.Moscow has said it's prepared to cut its oil output if the G7 nations carry through with the price cap, warning the measure will end up primarily hurting those behind the plan.Dominic Schnider, head of commodities at UBS Global Wealth Management, said that could pull another 1 million barrels a day at a time when the oil market is already facing a supply squeeze from the OPEC+ decision to slash its production targets.""The Russians were clear: 'If you force us to accept the price cap, we're simply not going to deliver crude to you,"" Schnider said in a Tuesday interview with CNBC,""And so I think that kind of situation means, maybe, from a global supply perspective, there's an additional 1 million barrels at risk here.""As we get further draws, you're going to see prices going up. That simple. And we're looking at $110-$125, that's for us our point of gravity when it comes to crude oil,"" he added.Brent crude futures were down about 2% at $94.24 at last check Tuesday, thanks to worries that a recession and a fresh COVID-19 breakout in China will hit demand. US benchmark WTI crude futures were 2.4% lower at $88.97.The G7 nations — Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, and the US — have agreed to set a price cap on Russian oil in an effort to target Moscow's revenues and curb its ability to fund its war against Ukraine.But they face a tough task in persuading the likes of China and India, both big buyers of Russian crude, to join up to the price cap plan.Story continuesMeanwhile, the US is caught up in growing hostilities with OPEC+ and its de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, after the producer group last week decided to cut output by 2 million barrels a day.The move is seen as a snub to the Biden administration's efforts to stem price rises for oil, and therefore US gasoline — and led to the White House accusing OPEC+ of ""aligning with Russia"".Schnider agreed that the OPEC+ cuts are likely to push oil prices higher over the coming months, which would then make the G7's push to impose a Russian oil price cap by the end of 2022 more difficult.While the group is still ironing out the details of the price cap, such as penalties for those who don't adopt it, officials have floated a range of $40-$60 a barrel.""It complicates. I mean, Europe still wants to get rid of some — depending on how you calculate — oil and products. That means it's between two-and-a-half and up to three million barrels. You need to find these barrels. That's number one,"" Schnider said.""We are still quite concerned if that kind of rotation in trade flows — how is that going to really work out? Because the Russians were clear,"" he added.But he noted that the US still has some options to help ease the tightness in the market, which includes tapping into its Strategic Petroleum Reserve for additional releases of oil.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

(NYSE:LPI) institutional owners must be relieved by the recent gain",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/losing-15-past-laredo-petroleum-105049429.html,1665485449,STORY,['CL=F'],"[A look at the shareholders of Laredo Petroleum, Inc. (NYSE:LPI) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 81% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Last week's US$110m market cap gain would probably be appreciated by institutional investors, especially after a year of 15% losses.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Laredo Petroleum, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Laredo Petroleum ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Laredo Petroleum?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Laredo Petroleum does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Laredo Petroleum's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Laredo Petroleum. The company's largest shareholder is BlackRock, Inc., with ownership of 14%. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.9% and 6.7% of the stock. Furthermore, CEO Mikell Pigott is the owner of 0.7% of the company's shares.On further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 10 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.Story continuesWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Laredo PetroleumWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.We can report that insiders do own shares in Laredo Petroleum, Inc.. It is a pretty big company, so it is generally a positive to see some potentially meaningful alignment. In this case, they own around US$25m worth of shares (at current prices). If you would like to explore the question of insider alignment, you can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 12% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Public Company OwnershipPublic companies currently own 4.5% of Laredo Petroleum stock. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 5 warning signs for Laredo Petroleum (1 is potentially serious!) that you should be aware of before investing here.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do.

There, you're taking a look at some of those casino stocks. Whether it's Sands or Wynn Resorts, all of them are down this morning, early in trade.Melco Resorts, MGM Resorts also lower here, as we're seeing some mixed major averages here. But what was also pointed out within this for Citigroup, they cut their estimate for the gaming revenue in October to 5.5 billion [INAUDIBLE]-- I believe I pronounced that correctly-- from 7 billion, citing some of the disappointing revenue that I mentioned during the first nine days of this month.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, there's a lot of hope that you've got reopening happening in China slowly, but surely, and some of the restrictions on Macau have been removed. So then it's a disappointment here that there would be this kind of a cut to the forecast here. And that's what the folks over at Citigroup are saying. They say despite the solid National Day Golden Week visitation, recovery was probably impacted by the recent COVID-19 outbreak in China. So it just continues to be a problem for hospitality, and in particular, for gaming in Macau.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, I'll just quickly mention in this sphere, too, of gaming, I'm watching sports, the sports betting space this week. There's a key conference later in the week. DraftKings CEO Jason Robins will be speaking at this conference. To my knowledge, this would be his first public comments perhaps on anything related to Disney and ESPN. That popped the stock last week. I'd put that on the watch list.JULIE HYMAN: And you also have to wonder, many of those other companies that we just mentioned also have sports betting, digital betting. So we'll see if this, then, helps them recover a little bit from some of the declines today.]"

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Zoetis (NYSE:ZTS). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. View our latest analysis for Zoetis How Quickly Is Zoetis Increasing Earnings Per Share?Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Zoetis managed to grow EPS by 16% per year, over three years. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Zoetis maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 7.9% to US$8.0b. That's a real positive.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.

So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for Zoetis?Are Zoetis Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$69b company like Zoetis. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. As a matter of fact, their holding is valued at US$49m. That shows significant buy-in, and may indicate conviction in the business strategy. Even though that's only about 0.07% of the company, it's enough money to indicate alignment between the leaders of the business and ordinary shareholders.Story continuesShould You Add Zoetis To Your Watchlist?One positive for Zoetis is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists. Don't forget that there may still be risks.

Zoetis’ inclusion on the list is based on the company’s African Livestock Productivity and Health Advancement (A.L.P.H.A.) initiative, which recently celebrated five years of progress establishing and developing sustainable veterinary care including access to vaccines, medicines and diagnostic services in Sub-Saharan Africa. Zoetis ranked 20th in the list of 50 companies, according to Fortune.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221010005414/en/""Being recognized by Fortune is a proud moment for Zoetis and affirms the impact we can have by living our purpose to nurture the world and humankind by advancing animal care,"" said Jeannette Ferran Astorga, Executive Vice President, Corporate Affairs, Communications and Sustainability at Zoetis. ""As part of our Driven to Care long-term sustainability goals, we are growing access to veterinary care in emerging markets, and our progress in Sub-Saharan Africa is helping achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for No Poverty, Zero Hunger and Gender Equality, among others.""In June of this year, Zoetis reported 5 years of progress for its A.L.P.H.A. initiative, including:91 innovative veterinary products now commercially available in Sub-Saharan Africa – a vast improvement from 2017 when only four products were commercially available in the region128 million animals treated – 124 million chickens and 4 million cows16 diagnostic laboratories fully operational with trained personnelMore than 26,000 farmers, veterinarians and para-veterinarians trained on veterinary care (approximately 30% of whom are women)Story continuesLivestock are an essential asset to rural communities and critical to achieving food security in regions with high incidence of livestock and human disease. Sub-Saharan Africa has one of the highest rates of food insecurity and some of the highest human population growth rates in the world. Two-thirds of the global extreme poor live in Sub-Saharan Africa, and smallholder farming is their main source of livelihood, with livestock providing up to 45% of these families’ total income. With over 20% of animal production losses linked to diseases globally, access to quality animal healthcare is vital to protecting not only farmers’ livelihoods, but also the region’s limited natural resources. Animal health is extremely important in contributing to sustainable economic development goals and business opportunities in the region, and Zoetis is committed to continuing to make a positive impact by improving access to critical veterinary products and services and supporting an infrastructure for quality animal healthcare.The Change the World list recognizes companies that have had a positive social impact through activities that are part of their core business strategy. As nominees are assessed, the most important factors are:Measurable social impact: The reach, nature, and durability of the company’s impact on one or more specific societal problems.Business results: The benefit the socially impactful work brings to the company. Profitability and contribution to shareholder value outweigh benefits to the company’s reputation.Degree of innovation: How innovative the company’s effort is relative to that of others in its industry and whether other companies have followed its example or partnered with it.Zoetis was named to Fast Company’s list of Most Innovative Companies for 2022 in March and is among Newsweek Magazine's America's Most Responsible Companies 2022 list. In June 2022, Zoetis shared its 2021 Sustainability Progress Update and ESG and SASB Index. The company will continue to share updates on its sustainability activities, including progress against its Driven to Care goals, and report annually.About ZoetisAs the world’s leading animal health company, Zoetis is driven by a singular purpose: to nurture our world and humankind by advancing care for animals. After 70 years innovating ways to predict, prevent, detect, and treat animal illness, Zoetis continues to stand by those raising and caring for animals worldwide, from livestock farmers to veterinarians and pet owners. The company’s leading portfolio and pipeline of medicines, vaccines, diagnostics and technologies make a difference in over 100 countries.

There are currently  65 names on this prestigious list.While there is no question the 65 Dividend Aristocrats have staying power, that doesn’t necessarily mean they qualify for the best dividend stocks of all time. To my mind, it’s not just about increasing the annual dividend payment but also about delivering market-beating total returns. So, for this article, I started with the 65 Dividend Aristocrats and whittled down the list to a manageable 10. To make the cut, the companies on this list must have a 10-year annualized total return greater than the entire U.S. market. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLOWLowe’s$197.21SPGIS&amp;P Global$304.84ADPAutomatic Data Processing$227.12SHWSherwin-Williams$205.62ITWIllinois Tool Works$187.35HRLHormel Foods$44.55APDAir Products &amp; Chemicals$231.82ADMArcher-Daniels-Midland$85.47NUENucor$115.01BDXBecton Dickinson$222.66Best Dividend Stocks: Lowe’s (LOW)the front of a Lowe's storeSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.comLowe’s (NYSE:LOW) has increased its annual dividend for 48 consecutive years. Its 10-year annualized total return is 21.18% through Oct. 6, 1,131 basis points higher than the entire U.S. market. It currently yields 2.1%. It’s been a little over four years since Lowe’s appointed Marvin Ellison as its CEO. Since he took the helm in July 2018, LOW stock is up 107% compared to 35% for the S&amp;P 500. Ellison jumped over to the home improvement retailer from JCPenney, where he was attempting to turn the department store around. Before that, he spent 12 years at Home Depot (NYSE:HD), where he was in charge of its U.S. stores. In its Q2 2022 press release, the company stated that it repurchased $4 billion of its stock during the quarter, paying an average price of $185.19. It’s already made money on its buyback.  Story continuesS&amp;P Global (SPGI)A photo of stock prices on a digital screen with a city street reflected in the glass and visible in the left side of the image; market pricesSource: katjen/ShutterStock.comS&amp;P Global (NYSE:SPGI) has increased its annual dividend for 49 consecutive years. Its 10-year annualized total return is 19.75% through Oct. 6, 988 basis points higher than the entire U.S. market. It currently yields 1.1%. S&amp;P Global has been one of my favorite stocks to recommend in recent years. I included SPGI in a list of stocks to buy for the next 15 years in October 2021. It used to be called McGraw-Hill until the company sold off its McGraw-Hill Education subsidiary in November 2012 and subsequently changed its name to S&amp;P Global. It’s been uphill ever since. When most people think of S&amp;P Global, they probably think of its ratings business, which saw revenue decrease 26% year over year in the second quarter. Or they think of indices such as the S&amp;P 500, which had a good quarter, with revenue up 22% year over year. Thanks in part to its merger with IHS Markit, total Q2 revenue increased 42% to $3 billion. On a pro forma basis, revenue declined 5%. Adjusted net income fell 11% to $955 million. You can be sure before too long, S&amp;P Global will do something about IHS Markit’s lower margins. Best Dividend Stocks: Automatic Data Processing (ADP)In this photo illustration the stock market information of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. displays on a smartphone with the logo of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. ADP stock.Source: IgorGolovniov / ShutterstockAutomatic Data Processing (NYSE:ADP) has increased its annual dividend for 47 consecutive years. Its 10-year annualized total return is 16.49% through Oct. 6, 662 basis points higher than the entire U.S. market. It currently yields 1.8%. There are 21 analysts currently covering ADP stock. Most analysts have a “hold” rating on shares with an average target price of $246.71, just 8.6% higher than where the stock is currently trading.Don’t be alarmed by this, though. Demand for the products and services the company offers — payroll management and human capital management — isn’t going away. That’s why ADP is expected to earn $8.02 a share in 2022 and $8.93 in 2023. That means shares are trading at 25.4x 2023 earnings. At first glance, this multiple probably seems high. However, it’s less than the stock’s five-year average of around 30x forward earnings.  ADP has one of the best 10-year total returns of the Dividend Aristocrats. That says something.Sherwin-Williams (SHW)A Sherwin-Williams (SHW) sign in Richfield, Minnesota.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comSherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW) has increased its annual dividend for 44 consecutive years. Its 10-year annualized total return is 16.05% through Oct. 6, 618 basis points higher than the entire U.S. market. It currently yields 1.1%. On Sept. 15, Sherwin-Williams announced that it was partnering with the Hollywood Sign Trust to give the Hollywood sign a makeover to celebrate its 100th anniversary in 2023. It’s been over a decade since the company last touched up the 45-foot-high sign. Only a paint company as good as Sherwin-Williams would get this plum assignment.SHW stock is down 41% year to date, in part because of lackluster profits. Second-quarter adjusted net income was $2.41 per share, 9.1% less than a year earlier. Higher material costs and supply chain issues cut into profits. Its gross margin in the quarter was 41.7%, 310 basis points less than a year earlier.Sherwin-Williams stock hasn’t traded this low since August 2020. Its price-to-sales ratio is 2.8x. It hasn’t been this low since 2019. Despite headwinds, the company still expects to earn $8.65 in 2022 at the midpoint of its guidance.  Best Dividend Stocks: Illinois Tool Works (ITW)Illinois Tool Works (ITW) logo magnified while being displayed on a web browserSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comIllinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW) has increased its annual dividend for 58 consecutive years. Its 10-year annualized total return is 13.94% through Oct. 6, 407 basis points higher than the entire U.S. market. It currently yields 2.7% after upping its quarterly dividend payout by 7% in August to $1.31 per share.The industrial conglomerate’s goals are straightforward. It expects organic annual revenue growth of 3%-5%, 28% operating margins, 7%-10% annual EPS growth, and to convert 100% or more of its net income to free cash flow. Illinois Tool Works’ diversification is second to none. It has seven operating segments. All seven account for at least 10% of its 2021 revenue of $14.5 billion. For 2022, the company expects $15.7 billion in revenue at the midpoint of its guidance with a free cash flow conversion rate of 85% to 95% of net income.Hormel Foods (HRL)Hormel Foods Logo shown on a laptop screen behind a phone screen also showing the logo.

Its 10-year annualized total return is 13.4% through Oct. 6, 353 basis points higher than the entire U.S. market. It currently yields 2.3%. I don’t know if Spam’s resurgence is a sign of how expensive food has gotten or if it really is tastier than I imagined. Hormel recently said it is on pace to sell a record amount of Spam for the eighth straight year. It turns out it’s trendy in Hawaiian, Asian and Pacific Island cuisine. Who knew?Spam is part of the company’s grocery products division. For its fiscal third quarter, ended July 31, the division’s sales increased 24.5% year over year to $869.8 million. Spam had something to do with the increase. However, the company’s refrigerated foods business continues to generate the most revenue, accounting for 55% of sales in the most recently reported quarter. In the years ahead, Hormel plans to grow its business outside the United States. International sales currently account for less than 6% of overall revenue.  All in all, this is a stable performer in good times and bad.

The facility can produce up to 35 metric tons per day. In addition, the site will handle liquid hydrogen distribution and dispensing operations. This is part of the company’s commitment to spend $30 billion in capital over 10 years, ending in 2027. It also has a goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by one-third by 2030.Analysts expect the company’s earnings to increase 14% this year to $10.29 per share and 10.8% in 2023 to $11.40 per share.Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) logo on sign at office campusSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comArcher-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) has increased its annual dividend for 49 consecutive years.

It currently yields 2%. Archer-Daniels-Midland and agriculture go together like peanut butter and jelly. It’s hard to imagine the agriculture industry without the company. On Sept. 30, Archer-Daniels-Midland celebrated 120 years in business.“Over the past 120 years, our company has evolved from a regional startup into an irreplaceable leader providing needed nutrition to billions around the globe. We’ve transformed at many moments along the way, but unlocking the power of nature to enrich lives has always been at the heart of everything we do,” ADM CEO Juan Luciano said in a press release. The best reason to invest in ADM is that it continues to improve its operations. By 2025, it expects to grow earnings in the high single digits each year, with a minimum 10% return on invested capital and dividend payout ratio of 30% to 40%.As long as Archer-Daniels-Midland continues to grow, ADM stock should outperform the index over the next 10 years.Best Dividend Stocks: Nucor (NUE)Nucor logo close-up on website page.

That says a lot about the strength of its business.If you’re reading this article, you’re a fan of dividend stocks. However, dividends are just part of the rewards companies give to their shareholders. Share repurchases are also important. The steelmaker repurchased $2.7 billion of its stock during the first three quarters of the year. The Motley Fool’s Howard Smith notes that, over the past 24 months, Nucor has lowered its share count by 15%. That means if you owned 1% of a company with 100 million shares outstanding before a 15% share count reduction, you now own 1.2% after the buybacks without spending a dime.On Sept. 15, the company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 to be paid to shareholders on Nov. 10. It is the company’s 198th consecutive quarterly cash dividend. That sounds even more impressive than 49 years. Also, in September, the company said 2022 would be the most profitable year in its history.

Its 10-year annualized total return is 12.34% through Oct. 6, 247 basis points higher than the entire U.S. market. It currently yields 1.5%. When I think of Becton Dickinson, I think of the allergy shots I got every week as a kid. You couldn’t miss the BD logo on the side of the needle. While I’m glad I no longer get those shots, it’s a part of the company’s history — and a profitable one. However, the healthcare giant has changed immensely since then. On Oct. 5, BD announced a collaboration with The Ottawa Hospital that will improve the quality of patient care by creating the first “smart hospital” in Ontario. I’m originally from Ontario, so I’m interested in this development. In February, BD published a blog post that discussed how connecting smart devices could enhance patient care through an integrated medication management system. According to the post, more than 7 million patients yearly in the U.S. are impacted by medication errors. It is estimated these errors cost hospitals and other healthcare facilities more than $40 billion annually.The company’s software harnesses data to ensure safeguards are implemented to reduce these errors. The Ottawa Hospital gets to see this up close and personal.

(NYSE:NEE) over the past 12 months. An insider's optimism about the company's prospects is a positive sign.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for NextEra Energy NextEra Energy Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe insider James Robo made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$5.0m worth of shares at a price of US$77.26 each. That means that even when the share price was higher than US$76.73 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares. It is generally more encouraging if they paid above the current price, as it suggests they saw value, even at higher levels.While NextEra Energy insiders bought shares during the last year, they didn't sell. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below.

So if that suits your style you could check each stock one by one or you could take a look at this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Does NextEra Energy Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that NextEra Energy insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$255m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The NextEra Energy Insider Transactions Indicate?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded NextEra Energy shares in the last quarter. However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening. It would be great to see more insider buying, but overall it seems like NextEra Energy insiders are reasonably well aligned (owning significant chunk of the company's shares) and optimistic for the future. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 17. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.10 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +5.8%.Revenues are expected to be $4.18 billion, up 3.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.85% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation?For The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.15%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation would post earnings of $1.12 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.15, delivering a surprise of +2.68%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, Citigroup (C) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.56 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -27.4%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $18.47 billion, up 7.7% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Citigroup has been revised 1.1% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -7.40%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Citigroup will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The French government said last week that it had tapped its strategic fuel reserves to resupply stations that had run dry.France's largest sugar maker Tereos said last month it had to slow output at some factories after TotalEnergies said it would be unable to supply diesel. It declined to comment on the strategic stock release.Cristal Union, France's second largest producer, said its own fuel stocks had allowed it to maintain production rates last week, but that it had used strategic reserves over the weekend.Sugar factories, which usually run from September to late January or early February in France, rely on farmers having enough fuel to harvest sugar beet and transport it to a factory to be processed.The decision to release strategic stocks late last week followed a meeting between sugar producers and French Agriculture Minister Marc Fesneau last Wednesday.""We explained that there were worrying tensions that risked leading to temporary factory closures,"" SNFS Chairman Christian Spiegeleer told Reuters.""The state agreed to tap the strategic stocks so that the lack of diesel does not affect the factories' proper functioning,"" he added.The French Agriculture Ministry had no immediate comment.(Reporting by Sybille de La Hamaide; Editing by Alexander Smith)]"

133,2b044bac-2a69-3cab-8a10-beb2b22792b8,MA,2022-10-11,Are Investors Undervaluing Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) By 35%?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-undervaluing-mastercard-incorporated-nyse-140027287.html,1665410427,STORY,['MA'],"[How far off is Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Mastercard The MethodWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$12.3bUS$14.4bUS$15.9bUS$17.8bUS$19.2bUS$20.4bUS$21.4bUS$22.3bUS$23.0bUS$23.7bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x6Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 7.95%Est @ 6.15%Est @ 4.89%Est @ 4%Est @ 3.38%Est @ 2.95% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.3% US$11.5kUS$12.7kUS$13.2kUS$14.0kUS$14.2kUS$14.2kUS$14.0kUS$13.7kUS$13.3kUS$12.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$134bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 1.9%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$24b× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (6.3%– 1.9%) = US$558bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$558b÷ ( 1 + 6.3%)10= US$304bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$438b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$295, the company appears quite undervalued at a 35% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Mastercard as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.021. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

The selloff spread to the foreign-exchange market as investors tallied up the damage from the sweeping curbs the US is imposing on companies that conduct technology business with China.The Biden administration measures erect barriers of entry to China’s market by limiting the ability of US firms to sell equipment and tech to their Chinese counterparts. There are concerns that the restrictions could spread if Washington widens the initiative to include other countries, while questions also remain over the scope and final impact of the moves.“It is difficult to call a bottom on the performance of the chip sector,” said Gary Dugan, chief executive officer of the Global CIO Office. “The big story is that the West is becoming profoundly more concerned about security around any form of technology. We see no reason to re-enter the sector for the moment despite the profound poor performance.”US chip stocks were on track to decline for a third day, with Nvidia Corp., Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Qualcomm Inc. and Texas Instruments Inc. all down more than 1% before the bell. Chip-tool maker ASML Holding NV traded down 2.3% in Amsterdam, bringing three-day losses to more than 11%.The US measures include restrictions on the export of some types of chips used in artificial intelligence and supercomputing, and also tighter rules on the sale of semiconductor equipment to any Chinese company. Washington also added more Chinese firms to a list of companies that it regards as “unverified,” which means US suppliers will face new hurdles in selling technologies to those entities.Story continuesThe US announced the export curbs Friday, and there have been suggestions that similar actions may be deployed in other countries to ensure international cooperation. The announcement spurred a two-day rout of over 9% in the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index that saw it close Monday at its lowest level since November 2020. Markets in Korea, Japan and Taiwan were shut that day for holidays.Samsung lost as much as 3.9%, the most in a year. South Korea’s SK Hynix Inc., one of the world’s largest makers of memory chips that has facilities in China -- is part of a supply network that sends components around the world. Its shares slid 3.5% before paring losses.The current rout has already wiped out more than $240 billion from chip stocks worldwide since Thursday’s close, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The selloff extended to currency markets, with the South Korean won sliding as much as 1.8% versus the greenback while the Taiwan dollar declined 0.7%.The curbs are a “big setback to China” and “bad news” for global semiconductors, Nomura Holdings Inc. analyst David Wong wrote in a note Monday. China’s localization efforts may also be “at risk as it may not be able to use advanced foundries in Taiwan and Korea,” he wrote.The US measures seek to stop China’s drive to develop its own chip industry and advance its military capabilities. The impact could extend well beyond semiconductors and into industries that rely on high-end computing, from electric vehicles and aerospace to gadgets like smartphones.The fallout is already being felt. KLA Corp. will stop offering some supplies and services from Wednesday to China-based customers including SK Hynix to comply with the recent US regulations, Reuters reported, citing a person familiar with the situation.Shares of Chinese chipmakers extended their recent losses on Tuesday, with Morgan Stanley saying that the broader restrictions around supercomputers and multinational capital investment in China could be “disruptive.”Chinese state media and officials have responded to Biden’s move in recent days, warning of economic consequences and stirring speculation about potential retaliation.“With the latest measure, it would become difficult for China to manufacture and develop semiconductors because most semiconductor equipment are dominated by US and its allies,” such as Japan and Netherlands, Chae Minsook, an analyst at Korea Investment &amp; Securities, wrote in a report. “It is impossible to maintain the chip industry without adopting advanced equipments.”(Updates throughout)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekA Digital Drive to Reform the $11 Trillion Global Gold MarketExxon’s Exodus: Employees Have Finally Had Enough of Its Toxic CultureThis Is What the Gas Station of the Future Will Look LikeHow Gamers Beat NFTsTaking ‘Abrasive’ and ‘Nice’ Out of Performance Reviews©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

139,0372b1b3-ed7d-34b8-abd6-8abbb91f3255,LMT,2022-10-11,12 Best Bear Market Stocks to Buy Now,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-best-bear-market-stocks-131417536.html,1665407657,STORY,"['EPD', 'LMT', 'KO', 'DKL', 'CAG', 'RTX', 'UAN', 'BRK-B', 'WMT']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the twelve best bear market stocks to buy now. For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Bear Market Stocks to Buy Now. The ongoing hawkish interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and inflationary pressures from high oil prices and the Russian invasion of Ukraine have decimated the stock market and led to a bearish rally that has resulted in major stock indexes bleeding one third of their value year to date just as they had started to recover from the coronavirus pandemic.Such an environment merits a cautious investment approach and careful stock picking, as it requires the investor to sift out companies with stable cash flows or products that are expected to withstand recessionary pressures. The latter is especially important since interest rate hikes will lead to a recession - and analysts right now only differ about its timing.Ken Fisher, the founder of the renowned hedge fund Fisher Investments, shared his thoughts and commented that even though the market is wary of consistent interest hikes, it increases the motivation for banks to lend. Mr. Fisher outlined that:So let me just say that when I was very young before I was an adult, Milton Friedman was saying that the central banks fiddling with interest rates thinking they can predict what that will do to the economy is beyond ridiculous and mostly, it doesn't allow you to impact the economy very directly. When I was young, the deposit base the banks lend off of was overwhelmingly, time deposits cost them money, and the spread between what they took money in at and what they lend it out at was a form of a gross margin, and the bigger that spread, the eager they became to lend the more that it was small i.e. the flattened or inverted yield curve, the less they were. But today 93% of U.S. bank lending base is interest free, free money, so the more the Federal Reserve raises rates, the more it increases the incentive of banks to lend. Which is, again, something I don't see why they don't understand that. But if you look at this period, the more inflation's gone up, the more corporate margins have gone up. Analogous not understood. Share buybacks remain strong, corporate bond spread. . . uh commercial lending through September's up 11% year over year.Story continuesWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some top bear stocks, with the top three in our list being Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this homebuilder have returned -4%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -8.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry, which PulteGroup falls in, has gained 0.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.PulteGroup is expected to post earnings of $2.76 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +51.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.3%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.15 points to a change of +52.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.71 indicates a change of -12.9% from what PulteGroup is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.9%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, PulteGroup is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PHM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For PulteGroup, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $4.05 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +16.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $16.72 billion and $17.09 billion estimates indicate +20.1% and +2.2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPulteGroup reported revenues of $3.93 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.9%. EPS of $2.73 for the same period compares with $1.72 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.03 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.52%. The EPS surprise was +5.81%.Over the last four quarters, PulteGroup surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.PulteGroup is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PulteGroup. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Historically, dividend stocks have performed well during times of financial instability. Especially companies with strong dividend growth track records are more popular among investors due to their regular income. In this regard, companies like The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are gaining ground among investors due to their long dividend growth streaks.Studies conducted in the past show that dividends contributed significantly to overall returns of the market. According to a report published by London Business School and Credit Suisse in 2011, the total annual average return of the US stock market from 1900 to 2011 was 5%. However, reinvested dividends took the total return to 9.4%. The report also mentioned that for long-term investors, dividends stocks are the most reliable option. Another research by Danske Capital showed that in the last ten bull markets from 2005 to 2015, dividend-paying stocks outperformed their non-dividend peers by an average of 3% per year.With rising interest rates and high inflation this year, investors are preferring dividend stocks over other asset classes. The returns of dividend stocks also comply with investors’ inclination toward them. The MSCI World High Dividend Yield Index, which tracks the performance of large- and mid-cap stocks across 23 developed markets, fell by 16.17% in 2022 through September, compared with a decline of 25.13% in the MSCI World index during the same period.10 Dividend Stocks That Are Too Cheap To IgnoreImage by Steve Buissinne from PixabayOur Methodology:The dividend stocks mentioned below have share prices below $35, as of October 10.

The annual list recognizes leading global companies that use the creative tools of capitalism to address society's most pressing needs.Each year, FORTUNE identifies companies that have had a positive social impact through activities that are part of their core business strategy. Eligible businesses, academic institutions, and nonprofit organizations are nominated and ranked based on key criteria, including, measurable social impact on one or more specific societal problems; business results and the benefit that the socially impactful work brings to the company; degree of innovation and how the company's effort is relative to that of others in the industry.""It is an absolute honor to have GI Genius selected for this prominent recognition,"" said Giovanni Di Napoli, president of the Medtronic Gastrointestinal business, which is part of the Medical Surgical Portfolio at Medtronic. ""At Medtronic, our purpose powers our innovation to develop life-saving medical therapies. This means delivering impact for the diverse global communities we serve. Our expanding AI capabilities at Medtronic create opportunities to deliver against unmet needs, including across the Gastrointestinal (GI) practice.""Medtronic is committed to solving the world's biggest health challenges with healthcare technology. That is why AI and data are not only transformative trends in the industry, but also strategic pillars for Medtronic - and GI Genius is a clear example of that. Today, the GI Genius module is the first commercially available computer-aided detection system using AI to help physicians detect polyps and flag signs of colon cancer. The module is poised to have a world-changing impact in the fight against colorectal cancer and improve patient outcomes by assisting physicians in identifying polyps they might otherwise miss.Story continuesColorectal cancer is the second deadliest cancer and the third most common cancer globally. One in 20 U.S. adults will be diagnosed with this disease in their lifetime. Screening is one of the most effective ways to prevent or diagnose it early - when it is most treatable. When detected early, 90% of patients can beat colorectal cancer. And that's where the GI Genius™ intelligent endoscopy module can make a profound world-changing impact by enhancing standard colonoscopies for the +10 million U.S. patients who undergo screenings annually.With every 1% increase in precancerous lesion detection rates, the rates of interval colorectal cancer (cancer occurring after a negative screening) fall by %. A study demonstrated that GI Genius could increase the detection of hard-to-detect precancerous polyps by up to 14.4%, and in the recently published DETECT study, it was shown to reduce the missed polyp rate by nearly 50%.The GI Genius module can detect lesions or flat polyps in real-time during colonoscopy procedures. With leading AI technology, we're improving colonoscopy polyp detection rates and helping to reduce variability in patient outcomes.The Medtronic Health Equity Assistance Program, launched in February 2022, has donated 133 GI Genius units to 62 facilities in low-income and underserved communities across the United States where screening rates are low or where access to the technology is not currently available.This is the second time Medtronic has been named to FORTUNE's annual ‘Change the World' list.

150,662dea83-e3b9-391f-9100-3c62644329b0,MOS,2022-10-11,Estimating The Fair Value Of The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estimating-fair-value-mosaic-company-114244524.html,1665488564,STORY,['MOS'],"[How far off is The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Mosaic What's The Estimated Valuation?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.90bUS$2.52bUS$1.53bUS$1.17bUS$984.8mUS$879.2mUS$818.3mUS$783.4mUS$764.6mUS$756.2mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x10Analyst x7Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ -16.15%Est @ -10.72%Est @ -6.92%Est @ -4.27%Est @ -2.4%Est @ -1.1% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.2% US$3.7kUS$2.2kUS$1.3kUS$922US$728US$611US$536US$483US$443US$413(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$11bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 1.9%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$756m× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (6.2%– 1.9%) = US$18bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$18b÷ ( 1 + 6.2%)10= US$9.8bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$21b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$52.7, the company appears about fair value at a 14% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Mosaic as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.015. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For Mosaic, we've compiled three additional aspects you should further examine:Risks: For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Mosaic  that you should be aware of.Future Earnings: How does MOS's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

However, the purchase is proving to be a costly gamble, since losses made by insiders have totalled US$433k since the time of purchase.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Boeing The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At BoeingOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Independent Non-Executive Chairman Lawrence Kellner for US$1.0m worth of shares, at about US$209 per share. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of US$130. It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares. It is generally more encouraging if they paid above the current price, as it suggests they saw value, even at higher levels.Happily, we note that in the last year insiders paid US$1.1m for 5.48k shares. But they sold 990.00 shares for US$220k. In total, Boeing insiders bought more than they sold over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeBoeing is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Boeing insiders own about US$54m worth of shares. That equates to 0.07% of the company. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.Story continuesSo What Do The Boeing Insider Transactions Indicate?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Boeing shares in the last quarter. However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening. Overall we don't see anything to make us think Boeing insiders are doubting the company, and they do own shares. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. For example - Boeing has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.Of course Boeing may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Mid-America Apartment Communities in FocusHeadquartered in Germantown, Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of -36.7% so far this year. Currently paying a dividend of $1.25 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 3.44%. In comparison, the REIT and Equity Trust - Residential industry's yield is 3.35%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.81%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $5 is up 22% from last year. In the past five-year period, Mid-America Apartment Communities has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 4.95%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Mid-America Apartment Communities's current payout ratio is 57%, meaning it paid out 57% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, MAA expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 is $8.29 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 18.26%.Story continuesBottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Big, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, MAA presents a compelling investment opportunity; it's not only an attractive dividend play, but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

An upgrade or downgrade can quickly move a stock’s price and lift or lower an analyst’s target price. The target price can also guide investors as to the potential long-term appreciation or depreciation of a stock.But the best analysts are only right about 50% of the time. And what does an investor do when the same analyst is the most optimistic or pessimistic among fellow analysts about several stocks in a particular sector?Take a look at what one analyst says are the three residential real estate investment trust (REIT) stocks with the highest upside and how some of his peers view the same stocks.Camden Property Trust (NYSE: CPT) is a Houston-based residential REIT that owns and manages over 240,000 square feet of apartment complexes in major cities across the U.S. Some of its apartment complexes also contain ground-floor retail space, offices or mixed-use space.Camden Property Trust pays a dividend of $3.76, which has grown 25% over the past five years with no cuts or eliminations. It presently yields about 3.1%.Barclay’s analyst Anthony Powell recently maintained an overweight position on Camden Property Trust while lowering the target price from $174 to $169. From its recent price, that represents a potential upside of 43%, the highest among residential REITs.Evercore ISI Group analyst Steve Sakwa was not quite as optimistic, lowering his price target twice within two weeks, from $158 to $147. But that’s still a 25% upside from Camden Property Trust’s recent price.Don't Miss: Bezos-Backed Startup Lets You Buy Shares Of This 3-Bedroom Home For As Little As $100Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc. (NYSE: MAA) is another residential REIT that owns and manages over 101,000 units in nearly 300 communities across 16 states.The Germantown, Tennessee-based REIT pays an annual dividend of $5 per share, currently yielding about 3.3%. The dividend has grown by 43% over the past five years, with no cuts or eliminations.Story continuesBarclay’s Powell also recently maintained an overweight position on Mid-America Apartment Communities and raised its price target from $211 to $215. This presents a potential upside of 41% from its recent price.However, analyst Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho Bank was far less sanguine, maintaining a neutral position and nudging the price target down from $178 to $177.Equity Residential (NYSE: EQR) is a Chicago-based REIT that boasts over 300 apartment buildings located in large urban areas, such as Boston, New York, Washington, D.C, Seattle, San Francisco and Denver.Equity Residential pays an annual dividend of $2.50, which currently yields about 3.8%. The dividend has grown 24% over the past five years with no cuts nor eliminations over that time.Barclay’s Powell also maintained an equal-rate position on Equity Residential, while raising the price target from $83 to $88. That increase now presents Equity Residential with a potential upside of 35%.But Powell’s target price was much higher than several other analysts who wrote about Equity Residential. Sakwa of Evercore ISI Group sees $81 as a more realistic target price, and John Kim of BMO Capital Markets even downgraded Equity Residential from outperform to market perform, while slicing his target price from $88 to $74. That only equates to 13% of upside potential from its recent price.So where does that leave investors? The most prudent advice is to consider analyst opinions as a guide to potential appreciation but still assess stocks by their fundamentals and/or technical indicators before making any purchases.Read next: This Little-Known REIT Is Producing Double-Digit Returns In A Bear Market: How?See more from BenzingaThese 3 REITs Are Paying Huge DividendsCan These REITs Keep Paying 9% Dividend Yields?Don't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

The stock has declined 15.9% over the past four weeks. However, given the fact that it is now in oversold territory and Wall Street analysts are majorly in agreement about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier, the stock could be due for a turnaround.How to Determine if a Stock is OversoldWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Why a Trend Reversal is Due for MAAThe heavy selling of MAA shares appears to be in the process of exhausting itself, as indicated by its RSI reading of 27.65. So, the trend for the stock could reverse soon for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.This technical indicator is not the only factor that calls for a potential rebound for the stock. There is a fundamental indicator as well. A strong agreement among sell-side analysts covering MAA in raising earnings estimates for the current year has led to an increase in the consensus EPS estimate by 0.1% over the last 30 days. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Moreover, MAA currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises.

Although prices were relatively low, insiders chose to sell US$2.2m worth of stock in the past 12 months. This could be a sign of impending weakness.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Northrop Grumman Northrop Grumman Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, David Perry, sold US$1.2m worth of shares at a price of US$394 per share.

As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation.

This has lagged the Consumer Discretionary sector's loss of 10.69% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 8.4% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from V.F. as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be October 26, 2022. On that day, V.F. is projected to report earnings of $0.74 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 33.33%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $3.1 billion, down 2.97% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $2.70 per share and revenue of $11.82 billion. These totals would mark changes of -15.09% and -0.19%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for V.F.These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 12.74% lower within the past month. V.F. is holding a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) right now.Story continuesDigging into valuation, V.F. currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 10.69. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 9.43, so we one might conclude that V.F. is trading at a premium comparatively.We can also see that VFC currently has a PEG ratio of 1.49.

176,18899553-d53e-3265-8315-6507ceb1578f,ZION,2022-10-11,Zions (ZION) to Report Q3 Results: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zions-zion-report-q3-results-140002182.html,1665410402,STORY,['ZIONP'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Zions (ZION) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis financial holding company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.59 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +9.7%.Revenues are expected to be $812.72 million, up 15.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.5% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Zions?For Zions, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.06%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Zions will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Zions would post earnings of $1.35 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.29, delivering a surprise of -4.44%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Zions appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Banks - West industry, First Republic Bank (FRC), is soon expected to post earnings of $2.19 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +14.7%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.55 billion, up 18.9% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for First Republic Bank has been revised 1.3% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -0.06%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that First Republic Bank will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This means that a larger number of shares were sold by insiders in relation to shares purchased.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Wells Fargo Wells Fargo Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, Kleber Santos, sold US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$44.44 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$41.45. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive). Kleber Santos was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Does Wells Fargo Boast High Insider Ownership?For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Wells Fargo insiders own 0.07% of the company, currently worth about US$116m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Wells Fargo Insiders?The fact that there have been no Wells Fargo insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Wells Fargo, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. For example - Wells Fargo has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.Story continuesOf course Wells Fargo may not be the best stock to buy.

For a preview of what to expect, let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Semenova. These are always-- it's always a good bellwether, right, about where things are in terms of the economy. As we said, never been more uncertain.ALEXANDRA SEMENOVA: Yeah, absolutely, Akiko. Those four banks, among the six largest in the US by assets, are set to be the opening act of the earnings season, with Goldman Sachs and Bank of America set to release results next week. And some of the themes that we'll be watching closely are a slowdown in investment banking revenues, potential layoffs across their businesses, how demand for loans is holding up with higher interest rates, and any potential warnings about the economy that CEOs may deliver on earnings calls.And this quarter, profits are expected to shrink, especially compared to a really robust 2021 for Wall Street. Profits are also likely to take a hit from higher loan loss provisions. Those are funds set aside by banks for any potential sour loans if customers don't make their payments. The six largest US banks are estimated to set aside a collective $4.5 billion this quarter. That's according to a Financial Times report today. And this is also a turnaround from a year ago, when banks actually benefited from releasing those reserves, as we were recovering from the pandemic.One notable thing to note, too, is that banks typically benefit from higher interest rate environments. Those often give them a nice boost on their net interest income. But investment banking revenue is likely to offset that. And some other things to look out for, too, are any comments that bank executives make. Jamie Dimon is always an interesting one on his earnings calls with his storm cloud warnings. Credit Suisse and the broader-- what that means for the broader industry. And also Bank of America and Morgan Stanley are estimated to lose a combined $500 million on Elon Musk's Twitter deal.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, worth noting the bar pretty low, going into earnings season, not just within banks, but overall. Thanks so much for that. I know you're going to tracking those results really closely.]"

However, the P/E might be low for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.Recent times have been advantageous for Pfizer as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. It might be that many expect the strong earnings performance to degrade substantially, which has repressed the P/E. If you like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's out of favour. View our latest analysis for Pfizer peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Pfizer will help you uncover what's on the horizon.What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The Low P/E?In order to justify its P/E ratio, Pfizer would need to produce sluggish growth that's trailing the market.Taking a look back first, we see that the company grew earnings per share by an impressive 140% last year. The latest three year period has also seen an excellent 138% overall rise in EPS, aided by its short-term performance. So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing earnings over that time.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should bring diminished returns, with earnings decreasing 14% per annum as estimated by the analysts watching the company. Meanwhile, the broader market is forecast to expand by 9.5% each year, which paints a poor picture.With this information, we are not surprised that Pfizer is trading at a P/E lower than the market. Nonetheless, there's no guarantee the P/E has reached a floor yet with earnings going in reverse. There's potential for the P/E to fall to even lower levels if the company doesn't improve its profitability.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayWhile the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.We've established that Pfizer maintains its low P/E on the weakness of its forecast for sliding earnings, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement in earnings isn't great enough to justify a higher P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price rising strongly in the near future under these circumstances.Having said that, be aware  Pfizer is showing 1 warning sign in our investment analysis, you should know about.Of course, you might also be able to find a better stock than Pfizer.

The company’s near-term prospect looks gloomy due to weakening demand for its chips used in gaming and data center end markets.

The Value Style Score utilizes ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, and Price/Cash Flow to help pick out the most attractive and discounted stocks.Pfizer (PFE)With eight blockbuster products in its portfolio, New York-based, Pfizer, Inc. boasts a sustainable pipeline with multiple late-stage programs that can drive growth. Pfizer markets a wide range of drugs and vaccines. Its business comprises six business units — Oncology, Inflammation &amp; Immunology, Rare Disease, Hospital, Vaccines and Internal Medicine. In November 2020, Pfizer spun-off its Upjohn unit, its off-patent branded and generic established medicines business, and combined it with generic drugmaker Mylan to create a new generic pharmaceutical company called Viatris. The Consumer Healthcare (CHC) segment, an over-the-counter (OTC) medicines business, was merged with Glaxo’s unit in July 2019 to form a new joint venture (JV). However, Glaxo divested the CHC JV into a new company called Haleon in July 2022. Pfizer owns a stake of 32% in Haleon and plans to sell the stake in a disciplined manner.PFE boasts a Value Style Score of A and VGM Score of A, and holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this drugmaker have returned -11.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -8.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Pfizer falls in, has lost 2.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Pfizer is expected to post earnings of $1.64 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.54 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +48%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.39 indicates a change of -17.6% from what Pfizer is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Pfizer is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PFE _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Pfizer, the consensus sales estimate of $22.46 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -6.8%. The $101.13 billion and $81.26 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +24.1% and -19.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPfizer reported revenues of $27.74 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +46.2%. EPS of $2.04 for the same period compares with $1.07 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $26.32 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.39%. The EPS surprise was +16.57%.Over the last four quarters, Pfizer surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Pfizer is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Pfizer. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. In light of that, when we looked at Fox (NASDAQ:FOXA) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Fox, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.13 = US$2.6b ÷ (US$22b - US$2.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).Therefore, Fox has an ROCE of 13%. On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 7.4% generated by the Media industry. View our latest analysis for Fox roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Fox compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.How Are Returns Trending?When we looked at the ROCE trend at Fox, we didn't gain much confidence. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 30% over the last five years. However it looks like Fox might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.The Bottom Line On Fox's ROCEBringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by Fox's reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. And with the stock having returned a mere 3.8% in the last three years to shareholders, you could argue that they're aware of these lackluster trends. Therefore, if you're looking for a multi-bagger, we'd propose looking at other options.Story continuesFox does have some risks though, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Fox  that you might be interested in.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Down almost 4% after publishing a policy change that would subject users to a fine of $2,500 for spreading misinformation, according to the company. Then the payment platform in a widely-reported statement said, it published an acceptable use policy in error and will not be fining users for misinformation, at least not yet.It's unclear whether it published in error or published it too early. But among the critics of that policy when it first came out and then was rescinded, was the former president of the company David Marcus, who tweeted about it. And basically said, he was critical of it. He said, ""Paypal's new AUP goes against everything I believe in. A private company now gets to decide to take your money if you say something they disagree with. Insanity.""Now, there are lots of companies that tell you that you can't spread misinformation. All the social media companies have policies on this stuff. But I don't know that any other has introduced a fine associated with it. I guess that is what the real difference is here. But I also-- how do you spread misinformation on PayPal? Like, do you guys--BRAD SMITH: Yeah.BRIAN SOZZI: I mean, is it through-- PayPal owns Venmo. I don't know if that would apply to Venmo.JULIE HYMAN: Like asking for money for things that are--BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah. unclear.JULIE HYMAN: --false?BRAD SMITH: Yeah. I mean--JULIE HYMAN: I don't-- I don't quite understand the examples of it.BRAD SMITH: Even with the social networking capabilities that they've tried to add on to peer-to-peer payments, it's really not clear what's spreading of misinformation would actually be categorized as underneath of the platform, whether it's PayPal proper or the subsidiary, Venmo, to your point.Story continuesBut for PayPal, it's the first company that would have introduced, I think, a fine for end users. And especially $2,500, that is a pretty steep fine that would have come forward had they moved forward with that. But it really does show that because all of the other platforms, to your point, they were either labeling posts saying--JULIE HYMAN: Well, they suspend your account.BRAD SMITH: Or they suspend your account, things of that nature. But nothing to the extent of a monetary fine that we'd seen even leaked out to the public, it seems like, at this point.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, I think this story will be, you know, in the veer-- rearview mirror within a week or so. And then as an investor, you have to think about, what will the market turn to? And you see PayPal shares up 19% in the past three months, compared to the NASDAQ up 9%.There have been, I think, a lot of expectations around how many costs PayPal could pull out of its business over the next six months. You've seen CEO Dan Schulman give some, I think, bullish presentations to various investment banks over the past few months.I think the Street is really positioning for an inflection point in this company's margins. I'm just not sure they're going to get that in the third quarter and with that fourth-quarter guidance.JULIE HYMAN: Well, and for the folks who are in management at PayPal, you don't like to see something like this sort of draw negative attention to the company, at the same time that they're trying to make some of that progress.BRAD SMITH: Absolutely.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah.]"

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Stocks for Long-Term Growth.Growth stocks are taking a beating in 2022 due to higher borrowing costs that are delaying expansion plans and negatively impacting margins. However, for long-term investors, this is a buying opportunity. Investors that have a long-term time horizon and are closely observing secular trends can still find stocks in a bear market that can experience strong growth. Secular growth industries include clean energy, electric vehicles, biotech, cloud computing, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence among others. These are all industries that are reshaping the world and are therefore expected to experience long-term growth. For instance, the digital transformation of industries is expected to grow the cloud computing industry from an estimated $480 billion in 2022 to $1.7 trillion by 2029 at a compound annual growth rate of 19.9% over the forecasted period. The global biotech industry was worth $1 trillion in 2021 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 13.9% from 2022 to 2030. As businesses go digital, cybersecurity is becoming a major concern for businesses. The global cybersecurity market is expected to be worth $155.8 billion in 2022 and then grow at a compound annual growth rate of 13.4% through 2029 to reach a value of $376.3 billion.These are only a few industries that are expected to experience healthy growth over the next decade. In this article, we will uncover some of the best stocks for investors to own for long-term growth. Some of the best long-term stocks to own include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc.

To skip our detailed analysis of these stocks and Singer's investment insights, you can go directly to see Activist Investor Paul Singer's 5 Latest Stock Picks.Once dubbed 'the world's most feared investor', Paul Elliot Singer is the founder, president and co-CEO of Elliott Management. Known for his high-profile, and often combative, deal-making, his hedge fund has a reputation for seeking out and successfully exploiting market weakness. Having started Elliott Management in 1977, after a brief stint in corporate law, with $1.3 million in seed capital, Singer’s market ventures have been consistently successful, with average annual returns of almost 14%. Although the 78-year-old is not as flashy or public as activists such as Carl Icahn, his corporate ventures have spanned sectors from technology and telecommunications to entertainment, and energy, helping him amass a fortune worth roughly $4.3 billion, alongside a spot on the list of the richest people according to Forbes.Elliott Management, since the day it was founded, has been focused on distressed securities. While it started as a hedge fund focusing on convertible arbitrage, Paul Singer slowly steered the fund’s focus toward companies and later countries facing financial trouble. In the 1990s, Paul Singer’s firm bought up troubled sovereign debt from countries including Peru and Argentina that brought in multi-million-dollar repayments. These methods, which sometimes included corporate debt plays, earned him the title of “doomsday investor” in a 2018 article by The New Yorker magazine. A more recent excursion came March this year amidst the chaos on the nickel market on March 8, 11 days after the outbreak of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, where the activist fund founded by Paul Singer claimed more than $450 million in damages from the London Metal Exchange for having used an illegal method intended to interrupt trade.Story continuesSinger, who was born and raised in New Jersey, and studied psychology at the University of Rochester before getting a J.D. from the Harvard Law School in 1969, has been credited among those who accurately predicted the 2008 Financial Crisis — a period where he made significant profits from credit default swaps that bet leveraged companies would crash.At the end of June, Singer's Elliot Management reported managing $8.67 billion in its investment portfolio. The fund liquidated all of its holdings in 10 companies and reduced its stake in 4 companies. In contrast, the fund made 9 additions to its portfolio while increasing its stakes in 11 different names. Elliot Management's top 10 holdings at the end of the second quarter included names like Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC), Peabody Energy Corporation (NYSE:BTU) and Suncor Energy Inc. (NYSE:SU).Activist Investor Paul Singer's 8 Latest Stock PicksPaul Singer of Elliott ManagementOur MethodologyThe following data is gathered from Elliott Management’s latest 13F filing with the SEC.

The analyst lowered global hard disk drive unit forecasts for both this year and next to reflect continued consumer weakness. Despite the overall weakness, the analyst believes that pricing has held up, which is a reflection of mix shift to nearline. However, while this is a near-term positive, O'Malley thinks that this is unlikely to persist.According to the company’s Q4 earnings report released on August 5, Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) recorded earnings per share of $1.78, beating market estimates by $0.06. Additionally, the company’s revenue for the quarter came in at $4.53 billion.At the close of Q2 2022, 43 hedge funds were bullish on Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC).

His hedge fund held a stake worth approximately $33 million by the close of the quarter.According to BofA analyst Omar Dessouky, the leaked footage of Grand Theft Auto 6 is ""slightly negative"" for shares of Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO) because it provides further proof that the game is still not ready for a 2023 release. Additionally, Dessouky suggests that valuable intellectual property from Rockstar may have been stolen in the leaks as well. He kept a Neutral rating on the shares of the company, alongside a $130 price target.As of Q2 2022, 66 of the 895 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were bullish on Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.

Take-Two has a reputation for the high quality of its games, having published industry favorites such as Grand Theft Auto and NBA2K.The video game industry itself has shed much of its boom-and-bust patterns to become a steadier, more predictable business with high barriers to entry, established title franchises, and high levels of recurring, in-game revenue streams. The company has been investing heavily to step up the number of new title launches over the next few years, a favorable set-up which we believe is not fully reflected in its stock price.”6.

You could see the stock off just around 7% after voluntarily recalling more than 12,000 vehicles over concerns of a possible steering and suspension hazard. Yahoo Finance's Senior Auto Reporter Pras Subramanian is here with more on this. Pras, looking at the stock reaction, Wall Street, obviously, very concerned about this recall. What's your take on it?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: It's just not a good look right now when they have this critical Q4 coming up. They've got to meet these deliveries to hit that goal of 25,000 cars a year. It's a simple issue. It's tightening a bolt on an arm in front of the steering knuckle. But if it fails, it's a catastrophic steering failure, right?So they have to do this. Safety is of utmost concern. It's good they're doing this now, but it's just sort of-- as one analyst said, it's a black eye for them, right? Like there's credibility issues already on the table for them, and now, you have this on top of their big goal in Q4. So I think it's kind of, like, you see the analysts, the chart. It's just a concern there right now for them to perform.- It reads like a bit of an overreaction based on the fact there are no deaths, no real, serious accidents, a very small incident number as well.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Seven trucks, yeah.- This is a proactive company really getting ahead of it. I want to ask you about Tesla, as well, some massive numbers out of China, breaking a record.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: And the flip side, huge numbers out of China, the Giga, Shanghai, 83,000 vehicles delivered. It's their biggest month ever. This after they sort of did these upgrades to that Shanghai facility over the summer. They shut down for a bit, and now, they're really pumping out cars there. Tesla, in the latest quarter, said that they can produce around 750,000 vehicles per year there now. That's their biggest factory, so huge install base there now in Giga, Shanghai.Story continues- Now, we just got to couch that. There are new lockdowns already underway in China, not where the Tesla factory is yet, but their caseload tripled after the weekend. So new lockdowns in China could eventually impact Tesla as well. Rochelle?- And, Pras, stick around, because I want to turn now to Ford and GM. We saw a UBS analyst Patrick Hummel downgrading both stocks, citing an expected weakened demand thanks to inflationary pressures, as well as some of these supply constraints we continue to hear about. Now, Hummel predicts ""that it will take three to six months for the auto industry to end up in oversupply."" So, Pras, what's your reaction to this? It does seem like one step forward, two steps back for some of these automakers right now.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: It's a little surprising. Even in the last two and a half years, we've seen the supply be the problem for the automakers. They were able to command huge margins, extreme pricing power because of the fact they didn't have enough supply, and now, we're talking about demand actually turning down and its supply becoming a problem when you have more cars than are actually needed for the market probably by, I think, the analysts are saying next year. Although it's interesting, they thought that Ford was actually in a worse place than GM because of their product portfolio and stuff like supply chain. But I'm curious what you guys think about that.- Yeah, I mean, it's interesting. I just think, just in terms of the demand destruction projection part of it, the fact that it's falling apart and falling apart so quickly, I think that caught me a little bit off guard. Yes, we talked about the fact that the economy is weakening. People are going to be pulling back on spending, but I didn't know-- I didn't necessarily, I guess, expect it to be to that degree so quickly. So that's something that jumped out to me and then also just in terms of what he does like. UBS saying that they favor automakers with a luxury exposure, one of them being Mercedes, just given the fact that more the higher end consumer could potentially be more resilient if we do see a large economic downturn.- Yeah, it is shocking, the U-turn. It was just a couple of weeks ago that Ford told us 40,000, 45,000 cars did not have the parts, and they'd have to park them until-- and now, we're talking about, again, oversupply in the next three to six months. It is hard to imagine us going into a world, where that is the situation. Dealers across the country, as you know, Pras, are wiped out.They are still empty. So dramatic turnaround like that, I can't quite imagine, but apparently, they're seeing it. We've seen it only in the used car sector. CarMax got hit hard at earnings. The new car segment, we haven't seen demand destruction yet.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Because there hasn't been supply, but really interesting point about the luxury demand side. Because we write a lot about that how this insatiable demand on Rolls-Royce, Bentley, Mercedes, those types of names, they can't find enough buyers. I mean, they can't find enough cars for their buyers, and on the flip side, Ford and GM, potentially, this analyst thinks that there's a problem for them. Because these buyers are less able to weather the storm of a potential downturn.- But, I guess, to me, it's just interesting, because it's coming out at a time when we're still talking about the supply chain issues that a lot of these larger automakers make. So how is that going to be corrected so quickly that then would leave to this oversupply when we haven't been able to get a better grasp of this now for over two years?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I really can't see this being a problem for the back half of next year if you really think about it. I think that's what the analyst is kind of saying, but he's kind of putting his marker on the table right now, like Ford. He said, Ford, we see absolute downside for Ford. That's a direct quote. I mean, that's crazy.- Right now, they have very, very strong pricing power. I don't know. Maybe UBS will have the last laugh on this one. It certainly looks like Wall Street's worried about the downgrade here with Ford shares sinking today. Pras, thanks so much for that.]"

""I think what you will expect is that if the dollar continues to be strong, which is generally the expectation, you are going to see this show probably in Q1 and Q2 next year as the move recently has been so quick that companies haven't had the time for that to flow completely through the income statement.""The U.S. dollar has been on a serious march higher for months, fueled by the Fed's aggressive interest rate hikes to stomp out inflation and currency instability in countries such as the U.K. Year to date, the U.S. Dollar Index has shot up 1%, with most of the advance commencing in mid-June after the Fed cranked up its inflation-fighting rhetoric.Dollar strength has the effect of lowering sales and profits for large multinational corporations that do business in multiple countries. The opposite happens when the dollar is weak.Such strength is becoming a major pain point for companies (and markets) when it comes to actual financial performance as well as communicating guidance to investors.Food makers Conagra Brands (CAG) and McCormick (MKC) warned just last week about a potential financial hit by way of dollar strength.

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc in FocusThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc (PNC) is headquartered in Pittsburgh, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of -24.53% since the start of the year. Currently paying a dividend of $1.5 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 3.96%. In comparison, the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield is 3.84%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.81%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $6 is up 25% from last year. In the past five-year period, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 13.55%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc's current payout ratio is 42%, meaning it paid out 42% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for PNC for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 is $14.38 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 1.41%.Story continuesBottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.High-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, PNC is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The thinking is that the early bird catches the dollars,"" said Carol Spieckerman, president at consultancy Spieckerman Retail.Walmart Inc is holding a ""Rollbacks and More"" sale event from Oct. 10-13 to counter Amazon's discount days, with deals on everything from Hot Wheels toys to luggage.Kohl's Corp and Best Buy Co Inc's 48-hour sale also runs on the same days as Amazon's event, while Target Corp's ""Deal Days"" were from Oct. 6-8, avoiding a clash with Amazon.""The middle- to upper-income consumer is likely to take more advantage of the current deals to get a jump on the holiday season ... at the lower end of the income spectrum, those consumers may hold off and buy closer to need,"" Telsey Advisory Group analyst Joseph Feldman said.Inflation and early discounting is also expected to slow holiday spending for the year. U.S. online holiday sales are expected to rise this year at their slowest pace since at least 2015 and grow only 2.5% to $209.7 billion, according to Adobe Analytics.The early start to the holiday shopping season, however, does not come as a surprise.Major retailers such as Target and Walmart have been giving big discounts for months to get rid of excess inventory that piled up as consumer's cut back on discretionary spending. Some of them even had competing deals when Amazon held its Prime Day sales in July.At the time, Amazon raked in about $12 billion in sales, according to Adobe.""This holiday season, retailers are resorting to blunt force promotions to coax shoppers,"" Spieckerman said.

The retailer announced it's adding an additional three weeks to its Black Friday deals, extending the discount offerings of up to 50% off to seven weeks total. This is, I think, Target just being Target. And also, I should mention, we got some Adobe sales data out today, predicting the holiday season sales will rise 2 and 1/2% year over year.Not great, but this will be one of the most aggressive discounting seasons yet-- holiday seasons, according to Adobe.

It's pretty interesting.BRAD SMITH: Move over Lululemons. We made too much. And here is, we've got way too much over at Target. And that's going to be the story for a lot of retailers over the course of this holiday season. How do they churn through inventory at a massively accelerated clip in order to get back into a decent position come the start of 2023 as well? And for the consumer, how are they spending?

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Target The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At TargetThe insider, Robert Harrison, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$453k worth of shares at a price of US$218 each. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$152. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.Target insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Target Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Target. In total, Chief Accounting Officer Matthew Liegel dumped US$213k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Insider Ownership Of TargetMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Target insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$165m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Target Tell Us?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

California-based Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) is a leader when it comes to the development of cutting-edge surgical robotic procedures — from minimally invasive to major surgeries. The company’s most widely used product is its da Vinci Surgical System. The robotic surgical system, which is controlled by a surgeon, is used for prostate surgeries, to repair heart valves and for gynecologic procedures. As of the second quarter, the company had installed 7,135 of its da Vinci systems, which can cost upward of $2 million apiece, making customers likely to stick with the system once they have purchased it.As most tech stocks, ISRG shares have been battered and bruised, falling 48% this year.

But in any portfolio, there will be mixed results between individual stocks. So we wouldn't blame long term Boston Properties, Inc. (NYSE:BXP) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 44% over a half decade. And it's not just long term holders hurting, because the stock is down 37% in the last year. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 18% in the last three months.Given the past week has been tough on shareholders, let's investigate the fundamentals and see what we can learn. View our latest analysis for Boston Properties There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.While the share price declined over five years, Boston Properties actually managed to increase EPS by an average of 7.3% per year. Given the share price reaction, one might suspect that EPS is not a good guide to the business performance during the period (perhaps due to a one-off loss or gain). Or possibly, the market was previously very optimistic, so the stock has disappointed, despite improving EPS.Due to the lack of correlation between the EPS growth and the falling share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics to try to understand the share price movement.The steady dividend doesn't really explain why the share price is down. It's not immediately clear to us why the stock price is down but further research might provide some answers.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-and-revenue-growthBoston Properties is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. Given we have quite a good number of analyst forecasts, it might be well worth checking out this free chart depicting consensus estimates.Story continuesWhat About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Boston Properties' TSR for the last 5 years was -34%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 21% in the twelve months, Boston Properties shareholders did even worse, losing 35% (even including dividends). Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 6% over the last half decade.

This payment means the dividend yield will be 1.5%, which is below the average for the industry. Check out our latest analysis for CSX CSX's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsIt would be nice for the yield to be higher, but we should also check if higher levels of dividend payment would be sustainable. Before making this announcement, CSX was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 24.7% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 19% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendCSX Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2012, the annual payment back then was $0.16, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $0.40. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 9.6% over that duration. The dividend has been growing very nicely for a number of years, and has given its shareholders some nice income in their portfolios.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. It's encouraging to see that CSX has been growing its earnings per share at 24% a year over the past five years. A low payout ratio gives the company a lot of flexibility, and growing earnings also make it very easy for it to grow the dividend.CSX Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is good to see that the dividend is staying consistent, and we don't think there is any reason to suspect this might change over the medium term. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 1 warning sign for CSX that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Is CSX not quite the opportunity you were looking for?

As of Q2 2022, 1623 Capital's portfolio is diversified across 9 sectors, with the Consumer Discretionary sector being the heaviest — making up 16.9% of the total portfolio value.Some of the most noteworthy stocks in 1623 Capital’s Q2 portfolio include major industry players such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Visa, Inc. (NYSE:V), among others listed below.The Motley Fool's Latest Portfolio: Top 10 Stock PicksOur Methodology We made use of the Q2 portfolio of Motley Fool’s 1623 Capital for this analysis, selecting the hedge fund’s top 10 holdings.10. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)1623 Capital’s Stake Value: $6.63 millionPercentage of 1623 Capital’s 13F portfolio: 4.13%Number of Hedge Fund Holders:68The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is an American multinational financial services company that offers banking, commercial banking, investing and other related services. One of the largest financial institutions in the United States, Motley Fool’s 1623 Capital held 105,000 shares of The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in Q2 2022, worth $6.63 million, representing 4.13% of the total 13F portfolio.Story continuesOn July 27, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) declared a 10% increase in its quarterly dividend to $0.22, which was paid on August 26 to the shareholders of record on August 12.On September 27, Deutsche Bank analyst Brian Bedell raised the price target on The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) to $99 from $95 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares of the company.  With the exception of Charles Schwab, Bedell had broadly reduced earnings estimates across the trust banks and online brokers he covers.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 68 hedge funds were bullish on The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) at the end of the second quarter of 2022, down from 78 funds in the preceding quarter. Harris Associates is the largest shareholder of the company, with more than 12.7 million shares worth approximately $804.6 million.A noteworthy stock, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) ranks among the top 10 holdings in 1623 Capital's portfolio, alongside the likes of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Visa, Inc. (NYSE:V).Here is what Baron Funds specifically said about The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Shares of online brokerage firm The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) detracted in the quarter over concerns that clients will shift assets to less profitable money market funds and declining equity markets will pressure the asset management business. We retain conviction. Despite turbulent markets, Schwab attracted over $120 billion of net new client assets in the recent quarter. Rising interest rates should lead to increased profits on the company’s nearly $600 billion of interest earning assets as well.”9. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)1623 Capital’s Stake Value: $7.18 millionPercentage of 1623 Capital’s 13F portfolio: 4.47%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is an American software company that develops a cloud computing platform to help companies manage digital workflows for enterprise operations. The company specializes in workflow automation, artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotic process automation, and performance analytics, among other tech services.

(NYSE:NOW) with a Neutral rating and $510 price target. Although the analyst considers ServiceNow to be a ""a very well-run company,"" he believes that it will likely fall short of its long-term subscription revenue targets in 2024 and 2026. According to the analyst, the most recent quarter ""could be signaling something more than just the macro environment as ServiceNow has had a long run of successes, which at some point equates to simply difficult compares.""According to the second quarter database of Insider Monkey, 99 hedge funds were bullish on ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) with combined stakes worth $5.2 billion, up from 90 funds in the prior quarter worth $7.5 billion.. Fisher Asset Management held shares worth $693.89 million in ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW).Ensemble Capital recently published its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the fund specifically said about ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW):“ServiceNow is an enterprise software company that helps their corporate customers integrate all of their various software products into a unified platform. Their products are a key element of driving the digital transformation nearly every large company is undergoing. At the recent JP Morgan investor day, CEO Jamie Dimon explained that while the company could reduce expenses if needed should the economy slow, that their spending on digital transformation would continue as this spending was critical to the company managing costs and maximizing revenue over time. As an example of this type of spending, Dimon specifically pointed to ServiceNow, calling out that the company’s products now oversaw the single largest collection of JP Morgan data and highlighted that working with them had saved JP Morgan $50 million over the past few years.While we have high expectations for ServiceNow’s long-term growth rate, at the company’s investor day in late May they offered an increased growth outlook for the next five years as they target even higher levels of growth than we have been expecting.”8. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)1623 Capital’s Stake Value: $7.2 millionPercentage of 1623 Capital’s 13F portfolio: 4.5%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 252Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a leading online retailer and one of the highest-grossing e-commerce aggregators. During Q2 2022, The Motley Fool's 1623 Capital held a total stake value of $7.2 million in the retail giant, making up 4.5% of its portfolio value.Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Amazon Web Services and SK Telecom announced that the two companies will co-develop a new set of computer vision services at the Mobile World Congress held on September 29 in Las Vegas. The end-goal of this collaboration is to make it easier and more cost effective for customers to build, use, and scale computer vision applications, which enhance productivity.On September 29, Citi analyst Ronald Josey reiterated a Buy rating on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) with a $185 price target, stating that the company's refreshed device line-up furthers its connected home vision. According to the analyst, Amazon remained his top pick due to its Prime Early Access Sale ahead of the Holiday season, improved Prime member engagement, steady Web Services growth, and progress on cost efficiencies.At the end of Q2 2022, 252 hedge funds were eager on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and held stakes worth $30 billion in the company. As of June 30, Fisher Asset Management owns more than 46 million shares of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and is the most prominent investor in the company.Here is what Lakehouse Capital specifically said about Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its investor letter:“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) proved resilient in the face of ongoing macro pressures and delivered a strong quarterly result along with “better-than-feared” guidance for the third quarter. Net sales increased 7% year-on-year (10% constant currency) to $121.2 billion, while operating profit declined 57% to $3.3 billion. The drop in operating profit was attributable not only to external macro factors, such as elevated shipping and fuel costs, but also lower productivity and efficiency costs as a result of some overcapacity on the back of its recent investment cycle. It was pleasing to see that the company has begun to make progress on the more controllable costs, particularly productivity and staffing, with headcount, for example, down almost 100,000 over the quarter. We continue to believe Amazon is well positioned to manage these short-term issues and remains on track to deliver significant profit improvements over the next twelve months.Management also confirmed that they have not seen any deterioration in Prime membership growth or retention following the 17% increase in Prime fees put through earlier in the year. This is not surprising to us, as in our view, the price increase was more than justified given the tremendous amount of customer value that has been added since the last price increase was implemented back in 2018, which includes the doubling of its fulfilment network and workforce, significant expansion of free same-day delivery and considerable investments in video and music content. Ultimately, we remain positive about Amazon’s future and believe that the company’s scale and market leadership will continue to drive growth for many years to come.”7. Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX)1623 Capital’s Stake Value: $7.29 millionPercentage of 1623 Capital’s 13F portfolio: 4.54%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) is an American multinational company that specializes in Internet connection and data centers. The company’s data centers provide services to more than 260 of the world’s fortune 500 companies and has over 10,000 customers. Securities filings for Q2 2022 reveal that Motley Fool’s 1623 Capital held stakes worth $7.29 million in Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX), representing 4.54% of the total 13F portfolio.JPMorgan analyst Richard Choe maintained an Overweight rating on Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) with an $850 price target after hosting a meeting with management on August 28. Based on the analyst's remarks, Equinix has continued to see strong demand trends from both, enterprise and cloud service providers, and its pricing actions will add to its revenue growth. Although Choe believes that higher costs will offset some revenue gains, an improved efficiency and operating leverage may benefit funds due to operations growth.38 hedge funds that Insider Monkey tracks owned shares in Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) at the end of the second quarter of 2022 with AEW Capital Management owning 373,148 shares.Here is what Baron Real Estate Income Fund has to say about Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Equinix, Inc. is a network dense global data operator of over 240 data centers in 69 metros and 30 countries. Its customers place high value on the ecosystem of customers that Equinix has curated within its data centers over many years so that they are able to interconnect within the data center facility instead of having data travel through the public internet (latency sensitive applications as well as data security considerations). Customers value the global network with 90% of customers in multiple metropolitan areas and 75% in multiple geographic regions.Equinix has a diverse but valuable customer base with no single customer greater than 2.6% of recurring monthly revenues. COVID-19 has accelerated digital transformation priorities for many organizations, and we believe that Equinix will be poised to benefit from: i) organic growth through new bookings and pricing power (the majority of incremental bookings are from existing customers); ii) growth of high margin cross-connect revenue (approximately 20% of total); and iii) continued geographic expansion through development and select M&amp;A. We believe the combination of these factors will allow the company to grow annual cash flow in the high singledigit range.”6. Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (NYSE:BR)1623 Capital’s Stake Value: $8 millionPercentage of 1623 Capital’s 13F portfolio: 5%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 17Broadridge Financial Solutions is a public corporate services and financial technology company that offers proxy statements, annual reports, and other financial data to public companies. Motley Fool’s 1623 Capital owns 56,300 shares of Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (NYSE:BR) as of Q2 2022, worth approximately $8 million.Earlier this September, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (NYSE:BR) announced a partnership with Coinbase, offering interoperability between Coinbase Prime and Broadridge Trading and Connectivity Solutions' NYFIX order-routing network. This solution allows NYFIX clients to route order flow to Coinbase Prime via the FIX protocol, while simultaneously allowing buy-side traders to source crypto liquidity from Coinbase and trade right from their OMS.According to Insider Monkey’s database, 17 hedge funds were bullish on Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (NYSE:BR) at the end of Q2 2022, the same as the previous quarter. D. E. Shaw is the leading position holder in the company, with 206,587 shares worth $26.50 million.Much like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Visa, Inc. (NYSE:V), The Motley Fool's 1623 Capital holds significant investments in Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (NYSE:BR).Here is what Wedgewood Partners specifically said about Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (NYSE:BR) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (NYSE:BR) grew its core recurring revenue at a +6% organic rate driven by the increase in the number of open equity and ETF positions at its platform customers. We think this increase in position count was a pleasant surprise compared to the downturn in asset prices seen during most of the quarter. Broadridge customers include large online brokerage providers that have expanded into the mass market. As more investors carry more positions and instruments (regardless of size) Broadridge’s services are necessary to connect these investors with corporate governance communications from issuers and other service providers. All told, we think the expansion of capital markets is a healthy long-term trend that Broadridge should continue to benefit from.” Click to continue reading and see The Motley Fool's Latest Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks.  Suggested articles:10 Best Auto Stocks To Invest In13 Best Semiconductor Stocks To Buy10 Best Dividend Growth StocksDisclosure: None.

The French government said last week that it had tapped its strategic fuel reserves to resupply stations that had run dry.France's largest sugar maker Tereos said last month it had to slow output at some factories after TotalEnergies said it would be unable to supply diesel. It declined to comment on the strategic stock release.Cristal Union, France's second largest producer, said its own fuel stocks had allowed it to maintain production rates last week, but that it had used strategic reserves over the weekend.Sugar factories, which usually run from September to late January or early February in France, rely on farmers having enough fuel to harvest sugar beet and transport it to a factory to be processed.The decision to release strategic stocks late last week followed a meeting between sugar producers and French Agriculture Minister Marc Fesneau last Wednesday.""We explained that there were worrying tensions that risked leading to temporary factory closures,"" SNFS Chairman Christian Spiegeleer told Reuters.""The state agreed to tap the strategic stocks so that the lack of diesel does not affect the factories' proper functioning,"" he added.The French Agriculture Ministry had no immediate comment.(Reporting by Sybille de La Hamaide; Editing by Alexander Smith)]"

Markets Are Surging,ETF.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/turkeys-inflation-wild-markets-surging-184500658.html,1665081900,STORY,['KSA'],"[Turkey may be the strangest market in the global economy. Led by strongman President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the country’s inflation tops 80% and its credit has been downgraded repeatedly, now sitting at high-risk, or junk, status thanks to interest rate cuts. Turkey has more than $16 billion in debt due before 2024, according to Bloomberg. And still, the $277.7 million iShares MSCI Turkey ETF (TUR) has risen more than 34% this year. That makes it the best-performing total market country exchange-traded fund among all U.S.-listed ETFs. The closest ETF in terms of year-to-date performance to TUR is the iShares MSCI Brazil ETF (EWZ), which is up nearly 22%. Even oil-producing countries have not fared nearly as well, with the iShares MSCI Qatar ETF (QAT) up less than 11% and the iShares MSCI Saudi Arabia ETF (KSA) up just 6.53%. Parsing the gains in the Turkish market—which come as the S&amp;P 500 has dropped more than 20%—is to go down a rabbit hole.The market surge comes amid economic chaos. Despite breathtaking inflation levels, the country’s central bank cut interest rates with Erdogan’s blessing to a benchmark rate of 12%, which ultimately led to the country’s currency tanking. That cut came after several that began last year, and the president indicated in late September he expects single-digit interest rates before the end of the year. In fact, the Carnegie Middle East Center reported late last year, when inflation was already sky high, that Erdogan believes soaring inflation is caused by high interest rates and that rate reductions will benefit domestic investment and exports. Multiple Economic ChallengesThat said, only a few days ago, Bloomberg reported that the country’s foreign trade deficit expanded 300% on an annual basis in September, and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has made the country even more vulnerable as commodity prices rise. Indeed, the Bloomberg article notes Turkey has struggled to pay for Russian fuel and imports are accelerating at a steeper pace than exports. Story continuesErdogan has said that inflation is part of his economic plan and that he’ll deal with high inflation early next year. One possible explanation for the apparently nonsensical gains is that investors are finding protection from the effects of inflation in Erdogan’s interest rate cuts. Local and foreign investors are buying Turkish stocks: Foreigners poured $366 million into Turkish stocks in the week ended Aug. 19, Bloomberg reported, citing central bank figures.Also, its economy has been growing at around 6% annually for the past 20 years.U.S. investors don’t seem to be lured in by the market’s outsized performance, even though the broad U.S. market, as represented by the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), has seen a decline of more than 20% year to date, and there are few bright spots among the various asset classes. Rather than gaining investor dollars in 2022, TUR has seen outflows of roughly $72 million.  Contact Heather Bell at heather.bell@etf.comRecommended StoriesChina's Current Troubles Not Long-Term Worry: Matthews Asia Hot Reads: Fed Could Step Up Rate HikesBrazil’s Markets May Gyrate Ahead of Runoff Election Cannabis ETFs Soar After Biden Pardon Permalink | © Copyright 2022 ETF.com.

This was partially offset by lower volume, which fell 13%, and currency, which was down 2%.Tools and Outdoor demand softened during the last portion of the quarter which caused the company to spring into action. It's expecting demand to normalize closer to 2019 in the back half of 2022. As a result, it's reducing inventory and cutting costs.  In addition to dealing with inflationary pressures and softening demand, Stanley Black &amp; Decker is also in a transition with its business. It sold Stanley Security and Access Technologies in July 2022.

252,509557ea-6f65-3897-ab43-f91da1b025a0,NVDA,2022-10-11,"AMD (NASDAQ:AMD): A Great Stock for the Long Run, but There are Risks in the Near Term",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amd-nasdaq-amd-great-stock-145345727.html,1665413625,STORY,"['AMD', 'NVDA']","[This article first appeared on Simply Wall St NewsKey Takeaways from This Analysis:AMD has announced that third-quarter revenue will be ~14% lower than expected.Demand from the PC market has dropped substantially compared to previous quarters.AMD is well positioned for the long term, but there are risks to the share price in the medium term.Advanced Micro Device's  ( Nasdaq: AMD ) shares price fell sharply on Friday after the company released selected preliminary third-quarter results. In summary, the release indicated that revenue will be substantially lower than expected due to softer demand from the PC market.Notable points from the announcement:AMD expects third-quarter revenue to be about $5.6 billion, compared to previous estimates of $6.7 billion. This will reflect year-on-year growth of 29% where it was previously expected to be 55%.The slowdown reflects lower demand from the PC market which has led to revenue for the Client segment falling ~40% year on year, and 53% from the second quarter.Data Center revenue is still expected to be 45% higher than a year ago, and revenue from the gaming segment will be 14% higher.Operating expenses are expected to be lower than expected, but the gross margin would also be lower than expected.This renewed guidance is really all about lower sales due to the PC market.This news wasn’t a total surprise as analysts have been expecting a slowdown in the PC market. It’s also been reflected in the prices of most semiconductor stocks for the last few months. The question now is whether this news was already in the price, and could the slowdown spread to other semiconductor market segments?See our latest analysis for AMDWas this news already in the price?While the slowdown in PC demand has been expected, analysts have been quite bullish on the stock based on the valuation. Current 12-month price targets average $117, implying a 73% upside. However, as the chart below reflects there’s a wide range between the highest and lowest targets. This typically means we can’t be very confident about the average target price.Story continuesThe general opinion in the market seems to be that AMD is quite reasonably valued. But that assumes there will be reasonable growth in the next few years. If the slowdown in the semiconductor market is more severe, valuations will have to change. A lot hinges on whether demand from the data center market also drops off.AMD vs Nvidia and IntelAMD and Nvidia  ( Nasdaq: NVDA ) dominate the discrete GPU market, while AMD and Intel ( Nasdaq: INTC ) dominate the CPU market. AMD is in second place in both markets, but has gained share of the CPU market, and managed to hold its own in the GPU market.AMD, Nvidia, Intel - Selected Metrics, October 7th, 2022Intel trades on far lower multiples as its growth has stagnated in recent years. AMD trades on lower earnings and sales multiples than Nvidia, but it is less profitable. One could argue that AMD has more room to improve both market share and margins.While we can argue about the merits of investing in AMD vs Nvidia, they are likely to remain highly correlated. Share Price performance will probably have more to do with market conditions than anything company-specific factors.What this means for investorsAMD is a leading supplier of hardware to many of the world’s rapidly growing industries - cloud computing, AI, automation, crypto, and the metaverse to name a few. AMD is a picks and shovels stock that provides indirect exposure to all of these industries. If you believe these industries will continue to grow, AMD should be able to deliver over the long term.But in the short to medium term there are risks - if demand for semiconductors falls off more sharply than expected - which is a distinct possibility - sentiment is likely to weigh on the share price regardless of the valuation.Check out the full analysis for AMD to find out more about the company.

MDRX is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its strategic alliances over the past few months. A robust second-quarter 2022 performance and its business model are expected to contribute further. Yet, concerns related to foreign exchange and consolidation in the healthcare industry persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 4.1% against the 52.5% decline of the industry and 17.7% fall of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned IT solutions and services provider has a market capitalization of $1.59 billion. The company projects 16.3% growth over the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. MDRX’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in one, the average earnings surprise being 45.6%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper:Strategic Alliances: We are optimistic about Allscripts’ partnerships over the past few months. On the second-quarter 2022 earnings call in August, the company confirmed that its Veradigm Life Sciences’ real-world evidence data and analytics team signed numerous multi-year data agreements.During the same call, Allscripts confirmed that in its provider business, its revenue cycle management team closed two key deals in the quarter, both with orthopedic specialty practices.Business Model: Allscripts delivers IT solutions and services to help healthcare organizations achieve optimal clinical, financial and operational results, which raises our optimism about the stock. The company sells its solutions to physicians, hospitals and governments, to name a few, besides post-acute organizations such as home health and hospice agencies.Allscripts helps its clients improve the quality and efficiency of healthcare with solutions that include electronic health records, information connectivity, private cloud hosting, outsourcing, analytics, patient access and population health management. It derives its revenues primarily from sales of proprietary software, support and maintenance services, and managed services.Story continuesStrong Q2 Results: Allscripts’ solid second-quarter 2022 performance buoys optimism regarding the stock. The year-over-year uptick in the top line and revenues from both segments during the quarter is impressive. Allscripts is progressing well via its mergers and acquisitions, which raises our confidence in the stock. The gross margin expansion is another positive.DownsidesForeign Exchange Concerns: Allscripts conducts business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar but reports its financial results in U.S. dollars. As a result, the company faces exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may make its products and services more expensive for global clients.Consolidation in the Healthcare Industry: Many healthcare providers are consolidating to create integrated healthcare delivery systems with greater market power, which decreases the number of market participants. Thus, competition to provide products and services like Allscripts will intensify, and the importance of establishing and maintaining relationships with key industry participants will increase. These industry participants may use their market power to negotiate price reductions for Allscripts’ products and services.Estimate TrendAllscripts is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2022. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 10.9% north to 81 cents per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $153 million, suggesting a 58.6% plunge from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

WBA is slated to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results on Oct 13, before market open.In the fiscal third quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 1.05%. WBA’s earnings outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 13.37%.Let’s look at how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at Play   Walgreens is likely to have gained from continued strategic executions on both the United States and the international front. The quarter’s top line is likely to have benefited from the new Walgreens Health business, which brings equitable, personalized, whole-person healthcare to local communities across America.In May 2022, Walgreens sold 6 million shares of AmerisourceBergen Corporation common stock pursuant to Rule 144 at $150 per share. The company earlier announced its plans to use the proceeds from the sale, amounting to nearly $900 million for debt paydown and the continued support of its strategic priorities. This strategic development is likely to have contributed to the company’s fiscal fourth-quarter performance and improved its debt position.The company, on its third-quarter earnings release, noted that the partial monetization of AmerisourceBergen shares has been augmenting its balance sheet and was consistent with the company’s efforts to generate shareholder value.United StatesWalgreens is likely to have registered growth in U.S. retail pharmacy business, banking on demand for vaccinations and tests amid the ongoing series of contagious virus spread. In the fiscal third quarter, U.S. digital sales grew 25% on top of 95% growth a year ago.In the United States, Walgreens Boots’ expanded partnership with ALTO US, a provider of loss prevention and tech-enabled security services, should have contributed to the fiscal fourth-quarter top line. Meanwhile, its initiative to work together across more than 2,200 stores should have a positive impact on retail shrink in the quarter under review.Story continuesWalgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseWalgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. QuoteIn this regard, we note that the company delivered 4.7 million COVID vaccinations in the fiscal third quarter. As of early April, Walgreens has been offering additional boosters to adults aged 50 and older, and certain immunocompromised individuals. In March-end, Walgreens began offering Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccine boosters to adults aged 50 and older, and certain immunocompromised individuals, post FDA’s authorization and recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These are likely to have driven the pharmacy performance in the United States in the to-be-reported quarter.In terms of COVID testing, in the fiscal third quarter, WBA completed 3.9 million in-store tests. The company’s expanded access to offering Pixel by Labcorp, and at-home PCR kits at no cost through curbside and in-store pickup has been seen to gain strong customer acceptance over the past few months. This, too, should have contributed to the top line in the fiscal fourth quarter.The U.S. retail business is likely to have gained from favorable retail comparable sales growth, as it did in the past few quarters. In terms of health and wellness, the company is expected to have registered positive outcomes on growing strength in at-home COVID-19 testing, and cough, cold and flu.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Walgreens’ United States revenues is pegged at $26.44 billion, suggesting a decline of 8.1% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.InternationalIn the last reported quarter, the international business registered an ongoing rebound and strong execution across its retail portfolio, particularly in Boots U.K. The trend is expected to have continued in the fiscal fourth quarter, driven by the strong demand for COVID-19 and monkeypox testing and vaccinations, online healthcare services, and beauty brands. The Boots.com business is also likely to have continued its strong performance on increasing proportion of the U.K. retail sales being derived from the company’s mobile application.In the fiscal third quarter, sales increased 9.3% year over year, reflecting growth across all international markets, with Boots UK advancing 13.5% and Germany wholesale growing 6.8%.Walgreens noted that the integration of the wholesale business in Germany remained on track, with operational synergy gains coming in ahead of schedule. This development is expected to have accelerated international businesses in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for International revenues is pegged at $5.48 billion, suggesting a fall of 0.5% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.Walgreens HealthThe Walgreens Health segment is likely to have gained from its majority investments in Shields Health and VillageMD. VillageMD has been continuing its rollout of co-located clinics, with 120 open until the fiscal third-quarter end. Per the company, it has been on track toward 200 by the end of 2022.Shields has been rapidly expanding its platform, including new deals with three significant health systems and the launch of Boston Children's Pharmacy. VillageMD and Shields are expected to have driven pro-forma sales growth in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Retail Pharmacy-Walgreens Health revenues is pegged at $818 million.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has higher chances of beating estimates.

This change outpaced the S&amp;P 500's 0.75% loss on the day. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.32%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.11%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the seller of gases for industrial, medical and other uses had lost 9.81% over the past month. This has lagged the Basic Materials sector's loss of 3.29% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 8.4% in that time.Air Products and Chemicals will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be November 3, 2022. In that report, analysts expect Air Products and Chemicals to post earnings of $2.77 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 10.36%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $3.29 billion, up 15.89% from the prior-year quarter.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Air Products and Chemicals.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. In light of that, when we looked at Fox (NASDAQ:FOXA) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Fox, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.13 = US$2.6b ÷ (US$22b - US$2.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).Therefore, Fox has an ROCE of 13%. On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 7.4% generated by the Media industry. View our latest analysis for Fox roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Fox compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.How Are Returns Trending?When we looked at the ROCE trend at Fox, we didn't gain much confidence. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 30% over the last five years. However it looks like Fox might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.The Bottom Line On Fox's ROCEBringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by Fox's reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. And with the stock having returned a mere 3.8% in the last three years to shareholders, you could argue that they're aware of these lackluster trends. Therefore, if you're looking for a multi-bagger, we'd propose looking at other options.Story continuesFox does have some risks though, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Fox  that you might be interested in.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

257,c1752357-61e3-343b-96d8-1c7ba6d6437f,CMI,2022-10-11,‘Children can’t advocate for themselves’: American public schools have a massive plastic waste problem,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/children-t-advocate-themselves-american-170000355.html,1665421200,STORY,['CMI'],"[American public schools serve lunch to nearly 30 million students daily, and many depend on Styrofoam trays and other single-use plasticware to do so. By one measure, a single middle school can create more than 30,000 pounds of waste through its lunchroom annually—multiply that by nearly 100,000 public schools in the nation, and the problem balloons to serious proportions.For plastic reduction advocates, large public institutions such as schools, prisons, and government buildings are valuable targets for waste reduction efforts. The Washington State Department of Corrections implemented reusables in its prisons, avoiding the use of hundreds of thousands of plastic spoons annually as a result, which translated to millions of pieces of plastic eliminated across four facilities. In the case of schools, a move toward reusable cutlery and dishes not only diverts waste from landfills but can also introduce children to the importance of conservation.“Changing the habits and attitudes of 6-year-olds is considerably more productive and, I think, worthwhile than changing the containers that get used by adult humans who’ve formed their own bad habits,” says John Charles Meyer, executive director of Plastic Free Restaurants, a nonprofit that helps restaurants and schools switch away from single-use plastics.After setting up his organization to subsidize restaurants, Meyer realized that doing the same for schools was a huge opportunity. Expanding his focus has allowed him to achieve even more. “We’ve wiped out more than 7 million pieces of plastic at this point,” he says, as a result of changes at about 65 restaurants and schools.Startups are also operating in this space. Indiana-based Ahimsa, which launched in 2019, has piloted a corporate sponsorship model with Cummins to subsidize the cost of switching to reusables for budget-strapped schools. Founder and CEO Manasa Mantravadi is a pediatrician, and her concern for the health risks associated with plastics led her to create a line of stainless steel dinnerware for children.Story continuesFindings published earlier this year found microplastics in human blood in nearly 80% of the people tested. The use of plastic foodware in schools is particularly concerning, according to Ahimsa, which cites research from the Endocrine Society that shows endocrine disrupting chemicals found in some plastics can cause neurological impairments in children.“Children often can’t advocate for themselves. If we don’t keep children in mind in all the things that we do across the board, then we’re doing a disservice to the world,” says Mantravadi.Though consumers still make up the majority of Ahimsa’s customers, the company has worked with corporate sponsors to introduce reusable products in five school districts across the country and expects fast growth.“Just from these first orders, we can see that our school line will easily match and likely surpass our residential line, even in the next year,” Mantravadi says, noting that the average consumer will spend $150 on Ahimsa products and a school about $8,000. “So you can be a business making a positive lasting impact.”A subsidy modelSchools that decide to switch away from plastic typically need help with funding and logistics. Meyer’s organization has been able to help schools in California, Oregon, and Washington to switch to quality reusables with private donations. He is especially impressed with Ahimsa’s stainless steel trays, and says they are a better option for schools than reusable plastic trays.“The reusable plastics also leach chemicals and toxics, especially when they’re put through high temperature industrial dishwashers,” Meyer says.Funding is not the only barrier for some schools adopting reusables. Meyer points out that in some cases, switching to reuse means extra labor, more inventory space, and reconfiguring a kitchen layout.“A lot of people just don’t have the time or the patience for it,” he says, adding that not everyone who has shown interest in a subsidy has followed up with him. “The biggest hurdle is change.”For the schools that have accepted funding and made the switch, there have been clear rewards.Ben Schleifer at the Center for Environmental Health shepherded the process to move to reusables at schools in Emeryville, Calif., a city tucked between Oakland and Berkeley in the Bay Area. This year, grades six to eight at the K–8 Anna Yates School piloted using stainless steel utensils in place of the black polypropylene spoons and forks the school has used for over a decade.“The students took to the new foodware on the second day of school and have been loving it ever since,” Schleifer says. “More students have been taking meals from school, and the students have said the utensils and trays feel ‘fancy’ and they enjoy a more authentic dining experience.”There are already plans to expand the program. “In spring 2023, we are hoping to enlist the elementary portion of Anna Yates and also Emery High,” says Schleifer. This will impact approximately 500 school meals per day.Schleifer points out that, while reusables can last for years before needing replacement, single-use food service items in school cafeterias are typically in use for only 20 minutes, even though they take much longer to manufacture and ship.Corporate sponsorshipCorporate sponsorships can also help accelerate this type of change. When Mantravadi reached out to the sustainability chairs of local corporations, Cummins saw it as a way to reduce waste in its home state; it has worked with Ahimsa to sponsor a charter school district in nearby Indianapolis.“At Cummins, we are committed to improving the communities where we live and work,” says Zsofia Nagy, a global emissions compliance and environmental sustainability leader at Cummins. “We realized that it would overlap with all of our focus areas, so it was not a difficult decision to support this initiative.”The initiative has impacted 1,250 students across three schools. The replacement trays help save an estimated 0.5 tons of plastic waste from landfill over a three-year cycle, when new trays would typically be repurchased owing to wear and tear.“We hope to positively impact the health and well-being [of] students from marginalized communities by introducing a healthier alternative for their school cafeteria,” says Nagy.Such initiatives offer a powerful way for companies to have an impact in their local communities, Mantravadi adds. She likens the business model to Little League, where local businesses sponsor teams as a way of promoting their companies while investing in the community.“My goal is to get Ahimsa to the schools, but not have the schools pay for it if possible,” she says.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com.]"

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Cummins in FocusHeadquartered in Columbus, Cummins (CMI) is an Auto-Tires-Trucks stock that has seen a price change of -0.05% so far this year. The engine maker is paying out a dividend of $1.57 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.88% compared to the Automotive - Internal Combustion Engines industry's yield of 2.28% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.81%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $6.28 is up 12.1% from last year. In the past five-year period, Cummins has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 7.86%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Cummins's current payout ratio is 38%. This means it paid out 38% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for CMI for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 is $17.30 per share, with earnings expected to increase 17.93% from the year ago period.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.For instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that CMI is not only an attractive dividend play, but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The problem could lead to excess wheel tilt and, in some rare cases, separation of the wheel, disabling the driver to steer the vehicle and posing a severe threat to safety.The affected customers were notified about the recall decision after seven reports potentially related to the structural issue of a torqued fastener came to light. However, no injuries were reported due to the malfunction.Rivian hopes the recall’s financial impact will be negligible and has ensured to perform checks on all its vehicles within 30 days. Rivian customers can bring their vehicles to service centers or the company will send mobile repair vans to them to resolve the problem.For a fledgling company like Rivian, which began manufacturing vehicles only a year ago, recalls have been quite frequent.A while ago, Rivian recalled 207 vehicles, covering the R1T pickup and the R1S SUV, which recently went into serial production. Per the automaker’s statements to the National Highway Traffic Safety Association, the front seat belt anchors were probably inadequately attached. A probable glitch in the manufacturing process likely caused the problem.In May, Rivian recalled about 500 2022 R1T electric pickup trucks in the United States over airbags that had problems deactivating when a child was in the front passenger seat.The newbie EV maker has so far produced a total of 14,317 vehicles this year and the latest recall will significantly impact it.Although Rivian had a thumping initial public offering last year in November, the automaker has been struggling to some extent to produce vehicles off its manufacturing floor without being affected by quality issues. The ongoing parts shortage is already impeding deliveries and recalls further add to the woes.Shares of RIVN have lost 66.2% in the past year compared with its industry’s 25.7% decline.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksRIVN carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) currently.Some better-ranked players in the auto space are Cummins Inc.

NIO made headway into four more European countries after entering Norway in 2021. At a recent event in Berlin, NIO announced extending its services to Germany, Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden.The selling strategy is different from the Norwegian market, wherein the automaker sells its electric vehicles (EVs) directly. Instead, in the new markets, it has introduced a subscription-based model through which customers can lease vehicles and rent NIO’s three models, namely two sedans and one SUV. NIO has stated that since tax policies are not lucrative, it has decided on the new strategy.The subscription period can be as short as a month and the longest being 60 months. Additionally, customers will get access to other services by NIO, as well as use NIO Houses. The Berlin NIO House is expected to open soon and new facilities will eventually open in other markets.The subscription plans have been designed holistically to allow users to enjoy a hassle-free experience. It comprises comprehensive insurance, maintenance, winter tires, a courtesy car, battery swapping and the flexibility to upgrade battery services.Beside getting the vehicles charged, customers have the provision for swapping their dead batteries for fully charged ones at NIO's swapping stations. In September-end, the company opened its first battery swap station in Germany’s Zusmarshausen on a motorway between Munich and Stuttgart.Also, the company opened its first European plant to manufacture swapping stations in Hungary last month. NIO has laid out an ambitious plan to install at least 120 battery-swapping stations in Europe by the end of 2023.  By 2025, it aims to build 1,000 swapping stations overseas, most of which will be in Europe.NIO will launch ET7, EL7 and ET5 in the new countries. Deliveries of the flagship ET7 are expected to begin in Germany and the Netherlands on Oct 16, followed by Sweden and Denmark on Nov 15. At the end of January 2023, the EL7 will be available in all four markets. The junior model, ET5, is slated to debut at the end of March 2023.All three vehicles cater to premium buyers in the wealthiest countries in Europe. The automaker intends to bring more affordable models as it gradually expands in the continent. It announced that it would launch a mass-market brand in China in 2024, and in Europe a few months later. NIO plans to introduce its ALPS brand in Europe once it is unveiled in 2024.Recently, NIO invested in Greenwing Resources, the Australia-based lithium company. The China-based EV-maker has agreed to pay $12,000,000 to Greenwing to subscribe for the latter’s 21,818,182 shares at a deemed issue price of 55 cents per share (Placement).

Hulu raising subscription prices today. Yahoo Finance's Ali Canal here with the details. How much, Ali?ALI CANAL: Yeah, Dave. So these price hikes, they were first announced back in August. But today, they are hitting those subscriptions. So here's what you're looking at if you're a Hulu subscriber. Ad supported will now cause $7.99 a month. That's up from the previous $6.99. Whereas, the ad-free version will run $2 more, $14.99 versus $12.99. Now, that bundled plan that also includes Disney Plus and ESPN Plus, that's safe for now. But it will see a price increase later this year.Now, price hikes, of course, they're not uncommon for these streaming platforms. Netflix hiked prices in January. Hulu had a previous price hike around the same time last year. And with analysts hyper focused on profitability, this is one way to increase that revenue per user. However, the one issue is that these platforms always run the risks of increased churn. So that's something that we're going to be monitoring moving forward. But for now, if you're a Hulu subscriber, you're paying just a bit more today.- And, Ali, we know the box office saw some so-so sort of lukewarm results for Sony's ""Lyle, Lyle Crocodile."" So how does that add to the shaky outlook for some of these family-friendly titles at the theater?ALI CANAL: Yeah. It's a much different landscape for these types of movies. ""Lyle, Lyle"" saw a box office haul this weekend of 11.5 million. It had a production budget of 50 million. So not the best debut, especially as we often see attendance levels drop off as the weeks go on. And I think, honestly, it's just a reflection of this post-pandemic theatrical environment. There are only going to be 14 family-friendly movies in 2022. We have 2 more to go before the end of the year.Story continuesAnd that's a pretty significant dip versus 24 of those titles that we saw in 2019. And one big reason for that is that this genre is moving over to streaming. Paramount Plus, Disney Plus, even Netflix have heavily invested in this type of content, in some cases spending a heck of a lot of money to secure these types of films. ""Hocus Pocus 2"" on Disney Plus was a big one recently. ""Disenchanted"" coming soon on Netflix.We'll have the ""School for Good and Evil"" out next week. And moving forward, I think it's just going to be a conscious decision on the part of studios when it comes to where these movies go, streaming or the theater. Are you leaving money on the table going right to streaming? Are some of these movies better suited for the theatrical? I think that's going to be a constant question. And there's going to be a lot more experimentation moving forward.- It's true. Everyone's still trying to figure it out. A big thank you. Ali Canal, thanks so much. I mean, I know for me when it comes to some of these streaming things, especially kids' movies, you figure you pay for the one subscription. You've got your treats at home. You just sit back. I'm one of these people, I'm going the streaming route if I can help it. It's going to take a lot for me to go to the movies for a kids' movie if I can get it at home.- Yeah. I mean, it's not a question that I'm going the streaming route here. I mean, I would have done this even if the pandemic didn't happen and people didn't get more used to just streaming movies in their own home. But I have never really been a huge fan of going to the movies. But from a parent's perspective, bringing my kids to the movies, it's going to be-- it's a huge cost saver. How expensive is it for the movie theater? $20 a ticket?- Honestly, I don't know.- $17 a ticket? Times that by four. That's a lot.- I go so rarely. Plus snacks. Over 100 bucks.]"

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 63% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).After a year of 45% losses, last week’s 3.0% gain would be welcomed by institutional investors as a likely sign that returns might start trending higher.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Walt Disney. Check out our latest analysis for Walt Disney ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Walt Disney?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Walt Disney does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Walt Disney's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Walt Disney. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 7.8% of shares outstanding. With 6.4% and 3.9% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Story continuesWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Walt DisneyWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that The Walt Disney Company insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$141m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 37% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Walt Disney. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company.

NFG, Herc Holdings Inc. HRI, ONEOK, Inc. OKE and CECO Environmental Corp. CECE.4 Stocks that Flaunt Impressive Interest Coverage RatiosVolatility has gripped Wall Street lately and you can easily blame this on inflationary headwinds and geopolitical tensions. The consumer price index rose to 8.3% in August 2022 on a year-over-year basis, more than analysts’ expectations. With the desperate need to tame inflation, the Federal Reserve recently increased the benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points. At present, addressing shooting commodity prices is of top priority for the Fed but this has raised concerns about a possible slowdown and slipping of the economy into recession.Given the current scenario, investors should gauge the changing market dynamics and accordingly chalk out a sturdy investment strategy. You can simply arrive at a decision to buy or sell a particular stock by looking at its sales and earnings numbers. But such a strategy does not always warrant superior returns when the market is facing myriad issues. A critical analysis of the company’s financial background is always required for a better investment decision.Well, a company should be sound enough to meet its financial obligations. This can be judged with coverage ratios — the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations. Here we have discussed one such ratio called the interest coverage ratio.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest &amp; Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.National Fuel Gas Co., Herc Holdings Inc., ONEOK, Inc. and CECO Environmental Corp. are four stocks with an impressive interest coverage ratio.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?The interest coverage ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charged on its debt.Story continuesDebt, which is crucial for most companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profits of a company. The company’s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, the interest coverage ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.The interest coverage ratio suggests the number of times interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardship. Definitely, one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.Here are four picks out of the seven stocks that qualified the screening:National Fuel Gas Company, a diversified energy company, sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a VGM Score of B.

271,fbe81b9e-a0d9-3381-bf12-e04feb0f99f6,FFIV,2022-10-11,"Should You Investigate F5, Inc. (NASDAQ:FFIV) At US$144?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investigate-f5-inc-nasdaq-ffiv-170548956.html,1665421548,STORY,['FFIV'],"[F5, Inc. (NASDAQ:FFIV), might not be a large cap stock, but it received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$174 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$144. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether F5's current trading price of US$144 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at F5’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for F5 Is F5 Still Cheap?The share price seems sensible at the moment according to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that F5’s ratio of 25x is trading slightly above its industry peers’ ratio of 23.49x, which means if you buy F5 today, you’d be paying a relatively sensible price for it. And if you believe that F5 should be trading at this level in the long run, then there should only be a fairly immaterial downside vs other industry peers. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that F5’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of F5 look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 89% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for F5. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in FFIV’s positive outlook, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at FFIV? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below the industry PE ratio?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on FFIV, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for FFIV, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Diving deeper into the forecasts for F5 mentioned earlier will help you understand how analysts view the stock going forward.

The company's market valuation decreased by US$6.6b after the stock price dropped 4.9% over the past week, but insiders were spared from painful losses.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Comcast The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At ComcastOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP, Daniel Murdock, for US$397k worth of shares, at about US$44.50 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$29.13. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels. Daniel Murdock was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Comcast insiders own 0.9% of the company, currently worth about US$1.1b based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Comcast Insider Transactions Indicate?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Comcast shares in the last quarter. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Comcast, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

On Monday, the company revealed that this week’s BravoCon 2022 in New York will traverse multiple consumer experiences in the real, digital and virtual worlds.This year’s Bravo Bazaar will offer fans of “Real Housewives,” “Top Chef,” “Below Deck” and other shows more than 60 brands at its on-site event, with transactions powered by NBCUniversal checkout, while others explore an “enhanced” metaverse version. Staged with recreations of sets from favorite shows and studded with shoppable products, the virtual event, which launched last year, will be four times larger this time. TRESemmé, a featured brand partner, will also sponsor a real-world salon with products that people can shop in-person and online.More from WWDScenes from Decentraland's Metaverse Fashion Week2020 Holiday Gift Ideas: Google's Top Searched Beauty, Home and Tech GiftsInside the Jacquard by Google Exhibit in Paris“NBCUniversal has a keen pulse on the wants and needs of the Bravo fandom,” said Evan Moore, senior vice president of commerce partnerships at NBCUniversal Advertising &amp; Partnerships division. “By embedding shoppable experiences within key moments where fans are living out the Bravo life — whether it’s at BravoCon, online across our properties, or in the metaverse with the enhanced Bravo Bazaar — we can drive genuine connection and impact for our partners that transcend the screen and the shows.”The list of Bravo-approved brands includes Lashaholics, Literie Candles and Verishop brands, plus others spurred by the network’s stars such as Sewing Down South, LoverBoy and CaraGala. Products and services span retail, beauty, apparel and home decor, among other categories.At TRESemmé’s BravoCon Salon, event attendees can “achieve Bravolebrity-styled hair,” according to Jessica Grigoriou, the hair care brand’s head of beauty marketing and Salon &amp; Masstige portfolio director. The salon and shopping opportunity goes beyond the Con as well. “We’re excited to extend these shoppable experiences to Bravo fans around the world using QR code technology on-site within the salon and on-air utilizing a Live Look In on Bravo and a branded bar on ‘Watch What Happens Live,’” she explained.Story continuesAltogether, according to NBCU, “Bravoholics” everywhere will be able to shop for their favorite looks and styles.It’s an ambitious move, but the company has plenty of reason to be optimistic. In previous research the company noted that consumers engaged with its Commercial Innovations were 88 percent more likely to remember relevant brands, and 79 percent were less likely to change channels. Shopping activations, specifically, showed twice the efficacy of traditional advertisements.The media giant, apparently emboldened by the numbers, seems to be doubling down on shopping and expanding it even beyond the initiative’s original premise.Introduced in 2019, the company’s shoppable TV initiative began with QR codes on TV screens to funnel viewers into its e-commerce storefront. Over time it added to its lineup of shows, sporting events and products, eventually turning its attention to the metaverse. Last year’s virtual Bravo Bazaar preceded other announcements — most recently, it introduced new augmented reality features for immersive ad experiences and partnerships with virtual platforms such as Shop the Scenes, which will launch a “Today” show holiday pop-up.NBCU is betting on its passionate TV fan base to power it all. Indeed, fan communities have become a major priority for commerce platforms in general, especially given their propensity to drive activity and shopping in the virtual world.However, the metaverse is only one facet of BravoCon. Indeed, the multiplatform effort blends broadcast TV with real world, online and immersive virtual experiences, comprising a strategy that’s akin to an amplified version of omnichannel retail. But instead of merely fusing physical and digital platforms, the quadruple play adds more literal dimensionality to the equation.The takeaway: While some platforms and brands may still struggle with omnichannel retail or mull over their place in the metaverse, there’s a multiverse of shopping that’s already underway.]"

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Malibu Boats (MBUU) earns a Zacks Rank #3 24 days from its next quarterly earnings release on November 3, 2022, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.80 a share.Malibu Boats' Earnings ESP sits at 4.65%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.80 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.72.MBUU is just one of a large group of Consumer Discretionary stocks with a positive ESP figure. Comcast (CMCSA) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Comcast is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on October 27, 2022.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this software maker have returned -16.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -8.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Oracle falls in, has lost 9.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Oracle is expected to post earnings of $1.18 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -2.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -8.8%.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.97 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +1.4%. This estimate has changed -6.9% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.52 indicates a change of +11% from what Oracle is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Oracle is rated Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for ORCL _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Oracle, the consensus sales estimate of $12.05 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +16.3%. The $49.62 billion and $52.9 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +16.9% and +6.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryOracle reported revenues of $11.45 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.7%. EPS of $1.03 for the same period compares with $1.03 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.47 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.18%. The EPS surprise was -3.74%.Over the last four quarters, Oracle surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Oracle is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Oracle. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The ‘Public Storage’ brand is the most recognized and established name in the self-storage industry, with its presence in all the major metropolitan markets of the country.It is well-positioned to benefit from favorable self-storage industry fundamentals, investments in technology and a robust balance-sheet position.Analysts seem bullish on this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2022 funds from operations (FFO) per share indicates a favorable outlook as it has increased marginally over the past month to $15.73.Shares of PSA have lost 9.6% in the past three months, narrower than the industry's decline of 16.9%. Given its robust fundamentals and positive estimate revisions, the stock is likely to keep performing well in the quarters ahead, hence the dip offers a good entry point.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat Makes Public Storage a Solid Pick?Solid Industry Fundamentals: The self-storage asset category is basically need-based and recession-resilient in nature. This asset class has low capital-expenditure requirements and generates high operating margins. The favorable demographic changes continue to benefit this asset category. Particularly, the demand for storage facilities has increased, given the consumers' need to park their possessions amid migration and downsizing trends and a rise in the number of people renting homes. Also, work-from-home, study-from-home, elevated home sales and remodeling and the in-and-out migration of metropolitan markets have aided demand for storage facilities.Technology Investments: To achieve revenue optimization and cost efficiency, the company has invested heavily in technology over the past few years. To enhance its move-in experience, PSA started the “eRental®” process in 2020. Last year, the company launched the Public Storage App, offering customers a new tool to access their properties through smartphones. These provide PSA with a competitive edge over its peers.Acquisitions &amp; Development: Public Storage has been focusing on several acquisitions to maximize its growth opportunities. In the June quarter, Public Storage acquired 10 self-storage facilities comprising 0.7 million net rentable square feet of area for $123.6 million. Following Jun 30, 2022, it acquired or was under contract to acquire 24 self-storage facilities spanning 1.7 million net rentable square feet of space across 10 states for $257.4 million.As of Jun 30, 2022, PSA had several facilities in development (2.6 million net rentable square feet) with an estimated cost of $480.3 million and expansion projects (2.8 million net rentable square feet) worth $547.0 million.Moreover, for 2022, the company expects to carry out acquisitions of around $1 billion and $250 million of development openings.FFO Growth: Over the past three to five years, PSA recorded FFO per share growth of 6.03% compared with the industry’s average of 0.70%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the 2022 FFO per share implies a rise of 21.66% for 2022 compared with the industry’s average of 10.22%.Balance Sheet &amp; Cash Flow Strength: PSA has one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector with ample liquidity. It exited second-quarter 2022 with $1.01 billion of cash and equivalents. Also, it enjoys an “A” credit rating from Standard &amp; Poor’s and an “A2” from Moody’s, rendering it favorable access to the debt market. With enough financial flexibility, PSA is well-poised to capitalize on future growth opportunities.PSA’s current cash flow growth is projected at 39.58% compared with the 9.64% growth projected for the industry. Moreover, its trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) is 40.19% compared with the industry’s average of 3.60%. This reflects that the company is more efficient in using shareholders’ funds than its peers.Story continuesOther Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Life Storage LSI, CubeSmart CUBE and Xenia Hotels &amp; Resorts XHR.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Life Storage’s ongoing year’s FFO per share has been raised marginally over the past month to $6.39. LSI currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CubeSmart’s current-year FFO per share has moved 2.5% northward in the past two months to $2.50. CUBE holds a Zacks Rank #2 presently.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Xenia Hotels &amp; Resorts’ 2022 FFO per share has moved 7.4% upward in the past two months to $1.59.

Some of the major ice cream stocks that could benefit from this growth include McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), General Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS), and Bloomin' Brands, Inc. (NASDAQ:BLMN).

BT Brands, Inc. (NASDAQ:BTBD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: N/A    BT Brands, Inc. (NASDAQ:BTBD) owns and operates fast-food restaurants in the north central region of the United States. It is one of the best ice cream stocks to invest in. BT Brands, Inc. (NASDAQ:BTBD) recently revealed that it had acquired 11.1 million shares, representing a 41.4% stake, of Bagger Dave's Burger Tavern for $1.3 million, equating to $0.11 per share, from the founder and CEO Michael Ansley. Ansley agreed to cancel all voting preferred shares prior to completing the sale to BT Brands, Inc. (NASDAQ:BTBD).Story continuesJust like McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), General Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS), and Bloomin' Brands, Inc. (NASDAQ:BLMN), BT Brands, Inc. (NASDAQ:BTBD) is one of the best ice cream stocks to buy now. 9. Good Times Restaurants Inc. (NASDAQ:GTIM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 5   Good Times Restaurants Inc. (NASDAQ:GTIM) engages in the restaurant business in the United States. It is one of the top ice cream stocks to invest in. Good Times Restaurants Inc. (NASDAQ:GTIM) recently reported Q3 FY22 results, in line with expectations. The results show that profitability remains challenging for the firm due to commodity and labor inflation. Despite no long-term debt and healthy growth, the firm currently trades as a distressed asset at less than book value. On July 12, Good Times Restaurants Inc. (NASDAQ:GTIM) announced that same-store sales for its third quarter ended June 28 increased 1.6% for its Good Times brand from the same prior year quarter and increased 5.3% for its Bad Daddy's brand from the same prior year quarter.At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 5 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.7 million in Good Times Restaurants Inc. (NASDAQ:GTIM), compared to 5 in the preceding quarter worth $3.3 million. 8. Shake Shack Inc. (NYSE:SHAK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 17    Shake Shack Inc. (NYSE:SHAK) owns, operates, and licenses Shake Shack restaurants (Shacks) worldwide. It is one of the major ice cream stocks to invest in. The company posted earnings for the second quarter of 2022 on August 4, reporting earnings per share of $0.00, beating market estimates by $0.02. The revenue over the period was $230 million, up more than 23% compared to the revenue over the same period last year. The company also revealed that system-wide sales amounted to $351.7 million during the time, up 24.8% versus 2021.On August 08, Credit Suisse analyst Lauren Silberman kept a Neutral rating on Shake Shack Inc. (NYSE:SHAK) stock and lowered the price target to $61 from $72, noting that the company's Q2 print reflected top-line softness on a pullback in trends and delay in new unit openings, and a restaurant margin beat.At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 17 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $145.8 million in Shake Shack Inc. (NYSE:SHAK), compared to 21 in the previous quarter worth $217.9 million.In its Q3 2021 investor letter, Alger, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Shake Shack Inc. (NYSE:SHAK) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Shake Shack Inc. (NYSE:SHAK) was among the top detractors from performance. Shake Shack is a modern day “roadside” burger stand serving a classic American menu of premium burgers, hot dogs, crinkle cut fries, shakes, frozen custard, beer and wine. Founded by Danny Meyer’s Union Square Hospitality Group (“USHG”), Shake Shack was created by leveraging USHG’s expertise in sourcing premium ingredients, community building, hospitality, fine dining and restaurant operations. There are currently 339 locations, including restaurants in 32 U.S. states and the District of Columbia and 116 international locations in cities like London, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Singapore, the Philippines, Mexico, Istanbul, Dubai, Tokyo, Seoul and more.Shares of Shake Shack underperformed in the third quarter due to a slower-than-expected recovery in urban locations and a lower-than-expected margin outlook. Sales at Urban locations were still down 18% year over year in July compared to a 23% decline in May, a modest improvement but less than expectations. We believe a delay in return to work has caused a temporary stalling in the company’s margin recovery, but this should improve as urban mobility increases and tourism from foreigners normalizes. On margins, the company guided to 15%-17% restaurant-level margins, which was below expectations of 18.9%. This margin outlook factored in higher wage inflation, which the company will begin to offset with a 3.5% price increase in the coming months. We believe margin recovery can potentially follow a sales recovery so near-term revenue choppiness may result in margin weakness but we believe the company is well positioned for when the environment normalizes as the pandemic winds down. Ultimately, we believe the pandemic accelerated Shake Shack’s digital efforts, so the company is currently positioned to benefit from a strong online presence. Digital was only 12% of sales in the early months of 2020, but that increased to 47% as of the second quarter of this year.”7. Wingstop Inc. (NASDAQ:WING)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 20      Wingstop Inc. (NASDAQ:WING) franchises and operates restaurants under the Wingstop brand name. It is one of the elite ice cream stocks to invest in. Wingstop Inc. (NASDAQ:WING) recently announced that it would be introducing a chicken sandwich next month and is expected to benefit from Uber advertising support in the back half in this regard. The firm is also undergoing a multi-year year tech stack project that is appreciated from a cost/capex perspective but opens the door to collecting the type of tech fees common in the pizza industry that are not currently factored into consensus estimates. On September 12, Wedbush analyst Nick Setyan kept an Outperform rating on Wingstop Inc. (NASDAQ:WING) stock and raised the price target to $157 from $135, highlighting that the popularity of the chicken sandwich could transform Wingstop Inc. (NASDAQ:WING) long-term unit economics.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, London-based investment firm Fundsmith LLP is a leading shareholder in Wingstop Inc. (NASDAQ:WING), with 825 million shares worth more than $61 million.  In its Q2 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Wingstop Inc. (NASDAQ:WING) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Other new buys included Wingstop. Wingstop Inc. (NASDAQ:WING), meanwhile, in the consumer discretionary sector, is doing to chicken wings what Domino’s did to pizza. With a strong digital model, the franchise-based business has a long runway for growth with an existing base of 1,500 stores expanding to potentially 6,000 units and compelling franchisee economics.”6. Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21     Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) operates as a fast-moving consumer goods company. It is one of the premier ice cream stocks to invest in. Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) has implemented a new operating model and restated its historical results according to this model. The restated results confirm that some categories are struggling when it comes to their underlying volume growth and their profitability. However, the new operating model should lead to a more enterprising managerial culture that could help to fix Unilever's category-specific issues. On September 29, Morgan Stanley analyst Pinar Ergun initiated coverage of Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) stock with an Equal Weight rating and a $42.75 price target, highlighting that cost improvement and pricing actions suggest a margin recovery from fiscal 2023 and Unilever's valuation is attractive with the shares trading at a 15% discount to peers. At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 21 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $813 million in Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL), compared to 23 the preceding quarter worth $1.1 billion.In addition to McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), General Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS), and Bloomin' Brands, Inc. (NASDAQ:BLMN), Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) is one of the best ice cream stocks to buy according to hedge funds. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Polen Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Multinational consumer goods company Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) showed robust price increases overall, with minimal impact on volume, resulting in faster-than-expected sales growth during the quarter. Indeed, higher inflation can be a positive change for companies with favorable brands like Unilever as these conditions make it easier for the biggest brands to raise prices, continue spending on advertising, and take share. We believe the appointment of an activist investor to Unilever’s board in June will help spur additional growth.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Ice Cream Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested Articles:10 Best Fundamental Stocks To Buy10 Best Lumber Stocks To Invest In11 Best Motley Fool Stocks To Buy Now Disclosure.

(NYSE: AMT) stock sold last week that it gave up its market capitalization leadership status to Prologis Inc. (NYSE: PLD). Prologis shares sold as well (-1.22% for the week), but it didn’t come close to the dumping of American Tower shares (-8.69%).The market cap figures are important measures of value to those Wall Street analysts who keep track of which stock in a sector is at the top of the list. Naturally, it’s not the only value measurement that’s examined, but it’s key to the overall attractiveness or nonattractiveness of shares in a company. It’s a buy or sell decision factor.The total market capitalization for Prologis now comes to $92.4 billion. The total market capitalization for American Tower now comes to $89.6 billion. It may not seem like a huge difference — and it’s not — but it’s the fact that Prologis now appears above rather than below American Tower on analysts’ lists for the big real estate investment trusts (REITs).Take a look at the weekly price chart for Prologis:Notice how it’s just barely closed beneath the stock’s 200-week moving average (the red line).Now take a look at the weekly price chart for American Tower:Note the difference in magnitude compared to the Prologis weekly price chart. This one shows a drop well below the 200-week moving average and each red bar of selling for the past four weeks is a tremendous downward move.This activity has resulted in a change in market cap leadership for the big names in the real estate investment trust sector.Market capitalization is figured by multiplying the total number of shares a company has times the price of the stock.For comparison’s sake, the market cap of Apple Inc.

RHI has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 3.6%.Factors That Augur WellRobert Half’s current ratio (a measure of liquidity) stood at 2.32 at the end of second-quarter 2022, higher than 1.76 recorded at the end of the prior quarter and the prior-year quarter’s 1.72. The gradually increasing current ratio bodes well for RHI. Moreover, a current ratio of more than 1.5 is usually considered good for a company. This may imply that the risk of default is less.Robert Half offers risk consulting, internal audit and information technology consulting services through its wholly-owned subsidiary Protiviti, which is in great shape. Protiviti is firmly positioned in the market and currently boasts a healthy margin in double digits and grosses revenues. For the second quarter of 2022, Protiviti’s revenues came in at $497 million, up 11% year over year on an as-adjusted basis. The U.S. Protiviti revenues of $396 million increased 8% year over year on an adjusted basis. Non-U.S. Protiviti revenues of $101 million rose 21% year over year on an as-adjusted basis.Commitment to shareholder returns prompts Robert Half a reliable way for investors to compound wealth over the long term. In 2021, RHI paid out $170.6 million of dividends and repurchased shares worth $287.7 million. In 2020, Robert Half paid out $155.9 million of dividends and repurchased shares worth $159.1 million. Such shareholder-friendly initiatives not only instill investors’ confidence in the stock but also positively impact a company's earnings per share.A Key RiskRobert Half is witnessing an increase in expenses due to the rise in staff compensation costs and heavy investments in technology initiatives.

It might be that many expect the strong earnings performance to wane, which has kept the P/E from rising. If not, then existing shareholders have reason to be feeling optimistic about the future direction of the share price. Check out our latest analysis for United Parcel Service peKeen to find out how analysts think United Parcel Service's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.How Is United Parcel Service's Growth Trending?United Parcel Service's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's only expected to deliver moderate growth, and importantly, perform in line with the market.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 79%. The strong recent performance means it was also able to grow EPS by 130% in total over the last three years. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably welcomed those medium-term rates of earnings growth.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 3.6% per annum over the next three years. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 9.5% each year, which is noticeably more attractive.With this information, we find it interesting that United Parcel Service is trading at a fairly similar P/E to the market. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly limited growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. These shareholders may be setting themselves up for future disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On United Parcel Service's P/EUsing the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.We've established that United Parcel Service currently trades on a higher than expected P/E since its forecast growth is lower than the wider market. When we see a weak earnings outlook with slower than market growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the moderate P/E lower. Unless these conditions improve, it's challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.It's always necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 2 warning signs with United Parcel Service, and understanding these should be part of your investment process.You might be able to find a better investment than United Parcel Service.

The awards recognize revolutionary innovations to PPL Electric's wooden utility pole inspection process and its application of a distribution settings automation tool that increases the safety, reliability and efficiency of its electric grid. Both awards were presented on October 6 at the 2022 AEIC annual meeting in Scottsdale, Arizona.Pictured (from left to right) are: PPL Electric Utilities Project Manager Eric Resch, PPL Electric Utilities Vice President of Distribution Operations Sal Salet and PPL Electric Utilities Support Engineer Arun Doodnauth.""Becoming one of the top utilities in the country doesn't happen overnight,"" said PPL Electric Utilities President Steph Raymond. ""It takes innovation and a questioning mindset. That's what allows us to continue to find new ways of doing things and breakthroughs in processes in non-traditional places. These awards are perfect examples of our continuous drive to innovate on behalf of our customers.""For researching and implementing a technological leap in wooden utility pole inspections, PPL Electric was awarded the AEIC President's Award, the organization's highest recognition. Using resistance drill-based wood pole inspection technology, PPL Electric ran three pilot programs to map the extent of the condition for external decay, then developed and tested a new drill bit design, along with software improvements, to automatically calculate the exterior and interior decay.This comprehensive resistance drill-based inspection — which is unique to PPL Electric — has improved detection of pole failures and decay as well as reduced the cost and duration of inspections. What used to take a five-person crew a week to complete can now be accomplished in just two days with a two-person crew. The increased inspection efficiency allows PPL Electric to be more responsive to emergent needs and achieve annual inspection goals faster, more accurately, and at a lower cost.Story continuesPPL Electric also received an AEIC Achievement Award for its work in implementing an adaptive Distribution Protection Analysis Toolkit (DPAT) that automates processes and increases the safety, reliability, and efficiency of the electric grid.Through a supported partnership, PPL Electric used Electric Power Research Institute's (EPRI) DPAT to create an automated system that develops and routinely checks settings on its distribution network. This enables the overall system to work more efficiently and helps avoid unnecessary disruptions in service that could be caused by incorrect settings.In addition, the tool can identify gaps in settings, as well as in system design and configuration, to clear potential faults from the system. This helps prevent safety risks to employees, customers, and the public.""AEIC is proud to recognize PPL Electric Utilities with two awards this year for projects that significantly improve utility operations in key areas,"" said AEIC CEO Steve Hauser. ""Their unique approach to pole inspection leadership and innovation in power system analysis is improving operational efficiency exponentially.""PPL Electric Utilities delivers safe, reliable and affordable electricity to more than 1.4 million homes and businesses in eastern and central Pennsylvania.

Robust product demand, e-commerce strength and its Neighbor's Club loyalty program have been contributing to its strong performance for the past several quarters. Sturdy demand for everyday merchandise, including consumable, usable and edible products, as well as year-round products, bodes well for TSCO’s comparable sales (comps) growth.However, TSCO has been witnessing rising inflationary and supply-chain issues. Higher product cost inflation and transportation costs have been hurting Tractor Supply’s gross margin.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TSCO’s 2022 sales and earnings suggests growth of 10.7% and 11.3%, respectively. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 10.2%.Backed by robust trends, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has outperformed the industry and the sector in the past year. Shares of TSCO have gained 0.6% in a year against the industry and the sector’s declines of 23.1% and 27.3%, respectively. The stock also compares favorably with the S&amp;P 500’s decline of 17.6% in the same period. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Factors Aiding GrowthTractor Supply is expected to retain its momentum in the quarters ahead, driven by its efforts to integrate its physical and digital operations to offer consumers a seamless shopping experience. The company’s ‘ONETractor’ strategy, aimed at connecting stores and online shopping, has been a key driver. TSCO’s omni-channel investments include curbside pickup, same-day and next-day delivery, a re-launched website, and a new mobile app. Management is likely to reach more than $2 billion in sales by 2026.The company has been progressing well with its Life Out Here Strategy, which is based on five key pillars — customers, digitization, execution, team members and total shareholder return. Earlier, TSCO launched the Field Activity Support Team and implemented various technology and service enhancements across the enterprise.As part of the plans, the company revised the long-term financial growth targets for 2022-2026. Management envisions net sales growth of 6-7%, while comps are expected to grow 4-5%. The operating margin is expected to be 10.1-10.6%, up from the earlier mentioned 9-9.5%. Earnings per share are likely to grow 8-11%, up from the previously stated 8-10%.Tractor Supply’s focus on its growth initiatives, which include the expansion of its store base and the incorporation of technological advancements to induce traffic and drive the top line, is another advantage. The company is on track with Project Fusion remodels and Side Lot transformation to remain nationally strong and locally relevant. This will also help improve store productivity by bringing the latest merchandising strategies to life. Management anticipates transforming the side lots into 100 locations in 2022. These have been significant investments in stores.Management remains optimistic about its growth prospects in 2022, driven by continued momentum in sales, cost-control measures and better inventory. The company expects net sales of $13.95-$14.05 billion for 2022, with comps growth of 5.2-5.8%. The operating margin is anticipated to be 10.2%. Net income is expected to be $1.07-$1.09, with earnings per share of $9.48-$9.60. The view does not include the impacts of the Orscheln Farm acquisition as it is currently subjected to customary closing conditions.Story continuesConclusionThe aforementioned strengths indicate that Tractor Supply is well-placed to retain momentum in the long term despite inflationary product costs, supply-chain issues and transportation costs.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other top-ranked stocks to consider — Ulta Beauty ULTA, Chico's FAS CHS and Designer Brands DBI.Ulta Beauty, a leading beauty retailer in the United States, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The company’s near-term prospect looks gloomy due to weakening demand for its chips used in gaming and data center end markets. While the macroeconomic headwinds are impacting gaming chip demand, ongoing supply-chain issues are also hurting data center chip market.The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine is likely to continue negatively impact NVIDIA’s near-term revenues. Trade war between the US and China also remains a key concern.However, solid uptake of artificial intelligence-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions is likely to aid NVIDIA growth. Additionally, collaboration with the likes of Mercedes-Benz and Audi is expected to further strengthen NVIDIA’s presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Pfizer's shares have gained +0.6% over the past year against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry’s gain of +5.6%.

The elimination of overdraft fees will impede fee income growth in the near term.However, Citigroup’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the trailing four quarters. It is progressing with its strategy to exit the global consumer banking business. With this, it will focus on institutional franchises, thereby improving long-term profitability.The bank also intends to wind down its UK retail banking business, and expand personal banking and wealth management businesses in the region.

The company currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Vertex’s main area of focus is cystic fibrosis (CF). With its four CF medicines, Vertex is treating the majority of the 83,000 patients living with CF in the United States, Europe, Canada and Australia.Vertex’s CF sales growth is primarily driven by higher sales of Trikafta (marketed as Kaftrio in Europe). Trikafta sales in 2022 are being driven by strong uptakes in international markets as well as additional patients starting treatment with Trikafta, most notably pediatric patients (6-11 years of age) in the United States.In the second half of the year, Vertex expects continued robust sales of Kaftrio/Trikafta in international markets, following new reimbursements recently secured in France, Spain and Italy.Meanwhile, Vertex is evaluating its CF medicines in younger patient populations and aims to have small-molecule treatments for approximately 90% of people with CF. Additionally, Vertex is pursuing genetic therapies to address the remaining 10% of CF patients, including an mRNA approach in partnership with Moderna MRNA.Vertex and Moderna plan to begin clinical development of their CFTR mRNA therapy in 2022/2023.While Vertex’s main focus is on the development and strengthening of its CF franchise, the company also has a rapidly advancing mid- to late-stage pipeline in six additional diseases beyond CF like acute pain, sickle cell disease, beta-thalassemia, APOL1-mediated kidney diseases (AMKD) and cell therapy for type I diabetes. Many of these candidates represent multibillion-dollar opportunities. Programs in five disease areas are entering or progressing through late-stage clinical development. Multiple late-stage projects established proof-of-concept when data were released this year.Vertex is co-developing a gene-editing treatment, exa-cel (formerly CTX001), in partnership with CRISPR Therapeutics CRSP, in two devastating diseases — sickle cell disease and thalassemia. Vertex will submit its biologics licensing application for exa-cel to the FDA on a rolling basis, beginning in November 2022 and expects to complete the submission by the end of the first quarter of 2023. In Europe, Vertex will submit its marketing application by the end of 2022. Vertex expects exa-cel to be its next commercial launch.Story continuesIn April, Vertex increased its investment in collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics. Per the amended deal, Vertex will lead the global development and future commercialization of CTX001.Inaxaplin (formerly VX-147) is being developed in a single pivotal phase II/III study in patients with APOL1-mediated kidney disease, or AMKD, with two APOL1 mutations and proteinuric kidney disease. Enrollment is ongoing, with more than 30 sites active in the United States. In June 2022, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to inaxaplin for treating APOL1-mediated focal segmental glomerulosclerosis based on phase II proof-of-concept data, which showed a 47.6% reduction in proteinuria.VX-548, a novel first-in-class, non-opioid NaV1.8 inhibitor, is being evaluated in two phase II acute pain studies, one following bunionectomy surgery and the other following abdominoplasty surgery. In March 2022, Vertex announced positive data from the two-phase II studies on VX-548. The studies demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful relief of pain and established proof of concept for VX-548. Based on this data, the company plans to advance VX-548 into pivotal phase III development for acute pain in the fourth quarter of 2022.A phase I/II study is ongoing on VX-880, Vertex’s stem cell-derived fully differentiated islet cell replacement therapy for the treatment of type I diabetes with impaired hypoglycemic awareness and severe hypoglycemia. The program was placed on a clinical hold by the FDA in May, based on insufficient information for dose escalation, data available from the two patients treated at half dose demonstrated proof-of-concept. In July, the FDA lifted the clinical hold and the study resumed enrollment in the United States. Three patients have been treated in the phase I/II study to date.ConclusionVertex’s dependence on just the CF franchise for commercial revenues is a concern. It needs a growth opportunity outside CF. Vertex’s non-CF programs carry significant risks, which is a concern.Nonetheless, a consistent rise in CF sales, the rapid progress of non-CF pipeline candidates, minimal competition in its core CF franchise and regular business development should keep the stock afloat going forward.Stock to ConsiderAnother stock in the drug/biotech sector worth considering is Agenus AGEN, with a Zacks Rank #1.

Historically, dividend stocks have performed well during times of financial instability.

In this regard, companies like The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are gaining ground among investors due to their long dividend growth streaks.Studies conducted in the past show that dividends contributed significantly to overall returns of the market. According to a report published by London Business School and Credit Suisse in 2011, the total annual average return of the US stock market from 1900 to 2011 was 5%. However, reinvested dividends took the total return to 9.4%. The report also mentioned that for long-term investors, dividends stocks are the most reliable option. Another research by Danske Capital showed that in the last ten bull markets from 2005 to 2015, dividend-paying stocks outperformed their non-dividend peers by an average of 3% per year.With rising interest rates and high inflation this year, investors are preferring dividend stocks over other asset classes. The returns of dividend stocks also comply with investors’ inclination toward them.

Coca-Cola (KO), which belongs to the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This world's largest beverage maker has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 7.41%.For the last reported quarter, Coke came out with earnings of $0.70 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.67 per share, representing a surprise of 4.48%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.58 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.64 per share, delivering a surprise of 10.34%.Price and EPS SurpriseWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Coke. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Coke currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.39%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on October 25, 2022.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Bear Market Stocks to Buy Now. The ongoing hawkish interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and inflationary pressures from high oil prices and the Russian invasion of Ukraine have decimated the stock market and led to a bearish rally that has resulted in major stock indexes bleeding one third of their value year to date just as they had started to recover from the coronavirus pandemic.Such an environment merits a cautious investment approach and careful stock picking, as it requires the investor to sift out companies with stable cash flows or products that are expected to withstand recessionary pressures. The latter is especially important since interest rate hikes will lead to a recession - and analysts right now only differ about its timing.Ken Fisher, the founder of the renowned hedge fund Fisher Investments, shared his thoughts and commented that even though the market is wary of consistent interest hikes, it increases the motivation for banks to lend. Mr. Fisher outlined that:So let me just say that when I was very young before I was an adult, Milton Friedman was saying that the central banks fiddling with interest rates thinking they can predict what that will do to the economy is beyond ridiculous and mostly, it doesn't allow you to impact the economy very directly. When I was young, the deposit base the banks lend off of was overwhelmingly, time deposits cost them money, and the spread between what they took money in at and what they lend it out at was a form of a gross margin, and the bigger that spread, the eager they became to lend the more that it was small i.e. the flattened or inverted yield curve, the less they were. But today 93% of U.S. bank lending base is interest free, free money, so the more the Federal Reserve raises rates, the more it increases the incentive of banks to lend. Which is, again, something I don't see why they don't understand that. But if you look at this period, the more inflation's gone up, the more corporate margins have gone up. Analogous not understood. Share buybacks remain strong, corporate bond spread. . . uh commercial lending through September's up 11% year over year.Story continuesWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some top bear stocks, with the top three in our list being Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B).Photo by Chris Liverani on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe studied countless different firms out there to gauge their business models and markets, following which we sifted companies that are not significantly reliant on high incomes or purchasing power for their revenues.

(NYSE:WM) stock at an average price of US$168 per share allowing them to get the most out of their money. The company's market worth decreased by US$4.0b over the past week after the stock price dropped 5.8%, although insiders were able to minimize their lossesAlthough we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Waste Management Waste Management Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Executive VP &amp; COO, John Morris, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.4m worth of shares at a price of US$168 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$156. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.In the last year Waste Management insiders didn't buy any company stock.

While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insider OwnershipMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Waste Management insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$113m based on the recent share price.

However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Cincinnati Financial's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Cincinnati Financial How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Cincinnati Financial is:5.1% = US$542m ÷ US$11b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.05 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Cincinnati Financial's Earnings Growth And 5.1% ROEAt first glance, Cincinnati Financial's ROE doesn't look very promising. Next, when compared to the average industry ROE of 11%, the company's ROE leaves us feeling even less enthusiastic. However, we we're pleasantly surprised to see that Cincinnati Financial grew its net income at a significant rate of 25% in the last five years. Therefore, there could be other reasons behind this growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.Story continuesWe then compared Cincinnati Financial's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 14% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is CINF worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether CINF is currently mispriced by the market.Is Cincinnati Financial Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Cincinnati Financial's three-year median payout ratio is a pretty moderate 29%, meaning the company retains 71% of its income. So it seems that Cincinnati Financial is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees impressive growth in its earnings (discussed above) and pays a dividend that's well covered.Moreover, Cincinnati Financial is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 54% over the next three years. Still, forecasts suggest that Cincinnati Financial's future ROE will rise to 8.4% even though the the company's payout ratio is expected to rise. We presume that there could some other characteristics of the business that could be driving the anticipated growth in the company's ROE.ConclusionIn total, it does look like Cincinnati Financial has some positive aspects to its business. Despite its low rate of return, the fact that the company reinvests a very high portion of its profits into its business, no doubt contributed to its high earnings growth. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

The company’s earnings were in line with the estimate in the last reported quarter.Factors to NoteProgressive is a leading auto insurer in the United States and the largest seller of motorcycle policies. PGR is a market leader in commercial auto insurance and one of the top 15 homeowner carriers based on premiums written.Net premiums earned in the third quarter are likely to have benefited from a compelling product portfolio, a leadership position, strength in the Vehicle and Property businesses, healthy policies in force and solid retention. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net premiums earned is pegged at $12.7 billion, suggesting growth of 11.9% from the year-ago reported number. We estimate net premiums earned of $12.9 billion in the to-be-reported quarter.Policies in force are likely to have improved, given the focus on segmentation and prudent risk selection. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for personal lines policies in force stands at 24 million, indicating an improvement of 4.1% from the year-ago reported figure. We estimate policies in force of 25 million in the to-be-reported quarter.PGR’s personal auto business is likely to have benefited from its focus on marketing and competitive product offerings and strong market presence.Higher-invested asset base and a higher interest rate likely have aided net investment income. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at $281 million, up 35.1% from the year-ago reported quarter. We estimate a net investment income of $220.6 million in the to-be-reported quarter.Improved premiums, an increase in service revenues and fees and other revenues might have contributed to the improvement in revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues stands at $13.2 billion, suggesting year-over-year growth of approximately 11.3%.Expenses might have risen on a higher loss and loss-adjustment expenses, policy acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses.

321,6d4bc1f0-b43a-3935-b412-f208d3aed968,VLO,2022-10-11,What Makes Valero Energy (VLO) a Strong Momentum Stock: Buy Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/makes-valero-energy-vlo-strong-160004938.html,1665417604,STORY,['VLO'],"[Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Valero Energy (VLO), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Valero Energy currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if VLO is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this oil refiner holds up.Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.For VLO, shares are up 6.24% over the past week while the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry is up 4.18% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 0.41% compares favorably with the industry's 0.22% performance as well.Story continuesWhile any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Shares of Valero Energy have increased 8.79% over the past quarter, and have gained 44.76% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved -6.33% and -15.85%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to VLO's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. VLO is currently averaging 4,341,239 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with VLO.Over the past two months, 4 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost VLO's consensus estimate, increasing from $26.94 to $27.55 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 5 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period.Bottom LineTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that VLO is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Valero Energy on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

322,a1300535-a126-3957-b83b-7fb6053f62fd,VLO,2022-10-11,Wall Street Analysts Believe Valero Energy (VLO) Could Rally 27%: Here's is How to Trade,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-analysts-believe-valero-135501989.html,1665410101,STORY,"['VLO', 'TGT']","[Shares of Valero Energy (VLO) have gained 0.4% over the past four weeks to close the last trading session at $113.78, but there could still be a solid upside left in the stock if short-term price targets of Wall Street analysts are any indication. Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $144.18 indicates a potential upside of 26.7%.The mean estimate comprises 11 short-term price targets with a standard deviation of $14.48. While the lowest estimate of $120 indicates a 5.5% increase from the current price level, the most optimistic analyst expects the stock to surge 45.9% to reach $166. It's very important to note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is a much-coveted metric for investors, solely banking on this metric to make an investment decision may not be wise at all. That's because the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable.But, for VLO, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view. While a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't gauge how much a stock could gain, it has proven to be powerful in predicting an upside.Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseZacks Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart for VLOHere's What You May Not Know About Analysts' Price TargetsAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?Story continuesThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Why VLO Could Witness a Solid UpsideThere has been increasing optimism among analysts lately about the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher. And that could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current year, four estimates have moved higher over the last 30 days while one has gone lower. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased 3.3%.Moreover, VLO currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much VLO could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

323,fab182ed-460f-38d2-921f-dd33c771f395,VLO,2022-10-11,Why Fast-paced Mover Valero Energy (VLO) Is a Great Choice for Value Investors,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-fast-paced-mover-valero-125012926.html,1665406212,STORY,['VLO'],"[Momentum investing is essentially the opposite of the tried-and-tested Wall Street adage -- ""buy low and sell high."" Investors following this investing style typically avoid betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. They believe instead that one could make far more money in lesser time by ""buying high and selling higher.""Everyone likes betting on fast-moving trending stocks, but it isn't easy to determine the right entry point. These stocks often lose momentum when their future growth potential fails to justify their swelled-up valuation. In that phase, investors find themselves invested in shares that have limited to no upside or even a downside. So, betting on a stock just by looking at the traditional momentum parameters could be risky at times.It could be safer to invest in bargain stocks that have been witnessing price momentum recently. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, is pretty useful in identifying great momentum stocks, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.Valero Energy (VLO) is one of the several great candidates that made it through the screen. While there are numerous reasons why this stock is a great choice, here are the most vital ones:A dash of recent price momentum reflects growing interest of investors in a stock. With a four-week price change of 0.4%, the stock of this oil refiner is certainly well-positioned in this regard.While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. VLO meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 8.8% over the past 12 weeks.Moreover, the momentum for VLO is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.62. This indicates that the stock moves 62% higher than the market in either direction.Story continuesGiven this price performance, it is no surprise that VLO has a Momentum Score of A, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.In addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped VLO earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, VLO is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. VLO is currently trading at 0.29 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 29 cents for each dollar of sales.So, VLO appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.In addition to VLO, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.However, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past.

Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $80.72 billion, up 11.59% from the year-ago period.UNH's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $21.86 per share and revenue of $322.21 billion.

(NASDAQ:ADP) as an investment opportunity by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Automatic Data Processing The ModelWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.27bUS$4.56bUS$5.44bUS$5.01bUS$5.31bUS$5.47bUS$5.62bUS$5.76bUS$5.90bUS$6.03bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 3.09%Est @ 2.74%Est @ 2.5%Est @ 2.33%Est @ 2.22% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.2% US$4.0kUS$4.0kUS$4.5kUS$3.9kUS$3.9kUS$3.8kUS$3.7kUS$3.5kUS$3.4kUS$3.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$38bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 1.9%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.0b× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (6.2%– 1.9%) = US$143bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$143b÷ ( 1 + 6.2%)10= US$78bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$116b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$227, the company appears about fair value at a 19% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Automatic Data Processing as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.014. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

However, reinvested dividends took the total return to 9.4%. The report also mentioned that for long-term investors, dividends stocks are the most reliable option. Another research by Danske Capital showed that in the last ten bull markets from 2005 to 2015, dividend-paying stocks outperformed their non-dividend peers by an average of 3% per year.With rising interest rates and high inflation this year, investors are preferring dividend stocks over other asset classes.

335,5b420628-2d27-3b4e-ae95-445df90dfcad,UDR,2022-10-11,Here's Why UDR (UDR) is Poised for a Turnaround After Losing 20.7% in 4 Weeks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-udr-udr-poised-133501267.html,1665408901,STORY,['UDR'],"[A downtrend has been apparent in UDR (UDR) lately with too much selling pressure. The stock has declined 20.7% over the past four weeks. However, given the fact that it is now in oversold territory and Wall Street analysts are majorly in agreement about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier, the stock could be due for a turnaround.Here is How to Spot Oversold StocksWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Why a Trend Reversal is Due for UDRThe RSI reading of 26.02 for UDR is an indication that the heavy selling could be in the process of exhausting itself, so the stock could bounce back in a quest for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.The RSI value is not the only factor that indicates a potential turnaround for the stock in the near term. On the fundamental side, there has been strong agreement among the sell-side analysts covering the stock in raising earnings estimates for the current year. Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for UDR has increased 0.1%. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Moreover, UDR currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Eaton in FocusHeadquartered in Dublin, Eaton (ETN) is an Industrial Products stock that has seen a price change of -20.83% so far this year. The power management company is paying out a dividend of $0.81 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.37% compared to the Manufacturing - Electronics industry's yield of 1% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.81%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $3.24 is up 6.6% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Eaton has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 5.23%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Eaton's payout ratio is 47%, which means it paid out 47% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, ETN expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 is $7.55 per share, with earnings expected to increase 14.05% from the year ago period.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.High-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, ETN is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

AWK has announced that its unit, New Jersey American Water, will invest $10 million to replace nearly 4 miles of aging water mains in the Leonardo section of Middletown, NJ.New Jersey American Water will replace the old water mains installed during the 1930s with new 6- and 8-inch ductile iron mains. The proper upgrade and maintenance of water mains will ensure an adequate potable water supply for its customers.The company has been upgrading and maintaining its water and wastewater infrastructure methodically by replacing old water mains. It plans to remove all aging lead and galvanized service lines by 2031 and provide high-quality services to 2.8 million people in the state.Aging Infrastructure – A ConcernPer the findings of the American Society of Civil Engineers (“ASCE”), water main breaks occur every two minutes in the United States due to the aging of the existing water infrastructure. Per the ASCE finding, due to the delay in essential pipeline repairs and maintenance, 2.1 trillion gallons of treated water is lost every year in the United States. It is evident from the findings of ASCE that a substantial portion of the U.S. water infrastructure has aged and is nearing the end of its effective service life. The repair and upgrade of miles of aging pipelines are essential to maintain quality water service. A delay in repair could cause frequent disruptions in the 24x7 supply of potable water services.Per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, investments of $473 billion and $271 billion are necessary to maintain and expand drinking water pipelines and wastewater pipelines, respectively, to meet the demand over the next 20 years. Water infrastructure, like overhead storage tanks and water purifying units, needs maintenance at proper intervals.Utilities Making Systematic InvestmentGiven the above-mentioned scenario, it is evident that systematic investment to upgrade and maintain the old infrastructure and make provisions for adding new infrastructure will assist the operators in meeting the rising customer demand. Water utilities are making systematic investments to replace and upgrade their aging water infrastructure.American Water plans to invest $13-$14 billion between 2022 and 2026, and $28-$32 billion between 2022 and 2031 to upgrade and strengthen the existing water and wastewater infrastructure. Water utilities like California Water Service Group CWT, Essential Utilities WTRG and Middlesex Water MSEX have well-chalked-out capital investment plans to strengthen their infrastructures.California Water Service has more than $1 billion in capital expenditure planned for 2022-2024. The current dividend yield of the company is 1.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CWT’s 2023 earnings indicates year-over-year growth of 14.3%. The current dividend yield of California Water Service is 1.9%. California Water Service currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Essential Utilities aims to invest $3 billion through 2024 to strengthen water and natural gas operations. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WTRG’s 2022 and 2023 earnings indicates year-over-year growth of 6.6% and 6.7%, respectively. The long-term (three to five years) earnings growth of WTRG is currently pegged at 6.1%. The current dividend yield of Essential Utilities is 2.8%. Essential Utilities currently has a Zacks Rank #2.Middlesex Water plans to invest $229 million during 2022-2024 to strengthen its water and wastewater infrastructure to provide services to customers in a safe, reliable and efficient manner. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MSEX’s 2022 and 2023 earnings indicates year-over-year growth of 15.5% and 10.5%, respectively. MSEX’s current dividend yield is 1.5%.

350,1bfeb601-7974-3d93-9824-16acaf7a3caa,FCX,2022-10-11,Okta and Freeport-McMoRan have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/okta-freeport-mcmoran-highlighted-zacks-130601642.html,1665407161,STORY,"['OKTA', 'FCX', 'BLK', 'ASB-PF']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – October 10, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares Okta OKTA as the Bull of the Day and Freeport-McMoRan FCX asthe Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on BlackRock, Inc. BLK, JPMorgan JPM and Associated Banc-Corp ASB.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:Okta is a $9 billion provider of identity security for enterprises. This is a key service where password security is a continuous vulnerability point.Primary products consist of Okta IT and Okta for Developers. Okta IT Products include Single Sign-On, Mobility Management, Adaptive Multi-Factor Authentication, Lifecycle Management and Universal Directory.Okta for Developers includes Complete Authentication, User Management, Application Programming Interface Access Management and Developer Tools.Estimates Higher, Stock Clobbered After Quarter Confusion and Management MovesOn August 31, Okta reported second-quarter fiscal 2023 adjusted loss of 10 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 66.67%. The company had reported a loss of 11 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.Total revenues surged 43.2% year over year to $451.8 million and surpassed the consensus mark by 4.93%. The upside can be attributed to higher subscription revenues.Subscription revenues (96.4% of total revenues) surged 43.6% year over year to $435.4 million. Professional services and other revenues (3.6% of total revenues) increased 32.7% year over year to $16.4 million.While the company's Q2 revenue was solid, leading indicators slipped and expectations for second half billings were lowered as Okta is facing some sales integration challenges with the recent Auth0 acquisition, with heightened attrition and some product confusion, to say nothing of a surprising sabbatical announcement from the COO.And the implied growth of 19% from management projections is down from 27%.OKTA shares got hit for 34% on September 1 after this report.Story continuesAnalysts Run In the AftermathThe reactions after the quarter have been interesting. While this year's EPS estimates naturally had to move higher on the big positive earnings surprise, there were upward revisions into next year too despite the company re-evaluating out-year targets.Next year's consensus leaped higher from a loss of 60-cents to a loss of only 31-cents.But analysts also downgraded the stock across the board on other factors.Stifel analyst Adam Borg lowered the firm's price target on Okta to $85 from $115 and kept a Hold rating on the shares following a ""disappointing quarter"" that included go-to-market integration and execution issues with Okta/Auth0.Borg also noted the uncertainty around COO/Co-founder Kerrest taking a one-year sabbatical, Chief Product Officer Jolly leaving the company, a lowering of fiscal year billings guidance and the re-evaluating of its existing FY26 targets.He continues to believe Okta is going after a large identity market opportunity and said the ""valuation is not overly demanding,"" but Borg views the stock as ""squarely in the penalty box.""Mizuho analyst Gregg Moskowitz lowered the firm's price target on Okta to $110 from $150 and kept a Buy rating on the shares after the company reported ""mixed"" Q2 results and lowered its FY23 billings outlook, due largely to sales integration challenges associated with core OKTA and Auth0.While ""disappointed"" by the results and outlook, Moskowitz notes Okta's valuation and its position as""the leader in the critically important"" identity/access management market.BTIG analyst Gray Powell lowered the firm's price target on Okta to $117 from $152 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. The company's Q2 results were ""mixed"" with a slight beat on current RPO offset by issues with Auth0 integration, sales attrition, and a weak macro environment driving a cut in its FY23 billings guidance.Powell concluded that while he was disappointed by the quarter, he remains positive on Okta's 25% long-term growth story and was also ""somewhat encouraged"" by the company's increased focus on improved profitability.Morgan Stanley analyst Hamza Fodderwala downgraded Okta to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $93, down from $150. While Fodderwala still views Okta as a long-term share winner in Identity and Access Management, which the analyst identifies as ""a large and rapidly growing market opportunity,"" recent sales execution issues and ongoing challenges with respect to integrating the Auth0 acquisition from last year leave the company without an effective go-to-market vehicle.Fodderwala says the company strategic advantage ""will take time to recover."" Sales execution issues, challenges with M&amp;A integration and a tough macro backdrop add up to leave limited visibility on a return to stabilization.Finally, on September 15, Jefferies analyst Joseph Gallo initiated coverage of Okta with a Buy rating and $90 price target. The stock's 73% decline year-to-date on ""myriad issues,"" including the cyber incident, macro environment and sales integration, is an ""overcorrection.""Gallo sees an attractive entry point for a ""leading cyber asset."" He believes Okta has a ""fantastic product"" with a ""large and underpenetrated"" market.Bottom line on OKTA: With its unique market position, and buoyant topline growth of 28%, Okta should be a good long-term investment as it falls back to levels not seen since December of 2018.Bear of the Day:In late July, Freeport-McMoRan came out with quarterly earnings of $0.58 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.76 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.77 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -23.68%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this $40 billion mining company would post earnings of $0.88 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.07, delivering a surprise of 21.59%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Freeport-McMoRan, which belongs to the Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry, posted revenues of $5.42 billion for the quarter ended June 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15.48%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $5.75 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.Freeport-McMoRan recorded net income of $840 million or 57 cents per share in second-quarter 2022, down from $1,083 million or 73 cents in the year-ago quarter.Company and Quarter DetailsBased in Phoenix, AZ, Freeport-McMoRan Inc., formerly Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc., is engaged in mineral exploration and development, including mining and milling of copper, gold, molybdenum and silver, as well as the smelting and refining of copper concentrates.The company conducts its operations primarily through its principal operating subsidiaries, PT Freeport Indonesia (PT-FI), Freeport-McMoRan Corporation (formerly Phelps Dodge) and Atlantic Copper.PT Freeport Indonesia’s principal asset is Papua, Indonesia-based Grasberg mine, which contains the world’s largest copper and gold reserves.Barring one-time items, adjusted earnings per share came in at 58 cents, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 76 cents.Revenues declined roughly 5.8% year over year to $5,416 million. The figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6,407.8 million.Copper production rose 17.7% year over year to 1,075 million pounds in the second quarter.Consolidated sales from mines rose 17% year over year to 1,087 million pounds of copper. The company sold 476,000 ounces of gold and 20 million pounds of molybdenum during the quarter.Consolidated average unit net cash costs per pound of copper were $1.41, down about 4.7% year over year. The downside was caused by higher sales volume and by-product credits.The average realized price for copper was $4.03 per pound, down roughly 7.1% year over year. The average realized price per ounce for gold increased around 1.8% year over year to $1,827. The average realized price per pound for molybdenum was $19.44, up around 48.3% year over year.Financial PositionCash and cash equivalents at the end of the second quarter were $9,492 million, up 17.6% year over year. The company’s long-term debt was $10,054 million, up around 10.8% year over year.Cash flows provided by operations were $3,312 million for the six months ended Jun 30, 2022.GuidanceFor 2022, Freeport anticipates consolidated sales volumes to be roughly 4.2 billion pounds of copper.The company also expects gold sales volumes of 1.7 million ounces for 2022. It also expects sales of 80 million pounds of molybdenum for the year.For the third quarter of 2022, Freeport expects sales volumes to be 1 billion pounds of copper, 400,000 ounces of gold and 21 million pounds of molybdenum.As this guidance has been digested, FCX has seen EPS estimates move 30% lower for this year and 35% lower for next year, pushing the stock into the cellar of the Zacks Rank.Additional content:Why Is an Earnings Beat Less Likely for BlackRock (BLK) in Q3?BlackRock, Inc. is slated to report third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 13, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings for the quarter are expected to have witnessed year-over-year declines.In second-quarter 2022, BLK’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were adversely impacted by an unfavorable operating backdrop, leading to lower revenues and assets under management (AUM) balance. A modest decline in expenses was a tailwind.BlackRock has an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering a surprise of 4%, on average.BlackRock, Inc. price-eps-surprise | BlackRock, Inc. QuoteThe company’s business activities and prospects in the to-be-reported quarter have not encouraged analysts to revise earnings estimates upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BlackRock’s third-quarter earnings of $8.19 has been revised 1.1% lower over the past 30 days. The figure indicates a decline of 25.2% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for earnings is $9.16.The consensus estimate for third-quarter sales is pegged at $4.52 billion, which suggests a decline of 10.5% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for sales is $4.69 billion.Before we take a look at what our quantitative model predicts for the to-be-reported quarter, let’s discuss the factors that are likely to have impacted the company’s quarterly performance.Key Factors &amp; Estimates for Q3BlackRock has been a dominant player in the exchange traded fund (“ETF”) market, given its continued investments in the U.S. iShare core ETFs. With investors increasing allocations toward ETFs instead of alternative investments to reduce management costs, the company’s iShares inflows have been strong over the past several quarters.Supported by expected asset inflows, BlackRock’s AUM balance is likely to have improved in the third quarter, positively impacting related fees. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total AUM is pegged at $8.78 trillion, suggesting a sequential rise of 3.4%. Our estimate for total AUM for the third quarter is $9.09 trillion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s investment advisory performance fees is pegged at $144 million, indicating a rise of 35.8% from the previous quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for performance fees is $207.7 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total investment advisory, administration fees and securities-lending revenues for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $3.60 billion, suggesting a sequential decline of 2.4%. Our estimate for the same is $3.74 billion.The consensus estimate for distribution fees of $383 million indicates a rise of 6.1% from the previous quarter’s reported figure. Our estimate for the same is $376.4 million.BlackRock’s expenses have been elevated over the past few years. Given that the company has been continuing with its restructuring initiatives to modify the size and shape of its workforce, and improve operating efficiency, overall costs are expected to have increased in the third quarter. Our estimate for third-quarter total expenses is $2.90 billion.Earnings WhispersAccording to our quantitative model, the chances of BlackRock beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings this time are low. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for BlackRock is -7.79%.Zacks Rank: The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Stocks Worth a LookA couple of finance stocks that you may want to consider as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases, per our model, are JPMorgan and Associated Banc-Corp.The Earnings ESP for JPMorgan is +2.50% and it carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. The company is slated to report third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 14.Associated Banc-Corp is scheduled to release third-quarter 2022 earnings on Oct 20. The company, which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present, has an Earnings ESP of +2.39%.

From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.Free: See Our Top Stock and 4 Runners Up &gt;&gt;Media ContactZacks Investment Research800-767-3771 ext. 9339https://www.zacks.comZacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for PepsiCo PepsiCo Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Vice Chairman, Hugh Johnston, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$6.0m worth of shares at a price of US$161 each. That means that even when the share price was slightly below the current price of US$162, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. We note that the biggest single sale was only 20% of Hugh Johnston's holding.In the last year PepsiCo insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.PepsiCo Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of PepsiCo shares. Specifically, insiders ditched US$900k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesDoes PepsiCo Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. PepsiCo insiders own 0.1% of the company, currently worth about US$316m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About PepsiCo Insiders?Insiders sold PepsiCo shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. But since PepsiCo is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 3 warning signs with PepsiCo and understanding these should be part of your investment process.But note: PepsiCo may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today presented late-breaking positive results from a Phase 3 trial evaluating the investigational use of Dupixent® (dupilumab) in children aged 1 to 11 years with active eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). The data will be shared at United European Gastroenterology (UEG) Week 2022 and submitted to regulatory authorities around the world, starting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) next year. In May 2022, Dupixent 300 mg weekly was approved by the FDA to treat EoE in people aged 12 years and older, weighing at least 40 kg.""Eosinophilic esophagitis impacts a child's fundamental ability to eat, which is especially critical in early childhood when healthy weight gain is vital to long-term health and development,"" said Mirna Chehade, M.D., Mount Sinai Center for Eosinophilic Disorders, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York and principal investigator of the trial. ""These Phase 3 data support the potential of dupilumab to reduce esophageal damage – caused in part by underlying type 2 inflammation – and showed histological disease remission and signs of weight gain impacting the growth percentile for those children on higher dose Dupixent.""As presented at UEG Week 2022, Dupixent led to significant improvements in the primary efficacy measure for higher (n=37) and lower (n=31) dose groups at 16 weeks in the randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial. Among children treated with Dupixent, 68% of patients on higher dose and 58% of patients on lower dose achieved the primary endpoint of significant histological disease remission, compared to 3% for placebo (both p&lt;0.0001). Children on the higher dose regimen also experienced significant improvements in abnormal endoscopic findings of their esophagus, with a reduction of 3.5 points compared to an increase of 0.3 points for placebo (p&lt;0.0001). Symptomatically, higher dose Dupixent led to a numerical improvement in the proportion of days children experienced disease symptoms from baseline as reported by their caregivers compared to placebo, though not statistically significant. Additionally, a prespecified exploratory analysis was presented which found higher dose Dupixent led to a 3.09 percentile increase in body weight for age percentile from baseline, compared to 0.29 for placebo.Story continuesSafety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved EoE indication for children and adults aged 12 years and older who weigh at least 40 kg. For the 16-week treatment period, the overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 79% (higher dose n=27/37, lower dose n=26/30) for Dupixent and 91% (n=31/34) for placebo. AEs most commonly observed with Dupixent (≥5%) compared to placebo included COVID-19 (higher dose n=5/37, lower dose n=9/30, placebo n=0/34; all cases were mild or moderate and did not lead to study discontinuation), rash (higher dose n=3/37, lower dose n=3/30, placebo n=2/34), headache (higher dose n=1/37, lower dose n=4/30, placebo n=1/34), viral gastroenteritis (higher dose n=4/37, lower dose n=0/30, placebo n=1/34), diarrhea (higher dose n=2/37, lower dose n=2/30, placebo n=1/34) and nausea (higher dose n=1/37, lower dose n=3/30, placebo n=0/34). Rates of treatment discontinuation due to AEs prior to week 16 were 0% (higher dose n=0/37, lower dose n=0/30) for Dupixent and 6% (n=2/34) for placebo.The potential use of Dupixent in children with EoE aged 1 to 11 years is currently under clinical development, and the safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About Eosinophilic EsophagitisEoE is a chronic inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. The results seen with Dupixent in adults and children with EoE demonstrate that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying this disease.In children, common symptoms of EoE include acid reflux, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, trouble swallowing, and a failure to thrive. These symptoms can impact growth, weight gain and development, and can cause food-related fear and anxiety which can persist through adulthood. Diet adjustments, which oftentimes include the elimination of many foods, are the standard treatment for EoE, as well as the use of treatments not approved for the disease in children. These include proton pump inhibitors, swallowed topical corticosteroids, or in severe cases, a feeding tube, which may be used to ensure proper caloric intake and weight gain.Of the approximately 21,000 children under the age of 12 in the U.S. currently being treated for EoE, about 9,000 do not satisfactorily respond to their current treatment regimen and potentially require advanced therapy.About the Dupixent Pediatric Eosinophilic Esophagitis Trial The Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in young children aged 1 to 11 years with EoE, as determined by histological, endoscopic and patient- or caregiver-reported measures. At baseline, 98% of these patients had at least one co-existing type 2 inflammatory disease such as food allergy, allergic rhinitis, asthma and atopic dermatitis.Patients received Dupixent subcutaneously at either a higher dose or lower dose regimen based on their weight (ranging from ≥5 kg to &lt;60 kg) over a 16-week period, at which point all endpoints were assessed. The dosing frequency ranged between every two weeks and every four weeks, based on weight.The primary endpoint was histological disease remission, which was defined as peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤6 eosinophils (eos)/high power field (hpf). Secondary endpoints included abnormal endoscopic findings (EoE Endoscopic Reference Score [EoE-EREFS] on a 0-18 scale), as well as changes in caregiver-reported symptoms (proportion of days with one or more EoE signs [e.g., stomach pain, vomiting, food refusal] by the Pediatric EoE Sign/Symptom Questionnaire-caregiver version [PESQ-C]). The PESQ-C is a novel endpoint developed by Regeneron and Sanofi used for the first time in this trial, designed to assess symptoms in young children through their caregivers (as signs), as children may have difficulty verbalizing their symptoms themselves. An exploratory endpoint assessed change from baseline in body weight for age percentile.The trial is ongoing with a 36-week extended active treatment period, followed by a 108-week open-label extension to evaluate long-term outcomes. These results, as well as more detailed lower dose results, will be presented or published in the future.About DupixentDupixent, which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology, is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials, establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), EoE and prurigo nodularis (PN).Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, CRSwNP, EoE or PN in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries, including in the European Union and Japan. More than 500,000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985, they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse, and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original, FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab), Dupixent, Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc), Praluent® (alirocumab), Kevzara® (sarilumab), Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb™ (atoltivimab, maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date, dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications, Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials, including pediatric EoE, hand and foot atopic dermatitis, chronic inducible urticaria-cold, chronic spontaneous urticaria, chronic pruritis of unknown origin, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation, chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis, allergic fungal rhinosinusitis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation, and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONS DUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical), or who cannot use topical therapies.

But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last five years have been pleasing. Its return of 73% has certainly bested the market return!While the stock has fallen 3.1% this week, it's worth focusing on the longer term and seeing if the stocks historical returns have been driven by the underlying fundamentals. View our latest analysis for Union Pacific There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, Union Pacific managed to grow its earnings per share at 15% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 12% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Union Pacific has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Union Pacific will grow revenue in the future.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Union Pacific's TSR for the last 5 years was 92%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveWhile it's never nice to take a loss, Union Pacific shareholders can take comfort that , including dividends,their trailing twelve month loss of 7.8% wasn't as bad as the market loss of around 22%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 14% for each year. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Union Pacific .Story continuesIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

(PRNewsFoto/Quest Diagnostics Incorporated)Published today in the Journal of Clinical Oncology (JCO) Clinical Cancer Informatics, an American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) journal, the study ""New Cancer Diagnoses Still Lagging in United States in Second Full Year of COVID-19 Pandemic"" analyzed rates of diagnoses of eight common types of cancer (prostate, breast, colorectal, lung, pancreatic, cervical, gastric and esophageal) of patients across the United States. Based on 1,144,879 deidentified results of diagnostic tests by Quest Diagnostics between January 2018 and March 2022, the study is believed to be the largest to evaluate the association of the pandemic on cancer diagnoses, based on objective laboratory data, in the United States.The analysis found that cancer diagnoses plummeted by close to 30% in the first few months of the pandemic in 2020, when much of society and healthcare shut down. While cancer diagnoses increased over the subsequent two years, the gains have not been enough to offset diagnoses delayed or missed earlier in the pandemic.The findings suggest more people are living with undiagnosed cancers now than prior to the pandemic. A delayed cancer diagnosis can lead to more advanced disease, more aggressive and costly treatment, and worse outcomes.The study follows unaffiliated research by the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) showing the death rate from cancer declined by 32% between 1991 and 2019, the year before the pandemic began, with gains ""attributed mainly to the unprecedented progress against lung, colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer[i].""Story continues""The decline in the cancer death rate over the past three decades is a major healthcare achievement. And yet, our more recent analysis shows the pandemic, by delaying cancer diagnoses, is putting these gains at risk,"" said co-author Harvey W. Kaufman, MD, Senior Medical Director and Head of the Health Trends Research Program for Quest Diagnostics.The latest Quest Diagnostics analysis builds on two studies published by the company's medical team in JAMA Open Network in 2020 and 2021.Among the key findings:From March through May 2020, the monthly number of new diagnoses fell 30% for the 8 cancer types: breast, colorectal, lung, pancreatic, cervical, gastric, esophageal, and prostate. Declines were significant for all cancer types.From June 2020 through March 2021, the number of diagnoses declined 15% compared to pre-pandemic levels.From April 2021 to March 2022 (period 3), the number of diagnoses declined 11% compared to pre-pandemic levels.Diagnoses of prostate and breast cancer remained significantly below pre-pandemic levels as late as period 3, at 17% and 11% respectively.""While restrictions to travel and healthcare services lifted by summer 2020, our analysis reveals that the pandemic's adverse influence on utilization of preventative care and cancer screenings continues this year,"" said co-author Yuri Fesko, MD, Vice President, Medical Affairs, Quest Diagnostics. ""As an oncologist, I am particularly disturbed by the finding that cancer diagnoses for breast and prostate cancer are well below pre-pandemic levels. We hope this study encourages people to resume regular preventive care and to move without delay to visit their physician if they suspect a health problem. Doing so may literally save your life.""The Quest Diagnostics analysis has implications for hospitals and health systems, which are experiencing an increase in mastectomies (for breast cancer) and longer hospital stays for patients with prostate cancer along with other conditions that could have been caught in routine screenings.[ii]""Hospitals and health systems are struggling to keep up with sicker patients requiring greater care, a trend that our analysis suggests may worsen, at least for some cancers,"" said Dr. Fesko.The study's strengths include large size, national representation and use of objective laboratory data, while limitations include lack of racial and ethnic data.More than 600,000 people are expected to die of cancer 2022. Breast and prostate cancer are expected to account for nearly 30% of new cancer diagnoses in 2022.[iii]About Quest Diagnostics Health Trends®Quest Diagnostics Health Trends® is a series of scientific reports that provide insights into health issues, based on patient laboratory data, to empower better patient care, population health management and public health policy.

While the stock has lost 5.2% over the past four weeks, it could witness a trend reversal as a hammer chart pattern was formed in its last trading session. This could mean that the bulls have been able to counteract the bears to help the stock find support.While the formation of a hammer pattern is a technical indication of nearing a bottom with potential exhaustion of selling pressure, rising optimism among Wall Street analysts about the future earnings of this financial services company is a solid fundamental factor that enhances the prospects of a trend reversal for the stock.1-month candlestick chart for AMPUnderstanding Hammer Chart and the Technique to Trade ItThis is one of the popular price patterns in candlestick charting. A minor difference between the opening and closing prices forms a small candle body, and a higher difference between the low of the day and the open or close forms a long lower wick (or vertical line). The length of the lower wick being at least twice the length of the real body, the candle resembles a 'hammer.'In simple terms, during a downtrend, with bears having absolute control, a stock usually opens lower compared to the previous day's close, and again closes lower. On the day the hammer pattern is formed, maintaining the downtrend, the stock makes a new low. However, after eventually finding support at the low of the day, some amount of buying interest emerges, pushing the stock up to close the session near or slightly above its opening price.When it occurs at the bottom of a downtrend, this pattern signals that the bears might have lost control over the price. And, the success of bulls in stopping the price from falling further indicates a potential trend reversal.Hammer candles can occur on any timeframe -- such as one-minute, daily, weekly -- and are utilized by both short-term as well as long-term investors.Like every technical indicator, the hammer chart pattern has its limitations. Particularly, as the strength of a hammer depends on its placement on the chart, it should always be used in conjunction with other bullish indicators.Story continuesHere's What Makes the Trend Reversal More Likely for AMPAn upward trend in earnings estimate revisions that AMP has been witnessing lately can certainly be considered a bullish indicator on the fundamental side. That's because empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for the current year has increased 0.1%. What it means is that the sell-side analysts covering AMP are majorly in agreement that the company will report better earnings than they predicted earlier.If this is not enough, you should note that AMP currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. And stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 usually outperform the market. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Moreover, the Zacks Rank has proven to be an excellent timing indicator, helping investors identify precisely when a company's prospects are beginning to improve.
