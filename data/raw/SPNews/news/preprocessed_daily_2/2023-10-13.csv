The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 86% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Texas Instruments. View our latest analysis for Texas Instruments ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Texas Instruments?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Texas Instruments already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Texas Instruments' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Texas Instruments is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.7% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.8% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.2% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 22 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Texas InstrumentsThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Texas Instruments Incorporated in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$175m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 14% stake in Texas Instruments. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Texas Instruments (at least 1 which is a bit concerning)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

The Style Scores can help you narrow down which stocks are better for your portfolio and which ones can beat the market over the long-term.Is This 1 Momentum Stock a Screaming Buy Right Now?For momentum investors, upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook take precedent, so they'll want to zero in on the Momentum Style Score.

5,f247ce61-9622-364e-8a8a-d48833077077,STT,2023-10-13,"Analysts Estimate BankUnited, Inc. (BKU) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-bankunited-inc-bku-140033788.html,1697119233,STORY,"['BKU', 'STT']","[BankUnited, Inc. (BKU) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 19. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.71 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -36.6%.Revenues are expected to be $239.38 million, down 7.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.58% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for BankUnited, Inc.For BankUnited, Inc.The Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.09%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that BankUnited, Inc. Will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that BankUnited, Inc. Would post earnings of $0.79 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.78, delivering a surprise of -1.27%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.BankUnited, Inc. Doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, State Street Corporation (STT) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.68 per share for the quarter ended September 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -7.7%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $2.92 billion, down 1.2% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for State Street Corporation has been revised 10.3% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -3.55%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that State Street Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:QRVO) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 88% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Qorvo. View our latest analysis for Qorvo ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Qorvo?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Qorvo does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Qorvo, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Qorvo. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 12%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.8% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.9% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 14 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of QorvoThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Qorvo, Inc.. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$66m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 11% stake in Qorvo. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past.

Hence, the current high interest rate regime is likely to have boosted the company’s quarterly net interest income (NII) and net interest margin (NIM).The Federal Reserve increased rates by 25 basis points in July and kept the rates unchanged at 5.25-5.5% during the September FOMC meeting. This is likely to have had a favorable impact on BofA’s NIM and NII.But the inverted yield curve and rising funding costs are expected to have weighed on both. Further, BAC’s billions of dollars’ worth of long-dated Treasuries and mortgage bonds, which it piled up at low rates that prevailed during the pandemic, are expected to have hampered NII and NIM growth in the quarter under review.Additionally, lending activities continued to slow down in the to-be-reported quarter. Per the Fed’s latest data, the demand for commercial and industrial loans was subdued in July and August, while real estate loans and consumer loans (specifically credit cards) witnessed modest demand.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BAC’s average interest earnings assets is pegged at $2.76 trillion, suggesting a 3.4% rise from the year-ago reported number. Our estimate for the metric is $2.74 trillion, indicating a 2.6% increase.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII (FTE basis) of $14.24 billion suggests a 2.7% increase. Our estimate for NII (FTE) implies a rise of 2.8% to $14.26 billion.Management expects NII (FTE) to be stable sequentially at $14.3 billion.Q3 Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at 80 cents, which has moved 1.2% lower over the past week. The estimate indicates a decline of 1.2% from the prior-year quarter. Our estimate for earnings is 78 cents.The consensus estimate for sales of $25.13 billion indicates 2.6% growth.

10,78c48f12-0c66-3c62-ab50-ef248ed346bd,USB,2023-10-13,Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q3 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fifth-third-bancorp-fitb-expected-140030423.html,1697119230,STORY,"['FITB', 'USB']","[The market expects Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 19, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.82 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -11.8%.Revenues are expected to be $2.16 billion, down 0.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.57% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Fifth Third Bancorp?For Fifth Third Bancorp, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.44%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Fifth Third Bancorp will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Fifth Third Bancorp would post earnings of $0.83 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.87, delivering a surprise of +4.82%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Fifth Third Bancorp appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsU.S. Bancorp (USB), another stock in the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.04 for the quarter ended September 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -11.9%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $7.02 billion, up 11.5% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for U.S. Bancorp has been revised 2% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, reflecting an equal Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that U.S. Bancorp will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 10 Best Dividend Aristocrats According to Analysts. With the stock market facing ongoing fluctuations, investors are experiencing the frustration of seeing their profits disappear. For instance, the S&amp;P 500 increased by 19.5% from January to July 2023 but has since fallen by 6%. Considering the Federal Reserve's inclination to maintain higher interest rates for an extended period, negative investor sentiment, and the typical seasonal decline, it appears that the momentum of this summer's market rally might continue to weaken as we enter the fall season. According to analysts, investors can mitigate their losses by investing in dividend stocks.Dividend stocks are already a popular choice among investors due to their reliability in providing a steady stream of income. Between 1993 and the end of last year, the S&amp;P 500 index increased by 777%. But with dividends included, the S&amp;P 500 grew by over 1,400% during that same time frame. In addition to this, when we examine the performance of the S&amp;P 500 on a decade-by-decade basis, we can see that the role of dividends in contributing to the total return has fluctuated over time. From 1930 to 2021, dividends accounted for an average of 40% of the S&amp;P 500's total return.A recent study conducted by Morgan Stanley's chief investment officer, Mike Wilson, found that stocks that pay dividends tend to perform better in the long run and are more resilient during market downturns. Here are some comments from the analyst, taken from his interview with Business Insider this month.""Our economists are of the view that inflation will continue to slow from elevated levels over the next 12 months. That backdrop is supportive of owning dividend-related factors and defensive dividend payers, in particular.""Story continuesHe further said:""Dividends provide a positive return cushion with a notable portion of outperformance for payers versus non-payers coming during periods of market volatility. Specifically, the majority of outperformance comes during large market pullbacks such as 2000, 2008, 2015, and 2020.""The Business Insider report also revealed that stocks that started paying dividends in 2000 have outperformed the market since then. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) have been raising their dividends for decades, becoming top choices for investors. In this article, we will discuss some of the best dividend stocks to buy according to analysts.Best Dividend Aristocrats According to AnalystsImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur Methodology:For our list, we scanned a list of the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, companies that have raised their dividends for 25 consecutive years or more.

Here is what the firm has to say:“We were fairly active in the quarter as market dislocations allowed us to be opportunistic, while focusing on companies with stronger moats, better pricing power, more predictable long-term growth and higher returns. In the materials sector we exited PPG Industries, Inc. (NYSE:PPG) and initiated a position in Sherwin-Williams. While both companies operate in the paint and coating industry and are benefiting from improving margins as raw material prices have come down of late, we believe Sherwin-Williams’ dominant retail footprint affords it better pricing power through the cycle. The company provided conservative 2023 guidance and has been successfully gaining market share in the pro segment. While PPG has more European and industrial exposure, Sherwin-Williams’ residential and more domestic focus should also benefit the company as housing indicators appear to be troughing. Weak housing in the face of higher mortgage rates caused Sherwin-Williams stock to sell off in the first quarter, creating a compelling investment opportunity for long-term focused fundamental investors.”21.

The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Edwards Lifesciences Is Edwards Lifesciences Fairly Valued?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.48bUS$1.70bUS$1.79bUS$1.98bUS$2.12bUS$2.23bUS$2.33bUS$2.42bUS$2.50bUS$2.58bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 7.01%Est @ 5.55%Est @ 4.53%Est @ 3.82%Est @ 3.32%Est @ 2.97% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.6% US$1.4kUS$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$15bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.6b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.6%– 2.2%) = US$60bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$60b÷ ( 1 + 6.6%)10= US$32bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$46b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$71.1, the company appears about fair value at a 6.5% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Edwards Lifesciences as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.883. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Edwards LifesciencesStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

(Photo: Jack Daleo/FLYING)This story originally appeared on flyingmag.com. The suburbs of Dallas are buzzing.About 210,000 now live in Frisco, to the northwest of the fast-growing Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. But that’s not the buzzing I’m referring to, because accompanying that influx of residents are the first flights of a new technology: drones.I spent last week in Dallas covering UP.Summit, an annual, invite-only gathering of some of the biggest movers and shakers in the transportation world. Among the attendees were senior U.S. defense officials, state and federal lawmakers, former presidents and prime ministers, and executives from some of the top firms in the industry.Adam Woodworth, CEO of Wing, fell into the latter group. At UP.Summit, Woodworth detailed the next phase of the company, which is owned by Google parent Alphabet. A large part of that road map relies on Dallas, where Wing last month launched drone delivery out of a Walmart Supercenter in Frisco. It plans to add a second store in the coming months.A Wing spokesperson gave me an inside look at the company’s newest operation, complete with a simulated delivery to show how its drones take off, navigate, deliver and return to the Supercenter — all on their own. Read on to see exactly how Wing delivers, hear Woodworth’s vision for drone delivery and get an outlook on the service as it starts to hit the U.S. market.The setupAfter listening to Woodworth speak, I hopped in an Uber and headed to Frisco, where I met a Wing spokesperson in front of the Walmart Supercenter at 8555 Preston Road. I didn’t see the operation at first. But upon closer inspection, I came across a small, fenced-in area in the parking lot. It took up just two rows of parking spaces and was about the size of a tennis court.Wing’s operation out of a Walmart Supercenter in Frisco takes up just a tiny portion of the parking lot. (Jack Daleo/FLYING)The spokesperson emphasized Wing’s ability to fit into Walmart’s framework seamlessly. After all, the largest retailer in the world needs the parking space for customers, and its associates don’t necessarily have the bandwidth to run a drone delivery operation.Story continuesSo, Wing keeps things compact and asset-light. Its store-to-door model, first launched in Australia’s Gold Coast region with grocer Coles, allows it to set up operations in the nooks and crannies of brick-and-mortar stores: in parking lots, on roofs or in unused space nearby. Meanwhile, all Walmart workers need to do is bring orders to the fenced-in service area.I arrived at the Frisco Supercenter just minutes before operations began at 10:30 a.m. CDT. A handful of employees were present. But they had little to do as 18 Wing drones charged on launchpads, performing routine maintenance checks on their own.A Wing drone charges before a day of operations—QR codes (not present at customer locations) help guide it to the landing pad. (Photo: Jack Daleo/FLYING)Even as orders started to come in, staffers — about five of whom were present at any given time — mostly just sat back and watched the drones do their thing.An automated flight planning and uncrewed traffic management (UTM) system charted the path of each suitcase-sized aircraft, accounting for factors such as weather, time of day and the presence of other objects in the airspace. The system also flags issues as they arise and responds to them as needed (such as by grounding a drone assessed to be unfit for operations, for example).Ground support operators were on-site, as is the case at other Wing locations. Their job is simple: When a drone encounters an issue, it tells them exactly what the problem is and where it’s located and the staffer makes what is usually an easy fix. For more complex repairs, drones are set aside to be shipped to a dedicated facility. But there were no hiccups when I was present.A Wing drone charges before a day of operations—QR codes (not present at customer locations) help guide it to the landing pad. (Jack Daleo/FLYING)While there was also a pilot at the Frisco site, he was only there for me. The flights I witnessed were actually overseen from a Remote Operations Center in another Dallas suburb, Coppell, about an hour’s drive away.That facility and another near Wing’s Palo Alto, California, headquarters control the company’s operations nationwide, including its service in Christiansburg, Virginia. Pilots at these centers are akin to air traffic controllers, watching dots on a screen.All of that automation and remote oversight left Walmart associates with a simple task: Bring orders out to the drones. From there, a Wing order loader attached the payload to the drone’s tether, using a tablet to match it to the right aircraft.Soon, staffers will have even less to do. Wing recently introduced the AutoLoader, a new piece of tech that will allow workers to leave containers out for the drones to pick up themselves. The company demonstrated the concept at UP.Summit, likening it to curbside pickup.How it’s deliveredThe Wing spokesperson simulated a delivery so that I — and now you — could see the whole process in action.The order (a water bottle) was sent to the order loader, who waited for the drone to rise and release its tether before attaching a small, Walmart-branded container. Then the aircraft ascended and zipped off to its destination, a nearby staging area.Initially, the buzzing was pretty loud. But it quickly faded into the background as the drone reached cruising altitude, making it difficult to hear unless you were listening for it.In the air, it cruised at 65 mph (56 knots) at roughly 200 feet, beyond the visual line of sight (BVLOS) of the ground crew. Because flights are preplanned, the drone accounted for how conditions such as wind would affect its battery. Still, onboard sensors kept an eye out for any unexpected changes, and the spokesperson said the drone could continue flying in moderate rain or even snow.As we walked to the staging area, a countdown timer on the Wing app gave us an ETA. The spokesperson assured me this was exact, since the entire route was planned in advance. Sure enough, like clockwork, the drone emerged on the horizon on schedule, descending to about 25 feet before lowering the order to the ground with its tether. If pulled, the tether and payload would release and the aircraft would return to the parking lot.A countdown on the Wing app estimated the delivery time down to the second. (Jack Daleo/FLYING)Finally, water bottle in hand, I walked with the spokesperson back to the staging area, where the drone returned to the landing pad just six minutes after the order was initially placed. That’s far less time than a delivery driver would need to complete the trip. While the service is still relatively small, Wing envisions those same benefits for retailers nationwide.Wing is not winging itSome drone delivery companies have struggled to garner customers due to overly ambitious plans, premature launches, or some combination of the two. Wing, with its deliberate approach, is not one of them.In the 30 or so minutes I spent at the Frisco Supercenter, I saw at least 10 organic orders come in from customers. Residents within 6 miles of the store can pick from over 1,000 items (the most popular being rotisserie chicken), including fragile items like eggs, since the container locks into place in the air to prevent swaying. Frozen foods such as ice cream are also on the menu, even in Texas, because delivery times can be as fast as three minutes.The store — combined with another, unnamed Supercenter that will begin service later this year — is expected to serve about 60,000 households. And customers have been clamoring for Wing to add even more coverage in the region, according to the spokesperson.Walmart and Wing offer more than 1,000 items to residents within 6 miles of the Frisco Supercenter. (Jack Daleo/FLYING)But Dallas is just the tip of the iceberg. Wing so far has completed more than 350,000 deliveries, with the vast majority happening outside the U.S.The company got its start in Canberra, Australia, in 2019, expanding to the suburb of Logan and adding service in Helsinki later that year. To date, Logan is the company’s largest service — on some days, it handles over 1,000 deliveries, or one every 25 seconds. Partnerships with restaurants such as KFC have given its Australia business a boost.Recently, Wing expanded operations in Queensland with property development group Mirvac and on-demand delivery provider DoorDash, which has an integration with the company’s service. Instead of using the Wing app, Queensland customers simply place their orders on DoorDash and select the drone delivery option.In the U.S., operations are less substantial. Wing began serving Christiansburg, Virginia, in 2019, where one couple has received more than 1,200 deliveries. Outside Christiansburg and Dallas, it’s largely been limited to testing and demonstrations: A delivery of Coors beer and peanuts to Coors Field in Denver, the drop-off of a ceremonial tee-off golf ball for the Sports Illustrated Invitational and some testing near its Palo Alto headquarters and Hillwood’s AllianceTexas.Wing is also partnered with Walgreens to expand store-to-door service in the U.S. and is working with Hillwood to prepare a special delivery facility at Frisco Station, a mixed-use development not far from the Supercenter.Speaking at UP.Summit, Woodworth was bullish on Wing’s domestic prospects. He emphasized a few tricks the company has up its sleeve, such as the Wing Delivery Network philosophy it revealed last year. The decentralized, automated system will share resources across each of the company’s service areas based on spikes and lulls in demand. That way, Wing can send capacity wherever it’s needed, allowing it to service larger, more populated areas.Woodworth also highlighted Wing’s Aircraft Library team, which develops new drone configurations based on components the company already uses. The idea is to help meet the unique payload, range or other requirements of its customers. Then there’s the AutoLoader, which figures to make matters significantly easier for store associates.Combined with a small ground footprint, high levels of automation and APIs (like the one for DoorDash) to integrate drone delivery directly into customers’ sales channels, Wing’s new tools should push it toward offering a service that’s fast, cheap and good — not just two of the three — as Woodworth put it.Walmart will certainly hope that’s the case. The retailer is looking to jump-start its drone delivery business, which it said has completed just 10,000 deliveries over the past two years. That’s despite operating a total of 36 hubs across seven states in partnership with DroneUp, Flytrex and Zipline, the industry leader in terms of sheer volume with 700,000 deliveries and counting.According to McKinsey, Zipline and Wing are not the only key players in the space. It said more than 10 drone operators made at least 5,000 commercial deliveries in 2022, delivering nearly 875,000 packages (an 80% increase over 2021). And with 500,000 deliveries completed through the end of June, the company forecasts over 1 million by year’s end.The majority of these are health care deliveries centered in Africa and the Asia-Pacific region, largely owing to Zipline’s dominance. But per data from McKinsey, North American market share is on the rise this year, while the European market is fading.The North American market would get a lift from more clarity on BVLOS operations. An FAA committee began developing regulations in 2021, but there is still no final rule in sight. That could change with the passage of the House FAA Reauthorization Act, which calls on the agency to produce a BVLOS Notice of Proposed Rulemaking within four months of its effective date.As things stand, Wing operates BVLOS under a Part 135 certificate, becoming the first drone delivery firm to obtain one in 2019. But the process is often expensive and lengthy, with Zipline, Amazon, UPS Flight Forward and Flytrex partner Causey Aviation Unmanned holding the only other approvals.The cheaper, shorter alternative is a waiver to section 91.113(b), which the FAA awards intermittently. Recently, Zipline, UPS and a few other firms successfully took this route.But a final BVLOS rule would allow Wing and others to scale, expanding current service areas and adding new ones in places spread out, hard to reach or obstructed by obstacles (such as tall buildings). It could also reduce costs by allowing drone firms to assign a single pilot to multiple aircraft, as Wing does, and offer customers a simpler path to sustainable operations as executives focus increasingly on ESG initiatives.The post How it’s delivered: Wing gives glimpse of a future with drone delivery appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

For a quick overview of the top 5, read our article, the 5 most Culturally Diverse Cities in the US. The United States is a melting pot of cultures, with people from all over the world calling it home. It is the third-largest country in the world by population, and its residents represent a wide range of ethnic and cultural backgrounds. African Americans, Asian Americans, Indigenous Americans, and Latin Americans are just a few groups that make up the American mosaic.Over the years, racial diversity in the United States has grown significantly, leading to the emergence of new and unique cultures. One such example is the Louisiana Creole culture, a fusion of African, Spanish, English, Native American, and French cultures. This new culture has its distinct cuisine, language, and traditions.Cultural Diversity in the USThe United States has become increasingly culturally influential over time due to its growing diversity. According to the 2010 and 2020 censuses, the white population in the country decreased from 63% to 57%, while the Hispanic population increased from 15% to 18%, and the Asian population increased from 5% to 6%. The Black population remained relatively stable at 12%.The Pew Research Center also analyzed that the 118th United States Congress is the most culturally diverse to date, with a quarter of voting members identifying as something other than non-Hispanic White. This is a continuation of a long-running trend, with the 118th Congress being the seventh Congress to break the record set by the one before it.Due to the increasing cultural diversity in the United States, people from all backgrounds have begun to adjust to the American way of life. One major aspect of this adaptability is immigrants leveraging their potential and talent to pursue entrepreneurship. Story continuesA study by the US Census Bureau in 2022 found that 0.83% of immigrants to the US founded at least one company between 2005 and 2010, compared to 0.46% of native-born US citizens. Moreover, The American Immigration Council also revealed that in 2023, immigrants or their children founded 44.8% of new American companies. This represents 224 companies, of which foreign-born individuals founded 103 and the children of immigrants founded 121.One example of a company founded by an immigrant is Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), an American multinational automotive and clean energy company. It was founded in 2003 by Elon Musk, who now employs over 27,000 people worldwide.Elon Musk is renowned as one of the most audacious innovators of our time. Born and raised in South Africa, he immigrated to Canada and later transferred to the United States, where he eventually founded Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a leading player in the electric vehicle charging industry, thanks to its strategic partnerships and heavy investments in research and development. As of September 2023, its market capitalization is nearly $853 billion.Another multinational company founded by an immigrant is the ubiquitous search engine Google. In 1998, Sergey Brin, a Russian immigrant, co-founded Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), now Google's parent company. Google has had a profound impact on the internet, transforming the way we access and consume information.Alphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s Google dominates the industry and offers innovative, user-friendly services. With over 270 million monthly active users and nearly 40,000 search queries processed per second, the search engine is the primary gateway to information for billions of people worldwide.Moreover, the company’s ecosystem of products and services, including Google Home, Google Maps, and Google Drive, solidifies its influence. Android OS, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s mobile operating system, powers billions of devices globally. Culturally Diverse Workplaces in the USAs the population's racial diversity has increased, companies have also changed their workforces to accommodate employees from different cultural backgrounds. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), a retail giant with a vast workforce, is one example of a company committed to diversity and inclusion.This is indicated by the fact that as of 2023, the US associates of Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) were 49% people of color. 41% of these employees also hold leadership roles within the organization, with the Board of Directors being 18% culturally diverse.  In addition to its commitment to transparent diversity hiring, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and its foundation pledged to contribute $100 million over five years to the Center for Racial Equity in 2020, to help to address racial disparities in the United States.Meanwhile, in 2021, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) released its first-ever diversity study to assess the cultural diversity of its on-screen talent and the behind-the-camera directors, writers, producers, and creators. According to the report, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) had significant diversity gaps in its programming. As a result, the company adopted an inclusion lens approach, focusing on underrepresented cultural minorities on screen and ensuring that portrayals of culturally diverse people are authentic.In addition, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) announced the creation of the Netflix Fund for Creative Equity, a $100 million, five-year investment fund to support organizations that help underrepresented communities train for and find jobs in film and television.20 Most Culturally Diverse Cities in the USNeirfy/Shutterstock.comMethodologyWe compiled a list of the 20 most culturally diverse cities in the US based on cultural diversity score. Our ranking criteria was based on three primary metrics: Diversity Score, the number of museums present in cities, and restaurants located in the area excluding fast food. We collected data on the relevant metrics from different websites. We got the Diversity Score Index from the National Equity Atlas, the total number of museums and restaurants from Trip Advisor. The diversity index quantitatively measures the different types of datasets in the community, specifically cultural diversity. It is a statistical representation of diversity in the various cities of the US.  We first scored each city on each index from 1 to 20, with 1 indicating the location with the most cultural diversity and 20 indicating the city with the least cultural diversity. We then assigned weights of 0.4 to the Diversity Score, 0.3 to the number of museums in cities and restaurants in the area excluding fast food. Finally, we calculated a composite weighted average of these scores to determine the cities with the most culturally diverse residents. After the final evaluation of the composite results, the cities were ranked from 1 to 20, with 1 indicating the city with the most culturally diverse population and 20 indicating the city with the least cultural diversity.

18,c3e6b637-30a4-38fb-9520-c7c544b3d8d9,WMT,2023-10-13,Palo Alto Networks and Hormel Foods have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/palo-alto-networks-hormel-foods-112000500.html,1697109600,STORY,"['PANW', 'HRL', 'COST', 'WMT', 'HD']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – October 12, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Palo Alto Networks PANW as the Bull of the Day and Hormel Foods HRL as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Walmart Inc. WMT, The Home Depot, Inc. HD and Costco Wholesale Corp. COST.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Palo Alto Networks is a global cybersecurity company specializing in advanced firewalls and cloud-based offerings to protect enterprises from cyber threats. In addition to strong price momentum propelling the stock, PANW also enjoys a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, reflecting earnings estimates that have been trending higher all year.Industry Leading Products and GrowthPalo Alto Networks continues to gain traction from consistent contract acquisitions and the growing preference for its advanced security platforms, driven by the emergence of hybrid work settings and the mission-critical demand for robust cyber security.The company's consecutive impressive quarterly results underscore its ongoing commitment to product advancement, a transition to a subscription-centric business approach, seamless platform integration, and steady investment in sales and marketing.The company has grown sales at an incredible pace over the last 10 years and is expected to maintain strong continued growth. Analysts expect Palo Alto Network's revenues to expand at a CAGR of 17.5% from fiscal 2024 to 2026.Not surprisingly, earnings are forecast to grow at a very high rate as well. Over the next 3-5 years EPS are expected to climb 28% annually. As PANW has long been a hardware focused cyber security company, the shift to cloud-based products and a subscription model has further improved the fundamentals of the business.Gross margins for the subscription segment are estimated to be around 80% and are expected to grow even faster than the rest of the business, with a 20% CAGR through 2026.Story continuesTechnical BreakoutPalo Alto Networks stock has compounded at an extremely impressive 33% annually over the last ten years and has been one of the strongest stocks in the market this year, up 85% YTD.While some traders may scoff at the idea of buying a stock that is already up so much in such a short time, momentum traders know the leading stocks often continue to be the leading stocks. And with Q4 shown to be the most bullish of the year, focusing on a leader like PANW might be a fantastic way to finish out the year.Over the last three and a half months, PANW stock has been carving out an inverse head and shoulders chart pattern. Just this week it broke out above the key $250 level and has been moving higher since. Investors interested in the stock can look for pullbacks to get involved.Bottom LineNot only is Palo Alto Networks growing rapidly in an industry with strong secular tailwinds, but a new catalyst this year just made it even more compelling. The explosion of Generative Artificial Intelligence is going to only increase the demands of cyber security but will also improve the company's ability to detect threats.Bear of the Day:Hormel Foods is underperforming in an industry that is already underperforming the broad market. Additionally, stiff competition in the food industry, and complications in the supply chain have put stress on both sales and earnings growth, giving the stock a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) rating.Falling Earnings EstimatesHormel Foods is a multinational food products company headquartered in Austin, Minnesota. Well known for its meat and food brands, Hormel's product portfolio includes brands like SPAM, Skippy, and Jennie-O.The most recent earnings report from HRL was rather disappointing. Both the top and bottom line missed analysts estimates, and although EPS were unchanged YoY, sales fell 2.3% YoY.Continued supply chain issues have created an environment of increased complexity and higher costs. Analysts expect FY23 sales to be down -4% YoY and with higher costs cutting into margins, earnings are projected to fall nearly -10% YoY.Analysts have unanimously downgraded earnings estimates, with the current quarter being lowered by -11.7%, FY23 by 5.2%, and FY24 decreased by -5.4%.ValuationHormel Foods is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 22.4x, which is above the market average. Additionally, although it is below its 10-year median of 23.3x, the valuation still seems a bit too rich for a company with so many headwinds.Bottom LineWith rapidly shifting food preferences from consumers, and stiff competition Hormel Foods is dealing with a challenging road ahead. Both issues are likely to cause further margin compression as they will have to compete either on price, or promotional outreach.By no means do I think Hormel Foods is going to go the way of the dodo bird, but at this point it is definitely a stock I think investors should avoid. Until it reaches deep value territory or earnings estimates begin to trend higher, look for opportunities elsewhere.Additional content:3 Blue-Chip Retail Stocks Poised to Captivate Your PortfolioIn the unpredictable world of the stock market, the pursuit of stability and growth is a constant challenge for investors.

21,79740b71-11df-37e9-a32b-e3ff5fb3e4ba,MMC,2023-10-13,Marsh & McLennan (MMC) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marsh-mclennan-mmc-earnings-expected-140030118.html,1697119230,STORY,['MMC'],"[The market expects Marsh &amp; McLennan (MMC) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 19, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis global professional services firm providing strategy, risk and people solutions is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.38 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +17%.Revenues are expected to be $5.19 billion, up 8.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.9% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Marsh &amp; McLennan?For Marsh &amp; McLennan, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.56%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Marsh &amp; McLennan will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Marsh &amp; McLennan would post earnings of $2.12 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.20, delivering a surprise of +3.77%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Marsh &amp; McLennan appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Marsh McLennan (NYSE: MMC), the world’s leading professional services firm in the areas of risk, strategy and people, supported the Government of Ukraine in designing and testing the platform to support the nation’s recovery and transformation.The data platform brings together detailed maps of war-related incidents in Ukraine (defined as individual events relating to Russian hostilities such as missile, drone, or shelling attacks) since the Russian invasion in February 2022. This includes granular insight into the frequency and type of attacks by location over time, with further insight into the types of assets targeted as well as damage levels sustained. In doing so, it enables transparency about the impact of the conflict to date and the degree of war risk.The platform shows that 76% of communities had no war-related incidents in 2023 up to 1 October. The equivalent figure since the invasion began on 24 February 2022 is 66%, demonstrating the progress made by Ukraine over the past year. A further 9% of communities were low-incident communities in 2023, having experienced only one war-related incident. The analysis shows that hostilities have been concentrated on a focused set of Ukrainian communities: 9% of communities have been subject to intense shelling; 6% are communities away from the frontline that have been targeted by Russian attacks. It also shows that 101 once-occupied communities have been recovered from Russia by Ukraine since the invasion began.Today’s launch follows June’s announcement in which Marsh McLennan committed to provide services on a pro-bono basis to create a platform for Ukraine to consolidate and analyze data for a transparent assessment of war risks in Ukraine. The platform aggregates data received from the police, military, security services, rescue services, transport services, and government institutions, among other sources.Story continuesOleksiy Danilov, Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine which operates the platform said: ""76% of communities in Ukraine have had no war related incidents this year.

It is worth considering Huntington Bancshares (HBAN), which belongs to the Zacks Banks - Midwest industry.This regional bank holding company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 2.82%.For the last reported quarter, Huntington Bancshares came out with earnings of $0.35 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.34 per share, representing a surprise of 2.94%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.37 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.38 per share, delivering a surprise of 2.70%.Thanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Huntington Bancshares lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Huntington Bancshares currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.80%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on October 20, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

SentinelOne Advisor Morgan Wright joins Yahoo Finance Live to detail the phishing tactics modern hackers are adapting in these cyberattacks targeting bigger and bigger companies' platforms and servers.""What is clear is that whoever figured this out, this may become part of a tool kit that's used later as they build out bigger malware packages and bigger types of attack platforms,"" Wright asserts. ""This could be part and this was a proof of concept.""For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: Talk to us about the other side. Who is perpetrating these attacks? What are they trying to get done? And what kind of resources do they have?- You know, there hasn't been really credible reporting yet on who's been behind it, but there's usually two things. Number one, if it's a state actor, it's done to gain some type of a strategic advantage or to take us offline. If you think of China and Taiwan, the situation in Ukraine, what's going on with Israel and Hamas right now, there could be some nation state actors.But on the criminal side, it usually involves money. Criminals don't do anything for those things. Their motivation is money. So you're looking at what is it they hope to do.But then there's potentially a third one, which are just basically digital anarchists. They just want to disrupt things. So it's not clear what it is, but what is clear is that whoever figured this out, this may become part of a toolkit that's used later as they build out bigger malware packages and bigger types of attack platforms.This could be part and this was a proof of concept. They tried it out. They found out it was effective even though it was mitigated. This could become a huge tool in a new toolkit that's used on companies, again, not the size of Google, you know, Cloudflare, and Amazon.Story continuesJOSH LIPTON: And Morgan, I'm interested to get your take. When companies find themselves in trouble like this, should they be paying ransoms in your opinion? I know it's a subject that gets debated and discussed a lot. I'm interested in your view.MORGAN WRIGHT: Yeah, you know, obviously, at SentinelOne, we've got a point of view, which is if you defend or protect yourself through use of AI automation, you can mitigate a lot of that before it happens. If you do get hit, the FBI has even said, look, people who pay tend to get hit again. So what you're trusting is that a criminal who has already breached your confidence, you know, breached public trust by attacking you, you expect them to be ethical and give you back all your files.So the best thing is not to have it happen. But if it does happen, you look at what happened with MGM and their refusal not to pay. There is a cost involved with that. And as long as you're willing to bear the cost of legal, rebuilding systems, you know, it's never good business to do business with criminals. But there's no easy answer to that except there is one thing, you have to be very careful. If the ransom money is going to an entity that's on the OFAC list, the Office of Foreign Asset Controls and it's supporting terrorism, the US Treasury could actually sanction you for paying a ransom if that money can be tied to going to a terrorist group.JULIE HYMAN: That's a very interesting point and a good reminder, especially right now. Morgan, you mentioned the MGM hack. And there was also one against Caesars. It feels like-- there are certain moments where it feels like there's an uptick in these, sorts of, attacks at least from an anecdotal basis. Is that actually what's happening and what do you think could be driving that?MORGAN WRIGHT: You know, higher education is getting hit. Education is getting hit because they're fairly open and they don't have the extensive resources. But you bring up a good point, hackers don't break in anymore. They log in.And the MGM hack started with somebody trolling LinkedIn, scanning LinkedIn, finding somebody, and then impersonating an employee to the help desk to get credentials. So it's really, if you get that initial toehold in, you can do it. So we do go through cycles, we do go through seasons as people get better at defending these attacks. Then new ways, new vulnerabilities are found, new groups come out and then they attempt to do that.But what we're finding right now is a lot of these breaches are happening not because they're exploiting a vulnerability in the system, but because they're getting initial access by exploiting identity and access management that way. So there's, kind of, a as we get better at one thing, then it's the other thing. I always tell people the problem isn't the problem.The problem isn't the way you think about the problem. There's only one problem that matters and that's how your adversary thinks about the problem. And criminals think differently than law-abiding citizens and that's kind of the advantage they have many times.]"

35,0b5c004f-296a-3cdd-85bf-72bc0483219a,O,2023-10-13,The past five years for ShaMaran Petroleum (CVE:SNM) investors has not been profitable,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/past-five-years-shamaran-petroleum-111956777.html,1697195996,STORY,"['CL=F', 'SHASF']","[ShaMaran Petroleum Corp. (CVE:SNM) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 22% in the last month. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last five years have been less than pleasing. In fact, the share price is down 52%, which falls well short of the return you could get by buying an index fund.So let's have a look and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. See our latest analysis for ShaMaran Petroleum While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.ShaMaran Petroleum became profitable within the last five years. Most would consider that to be a good thing, so it's counter-intuitive to see the share price declining. Other metrics might give us a better handle on how its value is changing over time.Revenue is actually up 24% over the time period. So it seems one might have to take closer look at the fundamentals to understand why the share price languishes. After all, there may be an opportunity.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe know that ShaMaran Petroleum has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? This free interactive report on ShaMaran Petroleum's balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About The Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?We'd be remiss not to mention the difference between ShaMaran Petroleum's total shareholder return (TSR) and its share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. We note that ShaMaran Petroleum's TSR, at -49% is higher than its share price return of -52%. When you consider it hasn't been paying a dividend, this data suggests shareholders have benefitted from a spin-off, or had the opportunity to acquire attractively priced shares in a discounted capital raising.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 6.5% in the last year, ShaMaran Petroleum shareholders lost 35%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 8% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand ShaMaran Petroleum better, we need to consider many other factors. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   4 warning signs for ShaMaran Petroleum   (of which 2 are a bit unpleasant!) you should know about.If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on Canadian exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) lost 1.2%. For the week, the S&amp;P and the Dow posted overall gains.

The schedule of quarterly reports is packed for the days ahead, including earnings from Netflix, Tesla, Bank of America and AT&amp;T. Investors will also have fresh economic data to grapple with, alongside remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Yahoo Finance's Brent Sanchez has a graphical breakdown of what to watch next week:H25 days agoHamza ShabanThe Fed's next 'rate hike' has already arrivedSome Fed officials see rising Treasury yields as a mechanism to slow the economy without having to go through the trouble of raising rates again. In effect, elevated yields can do the work of central bankers for them — functioning as a rate hike without instituting an actual rate hike.And this isn’t the first time a phantom rate hike has crept its way through the economy. In March Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the bank failures and associated turmoil essentially acted as another rate hike.But as with the Fed’s previous rate increases, a rise in inflation or other unfavorable observations could force the central bank to move. And if yields slide, their tightening effect would diminish, creating a greater need for the Fed to enact a genuine hike instead of relying on a substitute.H25 days agoHamza ShabanBig banks report strong earnings amid higher ratesThe nation’s largest banks appear to be thriving as the market settles into an era of “high for longer” interest rates, as the Fed attempts to pull inflation down to its 2% target.On Friday a host of banks reported robust earnings.Profits for JPMorgan Chase (JPM) surged in the third quarter, reinforcing its dominance in the sector, despite the headwinds facing banks this year. The New York giant reported earnings of $13.2 billion that were up 35% from the same period a year ago. Its revenue of $40.7 billion was up 21%. Its net income and revenue beat Wall Street expectations. Shares rose about 2%.Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) also beat earnings on Friday.Citigroup, whose shares rose nearly 2% reported profits that were broadly steady as it reaped the benefits of a rise in trading revenue and investment banking fees. Shares of Wells Fargo gained more than 2% after the company reported that profits rose in the third quarter as customers paid out higher interest on loans. Revenues for the quarter increased more than 20% compared to the same period last year.H25 days agoHamza ShabanStocks trending in afternoon tradingHere are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page in afternoon trading on Friday:Dollar General (DG): Shares rose more than 10% Friday afternoon following news that the company will bring back former CEO Todd Vasos to lead the discount retailer.JD.com (JD): The e-commerce company fell nearly 4% after several banks cut their price targets and revenue estimates for the company's third quarter.JPMorgan (JPM): Shares gained 4% on Friday afternoon after a strong earnings report showed that profits surged in the third quarter. Wells Fargo (WFC) and Citigroup (C) also beat earnings estimates.Boeing (BA): The aerospace and defense giant lost almost 3% during afternoon trading after a report that the plane maker is expanding inspections of production flaws in the 737 Max aircraft, which could further delay deliveries of the jet.H25 days agoHamza ShabanStocks mixed in afternoon tradingWall Street gave up some of its gains Friday afternoon, as investors digested the results from big banks and a reading on consumer sentiment that fell on concerns over inflation.The S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) edged lower by about 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.4% or 140 points. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) lost 0.8%.H25 days agoHamza ShabanInflation concerns flare up for American consumersConsumers are feeling worse about the economy even as the likelihood of a November or December rate hike creeps downward, heightening the attention on the Fed’s efforts to bring down inflation.The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index registered a 7% drop for its first October reading. “Nearly all demographic groups posted setbacks in sentiment, reflecting the continued weight of high prices,” said Joanne Hsu, director of the university’s Surveys of Consumers.The dark turn in current events, from the turmoil in Congress over who will serve as the next Speaker of the House to the escalating violence in the Israel-Hamas conflict, likely weighed on the mindsets of consumers, according to a note by analysts at Wells Fargo, published Friday.The more pessimistic feelings coincides with a dwindling likelihood of a rate hike later this year. Just a day before the survey was released, the latest inflation report on Thursday showed that prices in September rose at roughly the same pace seen in August. The data bolstered the case that the Fed still has a ways to go to pull inflation back down to its 2% target.Still, markets were indicating the Fed will likely hold rates steady in November. And even in December chances are shrinking that the Fed will raise rates then. As of Friday morning, markets were pricing in a 92% chance the Fed hold rates where they are in November, data from the CME Group show. The chances of a December rate hike fell, however, to about 30% from roughly 37% a week ago.H25 days agoHamza ShabanMicrosoft closes $69 billion takeover of Activision BlizzardThe largest-ever merger in the gaming market has closed, bringing an end to a protracted battle with government regulators over concerns of consolidation and competition.Microsoft (MSFT) on Friday finalized its $69 billion purchase of ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard (ATVI), according to a regulatory filing from the company Friday, in what is the largest-ever merger for the gaming market, Yahoo Finance’s Alexis Keenan and Daniel Howley report.The deal closed after Microsoft cleared a final hurdle from the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The regulator said concessions proposed in a revised acquisition agreement with Activision satisfied the antitrust regulator’s concerns that the transaction would give Microsoft an unfair advantage in the cloud gaming market.“The new deal will stop Microsoft from locking up competition in cloud gaming as this market takes off, preserving competitive prices and services for UK cloud gaming customers,” the CMA said in a press release.The deal makes Microsoft the third-largest video game company in the world by revenue behind Sony (SONY) and Tencent.J25 days agoJosh SchaferConsumer sentiment tumbles in OctoberSticky inflation, rising yields and a slumping stock market are taking a toll on how consumers feel about the current state of the US economy.The first October reading of the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index showed a reading of 63, down from 68.1 in September. The 7% drop was the largest one month move downward since the regional banking crisis in March.After several sticky inflation reports, Americans aren't feeling as bullish about inflation's path downward, either. One year-inflation expectations are now for prices to grow 3.8% over the next year. Last month consumers had projected inflation of 3.2%.""Assessments of personal finances declined about 15%, primarily on a substantial increase in concerns over inflation, and one-year expected business conditions plunged about 19%,"" Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu said in the survey release.H25 days agoHamza ShabanStocks trending in morning tradingHere are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page in morning trading on Friday:Broadcom (AVGO): Shares of the semiconductor company continued their climb Friday morning, rising 0.8%, following news that Broadcom’s acquisition of the cloud computing company VMware (VMW) is likely to be approved by Chinese officials.Boeing (BA): The aerospace and defense giant lost 3% during morning trading after a report that the plane maker is expanding inspections of production flaws in the 737 Max aircraft, which could further delay deliveries of the jet.JPMorgan (JPM): Shares gained 4% on Friday morning after a strong earnings report showed that profits surged in the third quarter.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, CME Group Inc.'s CME and Coinbase Global, Inc. COIN.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:AZEK is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that engages in the manufacturing and selling of building products for residential, commercial, and industrial markets in the United States.The stock fell apart in 2022 but has rallied over 100% off those lows from last year. Investors have seen a 25% sell-off over the last month, so the question right now is if the stock is a buy before earnings.The bulls might have a case to stay long as analyst estimates are moving higher as the stock tests technical support. This makes the current trading level an attractive area to enter the stock.About the Company AZEK was founded in 2013 and is headquartered in Chicago, IL. The company operates through two segments: Residential and Commercial.The residential side designs and manufacturers decking, railing, trim, molding, and other similar products. The commercial side manufactures engineered polymer materials used in various industries.The stock has a Zacks Style Score of ""B"" in Growth and Momentum. It has a Forward PE of 27 and pays no dividend. AZEK currently employs over 2,100 and has a market cap of $4 billion.Q1 Earnings Beat In early August AZEK reported a Q3 beat of 15%. The company also saw a slight revenue beat and guided FY23 higher, seeing $1.34-1.36B v the 1.3B expected.The company also raised FY23 EBITDA and Capex. Margins were higher at 25% v 21.9% last year.Management commented that demand signals are providing a positive backdrop for the remainder of the building season. They added that the residential segment sell-through growth is improving versus the prior quarter.Story continuesThe stock reacted positively, moving about 5% higher after EPS. From there, the stock drifted to February 2022 highs before starting to trend lower.Analyst Estimates Analyst estimates have been trending higher since before earnings and have continued to be taken higher since the August earnings report.Looking at the current quarter, estimates are moving 20% higher over the last 90 days. For the next quarter, estimates have gone from $0.02 to $0.07 over that same time frame, a move of 250%.Looking at the longer term, estimates are moving higher as well.For the current year, analysts have taken numbers from $0.57 to $0.68, or 19%. For next year, we see estimates jump from $0.86 to $1.05, or 22%.Analyst have also raised their price targets since the earnings report.Goldman reiterated its Buy and lifted its price target to $37 from $32. JPMorgan Chase lifted its target to $37 from $30 and reiterated its Overweight.AZEK next reports in November and a recent note from Jefferies saying they expect a guide coming in line with consensus. They expect growth in 2024 and believe the stock will react favorably to earnings.The TechnicalsThe stock has recently sold off and now resides right at the 200-day moving average. The selling went hand in hand with the overall market sell-off and the move higher in interest rates.Investors have a solid entry point at the 200-day, which lines up with a 61.8% Fibonacci retracement drawn from May lows to recent highs. This setup provides a good risk reward against the March lows while looking for a return to 2023 highs.Bottom Line After a rough ride in 2022, AZEK looks poised to provide solid fundamentals into next year. Earnings are scheduled for the end of November and will be a catalyst for the direction of the stock.The recent pullback provides a good risk reward for bullish investors and a starter position should be considered at current levels.Bear of the Day:Morgan Stanley is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that provides various financial products and services to corporations, governments, financial institutions, and individuals.The stock is trading near lows as earnings approach next week.

However, the Fed has since hiked interest rates once in July, following which cryptocurrencies took a hit once again. In fact, Bitcoin has been falling since hitting its 52-week high in early July.However, it has also solidified its position over the past few weeks and is now hovering around $26,900 after falling as much as $25,400 in late August and September.The rebound has been taking place since the Fed kept its benchmark policy rate unchanged in its September FOMC meeting to its current range of 5.25-5.25%.A higher market interest rate has a negative impact on high-growth sectors such as technology, consumer discretionary and cryptocurrencies. The Fed's aggressive monetary tightening policy has also raised worries that the economy might slip into a recession.Fed Chair Jerome Powell, in his first post-FOMC comment, said that inflation remains elevated, which might require the central bank to hike interest rates by another 25 basis points before it starts cutting interest rates in 2024.Following Powell's hawkish comments, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury Note surged to its highest level since 2007. The 10-year Treasury yield holds immense significance as it mirrors market participants' outlook on the nation's economic situation, influencing consumers, businesses and government entities.However, cryptocurrencies are once again trying to rebound from their recent lows as investors' sentiments have been upbeat following dovish comments from a number of Fed officials.

We have also discussed egalitarianism and how some companies are trying to help achieve that for many countries. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Most Egalitarian Countries in the World.  A perfectly egalitarian country is one where every child, regardless of their background, is born with the same chance to reach for the stars. Nobody is held back by being poor or treated unfairly in this perfect world. While there are no perfectly equal countries in the world, some have come close. These countries have prioritized accessible education, healthcare, and social support. These societies recognize that while perfection may be elusive, the relentless pursuit of equality guides the path toward a fairer and more compassionate world. On the other hand, the least egalitarian countries in the world often suffer from huge wealth disparities, limited access to education and healthcare, and systemic discrimination.In the United States, income and wealth inequality have been a pressing issue. The country has one of the highest levels of inequality among developed countries. A small percentage of the population holds a huge portion of the wealth, while a large portion struggles with economic hardship and limited access to essential services such as healthcare and education.The Nordic countries, which are often regarded the most income-equal countries in the world, essentially follow the Nordic model. The model relies on some of the world's highest tax rates. In 2019, according to the OECD, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden collected approximately 46.3%, 39.9%, and 42.9% of their GDP in taxes. In contrast, the United States only raised 24.5% of its GDP through taxation in 2019.Moreover, in 2018, Sweden had a top personal income tax rate of 57.3%, Denmark's was 55.8%, and Norway's was 46.6%, and these high rates apply to a broad range of income levels. In comparison, the US top tax bracket in 2018 was 37%, affecting only individuals earning $500,000 or more (or $600,000 for married couples filing jointly). It is also worth mentioning that while it is true that the GDP growth for the US was 5.9% and for Denmark (one of the highest taxed countries) was 4.9% in 2021, there is no evidence to support that countries' higher income equality will translate into economies with slower economic growth.Story continuesHence, discussing how large and small businesses wield considerable influence in the journey towards a more equitable world is pertinent. This influence is not limited to their immediate economic activities but extends to their approach to employment, investment, and societal engagement. One such business is the cloud-based company, Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM), which has dedicated its finances and efforts to social responsibility through measurable initiatives and achievements. Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) has made incredible progress in promoting workplace diversity and inclusion. They have exceeded their goal of having 50% of US employees come from underrepresented groups and reached this milestone a year early. They have also doubled Black leaders' representation and aim to increase Black, Indigenous, Latinx, and Multiracial leadership by 50% by the end of 2023. Moreover, they aspire to achieve 40% global female-identifying and non-binary employee representation by 2026. In addition to its workforce initiatives, Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) invests in education, advocacy for equal rights, and supplier diversity. They've invested millions in public schools in the US and globally and supported police and criminal justice reforms. Besides being at the forefront of corporate social responsibility, Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) has been equally impressive in its financial performance. Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) has reported excellent financial results for its second quarter of fiscal 2024, which ended on July 31, 2023. The company achieved a second-quarter revenue of $8.60 billion, with an 11% year-over-year increase and consistent performance in constant currency. Their operating margin stood at 31.6%. Salesforce also demonstrated strong earnings per share (EPS) with $2.12 in diluted EPS for the second quarter. Furthermore, this quarter, the company returned $1.9 billion to its stockholders through stock buyback.On the other hand, Accenture Plc (NYSE:ACN) has also been actively engaged in social impact initiatives to help grow and prepare individuals for a more prosperous future. Their ""Skills to Succeed"" program has been a standout achievement that has equipped over 3 million people with job skills by 2020. On June 15, 2023, Accenture Plc (NYSE:ACN) announced its investment in Praxis Labs, a New York-based software-as-a-service virtual reality (VR) company focused on diversity and inclusion training. The investment, led by Accenture Ventures, is part of its Project Spotlight initiative and was funded through the Black Founders Development Program. This program aims to support Black entrepreneurs, who often face disparities in funding, with direct access to venture capital and corporate mentorship. Praxis Labs utilizes immersive learning to enhance workplace equity and inclusion while providing learners flexible access to their platform. Accenture Plc (NYSE:ACN)’s investment in the company is an evidence to its willingness to reduce wealth disparities for Black founders in the technology startup sector. 20 Most Egalitarian Countries in the WorldA student in a classroom eagerly raising their hand, highlighting the quality of the company's test preparation services. Editorial photo for a financial news article. 8k. --ar 16:9MethodologyTo list the most egalitarian countries in the world, we relied on our comprehensive datasets utilized in our articles on 25 Most Civilied Countries in the World, 25 Most Gender and Income Equal Countries in the World, 25 Freest Countries in the World, and 20 Most Feminist Countries in the World. We identified the most recurring countries in these articles and averaged their rankings. The 20 with the highest average ranking have been listed below. Here is a list of the most egalitarian countries in the world20. SloveniaAverage Rank: 22Slovenia saw stable, low-income inequality from its 1991 independence until the 2008 economic crisis. It ranked as the most equal OECD country in the late 2000s with a Gini coefficient of 0.24. It is also one of the countries with the best education.19. South KoreaAverage Rank: 21 South Korea ranked 5th in global income equality in 2019, but economic inequality has grown. While it performs well in OECD comparisons, income polarization has worsened since the 2010 IMF stimulus. 18. JapanAverage Rank: 20.33In 2023, Japan is 13th globally for quality of life, 3rd in healthcare and 6th for safety. It enjoys one of the world's highest life expectancies, 84 years, on par with Switzerland and Liechtenstein. Japan is also one of the top countries for engineering. 17. SpainAverage Rank: 17Spain has been promoting female representation in politics and management positions. Almost 50% of political representation is female.16. BelgiumAverage Rank: 13Belgium has a higher-than-average net-adjusted disposable income per capita at $34,884 annually. Employment is 65% for ages 15-64, with 68% men and 61% women in paid work. It is one of the most egalitarian countries in the world. 15. LuxembourgAverage Rank: 12Life expectancy in Luxembourg is 83 years, which is 2 years higher than the OECD average. Their air quality is better, with high water quality satisfaction.14. AustriaAverage Rank: 11.85Austria is ranked as the second most liveable country after Finland. It offers its residents an excellent quality of life with a pristine environment, clean air, top-tier healthcare, and extensive educational options. Austria is one of the best countries for women.13. United KingdomAverage Rank: 11.75In 2022, the UK government responded to the living standards crisis with huge support, providing £58 billion ($71.2 billion) to help households cope with high inflation. Employers in the UK reacted to the tight labor market by increasing nominal pay at its fastest rate since 1991. Low-income households received massive support, with benefits uprated by 10.1% in April 2023, positively impacting their income. It is one of the most egalitarian countries in the world. 12. CanadaAverage Rank: 11.60Canada is one of the countries with the highest quality of life, with a 3.24-year higher life expectancy than the US. It excels in income, jobs, education, health, environment, social sectors, per the OECD's Better Life Index. Canada's universal healthcare is funded through taxes, which provides free healthcare services.11. New ZealandAverage Rank: 11.50New Zealand will mandate over 900 companies with 250+ employees to disclose their gender pay disparities to promote workplace equity. This requirement may later expand to cover around 2,700 businesses employing over 100 workers. New Zealand is one of the countries with the most income-equality. 10. IrelandAverage Rank: 10.25 Ireland is promoting equality by considering decriminalizing sex work to protect the rights and safety of sex workers. This effort is an evidence that Ireland is concerned about sex worker rights and will, hence, consult advocates to address the negative impacts of existing legislation.9. GermanyAverage Rank: 10Germany has improved its gender equality ranking, moving from 10th place in 2022 to 6th in 2023, according to the World Economic Forum. Progress in political empowerment was noted, but economic opportunity lagged due to a high gender wage gap and limited female representation in management positions. Germany outperformed the UK, Canada, and the US in this ranking. It is one of the most egalitarian countries in the world.8. AustraliaAverage Rank: 9 In Australia, Accenture Plc (NYSE:ACN)’s investment in education has extended to their partnerships with organizations like AIME and the Alannah &amp; Madeline Foundation, where they support students in building the most in-demand skills and digital confidence.7. IcelandAverage Rank: 7.25Iceland is renowned for its gender equality as it has topped the World Economic Forum's gender equality report for over a decade. With nearly half of its parliament seats held by women in 2021, Iceland's democratic and social model earns its reputation as a paradise for gender equality. Iceland is one of the most gender-equal countries in the world.6. NetherlandsAverage Rank: 6.75Dutch teenagers consistently rank high in life satisfaction, with strong social support, egalitarian environments at home and school, and flexible educational systems. The country's low unemployment, economic stability, and optimistic society also play a role. Teenagers tend to have minimal pressure to conform and greater freedom for self-discovery.

46,ff647ed1-21aa-3440-b5be-64f9e3c7fab8,MCO,2023-10-13,Moody's' (NYSE:MCO) five-year earnings growth trails the strong shareholder returns,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/moodys-nyse-mco-five-earnings-140029752.html,1697119229,STORY,['MCO'],"[When you buy shares in a company, it's worth keeping in mind the possibility that it could fail, and you could lose your money. But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. For example, the Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) share price has soared 106% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. Better yet, the share price has risen 3.7% in the last week. But this could be related to the buoyant market which is up about 2.9% in a week.On the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Moody's To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, Moody's achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 6.4% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 16% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Moody's' key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Moody's's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Moody's' TSR for the last 5 years was 115%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Moody's has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 36% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 17% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

The preliminary metrics has shed light on the company's business outlook and trends in its various end markets for the September quarter.In the third quarter, Ericsson is likely to have generated revenue of SEK 64.5 billion ($6 billion) down 5% year over year. In the Networks vertical, ERIC witnessed a substantial 60% drop in organic sales from North America. It was induced by reduced capital expenditure by operators and inventory corrections. However, positive demand trends in India helped offset this decline to some extent. In Networks vertical, the company expected to have registered a revenue of SEK 41.5 billion ($3.9 billion) down 14% year over year.The company announced that a decline in Vonage’s core operations, higher interest rates and a drop in its market capitalization has resulted in non-cash impairment charges of SEK 32 billion ($3 billion). The impairment charges account for approximately 50% of the total value of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with Vonage. While the Enterprise vertical has been affected by the Vonage slowdown, healthy demand for Enterprise Wireless Solutions supported the top line in this segment. From the Enterprise segment, the company is expected to have recorded SEK 6.7 billion ($619.5 million) in reveneues compared to SEK 5 billion in the year-ago quarter.With the Vonage buyout, Ericsson aimed to establish a market for easy-to-adapt global network platform with application program interfaces that will drive the next digitalization wave. Despite the recent setbacks, Vonage remains a crucial part of Ericsson's roadmap to capitalize on the market potential of the Global Network Platform. The market valuation is projected to reach a staggering $20 billion by 2028.The selective metrics offer a preliminary perspective, excluding restructuring and impairment charges. Ericsson had earlier expected EBITA margin for the third quarter to be in line with or marginally better than the second-quarter levels. The company’s EBITA margin for the third quarter is now likely to be 7.3% compared to 5.7% in the June-end quarter. The Cloud Software and Services vertical reported 10% year-over-year growth and achieved break even on a four-rolling-quarter basis. In the September quarter, Management expects SEK15.6 billion ($1.4 billion) in revenues from this segment.  The EBITA margin from this segment rose to 2.8% from a negative 5% in the year-ago quarter. These results are aligned with the company’s third-quarter guidance.Despite weakness in some end markets, management is confident about a gradual market recovery. Ericsson is well-positioned to cash in on the market momentum with its competitive 5G product portfolio. The company continues to execute its strategy to become a leading mobile infrastructure provider and establish a focused enterprise business. Its patent licensing business continues to perform well on the back of a strong intellectual property rights portfolio.Courtesy of investments in R&amp;D, combined with operational efficiency, Ericsson has the world’s leading patent portfolio in cellular technology.

The Finnish authorities have said they are investigating on the assumption that it was caused by deliberate sabotage, igniting suspicion of Russian involvement.Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said she would not rule out Russian involvement until the investigation is complete.Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said the leak was caused by an “external source”.Fears of sabotage have sparked market concerns over the vulnerability of other Baltic and North Sea gas infrastructure. Alongside worries over the risk to gas supply from the conflict in Israel, it has contributed to a 47pc jump in wholesale UK gas prices since the start of the week.Story continues04:32 PM BSTNASA launches spacecraft to metal asteroidSpaceX’s Falcon Heavy rocket launched on Friday carrying a NASA spacecraft on a $985m interplanetary science mission.The spacecraft will investigate a metal-rich asteroid called Psyche, which could give clues about the Earth’s core.The rocket lifted off from Florida’s Kennedy Space Center at 10.19am local time on Friday. It is the first time NASA has used the SpaceX rocket for a mission of this kind.The journey to Psyche will take nearly six years. The spacecraft will orbit the asteroid for two years to anaylse what it is made from.Psyche is shaped like a potato and is up to 173 miles wide.04:19 PM BSTUS house prices most unaffordable on recordHousing affordability in the US slumped to a new record low in August, new data shows.A combination of high house prices and high mortgage rates mean homes are more unaffordable than at any point in American history since at least 1989, according to the National Association of Realtors.The NAR’s index for housing affordability fell to 91.7 in August, down from 93.9 in July.If the index is below 100, it means a household with an average income will not qualify for a mortgage on a typical home.High borrowing costs initially triggered a drop in house prices in the US, but a shortage of supply means values have climbed to hit new record highs.An average family buying a typical $413,500 home in August had to spend 27.3pc of their household income on their mortgage payments, with rates at 7.12pc.A year earlier, when the average home cost $398,800 and rates were at 5.29pc, buying a home only took up 22.6pc of a typical household’s income.03:32 PM BSTHanding overThis is the point when I duck out -

Alex Kraus/Bloomberg02:03 PM BSTPound creeps higher after dollar rallyThe pound has edged higher a day after the dollar had its biggest daily increase since March amid stubbornly high US inflation figures.The dollar index, which measures the US currency against six of its major peers, rose 0.8pc on Thursday, its biggest one-day jump since March 15.However, today the pound clawed back some of its loss and is up 0.1pc against the greenback to nearly $1.22.Sterling was flat against the euro at 86p.01:45 PM BSTUS markets mixed before opening bellWall Street’s main stock indexes lacked direction before the opening bell as investors assessed earnings from major US banks.JP Morgan Chase, the biggest American bank, posted a jump in third-quarter profit as higher interest rates boosted its income from loans. Its shares rose 0.5pc in premarket trading.Wells Fargo gained 1.9pc after the US lender’s profit got a boost from customers paying higher interest on loans. Citigroup gained 2.4pc as it reported steady earnings.BlackRock reported a 13pc rise in third-quarter profit on a rebound in markets. However, shares of the world’s largest asset manager remained flat.US stocks registered their first decline in five days on Thursday as yields rose after data showed inflation remains stubbornly high. Yields, however, eased today.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2pc in premarket trading. The S&amp;P 500 was up 0.1pc in premarket trading, while the Nasdaq 100 was down 0.2pc.01:32 PM BSTCitigroup buoyed by rising investment banking feesCitigroup’s profit was broadly steady in the third quarter, fuelled by rising interest payments and surging investment banking fees.The bank’s net income rose to $3.5bn (£2.9bn) from a year ago, while earnings per share remained stable at $1.63, exceeding the consensus estimate of $1.21 by analysts polled by LSEG.Revenue at Citi’s institutional clients group that houses its Wall Street operations increased 12pc from a year ago, fuelled by a jump in investment banking fees.

He said:Currently, US consumers and businesses generally remain healthy, although, consumers are spending down their excess cash buffers.However, persistently tight labor markets as well as extremely high government debt levels with the largest peacetime fiscal deficits ever are increasing the risks that inflation remains elevated and that interest rates rise further from here.Additionally, we still do not know the longer-term consequences of quantitative tightening, which reduces liquidity in the system at a time when market-making capabilities are increasingly limited by regulations.Furthermore, the war in Ukraine compounded by last week’s attacks on Israel may have far-reaching impacts on energy and food markets, global trade, and geopolitical relationships.This may be the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades. While we hope for the best, we prepare the Firm for a broad range of outcomes so we can consistently deliver for clients no matter the environment.To conclude, I want to thank our extraordinary employees for all of their hard work in making us one of the most trusted financial institutions in the world.JP Morgan chief executive Jamie Dimon - AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin01:06 PM BSTNigel Farage to bank with Lloyds after Coutts account closureNigel Farage will start banking with Lloyds after the controversial closure of his Coutts account.Our correspondents Simon Foy and Matt Oliver have the latest:The former UK Independence Party leader said on Friday he was relieved to have been offered an account by Lloyds, Britain’s biggest mortgage provider, after he was rejected by a string of other high street lenders because of his political views.It comes after his accounts with Coutts were closed over the summer after staff decided his views did not “align” with the bank’s own values “as an inclusive organisation”.When the row went public, it triggered a furore that led to the resignation of Dame Alison Rose as chief executive of NatWest, which owns Coutts.An official inquiry into debanking was also launched.Read what Mr Farage told the Telegraph.Nigel Farage has begun banking with Lloyds after the Coutts furore - Gareth Fuller/PA Wire12:52 PM BSTJeff Bezos buys neighbour’s Florida mansion for $79mAmazon founder Jeff Bezos has bought his neighbour’s Florida mansion for $79m (£65m) in an area known as “Billionaire Bunker”.Our senior technology reporter Matthew Field has the details:The seven-bedroom property, which has a wine cellar, a home cinema and a sauna, is located next door to another vast property that Mr Bezos bought earlier this year for a reported $68m.The estate, which covers 19,000 sq ft, is situated in Indian Creek, a village on a private island near Miami.

We have a challenge with inflation, which is still too high. And we have the challenge of the international environment where there is still a lot of shocks.“So I need, as Chancellor, to focus on reliance in the face of those shocks. I am very much hoping for the best, but I do need to prepare for the worst, because I think we can see that the world is a very dangerous place right now.”Asked if the economic numbers, including inflation, are not as good as he would have hoped for at this time, he said:The numbers are definitely worse than what I faced in the spring.Our debt interest is likely to be £20bn to £30bn higher this year than we predicted in the spring. So yes, it’s a very challenging environment in the short-term.But my approach to this is to say we will manage those short-term pressures whilst at the same time building for the long-term.Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt is ""hoping for the best"" but ""preparing for the worst"" when planning for the Autumn Statement.Mr Hunt told Economics and Data editor @EdConwaySky he is still confident about the UK economy's future.https://t.co/aeZ2wQ1Q8f📺 Sky 501 pic.twitter.com/durMF4Wv0F— Sky News (@SkyNews) October 13, 202310:40 AM BSTEquifax fined £11m for security breach by Chinese hackersEquifax has been fined £11.2m over one of the largest cybersecurity breaches in history when the details of nearly 14m UK consumers was accessed by Chinese hackers.The Financial Conduct Authority issued the fine after it said Equifax failed “to manage and monitor the security” of its British customers in an attack that was “entirely preventable”.More than 147m Americans also had their personal information stolen by the credit reporting company in the incident 2017, one of the largest known data breaches in history.The hackers were able to access customers’ names, dates of birth, phone numbers, Equifax membership login details, partially exposed credit card details, and home addresses.Equifax’s UK operation, which left the handling of its data to its US parent company, did not find out that UK consumer data had been accessed until six weeks after it discovered the breach. The FCA said its data arrangement effectively counted as outsourcing.Therese Chambers, joint executive director of enforcement at the FCA, said:Financial firms hold data on customers that is highly attractive to criminals. They have a duty to keep it safe and Equifax failed to do so.They compounded this failure by the ways they mishandled their response to the data breach.

And… they’re gonna go on being tight ones.”Mr Bailey said interest rates were now in “restrictive” territory, meaning they are slowing the economy.He said: “We are seeing policy operating in a restricted fashion and obviously that does have a have an effect on the outlook for activity.”Inflation currently stands at 6.7pc and the Bank does not expect it to get back to its 2pc target until 2025.09:20 AM BSTOil gains amid Israel-Gaza bloodshedOil prices have pushed higher amid fears the Israel-Hamas war could destabilise the Middle East.Brent crude, the international benchmark, has risen 2.3pc toward $88 a barrel, while US-produced West Texas Intermediate has risen 2.4pc toward $85.Brent has gained more than 4pc this week but crude has been volatile as traders try to price in the potential for the war to draw in Iran, a supplier of arms and money to Hamas.Charu Chanana, market strategist for Saxo Capital, said: “The key threat to oil will only come if Iran’s involvement is proven.

Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Specifically, we decided to study Signet Jewelers'  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. Check out our latest analysis for Signet Jewelers How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Signet Jewelers is:21% = US$487m ÷ US$2.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.21 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Signet Jewelers' Earnings Growth And 21% ROEAt first glance, Signet Jewelers seems to have a decent ROE. Even when compared to the industry average of 20% the company's ROE looks quite decent. This certainly adds some context to Signet Jewelers' exceptional 61% net income growth seen over the past five years. However, there could also be other drivers behind this growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Signet Jewelers' net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 26%.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is Signet Jewelers fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.Is Signet Jewelers Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Signet Jewelers' ' three-year median payout ratio is on the lower side at 7.3% implying that it is retaining a higher percentage (93%) of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business as evidenced by the growth seen by the company.Additionally, Signet Jewelers has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 10% over the next three years. Despite the higher expected payout ratio, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much.ConclusionOn the whole, we feel that Signet Jewelers' performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

GrahamThanks, Tiffany, and good morning, everyone. The good news you heard yesterday is that Tim Wentworth has agreed to join WBA as our new Chief Executive Officer effective October 23. We're thrilled to have Tim and believe he will make a meaningful contribution to the future of the company with his deep knowledge and expertise in health care.We've asked him to make a few comments this morning, and I would like to turn it over to him now. Tim?Tim WentworthThanks, Ginger. I'm excited to join the call today and even more excited to get to work after next week.During my nearly 3 decades in health care, I've led efforts to create innovative and flexible health services to meet the needs of health plans, employers and government organizations as well as their employees and members. And you know whether building a team that grew the largest, most operationally efficient PBM in the country, or helping to establish Accredo as the most significant specialty pharmacy in the United States, or helping to put together Evernorth, a $100 billion-plus health services business, I've consistently built relationships and offered solutions both for customers who are looking for a trusted innovative partner who listens and for patients who are looking for access and affordability.This impact was the direct result of having a winning team of employees and a culture that values patients. Now I know WBA. I have worked with Walgreens as a customer, partner, competitor, investor and family member, and I understand the challenges ahead for us as well as for the health care industry.Walgreens was built on convenience, access and trust and has unique advantages in today's health care environment. I see the opportunities before us to build on our pharmacy strength and our trusted brand to evolve health care and the customer experience to deliver better outcomes at a lower cost.Now I've learned a lot over the recent weeks. As you might imagine, I've spent time with each and every board member, talking about the future and their priorities, learning about our challenges and opportunities, and most importantly, the importance of execution. Those discussions inform my own research. And of course, I have my personal experiences.For example, just last week, Mave, a terrific store employee in Rochester, New York, professionally and cheerfully delivered to make a critical prescription to help my mother. It was the kind of experience I appreciate and everyone deserves. And I know that Mave is surrounded by the committed pharmacists and other team members, all of whom together can improve the lives of each person who walks through our door, in my mom's hometown, Walgreens, and Rochester, and in every store we operate.All of these experiences together made my decision to join WBA, frankly, an easy one. There is a reservoir of goodwill for this company across communities and a substantial opportunity to return value to our customers, employees and shareholders.Alongside the Board, our team members and partners, I'm enthusiastic about our future and realizing our health care strategy and vision. I'm humbled to serve as WBA's next CEO and look forward to speaking to many of you in the coming weeks.Ginger, thank you, and thank you to the entire WBA Board for this opportunity. I'll now turn it back to you.Ginger L. GrahamThanks, Tim. I'm excited and looking forward to working with you. While Tim won't be on the Q&amp;A, I'm sure he will be talking with all of you soon after he joins the company.With that, let me turn to our business results. My time here has been very focused on stabilizing our talent, addressing our level of spending relative to the scale of our business, and critically reviewing our capital allocation across the business.With the benefit of having been on the Board, it has accelerated my ability to work with the team and make swift decisions and implement changes across many areas of our operations. We have focused on three near-term operational priorities. We must support our customer-facing activities, scrutinize every penny of spend that does not directly benefit the customer and improve cash management.I will restate what we know and is critical to our future. We believe the fundamentals of our core business remain strong. We dispensed over 1 billion prescriptions annually across our retail and specialty pharmacies. We play a key role in health care delivery in this country.78% of Americans live within 5 miles of a Walgreens or a Duane Reade and 58% of us are likely to visit a local pharmacy as the first step for a nonemergency health need. Our trusted brand, deep community relationships and convenience form the foundation of our pharmacy business and our platform for growth as we expand throughout other areas of health care.I see significant opportunity to improve the cost base of this business. During the last 6 weeks, we have taken decisive actions to rightsize our cost structure. We expect over $1 billion of cost savings during fiscal year 2024 based on the actions we have already taken and are in progress.Examples include, reducing our headquarter costs going line by line, expense category by expense category and reducing all nonessential spend. We've reviewed and are reducing areas for contracted or project work. We are altering our store operating hours based on local market trends. We are closing unprofitable stores. We're driving supply chain efficiencies, including using AI to more accurately forecast demand and optimizing our transportation network. We're also implementing centralized services that control inventory, reduce workload and provide better customer support.We're taking a hard look at all projects and stopping those that are not essential. These actions reduce expenses, but more importantly, they help focus our energy on the most important needs for the business and for our customers.We are more aggressively managing decisions that impact cash. This includes working capital management, targeting over $500 million of improvement and defining near-term capital expenditure reductions, which we expect will bolster our balance sheet and support our priorities.Let me give you some examples. One major effort at Walgreens has been to introduce a perpetual pharmacy inventory system across the chain. As of last week, it is available to all 9,000 of our stores. This provides complete visibility of our inventory in the pharmacies and supports our work to reduce excess inventory and free up working capital. It also has many benefits for the pharmacy staff, and feedback has been overwhelmingly positive as it simplifies workflows reducing store level activities.Another area where we have reduced working capital and impacted our workflow at the store level is related to regional micro fulfillment centers. These centers allow us to improve product availability, while, at the same time, reduce total inventory levels.Our 11th micro fulfillment center opened 3 weeks ago. These centers currently support more than 4,300 stores, filling over 2.3 million prescriptions each week across 29 states. As we fill more prescriptions centrally, it frees up our staff to spend more time with customers, offering other health-related products and services and it relieves some of the pressure on store staffing.It is important to note that we have paused further expansion of our fulfillment centers to first drive improvements in the rollout, so we may fully realize the many benefits the centers offer: working capital reduction, inventory tracking and control, customer service enhancements, workflow improvement and reduction in cost to fill. The team has defined threshold requirements of performance before we move to implement the final five locations.There is significant opportunity to reduce retail inventory and optimize our retail product mix. We are reducing SKUs, addressing slow-moving product categories and moving e-commerce shipments to fulfillment by our stores, getting the delivery to the customer, in most cases, in less than 1 hour. This is augmented by real progress on our own brands, which offers a big opportunity that we have been slow to capture.All of these working capital improvements yield customer service benefits and workflow improvements for our staff. Cash is also influenced by our capital expenditure budgets, and we are reducing our capital expenditures in fiscal year 2024 compared to last year, down approximately $600 million. We have already identified many of the actions required to deliver this improvement and to ensure that we execute all capital and project expenses are now being reviewed and approved centrally.One other important action I want to mention is our return to the office. I have recently communicated that our leaders are expected to return to the office this month, and all other team members are expected back in late November. We are convinced that our ability to act quickly, deliver priority projects and respond to business demands will be improved by being together.With that, I'll hand it over to Manmohan to review our financial results and our outlook for fiscal year 2024.Manmohan MahajanThank you, Ginger, and good morning. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS came in near the low end of the range provided on June 27 and in line with our update on September 1. Our results reflected a further slowdown in respiratory events, shifting consumer behaviors, driven by a challenging macroeconomic environment, and lower COVID-19-related contributions. Overall, we delivered 8.3% sales growth on a constant currency basis. This includes $1.4 billion in growth in our health care business versus the prior year.Our U.S. retail pharmacy business grew 3.6% and our Boots U.K. business delivered 10.9% sales growth. Adjusted EPS of $0.67 was down 18% on a constant currency basis. The 18% decline was driven by lower COVID-19 contributions, lower sale leaseback gains, net of rent and a higher tax rate.We saw positive results from underlying retail pharmacy performance, lower incentive accruals, strong international growth and improved profitability in U.S. health care. GAAP net loss of $180 million improved by $235 million compared to prior year. Remember that we had a $783 million noncash impairment charge in the year ago quarter. The loss in the quarter was driven by charges for certain legal and regulatory accruals and settlements and onetime charges related to transformational cost management program.Now let's move to the year-to-date highlights. Fiscal '23 sales increased 5.6% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EPS of $3.98 was down 20.3% on a constant currency basis. Our results reflected lower COVID-19 contributions and increased labor investments. These challenges were partly offset by lower incentive accruals, growth in international and retail performance in the U.S. GAAP net loss was $3.1 billion compared to net earnings of $4.3 billion in fiscal '22. Fiscal '23 included a $5.5 billion after-tax charge for opioid-related claims and lawsuits.Now let's move to the U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment. Comp sales growth was 5.7%, reflecting higher brand inflation and mix impacts in our pharmacy business and comp script growth. AOI was down 29.4% in the quarter, reflecting a 27% impact from lower COVID-19 contributions and a 17% impact from lower levels of sale leaseback gains, net of rent, higher underlying pharmacy gross profit and lower incentive accruals contributed positively to AOI. Let me now turn to U.S. pharmacy, pharmacy comp sales increased 9.2% in the quarter, driven by brand inflation and mix impacts and comp script growth.A weaker-than-normal respiratory season and impact of Medicaid redeterminations resulted in a weaker overall prescription market during the quarter. Third-party market data showed flu, cold and respiratory activity down 35% compared to the prior year quarter. Despite these weaker trends, comp scripts grew 1.6%, excluding immunizations.We administered roughly 400,000 COVID-19 vaccinations in the quarter down from 2.9 million in the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of COVID-19, fourth quarter adjusted gross profit increased versus the prior year period.Turning next to our U.S. retail business. During the quarter, the retail business was impacted by a weaker-than-normal respiratory season and a continued shift in consumer behaviors, driven by a challenging macroeconomic environment. As a result, comparable sales declined 3.3% in the quarter.There are three main drivers: first, an 80% decline in COVID-19 test kits impacted growth by around 160 basis points; second, weaker cough, cold, flu sales had an approximately 100 basis points impact; and lastly, we were impacted by approximately 60 basis points from summer seasonal weakness, as customers continue to pull back on discretionary spending, reflecting the challenging macroeconomic environment.Looking at category performance, we saw a decline in health and wellness, while personal care and beauty both grew low single digits. Retail gross margin was impacted by elevated shrink and lower sales in a higher-margin categories, such as cough, cold, flu seasonal and COVID-19 test kits. Despite the pressure in the second half, gross margin grew by nearly 100 basis points in fiscal '23, on top of a 100 basis point increase in the prior year.Turning next to the International segment, and as always, I will talk in constant currency numbers. The International segment again performed very well in the quarter, delivering profit ahead of guidance. Sales increased 6.7%, with growth across all international markets. Boots U.K. was up 10.9% and Germany wholesale grew 3.5%.Gross profit increased nearly 10%, outpacing sales growth. Boots U.K. experienced continued strong retail growth and improved pharmacy margin compared to the prior year period. Despite higher inflation and increased store-related costs, SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales improved, benefiting from disciplined cost management. These impacts resulted in adjusted operating income growth of 52%.Let's now look in more details at Boots U.K.. Comp retail sales increased 11.7%, on top of a 15.2% comp in the prior year quarter. Boots grew market share for the tenth consecutive quarter, approximately 1 percentage point versus the prior year quarter, with gains in beauty and health and wellness. Boots.com sales grew 29% year-on-year and represented over 13% of our U.K. retail sales.Turning next to U.S. Healthcare. U.S. Healthcare segment results were in line with the guidance provided on June 27, with AOI and adjusted EBITDA both up sequentially and year-over-year. The business continues to rapidly scale with fourth quarter sales of $2 billion, reflecting the acquisition of CareCentrix, the acquisition of Summit Health by VillageMD, and growth in all businesses.Segment pro forma sales grew 19%, driven by VillageMD sales of $1.4 billion, up 17% on a pro forma basis. The growth was led by higher value-based lives, expansion of the clinic footprint and increased fee-for-service volumes as clinics mature. CareCentrix sales were up 24% on a pro forma basis, and Shields delivered pro forma sales growth of 29%. Segment gross profit improved 29% sequentially. Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $30 million, an improvement of $103 million from the prior year quarter.Turning next to the cash flow. We generated $2.3 billion of operating cash flow in fiscal '23, reflecting lower COVID-19 contributions, opioid settlement payments and losses in our U.S. Healthcare segment. Fiscal '23 capital expenditures of $2.1 billion increased by approximately $400 million compared to the prior year. This was driven by growth initiatives, including VillageMD and the micro fulfillment center rollout. This resulted in free cash flow of $665 million. We also reduced debt by $2.6 billion in fiscal '23.As Ginger discussed, we are taking a number of actions to drive improvement in free cash flow in fiscal '24, including approximately $600 million in reduced capital expenditures and approximately $500 million benefit from working capital optimization initiatives.I will now turn to our fiscal '24 guidance. We are guiding to fiscal '24 adjusted EPS of $3.20 to $3.50, down from $3.98 in fiscal '23. Before discussing underlying performance, I want to mention some key headwinds that we will face in fiscal '24. These include lower sale and leaseback contributions, a higher tax rate and lower COVID-19 contributions. We're also assuming continued macroeconomic pressure on the consumer and a weaker respiratory season compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of these headwinds our forecast assumes underlying growth, which is primarily driven by two factors: First we expect accelerating profitability in our U.S. healthcare business in 2024 as the segment continues to scale, with adjusted EBITDA expected to be at or around breakeven.Second, we expect U.S. retail pharmacy underlying adjusted operating income to be driven by immediate actions to improve the cost base and modest underlying growth in both retail and pharmacy.Let me now illustrate the larger moving pieces as we bridge from fiscal '23 to fiscal '24. I mentioned three notable headwinds to adjusted EPS. Sale and leaseback is estimated to have a negative year-on-year impact of between 11% to 13%.As we have said before, we do not expect any contribution from sale and leaseback beyond fiscal '24. Tax rates will be higher in 2024, increasing by approximately 10 percentage points compared to 2023 due to higher international rates and benefits recognized in 2023 that are not expected to repeat in 2024.Finally, we're projecting lower COVID-19 contributions that result in a 6% to 7% year-on-year impact. Excluding these impacts, we expect underlying growth of 9% to 12%, driven by accelerating profitability in U.S. health care and immediate actions to improve our cost base across the company.Let me now walk you through the 2024 guidance in greater detail. Overall, we expect total sales in fiscal '24 to be up 1% to 4% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted operating income is expected to be down 5% to 12% on a constant currency basis.Let me now walk you through the assumptions and guidance for each of our reporting segments, starting with U.S. retail pharmacy. U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment sales are projected to be flat to up 2%. AOI will be negatively impacted by approximately 8 percentage points from the lower COVID-19 contributions and roughly 11 percentage points of lower sale and leaseback gains. Excluding these impacts, the underlying business is projected to drive 5% to 10% AOI growth.I will now take you through the key business drivers. First, we anticipate script volume growth driven by overall market growth. On reimbursement, we have roughly 75% of the contract signed for calendar year '24. We do expect reimbursement pressure to be less of a headwind in fiscal '24 than in fiscal '23.We're projecting approximately 5 million COVID vaccinations in 2024. Quarter-to-date, we're well on track and have already administered over 3 million COVID vaccinations. In retail, we expect margins to benefit from our category performance improvement program and a roughly 1 percentage point increase in own brand penetration.At the same time, we're adopting a prudent approach. We see a continuation of the challenging trends that impacted the second half of fiscal 2023. We're projecting flat comparable sales due to a milder cough, cold, and flu season year-on-year, lower COVID OTC test kit volume and continued consumer pressure. We're also planning a higher level of shrink, which has been increasing in the last several months and continues to represent a serious systemic issue across the retail industry. Within SG&amp;A, we expect to achieve over $1 billion of cost savings during fiscal 2024, as Ginger has already described.Turning next to guidance for the International segment. Segment sales are projected flat to up 4% on a constant currency basis. We expect adjusted operating income of $745 million to $770 million, representing a constant currency decline of 18% to 21%. The year-on-year decline is entirely driven by property transactions during fiscal '23, which will not be repeated, and the pending sales of the business in Chile. Excluding those impacts, we expect AOI growth to be flat to up 2%, with continued execution within Boots U.K. retail business held back by the impact of inflationary pressures.Now let's turn to U.S. Healthcare. We are focused on driving improved financial performance for U.S. Healthcare in 2024. We expect fiscal '24 sales of $8.3 billion to $8.8 billion, reflecting first full year of Summit Health and ongoing growth in all businesses.On a pro forma basis, we see sales growth of 10% to 17% and expect fiscal '24 adjusted EBITDA to be breakeven at the midpoint of the guidance range. This represents an increase of $325 million to $425 million compared to fiscal '23, driven by growth in full-risk lives, fee-for-service volume, optimization of the clinic footprint and realignment of the cost base at VillageMD, robust growth at Shields and Walgreens Health business growth, driven by scaling of our clinical trial business and health care services and through cost management.We assume an effective tax rate of approximately 19% to 20%, with the year-over-year increase driven by higher international statutory tax rates and benefits recognized in 2023 that are not expected to repeat in 2024. Interest expense is expected to decrease by approximately $80 million. In the first quarter, we will be lapping the prior year quarter's adjusted EPS of $1.16.The following five factors are expected to have an outsized impact in the first quarter this year. First, we had a significant tax benefit in prior year period, which will not repeat in the first quarter of 2024. Second, we're expecting COVID-19 contributions to be lower in the first quarter, reflecting last year's omicron wave and seasonality. Third, we anticipate lower contributions from sale and leaseback activity. Fourth, we're lapping elevated levels of labor investments in our pharmacy staff. Finally, we also expect a more normalized flu season in fiscal '24, peaking in the second quarter versus the early start in the prior year.Moving beyond the first quarter, we will see sequential improvement, and I will discuss the top four drivers. First, we're executing a series of actions to lower our cost base. These will have limited impact on the first quarter, but will start to ramp in the second quarter. There is adjusted EPS benefit of $0.50 to $0.60 in the balance of the year compared to the first quarter.Second, in our U.S. Healthcare segment, we expect profitability to improve from optimizing the clinic footprint, growing patient panels and realigning costs. Third, we expect growing contributions from retail initiatives, including sequentially improving retail comps and margin expansion programs. Finally, seasonality plays a role in our business, benefiting the second quarter, which is usually the height of the cough, cold, flu season in the U.S. and is when Boots U.K. sees significant profit driven by the holiday season.With that, let me now hand it over to John to discuss our U.S. health care business.John P. DriscollGood morning, and thanks, Manmohan. Over the past 2 years, we've acquired or launched new businesses in primary care, multi-specialty, post-acute care, urgent care, specialty pharmacy services, population health and provider enablement. Each of these businesses builds upon our strong foundation in retail pharmacy to tap into high-growth health care services.Walgreens uniquely has an advantage in convenience, consumer traffic, independence and trust that will help us with our health plan and provider partners create solutions that deliver better outcomes at lower cost. We connect daily with many of the patients that our plan and provider partners struggle to reach. Our goal is to be the independent partner of choice, not just in pharmacy, but also in health care services, where we can lower costs and help patients.Today, most of our customers come to Walgreens to meet their pharmacy needs. Increasingly and in the future, our pharmacy teams will be a critical part of how our plan and provider partners bend the cost curve. So whether you're a health plan or a health system, you're dealing with one Walgreens and a suite of capabilities and services.Here are some of the ways that our U.S. health care assets work with Walgreens to better serve our customers and payer, provider and pharma clients. Shield is working with our Walgreens Specialty Pharmacy to convert Walgreens locations to Shield's partner sites, collaborating with our contract pharmacies and delivering better adherence for patients on complex specialty drugs and better value for hospitals.Walgreens Health and CareCentrix are partnering with Pearl Health to support providers who'd like to transition from fee-for-service to value-based care by leveraging Pearl's tech solutions with Walgreens' health care services. We'll accept full medical risk as we support physicians' patients by providing post-acute and home health solutions from CareCentrix and population health services from Walgreens' Health. All of this is underpinned by Walgreens' engagement of our customers, ensuring them access to better care.Our clinical trials business, which launched just last year, leverages our pharmacy capabilities and data to recruit and execute on clinical trials for our pharma clients. We will engage patients in all markets, including underserved communities. To date, we've signed 15 contracts and continue to see increasing demand for our services.CareCentrix provides an increasing number of post-acute services to health plans. Combining Walgreens convenient locations and CareCentrix health plan relationships and patient management, opens the door for a significant opportunity in durable medical equipment sales in our stores.The U.S. Healthcare segment has ramped to an $8 billion sales run rate in just 2 years. Our health care services aim to deliver better value for our payer and provider partners. We meet patients where they are, in order to improve access to lower-cost solutions. While we have made progress on the build-out of our health care business, we are not satisfied with the near-term returns on our investments. We will continue to grow in 2024, but with a renewed focus on more profitable growth. We have seen some improved performance in the fourth quarter, with adjusted EBITDA sequentially increasing by $83 million. Our results reflect gross profit growth, with each quarter this year building on the prior with an enhanced focus on expense discipline. We are taking swift action to unlock the embedded profits at Village and already see the benefit of improved capital and expense management with the addition of our new CFO at Village, Rich Rubino. VillageMD, Summit Health and CityMD will be the most meaningful drivers of growth in fiscal 2024.It has taken us longer than anticipated to realize the cost synergies across the combined assets. We also need to solve for a less efficient cost profile and excellence in execution. We believe that we can best enhance VillageMD growth and value by focusing on increased density in our highest opportunity markets and expanding integration of our digital assets.As we grow, we are constantly evaluating our footprint. With that, we plan to exit approximately five markets and approximately 60 clinics in fiscal 2024. These exits may take a variety of forms, including outright sales and hybrid equity arrangements as examples.As we exit these nonstrategic markets, our long-term focus will be on achieving density in those regions with the greatest potential to drive future profitability growth and where we can best serve patients with our consolidated set of assets.The VillageMD model works, as evidenced by the consistent performance of reducing total cost of care and improving outcomes in our more mature markets. VillageMD has a Net Promoter Score of 89, which is one point higher than what I shared a year ago. We are also launching new virtual and less capital-intensive models.In August, we launched a pilot program with CityMD and Duane Reade, where a Duane Reade Walgreens customer can click a QR code and set up a visit at CityMD or a virtual telehealth visit with a clinician. We plan to roll out this digital partnership across Manhattan in the fall.Our VillageMD business is a primary care-led risk-bearing platform serving all customers and payers, focusing on utilizing their technology platform to deliver the best health outcomes in a lower total cost of care. Growth in clinics translates into growth in full risk lives as evidenced by the growth in member months in all markets and mature markets. From fiscal year 2022 to 2023, VillageMD has grown full risk member months by 40% across all markets and 24% in our mature markets.Even with the rapid growth of VillageMD clinics, we're seeing positive proof points of the business' ability to perform in full risk arrangements. For our full-risk MA population in three mature markets, we've seen Village bend the cost curve across multiple payers. Going forward, as we focus on more profitable growth, we will build on positive clinical margin to deliver contribution margin on a consolidated basis.Next, I'd like to discuss our latest Walgreens Health partnership. We're partnering with Pearl Health, a provider enablement company, that can help Walgreens expand our risk offering to more community-based primary care providers.Walgreens and Pearl together will provide a management services offering, with Walgreens providing prescription fulfillment, medication adherence, immunizations, care gap closures and diagnostic testing. Integrating local Walgreens pharmacies translates into more access to members with chronic illness, and more opportunities to influence better patient outcomes. This partnership enables physicians and health systems to work with us to manage the chronically ill in a much more targeted fashion. Pearl's access to doctors through the ACO reach program creates a care traffic control system that can deliver on our commitment to provide better health care at a lower price for plans and patients. This model is also capital efficient, scalable and configurable nationwide.With this partnership, we are initially assuming risk for 9,000 lives in 12 markets. Our existing Walgreens Health payer relationships have started with fee-for-service arrangements tied to care gap closures, clinical quality services and screening.Successful performance with these services provides a sound foundation for moving up the risk continuum. We expect to develop a range of risk arrangements that will leverage our assets across the care continuum, including VillageMD, Summit and CareCentrix, all building on our suite of clinical services available at Walgreens.With that, I'd like to pass it back to Ginger for closing remarks.Ginger L. GrahamThank you, John. The last several weeks have reinforced my confidence in the company's potential and also crystallized what actions must be taken to achieve it. We are focused on the right things. I am already encouraged by early results from decisions that advance our customer focus, eliminate cost and conserve cash.While we have a challenging year ahead of us, as Manmohan said earlier, our plan anticipates 9% to 12% growth in adjusted operating income from our underlying business. This comes in large part from our aggressive actions to manage costs we control.Of course, none of this would be possible without the hard work and dedication of a vast team of people here at WBA. They are doing the work, and they've moved quickly to respond to the realities of the business. I'm thankful for their responsiveness and commitment and for the opportunity that lies ahead as we set up WBA for a successful future together.Now I would like to open the line for questions. Operator?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions)Your first question comes from the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan.Lisa Christine GillI just really wanted to understand two things a little bit better. First, John, when you talk about the ramp and the challenges to profitability, one, when we think about that improved profitability, the exit of those markets in the 60 clinics, is that contributing to better AOI as we think about 2024? And then secondly, trying to better understand where you see the biggest opportunities from a challenge perspective, you talked about a lot of positive at Pearl, you talked about the turnaround at Village. Obviously, CareCentrix did really well this quarter.But can you maybe just talk about what are some of the other challenges you feel like you need to overcome to really truly make this a profitable business?John P. DriscollSure. I think -- Lisa, thanks for the question. If you think about the cost reduction, that's only one piece of what we're doing at Village City and Summit. It's really a 3-pronged strategy. We are rightsizing the footprint and getting our expenses in the right place. There are revenue synergy opportunities, and we're seeing consistent growth in core revenues, which indicate that there's some opportunity on the margin side, which we are quickly getting after.And then the rest of U.S. health care, actually, we're seeing substantial growth and building profitability in CareCentrix, Shields our analytics business, our U.S. health care business. So we're seeing substantial demand clinical trials is doing quite well. And so I think, as a portfolio, we have -- we are very confident in our ability to perform in '24. If you look at those revenue numbers, we've got the revenues. Now we're going to get at some more effectively -- some of the embedded profits.Lisa Christine GillAnd then just as it ties into kind of what everybody is talking about on the retail side, right, and I know you've given some guidance there. But as we think about expectation of scripts coming down, I would think that maybe there's an opportunity for more scripts to be pulled through into Walgreens.I understand respiratory, et cetera. But maybe if somebody can comment, Rick, if Rick is on the call. How do you think about that pull-through and opportunity on the scripts, excluding what we're seeing on the respiratory side? I know that the talk was 75% of relationships are signed on reimbursement, but reimbursement is expected to be down. Like what are going to be some of the big drivers beyond the $1 billion of incremental cost saves that we can actually see drive the operating profit in your core pharmacy business?Rick GatesYes. And Lisa, this is Rick. It's a great question. And I'll kind of give the building blocks to script growth that we're expecting this year. Obviously, we saw a weaker end of the fiscal year from market growth, specifically around cough, cold, flu, some of the respiratory and some of the Medicaid redetermination, which shows some lower utilization from consumers.So the primary driver of the market coming back in line with what the expectations are from IQVIA and others. And so that's really what we've seen as we started into the first quarter of the fiscal year and market is going to be a big underpinning to what we do. But we continue to advance our adherence programs that are really driving incremental script growth, partnering with health plans and others to really drive better adherence. And obviously, that does help on the script side.You're also going to see some access initiatives, especially going into calendar year '24, which should be some tailwinds for us. I think some changing dynamics in the marketplace or having individuals choose more open access and things that should give us access differently than what we've seen in the past. And the last one would be that we're really focused on potential profile buys and opportunities given some of the changes in the marketplace.So I think there's a bunch of drivers that really give us confidence that we have tailwinds behind us in the script (inaudible).OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee from TD Cowen.Charles RhyeeI wanted to ask about Tim coming on board here. Obviously, it seems like it was a fairly quick turnaround process. Maybe you can give us a little bit more insight into the that kind of hiring process sort of when he was identified? And also here, obviously, starting in 1.5 week or so, the company has given guidance. Any kind of sense on his involvement in sort of the business planning for the coming year? Anything there?And then also, obviously, you've given a lot of details in preserving and generating greater cash flow, obviously, through working capital reduction, et cetera. Any thoughts from the Board on sort of the dividend policy at this point?Ginger L. GrahamThanks Charles. Let me start off with the process around Tim. We, as a Board, engaged a global executive search firm, and spent quite a bit of time with them talking about what we believe were the important characteristics, attributes and experiences of someone who would lead an organization of this impact and magnitude.We did review dozens of candidates. There was quite an extensive search process that was undertaken. And we then narrowed it down to a top few, where personal interviews were conducted with those individuals. We did a very aggressive background and reference check with the primary candidates and then have had, what I would call, very extended conversations in a broad sense about philosophy, background, experiences, the future, the market dynamics, the capabilities required and about the ability to manage a very complex global organization.As Tim mentioned in his comments, every single Board member has been involved. I would say that we've done a very extensive evaluation through the process. And we did decide in the process that Tim was a very striking candidate for us on a number of fronts. Obviously, we were clear that we were looking for someone who had extensive background in health care, and Tim brings that pharmacy provider, payer networks, distribution. He really does understand a surround sound of the feedback that we get from the market about Walgreens and its many businesses.He also has managed scale and complexity before, which I think is very important. This is a $140 billion business. It's global. It has many possibilities, but someone has to be able to manage the strategic and the operational aspects of that.And I think you heard from him, even in his quick comments, he's very patient and customer-focused, which to me is a primary importance because that passion for the business, the understanding we have on human lives, the importance of our discipline, our safety and compliance, our quality, our personnel and the love he has of the store, those are big wins the company. So I personally am thrilled I've had -- I don't know how many hours with Tim. And it's a lot, and he and I are not done yet. We actually start together next week in a very extended work session. So I think the Board is excited as Tim conveyed his excitement, and we're all looking forward to him starting. Obviously, that won't happen again now until the 23rd.So you -- second question you asked was his involvement in all of this. Obviously, we've only recently come to this agreement between us. And so Tim has not been involved at all in the business or the operations. He's not been a party to forming the 2024 plan although he and I have had extensive discussions about what the opportunities are, the business capabilities and our challenges, I think he mentioned maybe in his comments as well, that he comes in eyes wide open. So I think that's very important. But Tim is not a party to this plan. He is a party to what we believe is possible, and he understands the assumptions we're making and he can't wait to get here.The third question I think you asked was the Board and its discussions about the dividend. So as you might imagine, this is a very important topic to the company. We have a very thorough process as a Board that we review every year. And at this point, the Board has made no changes to the dividend policy.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank.George Robert HillYes. This is kind of a two-parted question that go together. I guess, can you talk about -- if we think about the segments, how we should look at apportioning the $1 billion in cost savings and kind of the other side of that is the cut in CapEx seems pretty severe. It's taking $0.5 billion or so out on a sub-$2 billion number.How should we think about from a segment perspective, kind of where the CapEx cuts are coming from? And kind of how they're being apportioned. And I don't know if you can kind of give any examples specifically of the bigger sources of cost-cutting savings or the bigger sources of CapEx savings?Manmohan MahajanYes, sure. So let me start with the cost savings. We're expecting at least $1 billion of cost savings. And I think the way you need to think about this is majority of this is going to be coming from our U.S. retail pharmacy business.And three or four components, let me just walk through them real quick. Ginger talked about, we're looking at all costs related to headquarter support office, and we're going line by line. So that's one. We are closing unprofitable locations, and that's going to be accretive in the year.We have optimized store hours in certain locations to match with where the local market already is. And I think the other big component of this is we've looked at all the project spend and all the projects that exist across the company. And I think the focus is there twofold. More importantly, it's how do we focus the organization on customer-focused initiatives so that we deliver more value. But then obviously, reducing the spend on the income statement. So that's on the cost side.Look, on the CapEx side, I'd say if you look at the trend we've seen, you go back to maybe fiscal '22, I think we were at around $1.4 billion in the year. We increased to -- this is '21, sorry. So -- and then we went up $300 million. And again, last year was the peak of 2.1. And so what we're trying to achieve here is getting back to kind of the normal levels of CapEx here, Two parts that are going to contribute into this again is, one, as John talked about, we're very focused in our Healthcare segment on profitable growth. And so we will see a lower level of CapEx or growth CapEx coming out from U.S. Healthcare care segment.And then if you look at a couple of drivers of the CapEx on the U.S. retail pharmacy, micro fulfillment centers as well as our digital transformation some of those things are coming to fruition. And Ginger talked about taking a pause on micro fulfillment center so that we increase the productivity and achieve the desired results there first. So those are some of the factors, high level that are driving the CapEx reduction.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Kevin Caliendo from UBS.Kevin CaliendoThe 60 clinics that are closing, sort of what was the driving factor there? Why were they not successful? Was it competition in the marketplace? Was it payer relationships? Like why weren't you able to drive volumes in those markets? What happened there? What can you learn from that?John P. DriscollKevin, it's a fair question. I think the way to think about the 60 clinic reductions is that some of them will be closed. In some cases, we're going to transition those to affiliate relationships, but it comes down to how quickly can we unlock profitable growth. And in the Village City Summit, it's about concentration of power and relevance within certain markets.Every one of our clinics actually shows month-over-month growth, but we don't see the growth coming fast enough in certain markets. And so we're going to pivot there and be very focused on where we can drive the most profitable growth. We're growing through the rightsizing of our footprint and some of the changes in our relationships, but our strategy going forward will be really focusing on markets where we see that momentum and scale and at a level that we want to see to drive the profits and the margin expectations that we want. So it's really more of a discipline around focusing on markets where we can go deep and continue to grow on a compounded serious way profitably.Kevin CaliendoOkay. That's helpful. Can I just ask a quick follow-up on cash flow. Is the right way to think about it? I know you didn't provide fiscal '24 free cash flow, but should we take the $655 million add to $600 million and reduced CapEx, $500 million benefit in working cap and then adjust for net income? Is that like a rough range of where you think it would -- should come out for fiscal '24?Manmohan MahajanYes, sure. Look, as you understand, as you rightly pointed out, we do not generally provide guidance on the free cash flows. But we have outlined, we do expect significant growth. And what we did here is we've carved out two significant drivers year-on-year. But having said that -- and there was -- let me add a third one to that as well.Just on the U.S. health care, we are expecting in fiscal '24 at the midpoint of the range to be breakeven on the EBITDA. And when you look at that year-on-year, that is a significant improvement on the cash as well.Having said that, we're also looking at other offsetting items. So we just want to make sure you have kind of the three -- we do expect significant improvement and you have those three key drivers there.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies.Brian Gil TanquilutI guess, John, just a question on VillageMD, right? You're clearly showing some expectation for meaningful year-over-year improvement there or at least the whole Walgreens Health segment.As I think about the fact that you're opening new clinics, how does the J-curve factor into this, right? Because I'm just trying to bridge to that significant improvement when you're opening new clinics, probably you will lose money?John P. DriscollSure. Well, first of all, I think we've essentially stopped the opening of new clinics. But remember, the J-curve really refers most clearly to Village. With Summit and City, we've got consistent growing revenues that balance that a bit and actually help kind of develop -- show a better profit profile.And then we've got solid growth building quarter-over-quarter with Shields, CareCentrix, our analytics business, our clinical trials business and U.S. health care. So I think you've got to think about it as a portfolio. The J-curve specifically impacting the new clinics that we are in the early stage clinics for Village, but we've got a lot of other levers to pull or really advantages in the momentum and the margin profile, improving margin profile across the other businesses.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson from Evercore ISI.Elizabeth Hammell AndersonOne thing that's been obviously a hot topic this year is utilization. Obviously, you guys have a mixed model that both has fee-for-service as well as value-based care lives. Can you talk through us how you sort of see those inflections in utilization impacting the VillageMD overall -- business overall? And then secondly, can you just comment more generally on sort of any additional deleveraging plans you have for this year?John P. DriscollI think on the utilization, utilization is our friend, obviously, at City and at Summit and has been more of a headwind in Village. The good news from a Village perspective is that even with that increasing in utilization post-COVID, that we are, particularly in our mature markets, showing an improved margin profile on our full risk lives.And so it's -- the way we solve for what's a benefit of having a 2-part portfolio is continuing to convert more of those fee-for-service lives to full risk lives with a better margin profile and optimizing our cost base so that we can get the full value of that improvement in revenues.Manmohan MahajanYes. I think on the question around deleveraging, a couple of thoughts there. Number one, we're absolutely committed to our investment-grade rating. And as we've said, one of the key areas of focus here in the last 6 to 8 weeks for me and Ginger has been cash management. I've gone through that as to how we're going to drive the improvement there. And last I would point out is we continue to have a portfolio of investments, which we look at simplification and optimizing. That provides us flexibility.OperatorOur final question comes from Eric Percher from Nephron Research.Eric R. PercherI'd like to turn to the topic of labor and ask to what extent you're seeing headwinds from labor cost? And I think there's probably a bit of a reminder on the onetime costs you see on fiscal year '23 versus fiscal year '24.Manmohan MahajanYes. Maybe let me start with the onetime costs. So look, we have significant savings here that we're going to achieve in fiscal '24, and obviously, there is going to be a cost associated with it. But when I look at the cash flow impact in the year within '24, we see a positive impact, net-net, from a cash flow perspective of cost savings initiatives net of the cost associated with it.On the labor cost, yes, look, we have seen investments in the last 1.5 years, if you think about Q1, Q1 would be the last quarter where we would see headwinds from a lever investment perspective because most of these investments were in place starting second quarter last year. Apart from that, I think normal business course investments and labor will continue.OperatorAnd we have no further questions in the queue at this time. Ginger Graham, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.Ginger L. GrahamThanks so much, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call and your questions. We really appreciate the feedback and the support. We are clear on our challenges and our priorities, and we are focused on the future. We're looking forward to your further questions. So please reach out to our Investor Relations team. Thanks very much.OperatorAnd this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 10 Best Dividend Aristocrats According to Analysts. With the stock market facing ongoing fluctuations, investors are experiencing the frustration of seeing their profits disappear. For instance, the S&amp;P 500 increased by 19.5% from January to July 2023 but has since fallen by 6%. Considering the Federal Reserve's inclination to maintain higher interest rates for an extended period, negative investor sentiment, and the typical seasonal decline, it appears that the momentum of this summer's market rally might continue to weaken as we enter the fall season. According to analysts, investors can mitigate their losses by investing in dividend stocks.Dividend stocks are already a popular choice among investors due to their reliability in providing a steady stream of income. Between 1993 and the end of last year, the S&amp;P 500 index increased by 777%. But with dividends included, the S&amp;P 500 grew by over 1,400% during that same time frame. In addition to this, when we examine the performance of the S&amp;P 500 on a decade-by-decade basis, we can see that the role of dividends in contributing to the total return has fluctuated over time. From 1930 to 2021, dividends accounted for an average of 40% of the S&amp;P 500's total return.A recent study conducted by Morgan Stanley's chief investment officer, Mike Wilson, found that stocks that pay dividends tend to perform better in the long run and are more resilient during market downturns. Here are some comments from the analyst, taken from his interview with Business Insider this month.""Our economists are of the view that inflation will continue to slow from elevated levels over the next 12 months. That backdrop is supportive of owning dividend-related factors and defensive dividend payers, in particular.""Story continuesHe further said:""Dividends provide a positive return cushion with a notable portion of outperformance for payers versus non-payers coming during periods of market volatility. Specifically, the majority of outperformance comes during large market pullbacks such as 2000, 2008, 2015, and 2020.""The Business Insider report also revealed that stocks that started paying dividends in 2000 have outperformed the market since then. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) have been raising their dividends for decades, becoming top choices for investors.

Here is what the firm has to say:“We were fairly active in the quarter as market dislocations allowed us to be opportunistic, while focusing on companies with stronger moats, better pricing power, more predictable long-term growth and higher returns. In the materials sector we exited PPG Industries, Inc. (NYSE:PPG) and initiated a position in Sherwin-Williams. While both companies operate in the paint and coating industry and are benefiting from improving margins as raw material prices have come down of late, we believe Sherwin-Williams’ dominant retail footprint affords it better pricing power through the cycle. The company provided conservative 2023 guidance and has been successfully gaining market share in the pro segment. While PPG has more European and industrial exposure, Sherwin-Williams’ residential and more domestic focus should also benefit the company as housing indicators appear to be troughing. Weak housing in the face of higher mortgage rates caused Sherwin-Williams stock to sell off in the first quarter, creating a compelling investment opportunity for long-term focused fundamental investors.”21.

The award will serve as a catalyst for a future hydrogen ecosystem in the Upper Midwest.The Heartland Hydrogen Hub (HH2H) is one of seven selected to receive funding. The hub includes Xcel Energy, Marathon Petroleum Corporation and TC Energy, in collaboration with the University of North Dakota’s Energy &amp; Environmental Resource Center, to produce and use low-carbon hydrogen at commercial scale in Minnesota, Wisconsin, South Dakota, North Dakota and Montana. The hub aims to reduce carbon emissions by more than 1 million metric tons per year, the equivalent of taking 220,000 gasoline-powered cars off the road.""Clean fuels are a critical component of enabling economy-wide decarbonization. The Heartland Hydrogen Hub is game-changing initiative that demonstrates how we’re accelerating the development of the next generation of clean energy technology with significant benefits for our customers and the environment,"" said Bob Frenzel, Xcel Energy chairman, president and CEO. ""The strong partnership with our Upper Midwest states and other energy providers demonstrates our commitment to increasing economic impact while achieving carbon reduction goals for our customers.""Clean fuels in general, and the Heartland Hydrogen Hub in particular, are a key part of Xcel Energy’s vision for zero-carbon generation and net-zero emissions from natural gas distribution by 2050. Hydrogen is a clean molecule that can reduce carbon emissions in a variety of sectors. The company plans to use its existing and future nuclear, solar and wind resources in the Upper Midwest to produce hydrogen to blend into power generation, existing natural gas distribution systems, and other agricultural and industrial applications.Story continuesFor its projects within the hub, Xcel Energy expects to receive a large portion of the federal award, subject to negotiations. In its application, Xcel Energy proposed investing up to $2 billion over a decade for clean hydrogen producing equipment and infrastructure, representing 75% of full program costs for the company’s portion of the hub. As a member of the Heartland Hydrogen Hub team, Xcel Energy is prepared to execute and fund its portion of the project to build and operate safe, clean hydrogen infrastructure in the region and bring the benefits of green hydrogen and clean fuels to the clean energy workforce and local communities.Xcel Energy’s clean energy leadershipXcel Energy has nearly 20 years of experience leading the clean energy transition. The company has reduced carbon emissions 55% from 2005 levels in the Upper Midwest and remains on track to reduce carbon emissions 85% by 2030 as it moves toward a vision to meet Minnesota’s 100% carbon-free benchmark by 2040.""This federal funding will inject hundreds of millions of dollars into the Upper Midwest economy, helping to deliver an affordable project for our customers,"" said Chris Clark, president of Xcel Energy—Minnesota, South Dakota and North Dakota. ""It provides vital financial support for clean energy infrastructure that will deliver reliable, low-cost renewable energy to the communities we serve.""In total, the Heartland Hydrogen Hub anticipates creating approximately 3,900 total direct jobs, which includes construction and operating jobs across all phases of the project. The hub has engaged with communities, tribes, and other stakeholders to identify strategies and programs to promote shared prosperity in the project region.The Department of Energy's Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs (H2Hubs) will kickstart a national network of clean hydrogen producers, consumers, and connective infrastructure while supporting the production, storage, delivery, and end-use of clean hydrogen. The H2Hubs are part of President Biden’s Investing in America agenda. Congress approved funding for H2Hubs in the bipartisan 2021 infrastructure law. The hubs will accelerate the commercial-scale deployment of clean hydrogen—helping generate clean, dispatchable power, create a new form of energy storage, and decarbonize heavy industry, agriculture and transportation. Together, they will also reduce 25 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions from end-uses each year—an amount roughly equivalent to combined annual emissions of 5.5 million gasoline-powered cars—and create tens of thousands of good-paying jobs across the country while supporting healthier communities and strengthening America's energy security.""Unlocking the full potential of hydrogen—a versatile fuel that can be made from almost any energy resource in virtually every part of the country—is crucial to achieving President Biden’s goal of American industry powered by American clean energy, ensuring less volatility and more affordable clean energy options for American families and businesses,"" said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. ""With this historic investment, the Biden-Harris Administration is laying the foundation for a new, American-led industry that will propel the global clean energy transition while creating high quality jobs and delivering healthier communities in every pocket of the nation.""All of Xcel Energy’s federal and state policymakers, along with labor unions, have supported the effort through their shared interest in U.S. energy production, energy security, job creation, economic development and environmental stewardship.Project detailed design will begin after the Heartland Hydrogen Hub finishes award negotiations. Project development will likely continue through 2035. The public will have an opportunity to review Xcel Energy’s planned investments through the regulatory process.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 10 Best Dividend Aristocrats According to Analysts. With the stock market facing ongoing fluctuations, investors are experiencing the frustration of seeing their profits disappear. For instance, the S&amp;P 500 increased by 19.5% from January to July 2023 but has since fallen by 6%. Considering the Federal Reserve's inclination to maintain higher interest rates for an extended period, negative investor sentiment, and the typical seasonal decline, it appears that the momentum of this summer's market rally might continue to weaken as we enter the fall season. According to analysts, investors can mitigate their losses by investing in dividend stocks.Dividend stocks are already a popular choice among investors due to their reliability in providing a steady stream of income. Between 1993 and the end of last year, the S&amp;P 500 index increased by 777%. But with dividends included, the S&amp;P 500 grew by over 1,400% during that same time frame. In addition to this, when we examine the performance of the S&amp;P 500 on a decade-by-decade basis, we can see that the role of dividends in contributing to the total return has fluctuated over time. From 1930 to 2021, dividends accounted for an average of 40% of the S&amp;P 500's total return.A recent study conducted by Morgan Stanley's chief investment officer, Mike Wilson, found that stocks that pay dividends tend to perform better in the long run and are more resilient during market downturns. Here are some comments from the analyst, taken from his interview with Business Insider this month.""Our economists are of the view that inflation will continue to slow from elevated levels over the next 12 months. That backdrop is supportive of owning dividend-related factors and defensive dividend payers, in particular.""Story continuesHe further said:""Dividends provide a positive return cushion with a notable portion of outperformance for payers versus non-payers coming during periods of market volatility. Specifically, the majority of outperformance comes during large market pullbacks such as 2000, 2008, 2015, and 2020.""The Business Insider report also revealed that stocks that started paying dividends in 2000 have outperformed the market since then. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) have been raising their dividends for decades, becoming top choices for investors.

Here is what the firm has to say:“We were fairly active in the quarter as market dislocations allowed us to be opportunistic, while focusing on companies with stronger moats, better pricing power, more predictable long-term growth and higher returns. In the materials sector we exited PPG Industries, Inc. (NYSE:PPG) and initiated a position in Sherwin-Williams. While both companies operate in the paint and coating industry and are benefiting from improving margins as raw material prices have come down of late, we believe Sherwin-Williams’ dominant retail footprint affords it better pricing power through the cycle. The company provided conservative 2023 guidance and has been successfully gaining market share in the pro segment. While PPG has more European and industrial exposure, Sherwin-Williams’ residential and more domestic focus should also benefit the company as housing indicators appear to be troughing. Weak housing in the face of higher mortgage rates caused Sherwin-Williams stock to sell off in the first quarter, creating a compelling investment opportunity for long-term focused fundamental investors.”21.

83,f003c72e-a122-3477-b96e-2dfbafcaf090,PM,2023-10-13,Philip Morris (PM) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/philip-morris-pm-reports-next-140037552.html,1697119237,STORY,['PM'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Philip Morris (PM) reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 19, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis seller of Marlboro and other cigarette brands is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.61 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +5.2%.Revenues are expected to be $9.18 billion, up 14.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.02% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Philip Morris?For Philip Morris, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.50%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Philip Morris will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Philip Morris would post earnings of $1.48 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.60, delivering a surprise of +8.11%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Philip Morris doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company’s current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products.

This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. In November 2022, PMI acquired Swedish Match – a leader in oral nicotine delivery – creating a global smoke-free champion led by the companies’ IQOS and ZYN brands. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized versions of PMI’s IQOS Platform 1 devices and consumables and Swedish Match’s General snus as Modified Risk Tobacco Products (MRTPs). As of June 30, 2023, PMI's smoke-free products were available for sale in 80 markets, and PMI estimates that approximately 19.4 million adults around the world had already switched to IQOS and stopped smoking.

This clinical trial, conducted by HCA Healthcare Research Institute and sponsored by Insightec, a global healthcare company pioneering the use of focused ultrasound technology, investigates the benefit of combining noninvasive focused ultrasound with systemic immunotherapy as an alternative.Johnston-Willis Hospital is hosting the trial and has already enrolled the first two U.S. patients who are currently undergoing a total of six treatment cycles each. The patients have metastatic brain cancer, which originated from cancer cells spreading to the brain from the primary tumor in their lungs. The new treatment uses Insightec’s system to open the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which defends the brain against harmful substances, but also prevents critical medications from being delivered. By opening the BBB, non-small cell lung cancer medications may reach and target the critical lesions in the brain.""The potential success of this trial could be groundbreaking in the management of metastatic brain tumors, not only for lung cancer, but also for breast cancer and melanoma,"" said neurosurgeon K. Singh Sahni, the principal investigator of the trial and medical director of the Neuroscience and Gamma Knife Center at Johnston-Willis Hospital. ""There are remarkable new cancer medications that have excellent results in the body, yet cannot reach the brain because the blood-brain barrier currently impedes their flow. By opening the BBB, the hope is that such therapies will lead to equally good therapeutic responses in the brain as it currently has on other organs, such as the lung and liver.""Story continuesThe MR-guided focused ultrasound system was developed by Insightec and is already FDA-approved to use thermal ablation to treat essential tremor and Parkinson’s Disease that do not respond well to medication treatment. Johnston-Willis Hospital has treated 150 people living with essential tremor using focused ultrasound. In this trial, a different Insightec system that was developed solely to temporarily open the BBB and allow passage of immunotherapy to enable noninvasive treatment of brain tumors, is used.""It is incredibly important for both patients, and the healthcare industry as a whole, to participate in potentially groundbreaking clinical trials like this,"" said Dr. Michael Cuffe, executive vice president and chief clinical officer of HCA Healthcare. ""It is a privilege to utilize the scale of HCA Healthcare to explore new treatment options to help deliver better care to patients.""HCA Healthcare Research Institute is the multispecialty clinical research arm of HCA Healthcare focused on collaborating with industry partners to advance care. Currently, the HCA Healthcare Research Institute has 36 research sites, focusing on interventional, non-therapeutic, and records-based research. As of September 30, 2023, the institute has participated in more than 350 trials across the country. HCA Healthcare is the single largest health system research site network with more than 37 million patient encounters annually. The HCA Healthcare Research Institute offers a site network with national scientific leaders and community-based hospitals across the country in virtually every therapeutic area.""These treatments mark another exciting milestone in the forward trajectory of focused ultrasound treatment,"" said Dr. Maurice Ferre, CEO and chairman of the board of Insightec. ""Insightec continues to lead the way on utilizing focused ultrasound for innovative treatments to a variety of diseases and conditions. We are proud to be providing care and relief for more and more people every day.""The trial is expected to last through August 2024. Johnson-Willis Hospital was the first in the United States to receive The Joint Commission’s Gold Seal of Approval for brain tumor care.About HCA HealthcareNashville-based HCA Healthcare is one of the nation’s leading providers of healthcare services comprising 182 hospitals and approximately 2,300 ambulatory sites of care, including surgery centers, freestanding ERs, urgent care centers, and physician clinics, in 20 states and the United Kingdom.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 10 Best Dividend Aristocrats According to Analysts. With the stock market facing ongoing fluctuations, investors are experiencing the frustration of seeing their profits disappear. For instance, the S&amp;P 500 increased by 19.5% from January to July 2023 but has since fallen by 6%. Considering the Federal Reserve's inclination to maintain higher interest rates for an extended period, negative investor sentiment, and the typical seasonal decline, it appears that the momentum of this summer's market rally might continue to weaken as we enter the fall season. According to analysts, investors can mitigate their losses by investing in dividend stocks.Dividend stocks are already a popular choice among investors due to their reliability in providing a steady stream of income. Between 1993 and the end of last year, the S&amp;P 500 index increased by 777%. But with dividends included, the S&amp;P 500 grew by over 1,400% during that same time frame. In addition to this, when we examine the performance of the S&amp;P 500 on a decade-by-decade basis, we can see that the role of dividends in contributing to the total return has fluctuated over time. From 1930 to 2021, dividends accounted for an average of 40% of the S&amp;P 500's total return.A recent study conducted by Morgan Stanley's chief investment officer, Mike Wilson, found that stocks that pay dividends tend to perform better in the long run and are more resilient during market downturns. Here are some comments from the analyst, taken from his interview with Business Insider this month.""Our economists are of the view that inflation will continue to slow from elevated levels over the next 12 months. That backdrop is supportive of owning dividend-related factors and defensive dividend payers, in particular.""Story continuesHe further said:""Dividends provide a positive return cushion with a notable portion of outperformance for payers versus non-payers coming during periods of market volatility. Specifically, the majority of outperformance comes during large market pullbacks such as 2000, 2008, 2015, and 2020.""The Business Insider report also revealed that stocks that started paying dividends in 2000 have outperformed the market since then. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) have been raising their dividends for decades, becoming top choices for investors. In this article, we will discuss some of the best dividend stocks to buy according to analysts.Best Dividend Aristocrats According to AnalystsImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur Methodology:For our list, we scanned a list of the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, companies that have raised their dividends for 25 consecutive years or more.

Here is what the firm has to say:“We were fairly active in the quarter as market dislocations allowed us to be opportunistic, while focusing on companies with stronger moats, better pricing power, more predictable long-term growth and higher returns. In the materials sector we exited PPG Industries, Inc. (NYSE:PPG) and initiated a position in Sherwin-Williams. While both companies operate in the paint and coating industry and are benefiting from improving margins as raw material prices have come down of late, we believe Sherwin-Williams’ dominant retail footprint affords it better pricing power through the cycle. The company provided conservative 2023 guidance and has been successfully gaining market share in the pro segment. While PPG has more European and industrial exposure, Sherwin-Williams’ residential and more domestic focus should also benefit the company as housing indicators appear to be troughing. Weak housing in the face of higher mortgage rates caused Sherwin-Williams stock to sell off in the first quarter, creating a compelling investment opportunity for long-term focused fundamental investors.”21.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on stock market performance overall, head directly to 5 Worst Performing Dow Stocks YTD.In a July report by J.P. Morgan, it was stated that global economic growth is expected to slow down in the latter part of 2023, while inflation appears to be easing. However, it's worth noting that global core inflation is projected to remain elevated, staying above 3% until 2024. This ongoing high inflation will continue to exert pressure on central banks, potentially leading to further tightening measures. Bruce Kasman, Chief Global Economist at J.P. Morgan, said:“We do not think inflation is going to come back down to central bank comfort zones by themselves. Yes, there’s a decline going on. But no, we do not think you’re going to get inflation back below 3% in the U.S. or the euro area this year in an environment where supply has been damaged in a more lasting way and inflation psychology has shifted.”In the first half of 2023, global economic growth gained momentum, reaching a rate of 2.8%. So far, efforts to tighten monetary policies have balanced the diminishing impact of supply disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, starting in 2022, global policy rates have increased by nearly 400 basis points, affecting spending sensitive to interest rates and limiting industrial production. Despite the current growth momentum, it is believed that the global economy's resilience is decreasing. Consequently, it is expected that developed markets may undergo another round of tightening measures before the end of 2023 to control inflation. However, such actions may have adverse effects on the private sector's well-being. Consequently, there is a possibility of a synchronized global economic recession occurring, potentially before the end of 2024. J.P. Morgan Research anticipates that the United States may experience a mild recession toward the end of 2023. This is attributed to the Federal Reserve's conservative monetary policy, which is leading to stricter credit availability and a gradual decline in economic growth. The Western European economy faced challenges during the winter due to high energy prices. Although the first quarter of 2023 showed some improvement, overall economic growth remained relatively stagnant.Story continuesIn the first six months of 2023, there was a noticeable variance in stock performance, with differences observed in size, sectors, and investment styles. Surprisingly, this occurred amidst an unusual period of low volatility. Looking ahead, without any proactive measures from the Federal Reserve, experts expect a more difficult economic environment for stocks in the latter part of 2023. A similar less optimistic outlook is observed for equity markets in other regions across the world. Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, Global Head of Equity Macro Strategy at J.P. Morgan, stated:“Given that multiple expansion has been the main driver of performance year to date, we see unattractive risk-reward for equities and increasing investor complacency ahead of our expectation that the business cycle will further decelerate in the second half of the year, with the onset of a recession likely in the fourth quarter of 2023 or first quarter of 2024. What’s more, consumers are starting to show signs of weakness, and there is a risk that liquidity and credit conditions could tighten in the coming months.”According to S&amp;P Global, the Dow Jones Industrial Average showed improvement in September, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 but still experiencing a decline of 3.5%; -3.42% with dividends considered. However, when we consider the year-to-date performance, the Dow has lagged significantly behind the S&amp;P 500, with a gain of 1.09%;  2.73% with dividends, while the S&amp;P 500 has recorded an increase of 11.68%. This difference in performance is primarily attributed to how these indices are constructed, with factors like price weighting versus market value weighting playing a role. Historically, these differences tend to align, but in shorter time frames, disparities can emerge.In this article, we discuss some of the worst performing Dow stocks which include Verizon Communications Inc.

Disney’s Bob Iger returned to the CEO’s seat in November 2022, replacing Bob Chapek, who left following a turbulent tenure. As a result of disappointing quarterly results and incremental commentary suggesting a more inline strategy with other media, the market has become less confident that Iger will achieve a turnaround by the end of his 1.5- year contract. We continue to believe Disney has a unique collection of assets and owns some of the best content among all media companies. Their ability to monetize this content across many platforms — studio, theme park, toys, streaming — is incredibly valuable; thus we remain investors.”14.

The actual card is fairly sleek (as you can see below), as customers' names are etched into an Apple titanium card. The no-fee card generated a lot of hype, as many early users were quick to post their latest card on various social media sites.The initial goal of Marcus (back in 2016) was to leverage Goldman’s wonderful name brand and build a full-service digital bank. This card was a large piece of GS’s ambitions to grow its retail banking franchise called Marcus. After 5 years, Marcus now has 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances. Surprisingly, Marcus now represents nearly 20% of the firm’s total revenue.We thought it would be interesting to look at how the Apple Card is doing in terms of loans and exposures. With over $100 billion in assets, this has been a successful source of cheap deposits for GS. Despite having an institutional / “white shoe” brand in the investment banking and trading world, GS’s Apple Card has been a disappointment.”8.

Global Payments (GPN), which belongs to the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This electronics payment processing company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 2.95%.For the last reported quarter, Global Payments came out with earnings of $2.62 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.58 per share, representing a surprise of 1.55%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $2.30 per share and it actually produced earnings of $2.40 per share, delivering a surprise of 4.35%.For Global Payments, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Global Payments has an Earnings ESP of +0.23% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Marcus Collins, University of Michigan Ross School of Business Marketing Professor, sits down with Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the sociopolitical themes being represented in these media milestones.""The most powerful thing of all this is people aren't consuming because of what these things are, they're consuming because of who they are,"" Collins explains. ""Because of their cultural subscription, how they see the world, and it's being manifested or made material through their consumption.""For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video Transcript- But even as we think about the economic impact that Taylor Swift, that Beyonce, that Barbie have had over the course of this summer. It has been the summer of women powering the economy through some of the marketing, through some of the events.And now for a person like Taylor, who knows herself, who knows her audience as well, how powerful all of this could be going into-- I'll be the person to say it, going into a 2024 general election? How powerful do many of these themes also transpire into next year?Marcus Collins: Yeah, I mean, we see a common theme between Beyonce, Taylor, and Barbie. It's not just because they were women led, but because they are representing a brand of feminism, an ideology, a point of view about the world.And if we look at current politics, there's a lot of attack on women, on women's personhood, on women's autonomy, on their agency. and the hope, the ideal scenario is that these outlets these vehicles become cultural vessels by which people can engage in conversation in such a way that is reflected in how they vote.I mean, I think most powerful thing of all of this is that, people aren't consuming because of what these things are, they're consuming because of who they are, because their cultural subscription, how they see the world, and it's being manifested or made material through their consumption.And the hope as we enter into a political season, that we'll see those things manifest in the way in which people show up to the ballot box, the way people advocate for certain policies, and the way people show up in communities to guide a certain agenda forward.]"
97,609a30ba-6e5b-3570-9bf9-05f3ed474572,SLB,2023-10-13,Institutional investors are Schlumberger Limited's (NYSE:SLB) biggest bettors and were rewarded after last week's US$4.2b market cap gain,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-investors-schlumberger-limiteds-nyse-110050657.html,1697194850,STORY,['SLB'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Schlumberger's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions50% of the business is held by the top 20 shareholders Recent sales by insiders To get a sense of who is truly in control of Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 83% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.And last week, institutional investors ended up benefitting the most after the company hit US$84b in market cap. The one-year return on investment is currently 34% and last week's gain would have been more than welcomed.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Schlumberger. View our latest analysis for Schlumberger ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Schlumberger?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Schlumberger already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Schlumberger's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Schlumberger. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.1% of shares outstanding. With 7.5% and 5.9% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 20 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of SchlumbergerWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Schlumberger Limited in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$183m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 17% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Schlumberger. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

99,bf975a96-3b18-3fa7-9df8-302e6002c3f8,NTRS,2023-10-13,KeyCorp (KEY) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/keycorp-key-expected-beat-earnings-140036872.html,1697119236,STORY,"['KEY', 'NTRS']","[KeyCorp (KEY) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 19. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.27 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -50.9%.Revenues are expected to be $1.55 billion, down 17.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 5.42% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for KeyCorp?For KeyCorp, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.60%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that KeyCorp will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that KeyCorp would post earnings of $0.29 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.27, delivering a surprise of -6.90%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.KeyCorp appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.50 per share for the quarter ended September 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -16.7%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $1.72 billion, down 1.9% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Northern Trust Corporation has been revised 10.2% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, an equal Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Northern Trust Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This compels the company to aspire that every OB-GYN must know all treatment options available for common gynecologic conditions, including laparoscopic and hysteroscopic solutions.Story continuesApart from providing one Omni hysteroscope to all Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-approved residency programs, Hologic will loan one LapAR and one HystAR to all sites as well as support software licensing that will power Inovus’ connected training platform, Totum. Residents will also have the opportunity to train with Hologic’s gynecologic surgical tools.Highlights of the GYN Surgical SegmentHologic’s GYN Surgical division highlights the value of internal innovation and product line additions through M&amp;A, a winning formula across the company. Together, these strategies have injected new life into the business and transformed it into a meaningful growth driver for the company.In the last reported third quarter of fiscal 2023, the segment’s growth was driven by strong contributions from the hysteroscopic portfolio of MyoSure and the Fluent fluid management system, along with contributions from the recent NovaSure V5 device and new laparoscopic portfolio. Earlier in April 2023, HOLX completed the acquisition of Normedi Nordic AS, a longstanding distributor of Hologic’s Surgical products in the Nordics region of Europe.Industry ProspectsPer a research report, the global gynecological device market was valued at $9.3 billion in 2022 and is expected to witness a CAGR of 8.6% by 2030.Price PerformanceIn the past six months, shares of Hologic have decreased 18.3% compared with the industry’s fall of 13.8%.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksHologic currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Cardinal Health CAH, Haemonetics HAE and Align Technology ALGN, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

For a quick overview of the top 5, read our article, the 5 most Culturally Diverse Cities in the US. The United States is a melting pot of cultures, with people from all over the world calling it home. It is the third-largest country in the world by population, and its residents represent a wide range of ethnic and cultural backgrounds. African Americans, Asian Americans, Indigenous Americans, and Latin Americans are just a few groups that make up the American mosaic.Over the years, racial diversity in the United States has grown significantly, leading to the emergence of new and unique cultures. One such example is the Louisiana Creole culture, a fusion of African, Spanish, English, Native American, and French cultures. This new culture has its distinct cuisine, language, and traditions.Cultural Diversity in the USThe United States has become increasingly culturally influential over time due to its growing diversity. According to the 2010 and 2020 censuses, the white population in the country decreased from 63% to 57%, while the Hispanic population increased from 15% to 18%, and the Asian population increased from 5% to 6%. The Black population remained relatively stable at 12%.The Pew Research Center also analyzed that the 118th United States Congress is the most culturally diverse to date, with a quarter of voting members identifying as something other than non-Hispanic White. This is a continuation of a long-running trend, with the 118th Congress being the seventh Congress to break the record set by the one before it.Due to the increasing cultural diversity in the United States, people from all backgrounds have begun to adjust to the American way of life. One major aspect of this adaptability is immigrants leveraging their potential and talent to pursue entrepreneurship. Story continuesA study by the US Census Bureau in 2022 found that 0.83% of immigrants to the US founded at least one company between 2005 and 2010, compared to 0.46% of native-born US citizens. Moreover, The American Immigration Council also revealed that in 2023, immigrants or their children founded 44.8% of new American companies. This represents 224 companies, of which foreign-born individuals founded 103 and the children of immigrants founded 121.One example of a company founded by an immigrant is Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), an American multinational automotive and clean energy company. It was founded in 2003 by Elon Musk, who now employs over 27,000 people worldwide.Elon Musk is renowned as one of the most audacious innovators of our time. Born and raised in South Africa, he immigrated to Canada and later transferred to the United States, where he eventually founded Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a leading player in the electric vehicle charging industry, thanks to its strategic partnerships and heavy investments in research and development. As of September 2023, its market capitalization is nearly $853 billion.Another multinational company founded by an immigrant is the ubiquitous search engine Google. In 1998, Sergey Brin, a Russian immigrant, co-founded Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), now Google's parent company. Google has had a profound impact on the internet, transforming the way we access and consume information.Alphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s Google dominates the industry and offers innovative, user-friendly services. With over 270 million monthly active users and nearly 40,000 search queries processed per second, the search engine is the primary gateway to information for billions of people worldwide.Moreover, the company’s ecosystem of products and services, including Google Home, Google Maps, and Google Drive, solidifies its influence. Android OS, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s mobile operating system, powers billions of devices globally. Culturally Diverse Workplaces in the USAs the population's racial diversity has increased, companies have also changed their workforces to accommodate employees from different cultural backgrounds. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), a retail giant with a vast workforce, is one example of a company committed to diversity and inclusion.This is indicated by the fact that as of 2023, the US associates of Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) were 49% people of color. 41% of these employees also hold leadership roles within the organization, with the Board of Directors being 18% culturally diverse.  In addition to its commitment to transparent diversity hiring, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and its foundation pledged to contribute $100 million over five years to the Center for Racial Equity in 2020, to help to address racial disparities in the United States.Meanwhile, in 2021, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) released its first-ever diversity study to assess the cultural diversity of its on-screen talent and the behind-the-camera directors, writers, producers, and creators. According to the report, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) had significant diversity gaps in its programming. As a result, the company adopted an inclusion lens approach, focusing on underrepresented cultural minorities on screen and ensuring that portrayals of culturally diverse people are authentic.In addition, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) announced the creation of the Netflix Fund for Creative Equity, a $100 million, five-year investment fund to support organizations that help underrepresented communities train for and find jobs in film and television.20 Most Culturally Diverse Cities in the USNeirfy/Shutterstock.comMethodologyWe compiled a list of the 20 most culturally diverse cities in the US based on cultural diversity score. Our ranking criteria was based on three primary metrics: Diversity Score, the number of museums present in cities, and restaurants located in the area excluding fast food. We collected data on the relevant metrics from different websites. We got the Diversity Score Index from the National Equity Atlas, the total number of museums and restaurants from Trip Advisor. The diversity index quantitatively measures the different types of datasets in the community, specifically cultural diversity. It is a statistical representation of diversity in the various cities of the US.  We first scored each city on each index from 1 to 20, with 1 indicating the location with the most cultural diversity and 20 indicating the city with the least cultural diversity. We then assigned weights of 0.4 to the Diversity Score, 0.3 to the number of museums in cities and restaurants in the area excluding fast food. Finally, we calculated a composite weighted average of these scores to determine the cities with the most culturally diverse residents. After the final evaluation of the composite results, the cities were ranked from 1 to 20, with 1 indicating the city with the most culturally diverse population and 20 indicating the city with the least cultural diversity.

Here are some takeaways.Read More: Hollywood Studios, Striking Actors in Standoff as Talks CrumbleSuperagent Emanuel likes where Warner Bros. Discovery Inc.’s David Zaslav and Walt Disney Co.’s Bob Iger are headed. Not so much Fox Corp. or Paramount Global.Netflix co-CEO Sarandos said contract talks with striking actors broke down over their demand for a “levy” on streaming customers.Hybe founder and Chairman Bang Si-Hyuk said the globally popular K-pop band BTS is working on a 10th anniversary album and will reunite.Kris Jenner, matriarch of TV’s Kardashian family, worries about the impact of social media, particularly on her grandchildren. She’s not alone.There are too many sports documentaries, according to Bill Simmons, founder of the sports and culture site the Ringer.Actor-writer-producer Issa Rae calls artificial intelligence “terrifying.”Ghostwriter, an anonymous producer and songwriter, sees record labels eventually embracing AI.Netflix Inc. co-Chief Executive Officer Sarandos said talks with striking actors broke down after the union asked for a “levy” on streaming customers on top of a bonus plan for successful shows that the media companies had already offered.The ask “just felt like a bridge too far to add this deep in the negotiations,” Sarandos said.Story continuesThe Screen Actors Guild has been on strike since July, seeking improved pay, a share of streaming revenue and restrictions on the use of artificial intelligence. A separate strike by writers just ended.Sarandos said that a sound editor working on the company’s first original series in Israel, Lior Waitzman, was among the victims of the Hamas attack over the weekend. His credits include the series Fauda and Tehran.“Our hearts are out to Lior and his family and anyone else who may have lost somebody in Israel on Saturday,” he said.Separately, Netflix announced plans to open two new permanent stores in the US in 2025, with the goal of opening more physical locations globally with restaurants, stores and activities tied to its TV shows and films.AI Booster Ghostwriter Sees Label Cooperation Coming (7:10 p.m.)Ghostwriter, the anonymous creator behind the viral AI-generated track Heart on My Sleeve, said record labels will soon find a business model around synthetic voices.“Everything has to start somewhere and it’s always rough when you kick it off,” he said Thursday. “It takes time to acclimate, to figure it out, to build the business model, and then once that happens it’ll find its place.”Ghostwriter foresees a future where labels officially license artists’ voices and share in the revenue made from songs using their sound.The artist — who took the stage in an all white outfit and goggles to mask his identity — said he’s a producer and songwriter. His viral song was meant to be an experiment and was wholly human-made, apart from the AI-generated voices of Drake and The Weeknd. Streaming services eventually removed the track, though people can still find it online.“This is bigger than me or who I am,” he said.Bill Simmons: Too Many Sports Documentaries (6:25 p.m.)One of the most successful sports podcasters, Bill Simmons said there are too many sports documentaries and he’s concerned that to get access to the best athletes you now have to cooperate with them on the productions.“A lot of the ideas have been done,” said Simmons, creator of The Ringer sports and culture network.Simmons also said regional sports networks are over and that Walt Disney Co. should sell ESPN to Apple Inc.Writer-Actor Rae Likens AI Debate to Sci-Fi (6 p.m.)“It feels like a Black Mirror episode,” writer-producer-actor Issa Rae said. “There has to be consent for your likeness.”Calling AI “terrifying,” Rae said a person’s likeness is what they bring to the table. While it may be cost efficient to use technology to fill people in as extras, actors need to participate in the success of their productions.Rae, who was featured in the blockbuster film Barbie, said her goal is to add to her music company Hoorae Media with a production studio to promote creators of color.AI negotiations will be an ongoing process, she said, and that studios and guilds need to work together to prevent technology companies from using existing scripts to train AI models.Lakshmi Says Mideast Conflict Hard to Talk About (4:45 p.m.)Padma Lakshmi, the author, activist and Emmy-nominated host of the Hulu food show Taste the Nation, said she found it difficult to comment on the Israeli-Hamas war on social media.“It’s one of those issues that’s really hard to talk about, especially online in short format in social media, because anything you say is going to be a platitude,” she said. “If you express empathy for one group that means you’re an anti-Semite. If you express empathy for the horrible, horrible thing that’s happened right now then you don’t believe that these people over here, the Palestinians, should have a homeland.”Lakshmi also shared how she uses Taste the Nation to talk about political issues through stories about food.“It’s really about giving communities that have never had mainstream exposure and sort of an A-List treatment like that,” she said. “That’s what we strive to do and I always wanted to do that because I think those stories are interesting, and I think they’re interesting to other people in the country.”BTS Works on 10th Anniversary Album (4:10 p.m.)Members of the K-pop group, which is on a short break from performing, renewed their contracts in September, with plans to reunite in 2025, Hybe Co. founder and Chairman Bang Si-Hyuk said at the Bloomberg Screentime conference.Read More: K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTS in LABang also said his 10-year goal is to establish a plan for the company to be sustainable without him.“I’m not announcing my retirement,” he said. “The ideal plan is that the company should be running and sustaining itself without, you know, any single person.”Maria Sharapova Cites Tennis’ ‘Untapped Potential’ (3:40 p.m.)The former No. 1 women’s tennis player, Maria Sharapova pointed said there remains a significant pay gap between men and women tennis pros outside of the sport’s four major tournaments.“The disparity is insane,” she said at the Bloomberg Screentime conference.Media reports have suggested the Women’s Tennis Association may merge with the Association of Tennis Professionals, which could alleviate some of that gender inequality, but Sharapova said she doubts it will happen anytime soon.Byron Allen Says Disney Isn’t Ready to Sell ABC (3:15 p.m.)Media mogul Byron Allen said he texted Walt Disney Co. CEO Bob Iger with his offer to buy ABC and other channels but that the executive isn’t ready to sell.“They’re not there,” Allen said, adding he won’t have any trouble raising money to fund the purchase and he is more likely to get regulatory approval because he doesn’t own as many stations as other bidders.“When Bob is ready I’m going to chase it down like a lion chasing a gazelle,” he said.Allen, a former stand up comic who now owns a string of TV stations and the Weather Channel, said NFL owners need to change limits on borrowing and minimum investment requirements so that people of color can buy a team.“I’d love to put a half a billion, a billion into an NFL team,” he said. “It is the true religion of America. It’s the highest rated television content by far.”Kris Jenner Discusses Move to Hulu (2:55 p.m.)The matriarch of the Kardashian family discussed the move to Hulu from E with their flagship TV series, now called The Kardashians.“I really felt like streaming was in the cards for us,” Kris Jenner said Thursday at the Bloomberg Screentime conference. “We wanted to elevate what we were doing and streamline the show and have it have a new audience.”She also discussed the plusses and minuses of being social-media celebrities.“I mean, it’s just an negative place at times, but then it’s a great place at times,” she said. “And it’s an amazing focus group, a built-in focus group. It’s such a tool, but it can be a little scary too.”Jenner wears an Oura Ring that measures sleep quality, and she competes with her daughter, Kim, for the highest score.“Now it’s become this little obsession,” she said.YouTube Live-Sports Focus Is NFL (2:20 p.m.)Neal Mohan, chief executive officer of Alphabet Inc.’s YouTube, says that when it comes to live sports competition his focus remains on the NFL, not the NBA.In December, YouTube TV outmaneuvered rivals to win the right to broadcast the National Football League’s Sunday Ticket games, starting with the current 2023 season, in a deal valued at more than $2 billion per year over seven years.Meanwhile, there’s been growing speculation over who will televise NBA games when the league’s deals expire in 2025.Asked at the Bloomberg Screentime conference about the NBA, Mohan said “they have been longtime partners” and operate “one of the largest channels on our platform.”But “in terms of our focus right not,” he added, “it’s about this NFL experience.”YouTube Draws 1.3M Fans to Sunday Ticket (1:45 p.m.)Die-hard fans of live sports are migrating online in big numbers, responding to the multibillion-dollar investments by major technology companies, the research firm Antenna suggests in a new report.The NFL Sunday Ticket, now distributed by YouTube, has attracted an estimated 1.3 million sign-ups, Antenna said Thursday. That exceeds the 1.2 million customers the service reportedly had under its old distributor, DirecTV.The package, which lets fans watch games not shown on local channels, is also driving new subscribers to YouTube TV, a $73-a-month online alternative to cable television. About 41% of Sunday Ticket subscribers are new customers to YouTube TV.“It’s a really great win-win for the NFL and YouTube,” Jonathan Carson, Antenna’s co-founder and chief executive officer, said in an interview.Superagent Ari Emanuel kicked the event off Wednesday evening with comments that touched on the hostilities in the Middle East, rival Creative Artists Agency, as well as his assessment of some of the largest media companies including Paramount Global and Fox Corp.EA May Still Seek FIFA PartnershipElectronic Arts Inc. executive Laura Miele, speaking at the conference on Thursday, said her company may seek to reengage with global soccer body FIFA even though the two organizations failed to reach a new agreement over the company’s use of the brand in its video games.“We will look to potentially do World Cup partnerships,” she said.Tune in here for continuing coverage of the Screentime event.(Updates with employee’s death in sixth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekJeep’s Jump to $100,000 SUVs Risks Leaving Loyal Buyers BehindThe Ozempic Effect Is Coming for Everything From Kidney to Heart Disease TreatmentsThe New Middle East Is an All-Too-Familiar NightmareWall Street’s Surprising Quest for Ways to Finance Coal AgainBiden’s FCC Revives the Longest-Running Policy Fight in Tech©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

The move dashed hopes of a quick resolution after a deal with film and television writers.At picket lines on Thursday, actors said they were disappointed that talks had collapsed but would continue pushing for pay increases, protections around artificial intelligence and other workplace improvements.""This is the part of the movie where the hero gets knocked down and you think they're out,"" Jason George, a member of the SAG-AFTRA negotiating committee, said outside Netflix. ""And this is the part where you double down and you come back and win the day.""Members of SAG-AFTRA, which represents 160,000 actors and other media professionals, have been on strike against film and TV studios since July. The union resumed negotiations with the studios last week after the Writers Guild of America (WGA) ended its own five-month work stoppage.The two sides are at odds over actors' desire to benefit from the success of shows and movies on streaming services, such as the residuals that actors received during decades of broadcast television and reruns. SAG-AFTRA had initially asked that cast members receive a share of streaming revenue but changed the proposal to a per-subscriber bonus.Netflix Co-Chief Executive Ted Sarandos, who had joined the talks along with other media CEOs, said SAG-AFTRA had floated the per-subscriber ""levy"" for the first time on Wednesday night.""We just felt it was a bridge too far,"" Sarandos said at the Bloomberg Screentime conference on Thursday.Story continuesThe Alliance for Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which negotiates on behalf of Netflix and other studios, said the bonus would cost $800 million per year and be financially ""untenable.""SAG-AFTRA countered that the studios had inflated the cost of their proposal. Negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland said the cost would amount to roughly $500 million, and the union felt it was offering a concession that was closer to what the studios wanted.""I really hope that maybe this was just one of those blips"" in negotiations, Crabtree-Ireland said. ""I really hope that calmer heads prevail amongst the CEO group and that we're back in bargaining with them as soon as possible.""Actor Michelle Boyd said she was still optimistic that a deal would be reached and was buoyed by the crowd that turned out to picket on Thursday.""It was such a good turnout today, and I think it's really good to show the studios that we're not going away and we're not going to quit,"" she said.The two sides also are battling over the use of artificial intelligence on screen. Actors fear they will be replaced by digital replicas. The studios said they offered a guarantee that would not be done without consent and compensation.""We just want protection so they can't use our face in perpetuity, and continue to make money off my face in perpetuity, without ever having to pay me again,"" said actor David Stanbra.(Reporting by Omar Younis, Lisa Richwine and Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles; Editing by Mary Milliken and Gerry Doyle)]"

For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: BNP Paribas downgrading Carvana to neutral from outperform. That downgrade coming just days after competitor Shift Technologies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Shares of technology-- of Carvana, I should say, down about 10 and 1/2%, and the analyst over at BNP Paribas was one of the only two left that had had a buy--JOSH LIPTON: Long time bull, yeah.JULIE HYMAN: --equivalent rating. And to be fair the shares are up, what, 600% this year? But they are down. They came public back in 2020 at 45 bucks a share, and they're down about 25% still since--JOSH LIPTON: Yeah, so this analyst had been outperform since October 2020, long time bull, now moves to the sidelines with a neutral. Price target goes to 37. Less confident, the analyst says, now in the unit growth. And by the way, so now that he's to the sidelines, you have just one bull left on the Street. I don't know. Is that a contrarian indicator? I don't know. Is that--JULIE HYMAN: I mean, it's already up 600% this year. So--JOSH LIPTON: I don't know.JULIE HYMAN: I don't know. I mean, Carvana has just had a very volatile, tricky--JOSH LIPTON: For sure.JULIE HYMAN: --period of time that has governed it. We are also watching Netflix today. Netflix says it's going to open branded retail stores that are going to be called Netflix House. This according to Bloomberg. The streaming giant will have venues that will feature a mix of retail, dining, and live experiences. The shares down a little bit today, about 1 and 1/4%. But there were some wags on Twitter who were saying, you mean like a Blockbuster? But I think it's going to be more like--Story continuesJOSH LIPTON: Come on. There's dining, apparently.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, what is this going to-- I don't know.JOSH LIPTON: There's not a ton of details here. There's not a ton of details. I mean, maybe it's like-- it's going to be some retail, some dining, some live experiences. We have a lot-- it's sort of the evolution of Netflix, DVD to streaming and now maybe a ""Squid Game"" store.JULIE HYMAN: Like a Hard Rock Cafe maybe, but like for movies and shows from Netflix?JOSH LIPTON: That doesn't sound fun at all.JULIE HYMAN: Well, it's also-- the company has had some pop-ups, something called the Queen's Ball, A Bridgerton Experience, where I guess you go-- I don't know if people dress up, but you can go and hear music, like you hear in the show, and dance and drink. So what strikes me about this is that it does seem, at least from what I've seen initially, decidedly grown up, right? You think of-- so it's not like it's going to be competing directly with, say, a Disney type product, a parks product. It seems like it is going to be more adult aiming.And it may-- if you think about the ecosystem that exists not just around Netflix shows, but you think about the recaps that you read, the Easter eggs, you know, like, there's so, so much of an ecosystem around many, many shows. It kind of makes sense that you would then be able to transport that into-- I mean, that's what fuels the likes of Comic-Con, for example, right, where people gather in person to discuss things that they've read or watched or followed. So I don't know. It's sort of an intriguing concept to make.JOSH LIPTON: I mean, you mentioned Disney, which is a great example. There's an entertainment company, theme parks, clothing, leveraging the IP, leveraging the characters. If you came to my house, you would see how well it's working. ""Frozen"" everything, from blankets to toothbrushes. And listen, Netflix looking for different revenue streams. You can argue, why not try us? It'll be interesting, though, who is the target audience, you know.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. Well, how many Hellfire Club t-shirts have you seen, right, from ""Stranger Things""? Like, you do see--JOSH LIPTON: Well, they've got the merch shop. I mean, Netflix got the merch shop.JULIE HYMAN: I know you just discovered the online merch shop.JOSH LIPTON: They have sleeping bags here. They got whatever you need.]"

The studios earlier smashed the guild that is led by Fran Drescher for making costly demands and abandoning productive negotiations while the SAF-AFTRA responded by accusing the AMPTP of using the “bullying tactics” that they already tried on the WGA to cripple their deliberations. It seems that studios mistakenly thought that they will easily solve their conflict with SAF-AFTRA after coming to an agreement with the WGA who recently approved a new three-year contract that includes pay raises, AI protection of writers and other gains, ending the five-month strike. Striking actors and raised prices is certainly not the challenge Disney needs right now as it looks for ways to renew the growth of its kingdom that has been lacking magic.Disney Hiked Prices For The Second Time This YearOn Thursday, Disney rose its streaming prices in response to DTC profitability challenges and loss of subscribers.Back in August, Disney posted streaming losses for the third quarter of $512 million with Disney+ subscribers dropping 7.4% from the previous quarter. to 146.1 million.Disney announced the price hikes in August, with these increases impacting the monthly price of the ad-free Disney+ and Hulu plans in addition to the Hulu live TV packages and ESPN+ subscription. The Disney+ ad-free plan is now 27% more expensive as its monthly cost in the U.S. is $13.99 which is double the $6.99 monthly cost Disney charged when it first launched its streaming star in 2019.Additionally, Disney will also be applying this strategy on its theme parks so visiting the world’s happiest places will also cost more.Story continuesIger Has Too Many Fires To Put DownAlong with streaming headwinds, Disney is also facing a parks business slowdown, a a broken linear TV business model and a weak box office that fails to impress. Although Iger came back to save Disney, things are clearly not going according to plan as the world’s biggest entertainment company entered what seems to be an existential crisis. His two-year CEO timeline has been extended to four years as the once-America’s-most-beloved-chief-executive-officer who orchestrated modern-day Disney’s biggest business magic isn’t able to Mary Poppins his way out of this mess. But then again, sequels almost always fail to live up to the original.Netflix Remains The King Of Streaming, But It Cannot Afford To Ignore The Harsh Reality Of The Industry.Netflix first launched streaming in the U.S. in 2007 and by being the leader for 16 years, it gathered a massive user base that now has 238 million global subscribers. With its first-mover advantage and tremendous scale, Netflix built a solid financial footing with even the iconic Disney lagging behind on the profitability front as its DTC segment which covers Disney+, Hulu and ESPAN+ delivered an operating loss of whopping $2.2 billion through the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 that ended on July 1st. But even Netflix will have to deal with increased costs due to writers’ and actors’ strikes, although it is still in a more favorable position than Disney. Additionally, the collapsed negotiations imply that that production of scripted shows scheduled for autumn remains on hold.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

The stock's change was less than the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.63%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw a downswing of 0.51%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 0.63%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the oil refiner had lost 8.96% over the past month.

The company is scheduled to release its earnings on October 27, 2023. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $4.86, indicating a 24.77% decline compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $34.11 billion, indicating a 30.05% downward movement from the same quarter last year.For the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $16.22 per share and a revenue of $138.24 billion, representing changes of -13.68% and -21.32%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for Phillips 66. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

The stock's change was more than the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.63%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.51%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 0.63%.Shares of the world's largest biotech drugmaker witnessed a gain of 10.25% over the previous month, beating the performance of the Medical sector with its loss of 4.14% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 2.35%.The investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Amgen in its upcoming release. The company is slated to reveal its earnings on October 31, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Amgen to post earnings of $4.68 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 0.43%. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $6.94 billion, indicating a 4.27% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.Regarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of $18.35 per share and revenue of $27.26 billion, indicating changes of +3.73% and +3.55%, respectively, compared to the previous year.Investors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for Amgen. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.01% lower. Amgen is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Story continuesIn the context of valuation, Amgen is at present trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 15.45. This indicates a discount in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 17.42.Meanwhile, AMGN's PEG ratio is currently 3.57. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 2.12 as of yesterday's close.The Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry is part of the Medical sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 77, finds itself in the top 31% echelons of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups.

We believe Amgen has some key pipeline assets in obesity and inflammation, which indicate a large market opportunity. Several data readouts are expected in the next 12 months.The analyst believes Amgen has three potential blockbuster oncology candidates in its pipeline. These are AMG 193, a PRMT5i inhibitor that targets MTAP-null tumors in phase I, xaluritamig (STEAP1xCD3), a potential first-in-class candidate for prostate cancer in phase I, and tarlatamab for small-cell lung cancers in phase III.Amgen has outperformed the industry year to date. Amgen’s stock has risen 8% against a decline of 19.3% for the industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe analyst at Leerink Partner stated that the recently closed acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics is expected to boost Amgen’s near- and long-term EPS. The Leerink Partner analyst expects the Horizon Therapeutics acquisition to be accretive to earnings by 8% in 2024 and 15% in 2025.In December 2022, Amgen announced a definitive agreement to acquire Horizon Therapeutics for $27.8 billion. In May, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) filed a lawsuit in Federal Court to halt the proposed merger Per the FTC, if the acquisition was allowed to go through, a large-cap giant like Amgen could leverage its position with insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers to entrench the monopoly positions for two of Horizon's key products — Tepezza (approved for treating thyroid eye disease) and Krystexxa (approved for treating chronic refractory gout).Story continuesIn August, Amgen and Horizon Therapeutics resolved the pending FTC lawsuit. This cleared Amgen’s path to acquire Horizon for $28 billion. The acquisition closed on Oct 6. The acquisition has added several first-in-class early-in-lifecycle biologic drugs like Tepezza, Krystexxa and Uplizna to Amgen’s broad and diversified portfolio.The upgrade came ahead of Amgen's third-quarter results, which are expected to be announced on Oct 31 after market close.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderAmgen currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The CAR T-cell therapy market is currently going through a rapid expansion, owing to rapidly expanding clinical trial activities and recent commercialization of CAR-T cell therapy, which are expected to offer lucrative opportunities for market expansion and flourishing opportunities. The rise in awareness and upsurge in approvals of new CAR T-cell therapies and promising advanced drugs present in pipelines are anticipated to offer remunerative opportunities for the expansion for the global CAR T-cell therapy market in the near future. Some of the benefits of CAR T-cell therapies over conventional drugs, include the destruction of cancer cells using patients' immune system, early recovery, and shortened treatment time. In addition, CAR T-cell therapy survives for a long time in the body, as they have the ability to recognize and target cancer cells even if the cancer relapses. According to a report released by Precedence Research, the global cell therapy market was valued at US$ 12 billion in 2022 and it is expected to hit US$ 83.78 billion by 2032, poised to grow at a CAGR of 21.50% during the forecast period 2023 to 2032. Further, an additional report by Allied Market Research stated the global car t-cell therapy market size was valued at $1.7 billion in 2021, and is projected to reach $6.1 billion by 2031.   Active biotech and pharma companies in the markets this week include Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN), Regen BioPharma, Inc. (OTCPK:RGBP), Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD), GSK plc (NYSE:GSK), Incyte (NASDAQ:INCY).Precedence Research added: “The growth of global cell therapy market is attributed to the rising incidents of chronic disorders and infections. In addition, the growing cases of diabetes are also boosting the market growth. As per the International Diabetes Federation Diabetes Altas, almost 573 million persons globally had diabetes in 2022, with the number anticipated to grow by 643 million by 2032 and 783 million by 2045. Moreover, the growing number of research studies and clinical trials are also boosting the growth of global cell therapy market. One of the key factors propelling the expansion of global cell therapy market is adoption of innovative and latest technologies. Furthermore, after the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, the market for cell therapy is growing at a rapid pace. With over 900 companies working on advanced therapeutics around the world and around 1,000 cell or gene therapy clinical studies now conducted, the cell therapy market might see a surge in number of approvals.

Receives First Phase of Confirmatory Study - Regen BioPharma, Inc. (OTCPK:RGBP) has previously discussed initiation of a series of experiments to validate its DuraCAR CAR T-cell therapeutic while also identifying new, unexpected and potentially extremely useful findings in developing cell therapy treatments for autoimmune disorders.The company has now received the first set of confirmatory data which demonstrates that T cells which express the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) construct targeting CD19 and expressing siRNA for NR2F6 were successfully created. In addition, the siRNA that is designed into the CAR T-cell was very highly expressed. Subsequent studies will determine if the expression of NR2F6 mRNA is suppressed or enhanced as a result of the high expression of siRNA.""This is a major accomplishment in moving this model forward into therapies because in order to test whether we can genetically manipulate NR2F6 levels, we have to be able to produce a CAR T-cell where we demonstrate expression of this siRNA,"" says Dr. Harry Lander, Chief Scientific Consultant to the company. ""We are excited to see the results on NR2F6 expression. If it is inhibited, we will focus on using these DuraCAR cells as originally envisioned - to attack solid tumors. If it is enhanced, we will begin re-tooling these cells to treat autoimmune disorders.""""We are delighted to get our first dataset from an independent CRO which shows that the CAR T-cells are doing what we expect and look forward to the next set of data which will inform us about the disease areas, whether autoimmunity or cancer, we will focus on,"" says Dr. David Koos, Chairman and CEO of the company.

If you want to skip our discussion on the commodities market, head directly to 5 Best Commodity ETFs. Agricultural commodities consist of livestock, grains, oilseeds, sugar, and cocoa, to name some. Ever since the pandemic in 2021, the commodities market was presented with a number of challenges. Disruptions to the labor market and the global supply chain triggered a volatile pricing. As people tried to acclimatize to the lockdowns, consumer behavior changed and shifts were observed in demand. According to the World Bank, the prices for commodities are expected to decline by roughly 21% in 2023 - the sharpest decline since the extreme conditions of the pandemic. According to Euromonitor International, the agricultural commodities can be expected to decrease by 5.6% due to the higher supply. As the supply chain improves, this increase is being spearheaded by the increased production of corn, wheat, soybeans, and palm oil in Brazil, Australia, Canada, Russia, and the United States. In contrast, the price for rice and sugar is expected to increase. This is due to the rising demand for rice and a restrictive market for sugar. Despite the global pressure for a recession, the economy is somewhat stable. Hence, the decrease in fuel prices have made for cheaper inputs for the farming industry. However, the average fertilizer cost is still twice as high as pre-pandemic levels. Given the recessionary pressure and the expectation of costs further increasing, the margins in the agricultural industry are faced with some pressure.Similar to this, the energy-based commodity prices are also estimated to decrease to be 23% lower than that in 2022. This can be attributed to the improved levels of energy conservation and the favorable weather, which has helped reduce the demand. According to S&amp;P Global, the demand for fossil fuels is expected to increase during the year, which is against the increased legislative efforts to reduce emissions. Mr. Dan Klein, the Head of Energy Pathways, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, stated China’s covid policy as the most important factor for the global demand for energy commodities in 2023. He commented: Story continues“As its (China’s) demand softness due to lockdowns in 2022 was a key safety valve for oil, gas, and coal markets, while Europe scrambled to replace Russian energy. With another year of vaccinations and growing frustrations with lockdowns domestically in China, restrictions will likely ease somewhat in 2023 and imports of fossil fuels can be expected to increase again.""Also Read: 10 Best Natural Resources ETFsAs per the S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights Energy Outlook for 2023, the total demand for China’s energy market is set to increase by 3.3 million barrels – this would make up 47% of the global energy demand growth. Just like China, India’s demand for energy will also be crucial for the industry. As tensions continue between Russia and Europe, India is expected to be a key buyer for Russian energy. Similar to the agricultural and energy sector, the prices for crucial metals have experienced a 17% decline during the first quarter of 2023. Much like the commodity sector as a whole, the pandemic caused major disruptions to the supply chain for precious metals. As people adjusted to an online model to work and study, the demand for precious metals such as lithium increased. To make things worse, mining was halted and the supply lines were stretched thin. Ever since 2021, the industry has been adjusting. During the year, the industry has experienced an improved supply of metals, as shipments for non-ferrous metals increased in 2023. Coupled with a lower than anticipated demand for these metals, the prices have significantly fallen. While the prices have definitely reduced since 2022, the industry has still not reverted back to pre-pandemic levels. The historically high price of metals is a crucial concern for manufacturers, as the cost of production and sourcing raw materials remains staggering. Furthermore, the increased cost of production will continue to adversely affect the purchasing power parity for consumers. The ETFs featured in this article also enjoy an exposure to the market for gold and silver. According to the London Bullion Market (LBMA), the price for gold is to be affected by the US dollar and federal reserve rates, inflation, and other geopolitical factors. The global economic pressure called central banks to act. Although favorable, these attempts are deemed not enough in dampening the inflationary pressures. Despite the rise in rates, the price for gold rose about 6.53% between January 3 and February 2. In comparison, the US dollar fell by 1.77% during the same period. The USD then rose as Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve Chair, announced the US interest rates would continue rising. However, the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, the bail-out of First Republic Bank, and the distressed sale of Credit Suisse to UBS in Europe resulted in a drop in the US dollar. Following this, on March 24, the price for gold reached £1634.84, the highest it ever has in GBP. In contrast, silver prices dropped during the first quarter of 2023. However, it also experienced a change in the market mood as the price increased by 18.8% during March. Some of the best commodity stocks to look out for include Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX), Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), and Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO).

The program is used to conduct intelligence gathering for expeditionary marine countermeasure missions.Details of the DealValued at $347 million, the contract entails manufacturing up to 200 vehicles over the next five years. The award has been provided by the Naval Sea Systems Command.Per the terms of the deal, Huntington Ingalls will deliver these next-generation SUUVs to the U.S. Navy, along with providing afloat and auxiliary support equipment and engineering services for the same.What’s Supporting Huntington Ingalls?Huntington Ingalls is a prominent manufacturer of unmanned undersea vehicles (“UUV”) worldwide. Serving customers in more than 30 countries, HII provides design, autonomy, manufacturing, testing, operations and sustainment of unmanned systems, including UUVs and unmanned surface vessels (USV).Its REMUS family of UUVs are low logistics UUV that can be rapidly deployed from any vessel of opportunity, with their common usage in mine countermeasures, search and recovery and antisubmarine warfare.Notably, the U.S. Navy’s Lionfish System is based on HII's REMUS 300 UUV and is a highly portable, two-person SUUV with an open architecture design and versatile payload options. In early 2022, REMUS 300 was chosen as the Navy's official program of record for the next-generation SUUV.The aforementioned discussion surely reflects the proven expertise of HII in the UUV space that is likely to have led to a steady inflow of contracts for the company, like the latest one. This, in turn, should bolster its revenue generation prospects from the UUV product line.Growth ProspectusThe recent tiff between Ukraine and Russia has led other nations to strengthen their defense landscape to deter any war-like situation. In this context, it is imperative to mention that UUVs are noted for their ability to carry out dangerous maritime operations, such as mine countermeasure missions and harbor patrol. Therefore, as investments in undersea warfare capabilities have recently increased manifold, so has the demand for state-of-the-art UUVs.Story continuesLooking ahead, with technological advancement, nations are more rapidly adopting artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to increase the autonomy of UUVs. As a result, hefty investments in developing and acquiring autonomous marine systems can be expected in the coming days, thereby boosting the UUV market. To this end, the Fortune Business Insights firm projects the global unmanned underwater vehicles market to witness a CAGR of 13.5% during 2023-2030.Such growth trends should boost Huntington Ingalls along with other defense primes like Boeing BA, General Dynamics GD and Lockheed Martin LMT, which have a strong presence in the unmanned underwater vehicle market.Boeing’s Echo Voyager is a fully autonomous XLUUV class UUV that can be used for various missions, which were previously impossible due to traditional UUV limitations.Boeing’s long-term earnings growth rate is 4%. BA’s shares appreciated 48.1% in the past year.General Dynamics’ Bluefin SandShark is a one-person-portable, low-cost, autonomous unmanned underwater vehicle designed to leverage today’s miniaturized sensors and emerge as the development platform for the next generation.General Dynamics boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.2%. GD’s shares rallied 3.8% in the past year.Lockheed has more than four decades of experience developing unmanned and robotic systems for the sea. Notably, LMT’s Marlin autonomous underwater vehicle system offers a range of civilian and military customers and a quick and safe way to conduct subsea surveys and inspections.Lockheed’s long-term earnings growth rate is 8.4%. LMT’s shares rose 7.6% in the past year.Price MovementShares of HII have rallied 4.2% in the past six months against the industry’s decline of 12.6%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankHuntington Ingalls currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Portuguese energy firm Galp, Korean Gas Corp. and Mozambique's state oil company ENH are the minority partners with 10% each.Eni hopes to reach a final investment decision on a second floating LNG project to exploit the Coral field by the end of June next year, two sources directly involved with the project told Reuters this week.Meloni on Friday also said that 70% of Italy's climate fund, or about 3 billion euros ($3.16 billion), will be reserved for Africa.""Europe has an energy supply problem while Africa is potentially a huge producer of energy. If we put the two things together we can build a different future of cooperation between our continents about energy but ... also about raw materials,"" the prime minister said.Italy will host an Italy-Africa conference at the beginning of next year, Meloni said, adding that the government would present its new cooperation strategy for the continent during the conference.

132,0b5c004f-296a-3cdd-85bf-72bc0483219a,NOV,2023-10-13,The past five years for ShaMaran Petroleum (CVE:SNM) investors has not been profitable,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/past-five-years-shamaran-petroleum-111956777.html,1697195996,STORY,"['CL=F', 'SHASF']","[ShaMaran Petroleum Corp. (CVE:SNM) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 22% in the last month. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last five years have been less than pleasing. In fact, the share price is down 52%, which falls well short of the return you could get by buying an index fund.So let's have a look and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. See our latest analysis for ShaMaran Petroleum While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.ShaMaran Petroleum became profitable within the last five years. Most would consider that to be a good thing, so it's counter-intuitive to see the share price declining. Other metrics might give us a better handle on how its value is changing over time.Revenue is actually up 24% over the time period. So it seems one might have to take closer look at the fundamentals to understand why the share price languishes. After all, there may be an opportunity.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe know that ShaMaran Petroleum has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? This free interactive report on ShaMaran Petroleum's balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About The Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?We'd be remiss not to mention the difference between ShaMaran Petroleum's total shareholder return (TSR) and its share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. We note that ShaMaran Petroleum's TSR, at -49% is higher than its share price return of -52%. When you consider it hasn't been paying a dividend, this data suggests shareholders have benefitted from a spin-off, or had the opportunity to acquire attractively priced shares in a discounted capital raising.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 6.5% in the last year, ShaMaran Petroleum shareholders lost 35%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 8% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand ShaMaran Petroleum better, we need to consider many other factors. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   4 warning signs for ShaMaran Petroleum   (of which 2 are a bit unpleasant!) you should know about.If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on Canadian exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

The schedule of quarterly reports is packed for the days ahead, including earnings from Netflix, Tesla, Bank of America and AT&amp;T. Investors will also have fresh economic data to grapple with, alongside remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Yahoo Finance's Brent Sanchez has a graphical breakdown of what to watch next week:H23 days agoHamza ShabanThe Fed's next 'rate hike' has already arrivedSome Fed officials see rising Treasury yields as a mechanism to slow the economy without having to go through the trouble of raising rates again. In effect, elevated yields can do the work of central bankers for them — functioning as a rate hike without instituting an actual rate hike.And this isn’t the first time a phantom rate hike has crept its way through the economy. In March Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the bank failures and associated turmoil essentially acted as another rate hike.But as with the Fed’s previous rate increases, a rise in inflation or other unfavorable observations could force the central bank to move. And if yields slide, their tightening effect would diminish, creating a greater need for the Fed to enact a genuine hike instead of relying on a substitute.H23 days agoHamza ShabanBig banks report strong earnings amid higher ratesThe nation’s largest banks appear to be thriving as the market settles into an era of “high for longer” interest rates, as the Fed attempts to pull inflation down to its 2% target.On Friday a host of banks reported robust earnings.Profits for JPMorgan Chase (JPM) surged in the third quarter, reinforcing its dominance in the sector, despite the headwinds facing banks this year. The New York giant reported earnings of $13.2 billion that were up 35% from the same period a year ago. Its revenue of $40.7 billion was up 21%. Its net income and revenue beat Wall Street expectations. Shares rose about 2%.Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) also beat earnings on Friday.Citigroup, whose shares rose nearly 2% reported profits that were broadly steady as it reaped the benefits of a rise in trading revenue and investment banking fees.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) lost 0.8%.H23 days agoHamza ShabanInflation concerns flare up for American consumersConsumers are feeling worse about the economy even as the likelihood of a November or December rate hike creeps downward, heightening the attention on the Fed’s efforts to bring down inflation.The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index registered a 7% drop for its first October reading. “Nearly all demographic groups posted setbacks in sentiment, reflecting the continued weight of high prices,” said Joanne Hsu, director of the university’s Surveys of Consumers.The dark turn in current events, from the turmoil in Congress over who will serve as the next Speaker of the House to the escalating violence in the Israel-Hamas conflict, likely weighed on the mindsets of consumers, according to a note by analysts at Wells Fargo, published Friday.The more pessimistic feelings coincides with a dwindling likelihood of a rate hike later this year. Just a day before the survey was released, the latest inflation report on Thursday showed that prices in September rose at roughly the same pace seen in August. The data bolstered the case that the Fed still has a ways to go to pull inflation back down to its 2% target.Still, markets were indicating the Fed will likely hold rates steady in November.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 10 Best Dividend Aristocrats According to Analysts. With the stock market facing ongoing fluctuations, investors are experiencing the frustration of seeing their profits disappear. For instance, the S&amp;P 500 increased by 19.5% from January to July 2023 but has since fallen by 6%. Considering the Federal Reserve's inclination to maintain higher interest rates for an extended period, negative investor sentiment, and the typical seasonal decline, it appears that the momentum of this summer's market rally might continue to weaken as we enter the fall season. According to analysts, investors can mitigate their losses by investing in dividend stocks.Dividend stocks are already a popular choice among investors due to their reliability in providing a steady stream of income. Between 1993 and the end of last year, the S&amp;P 500 index increased by 777%. But with dividends included, the S&amp;P 500 grew by over 1,400% during that same time frame. In addition to this, when we examine the performance of the S&amp;P 500 on a decade-by-decade basis, we can see that the role of dividends in contributing to the total return has fluctuated over time. From 1930 to 2021, dividends accounted for an average of 40% of the S&amp;P 500's total return.A recent study conducted by Morgan Stanley's chief investment officer, Mike Wilson, found that stocks that pay dividends tend to perform better in the long run and are more resilient during market downturns. Here are some comments from the analyst, taken from his interview with Business Insider this month.""Our economists are of the view that inflation will continue to slow from elevated levels over the next 12 months. That backdrop is supportive of owning dividend-related factors and defensive dividend payers, in particular.""Story continuesHe further said:""Dividends provide a positive return cushion with a notable portion of outperformance for payers versus non-payers coming during periods of market volatility. Specifically, the majority of outperformance comes during large market pullbacks such as 2000, 2008, 2015, and 2020.""The Business Insider report also revealed that stocks that started paying dividends in 2000 have outperformed the market since then. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) have been raising their dividends for decades, becoming top choices for investors.

Here is what the firm has to say:“We were fairly active in the quarter as market dislocations allowed us to be opportunistic, while focusing on companies with stronger moats, better pricing power, more predictable long-term growth and higher returns. In the materials sector we exited PPG Industries, Inc. (NYSE:PPG) and initiated a position in Sherwin-Williams. While both companies operate in the paint and coating industry and are benefiting from improving margins as raw material prices have come down of late, we believe Sherwin-Williams’ dominant retail footprint affords it better pricing power through the cycle. The company provided conservative 2023 guidance and has been successfully gaining market share in the pro segment. While PPG has more European and industrial exposure, Sherwin-Williams’ residential and more domestic focus should also benefit the company as housing indicators appear to be troughing. Weak housing in the face of higher mortgage rates caused Sherwin-Williams stock to sell off in the first quarter, creating a compelling investment opportunity for long-term focused fundamental investors.”21.

(NYSE:NEE) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 80% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Last week's US$8.3b market cap gain would probably be appreciated by institutional investors, especially after a year of 25% losses.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of NextEra Energy, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for NextEra Energy ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About NextEra Energy?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.NextEra Energy already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see NextEra Energy's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in NextEra Energy. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.7% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.5% and 5.5% of the stock.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of NextEra EnergyWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of NextEra Energy, Inc.. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$189m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 20% stake in NextEra Energy. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand NextEra Energy better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

Objectively, leaders know that a happy and engaged workforce is good for business, but is that costly benefits package actually contributing to the bottom line?On Wednesday, that question came up at a Fortune’s Most Powerful Women Summit panel in Laguna Niguel, Calif.“I'm just trying to understand the tradeoffs from costs,” one attendee asked panelists, which included executives from Mastercard, Guild, and Deloitte. “[Is it] creating productivity on the other side? Or do we just have to get used to escalating expectations? It's a very significant cost pressure for us in terms of meeting employee expectations.”While the executives admitted they were still answering these questions themselves, they offered insight into how they calculate whether benefits offerings improve their staff’s performance.Bijal Shah, chief experience officer at Guild, a startup that provides education and training resources to employees, said it’s important to hold benefits partners accountable and ask for evidence that their services bolster productivity or engagement. Shah said clients often send questions and requests for data on how Guild benefits their bottom line.“I do think you're going to hold your partners accountable to providing that type of data and information, and scrutinizing if they don't have it, to be able to actually move your organization forward and not feel like it's just going to the expense line,” she said.At Mastercard, the company is looking inward for an answer. The payment processing giant conducted a total rewards optimization study last year, asking employees for feedback on the benefits Mastercard offers and what tradeoffs they'd make to get their desired benefits. Through the study, the company’s leadership discovered that employees were interested in purchasing company stock at a discounted price. After approaching the board and getting approval for the benefit, the company is now conceptualizing how to roll out the offering in 2024.Story continues“I do think that there's an opportunity for us to, obviously from an employer perspective, constantly [and] holistically look at our offerings, and obviously, pressure test our partners to really show the ROI and get the feedback from our employees,” said Lucrecia Borgonovo, Mastercard’s chief talent and organizational effectiveness officer.But it’s often still difficult to correlate benefits to metrics like productivity. “We've thought a lot about: How do we measure well-being and attach it to productivity—not necessarily utilization but actual productivity,” said Stephani Long, chief talent officer at Deloitte US. She says it’s hard to parse whether employees are more productive because they’re happy with their benefits.Leaders may need a bit of blind faith that their benefits offerings are driving results. “I'm a believer that many of these investments, maybe all of them, are actually saving money, not costing money,” Long said. Take paid family leave, for example. Providing paid time off for 16 weeks is much cheaper than an employee leaving their job permanently to care for their child, which forces employers to spend considerably more money backfilling a now-vacant role.Paige McGlauflinpaige.mcglauflin@fortune.com@paidionThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of passive income ideas and dividend stocks, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks For Passive Income. Passive income is becoming increasingly popular among people from diverse backgrounds. It's an appealing idea, especially with the current economic uncertainty, and it's capturing the attention of investors more than ever. According to a survey by LendingClub Corp. and Pymnts.com conducted in March this year, nearly half of working people have a side job or another source of extra income, like selling handmade items. Surprisingly, it's not just those with lower income; even people making $100,000 a year often seek additional income to cover their expenses. The report also mentioned that consumers could be collecting over $50 billion in total every month from their extra earnings, and a significant part of this money might not be reported to tax authorities.Passive income often arises from investments, assets, or activities that need very little ongoing work after they are established. Passive exchange-traded funds, that aim to replicate the performance of a specific market index or asset class, are important in this regard. In one of our articles, we referred to James Seyffart’s statement from Bloomberg Intelligence, who mentioned that passive investing is steadily on the rise in the US. Currently, passive mutual funds and ETFs own around 19% of the average publicly traded U.S. stock, which is three times higher than it was in 2013.Investing in dividend stocks is also one of the most reliable ways to generate passive income. Dividend-paying stocks help investors receive regular dividend payments, typically on a quarterly basis, without having to actively work or make ongoing investments. This income can provide a steady cash flow, making it a reliable source of passive income. In addition to this, dividend stocks have significantly contributed to the market’s overall returns. Between 2013 and 2022, dividends accounted for 17% of the overall returns in the S&amp;P 500 Index. But if we consider a much longer period, going back to the 1930s, dividends contributed to 37% of the returns.Story continuesThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the best dividend stocks as these companies have been raising their payouts year after year. To create passive income, it's vital that dividends consistently increase over time. In this article, we will further discuss dividend stocks to earn passive income.12 Best Dividend Stocks For Passive IncomePhoto by Sharon McCutcheon on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of Q2 2023 and picked companies that have raised their dividends for at least 10 consecutive years or more. From that list, we narrowed down our options to companies with strong financial positions and steady cash flow, indicating reliable future dividends for generating passive income. We then sorted these companies in ascending order based on the number of funds that hold stakes in them as of the second quarter of 2023.12. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is an American multinational telecommunications and media conglomerate. The company is also one of the largest cable television and broadband internet service providers in the country.In the second quarter of 2023, Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) reported revenue of $30.5 billion, which showed a 1.6% growth from the same period last year. The company's operating cash flow for the quarter came in at roughly $7.3 billion and its free cash flow amounted to $3.4 billion. It also returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends during the quarter, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks for passive income.The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some other reliable options for generating passive income.Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) has raised its dividends for 15 years in a row. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.29 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.65%, as of October 12.At the end of Q2 2023, 66 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database reported having stakes in Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), down from 68 a quarter earlier. The consolidated value of these stakes is over $3.14 billion.ClearBridge Investments mentioned Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) in its Q3 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Long-term holdings Charter and Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) delivered strong second-quarter results relative to expectations; their stable recurring revenue streams and undemanding valuations were rewarded in the current environment. Cable multiples compressed over the past 24 months on fears of heightened competition in their core broadband business from fixed wireless and fiber providers. While fiber remains a competitive alternative to cable broadband over the long term, high upfront investments and a materially higher cost of capital are resulting in slower buildouts than previously expected. Fixed wireless also continues to gain traction, particularly in rural markets, but share gains also appear to be moderating. At the same time, both Comcast and Charter are expanding their footprints into rural and adjacent markets while gaining wireless market share, leveraging their mobile virtual network operator agreements with Verizon. We think both cable companies are well-positioned to continue to grow while generating substantial free cash flows. We added to Comcast during the quarter.”11. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is a well-known American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of membership-based warehouse clubs.

A Qualcomm representative declined to comment on the overall size of the reductions to its 50,000 workforce.More than 750 of the positions being eliminated are from Qualcomm’s engineering ranks, including at levels from director down to technician. The rest of the cuts will come from a broad range of roles such as internal technical staff and accounting.The job reductions will begin about mid-December, Qualcomm said in the notifications. The San Diego-based company is required to make the filings under California rules. Those obligations on announcements of job cuts don’t apply to the company’s other locations.Chief Financial Officer Akash Palkhiwala told analysts in August that Qualcomm would “proactively implement additional cost actions.”“We had previously communicated we would evaluate additional cost actions as the environment continues to evolve,” he said on a conference call. “Until we see sustained signs of improving fundamentals, our operating framework does not assume an immediate recovery.”The company, which will report earnings next month, is on course to see revenue shrink by about 19% in the current fiscal year. While Chief Executive Officer Cristiano Amon is trying to drive Qualcomm’s products into new areas, the company still gets the bulk of its sales from the phone market.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on accessible tourism, you may go to 5 Best Vacations for Seniors with Limited Mobility.Silver TourismAccording to Census data, Baby Boomers are the wealthiest generation of all cohorts, controlling an estimated 70% of disposable income in the USA. Over the next two decades, it is forecast that the generation will leave a staggering $30 trillion behind. If it happens, it is going to be the greatest transfer of wealth in history. However, given the current trends of baby boomer traveling; it is unlikely that such a significant transfer of wealth is going to happen at all. After all, this phase of life is often referred to as the ""golden period"" for a reason. It's only reasonable to anticipate that a significant portion of their accumulated wealth will be allocated to travel, leisure, and non-essential living expenses.On average, this generational cohort is likely to take 4 to 5 leisure trips each year, spending an estimated $6,600 annually. These travelers love to visit Florida and the Caribbean, the top warm-weather spots on their travel list. Moreover, while the average spend of these travelers on a leisure trip per year is an estimated $6,000; many baby boomers can afford to spend the same on a single vacation as well. This higher spend on leisure travel stems from their financial stability and strength. Having no children to take care of and enough time on their hands; traveling seems like the perfect solution.Based on travel data, it has also been found that 3 out of 10 boomers choose cruises when going on vacation trips. According to Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), baby boomers are especially splurging on restaurants and cruises. While a spike in Social Security payments due to an 8.7% COLA (Cost of Living Adjustment) has been responsible for the increased spending, high-income households that are unaffected by such spikes seem to be spending more, too. In 2022, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) reported a substantial increase in aggregated credit and debit card spending per household on travel. This category includes expenditures on airlines, lodging, cruises, and rental cars.Story continuesThe data reveals a robust year-over-year (YoY) growth of 27%, surpassing the 2019 figures by a notable 9%. A senior economist at Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), Tinsley; notes that these older consumers are spending more on hotels, cruises, and airfare now that the pandemic is over. Another reason the baby boomers increasingly prefer cruises over other vacation trips is the range of accessibility they offer. You pack and unpack once. There are amenities and conveniences available for passengers with limited mobility, onboard assistance, and even assistance for excursions.Accessible TourismAccording to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, over 25.5 million Americans have self-reported travel-limiting disabilities. Out of this figure, 11.2 million are aged 65 years and above. Moreover, many of these Americans with mobility disabilities spend $58.2 billion on leisure trips. Despite representing a significant part of the travel industry, this market segment continues to be poorly served. MMGY Travel Assistance, a research firm focused on the travel and hospitality industry, has researched travelers with mobility disabilities. The results report that 96% of respondents have been facing accommodation-related problems during travel, 86% had flight problems, and 40% also reported having their mobility equipment lost or damaged by their airline.Prioritizing accessibility can help those with mobility disabilities travel with ease, tapping a significant market segment along the way. Many organizations have already started creating a more accessible future for such travelers, including Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE), Carnival Corporation &amp; plc (NYSE:CCL), Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR), and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL). Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) has partnered with several companies working to increase access for underserved travelers. Companies include Becoming RentABLE, a company that finds accessible short-term rental properties; Be My Eyes, an app that connects people with sight impairments; and Wheel the World, an online resource for accessible travel experiences, amongst others.""We're excited to leverage our expertise with Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) on how we can make the world accessible; that's our purpose as a company.""Alvaro Silberstein, co-founder &amp; CEO of Accelerator finalist Wheel the World.Similarly, Carnival Corporation &amp; plc (NYSE:CCL); an American cruise firm and one of the best cruise stocks to buy according to Insider Monkey, has also been providing accessible cruises to its customers. AIDA Cruises, one of the brands under Carnival Corporation &amp; plc (NYSE:CCL), has adapted to the special needs and requirements of individuals with impairments. Customers can access barrier-free travel through advanced booking, with almost all areas of the cruise ship accessible to customers without barriers.Hotels such as Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR), an American multinational company that operates, franchises, and licenses lodging including hotel, residential, and timeshare properties, are also worthy of mention due to their commitment to accessibility. At Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR), accessible stays are guaranteed through rooms with specific facilities, grab bars and walk-in showers, Braille signage, wheelchairs upon request, barrier-free access to common areas, restaurants, swimming pools, and much more.Many all-inclusive resorts are also popping up along the way to cater to the booming demand for senior traveling. Some all-inclusive resorts for seniors with limited mobility include Sandals Royal Bahamian Spa Resort &amp; Offshore Island, Bahamas; Riu Palace Riviera Maya, Mexico; and The Westin Golf Resort &amp; Spa, Playa Conchal, Costa Rica; to name a few.16 Best Vacations for Seniors with Limited MobilityMethodologyTo compile the list of best vacations for seniors with limited mobility, we checked out tourism websites, travel forums, accessibility guides such as World on Wheels, and travel blogs.

The program is used to conduct intelligence gathering for expeditionary marine countermeasure missions.Details of the DealValued at $347 million, the contract entails manufacturing up to 200 vehicles over the next five years. The award has been provided by the Naval Sea Systems Command.Per the terms of the deal, Huntington Ingalls will deliver these next-generation SUUVs to the U.S. Navy, along with providing afloat and auxiliary support equipment and engineering services for the same.What’s Supporting Huntington Ingalls?Huntington Ingalls is a prominent manufacturer of unmanned undersea vehicles (“UUV”) worldwide. Serving customers in more than 30 countries, HII provides design, autonomy, manufacturing, testing, operations and sustainment of unmanned systems, including UUVs and unmanned surface vessels (USV).Its REMUS family of UUVs are low logistics UUV that can be rapidly deployed from any vessel of opportunity, with their common usage in mine countermeasures, search and recovery and antisubmarine warfare.Notably, the U.S. Navy’s Lionfish System is based on HII's REMUS 300 UUV and is a highly portable, two-person SUUV with an open architecture design and versatile payload options. In early 2022, REMUS 300 was chosen as the Navy's official program of record for the next-generation SUUV.The aforementioned discussion surely reflects the proven expertise of HII in the UUV space that is likely to have led to a steady inflow of contracts for the company, like the latest one. This, in turn, should bolster its revenue generation prospects from the UUV product line.Growth ProspectusThe recent tiff between Ukraine and Russia has led other nations to strengthen their defense landscape to deter any war-like situation. In this context, it is imperative to mention that UUVs are noted for their ability to carry out dangerous maritime operations, such as mine countermeasure missions and harbor patrol. Therefore, as investments in undersea warfare capabilities have recently increased manifold, so has the demand for state-of-the-art UUVs.Story continuesLooking ahead, with technological advancement, nations are more rapidly adopting artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to increase the autonomy of UUVs. As a result, hefty investments in developing and acquiring autonomous marine systems can be expected in the coming days, thereby boosting the UUV market. To this end, the Fortune Business Insights firm projects the global unmanned underwater vehicles market to witness a CAGR of 13.5% during 2023-2030.Such growth trends should boost Huntington Ingalls along with other defense primes like Boeing BA, General Dynamics GD and Lockheed Martin LMT, which have a strong presence in the unmanned underwater vehicle market.Boeing’s Echo Voyager is a fully autonomous XLUUV class UUV that can be used for various missions, which were previously impossible due to traditional UUV limitations.Boeing’s long-term earnings growth rate is 4%. BA’s shares appreciated 48.1% in the past year.General Dynamics’ Bluefin SandShark is a one-person-portable, low-cost, autonomous unmanned underwater vehicle designed to leverage today’s miniaturized sensors and emerge as the development platform for the next generation.General Dynamics boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.2%. GD’s shares rallied 3.8% in the past year.Lockheed has more than four decades of experience developing unmanned and robotic systems for the sea. Notably, LMT’s Marlin autonomous underwater vehicle system offers a range of civilian and military customers and a quick and safe way to conduct subsea surveys and inspections.Lockheed’s long-term earnings growth rate is 8.4%. LMT’s shares rose 7.6% in the past year.Price MovementShares of HII have rallied 4.2% in the past six months against the industry’s decline of 12.6%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankHuntington Ingalls currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Lockheed Martin is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for LMT in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $6.67 per share for LMT, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.66 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for LMT, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.15% heading into earnings season.Lockheed Martin Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseLockheed Martin Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseLockheed Martin Corporation price-eps-surprise | Lockheed Martin Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

The Fed kept the benchmark lending rate unchanged at the existing 5.25-5.5% range at its September FOMC meeting. Market participants were widely expecting a status quo. However, the post-FOMC statement of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell created uncertainty among investors.Although the Fed paused its rate hike in the September FOMC meeting, the current dot plot has shown a strong likelihood of one more hike of 25 basis points in 2023. That will take the terminal interest rate of this hiking cycle to 5.6%, well above the 5.1% forecast in June. Notably, the current range of the Fed fund rate is the highest level since March 2001.More importantly, the central bank said it would keep interest rates higher for a longer time. The new projection has shown two rate cuts in 2024 instead of four projected in June. The first cut in interest rate is not expected before September 2024.Moreover, the unresolved war between Russia and Ukraine and the recent geopolitical conflict between Israel and the Palestine-based terrorist group Hamas may inject more volatility in the near future.Stocks to WatchAt this stage, dividend-paying stocks should be in demand as investors try to safeguard their portfolios.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Lockheed Martin LMT, RTX Corp. RTX, Boeing BA and L3Harris Technologies LHX.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:U.S. Defense Stocks to Gain as Israel-Hamas Conflict EscalatesFresh tensions have once again erupted in the Middle East, owing to the ongoing violence between Palestine's Hamas group and Israeli militants that took thousands of lives over the past couple of days. The conflict started with Hamas launching sudden missile attacks on the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon, to which Israel's military responded with multiple airstrikes on the Gaza strip.This unprecedented assault by Hamas and the retaliatory strikes from Israel are poised to be beneficial for U.S. defense stocks, especially those that are notable weapons suppliers to Israel. Evidently, the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace &amp; Defense Index surged a solid 6.7%, following the outbreak of the latest Israel-Hamas conflict. This, in turn, puts the spotlight on major weapon manufacturers like Lockheed Martin, RTX Corp., Boeing and L3Harris Technologies.U.S. Support to IsraelAmerica has been a patronizer for Israel, aiding in promoting the country's economic prosperity and regional security for many years. To this end, it is imperative to mention that the United States signed a landmark agreement with Israel in 2016. Per the contract, the United States pledged to offer military aid worth $38 billion to Israel over a period of 10 years.Israel has to spend $1.2 billion per year on the advanced military equipment that only the United States can provide. Obviously, this enhanced the inflow of U.S.-made weapons in Israel, thereby bolstering the U.S. defense majors' profits from international markets.Story continuesIn view of the recent scenario, U.S. President Joe Biden has pledged to provide additional military assistance, including ammunition and interceptors, to make sure that Israel does not run out of these critical assets to defend its cities and citizens, as stated in a CNBC report. Notably, the first plane carrying U.S. ammunition and military supplies has already landed at an air base in Southern Israel.Moreover, considering the fact that there are quite a few U.S. citizens among the hostages that Hamas has taken over the past couple of days, America has also enhanced its military force in the region to strengthen deterrence.U.S. Defense Stocks to GainConsidering the current military instability in Southern Israel, there's a high possibility of witnessing further hostility among the two parties. This, in turn, offers more growth opportunities for the following defense stocks.Lockheed Martin: LMT offers its C-130 and F-16 aircraft to Israel that the Israel Air Force has been using since the 1970s and 1980s, respectively. Israel is the owner of the largest fleet of F-16 fighters outside the United States.In light of the current situation, LMT's shares have risen 8.6% since Oct 6, following Hamas' latest strike on Israel. To tackle the ongoing violence in Southern Israel, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin recently ordered more of Lockheed-built F-35 and F-16 fighter aircraft to squadrons in the region.RTX Corp.: Its Missiles &amp; Defense unit, along with Israel's Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, manufactures the Iron Dome Weapon System. Notably, 10 Iron Dome batteries protect the citizens and infrastructure of Israel. These two companies also co-manufacture David's Sling System, which forms a crucial element of Israel's multi-tier layered missile defense architecture to provide mid-tier regional missile defense.RTX's shares have risen 5.1% since Oct 6. U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said that military supplies already flowing into Israel contain interceptors for the Iron Dome missile defense.Boeing: Israel Aerospace Industries' major structures work for Boeing's F-15 program, avionics and spare parts for the V-22 Osprey, the T-38 Talon and T-45 Goshawk. In 2022, the company was awarded contracts to deliver four KC-46A tankers to Israel.BA's shares have risen 3.3% since Oct 6. Following Hamas' attack on Israel, Boeing has sped up the delivery of 1,000 smart bombs to the latter, per a report from Fox News. Meanwhile, Mr. Austin's order also included the deployment of more F-15s in the region. This should boost Boeing, these jets' manufacturers.L3Harris Technologies: In July 2023, L3Harris announced that it is expanding its partnership with Israel Aerospace Industries' ELTA Systems Group (ELTA) to provide leading-edge, U.S. and NATO interoperable Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&amp;C) solutions.The companies are offering a missionized Bombardier Global 6500, integrated by L3Harris, with ELTA's latest next-generation AEW systems and operationally-proven Battle Management Command and Control Suite. The Global 6500 AEW&amp;C will fly higher, faster, longer and at a lower cost (to sustain, operate and maintain) than the existing AEW&amp;C platforms.LHX's shares have risen 8.3% since Oct 6. Following the ongoing violence, we may expect further development in the aforementioned partnership to boost Israel's airborne surveillance.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on stock market performance overall, head directly to 5 Worst Performing Dow Stocks YTD.In a July report by J.P. Morgan, it was stated that global economic growth is expected to slow down in the latter part of 2023, while inflation appears to be easing. However, it's worth noting that global core inflation is projected to remain elevated, staying above 3% until 2024. This ongoing high inflation will continue to exert pressure on central banks, potentially leading to further tightening measures. Bruce Kasman, Chief Global Economist at J.P. Morgan, said:“We do not think inflation is going to come back down to central bank comfort zones by themselves. Yes, there’s a decline going on. But no, we do not think you’re going to get inflation back below 3% in the U.S. or the euro area this year in an environment where supply has been damaged in a more lasting way and inflation psychology has shifted.”In the first half of 2023, global economic growth gained momentum, reaching a rate of 2.8%. So far, efforts to tighten monetary policies have balanced the diminishing impact of supply disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, starting in 2022, global policy rates have increased by nearly 400 basis points, affecting spending sensitive to interest rates and limiting industrial production. Despite the current growth momentum, it is believed that the global economy's resilience is decreasing. Consequently, it is expected that developed markets may undergo another round of tightening measures before the end of 2023 to control inflation. However, such actions may have adverse effects on the private sector's well-being. Consequently, there is a possibility of a synchronized global economic recession occurring, potentially before the end of 2024. J.P. Morgan Research anticipates that the United States may experience a mild recession toward the end of 2023. This is attributed to the Federal Reserve's conservative monetary policy, which is leading to stricter credit availability and a gradual decline in economic growth. The Western European economy faced challenges during the winter due to high energy prices. Although the first quarter of 2023 showed some improvement, overall economic growth remained relatively stagnant.Story continuesIn the first six months of 2023, there was a noticeable variance in stock performance, with differences observed in size, sectors, and investment styles. Surprisingly, this occurred amidst an unusual period of low volatility. Looking ahead, without any proactive measures from the Federal Reserve, experts expect a more difficult economic environment for stocks in the latter part of 2023. A similar less optimistic outlook is observed for equity markets in other regions across the world. Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, Global Head of Equity Macro Strategy at J.P. Morgan, stated:“Given that multiple expansion has been the main driver of performance year to date, we see unattractive risk-reward for equities and increasing investor complacency ahead of our expectation that the business cycle will further decelerate in the second half of the year, with the onset of a recession likely in the fourth quarter of 2023 or first quarter of 2024. What’s more, consumers are starting to show signs of weakness, and there is a risk that liquidity and credit conditions could tighten in the coming months.”According to S&amp;P Global, the Dow Jones Industrial Average showed improvement in September, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 but still experiencing a decline of 3.5%; -3.42% with dividends considered. However, when we consider the year-to-date performance, the Dow has lagged significantly behind the S&amp;P 500, with a gain of 1.09%;  2.73% with dividends, while the S&amp;P 500 has recorded an increase of 11.68%. This difference in performance is primarily attributed to how these indices are constructed, with factors like price weighting versus market value weighting playing a role. Historically, these differences tend to align, but in shorter time frames, disparities can emerge.In this article, we discuss some of the worst performing Dow stocks which include Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), 3M Company (NYSE:MMM), and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA).Worst Performing Dow Stocks YTDPhoto by nick chong on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe sorted the following Dow stocks based on year-to-date share price performance of each stock.

The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Year-to-Date Share Price Performance as of October 11: -4.63%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 92The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) functions as a global entertainment business. It is divided into two parts – Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution; and Disney Parks, Experiences and Products. On September 19, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)’s stock saw a decrease of over 3%. This decline followed the company's announcement of significant investments in its Parks segment, with the goal of doubling the current investment.The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) stock has faced setbacks due to the negative news surrounding its conflict with Florida legislators over a controversial education law. This has contributed to wider concerns that the streaming industry's growth is slowing down, impacting the outlook for The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)’s Disney+ streaming service.As per Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 92 hedge funds were bullish on The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), compared to the last quarter when 95 funds had invested in the stock.

Disney’s Bob Iger returned to the CEO’s seat in November 2022, replacing Bob Chapek, who left following a turbulent tenure. As a result of disappointing quarterly results and incremental commentary suggesting a more inline strategy with other media, the market has become less confident that Iger will achieve a turnaround by the end of his 1.5- year contract. We continue to believe Disney has a unique collection of assets and owns some of the best content among all media companies. Their ability to monetize this content across many platforms — studio, theme park, toys, streaming — is incredibly valuable; thus we remain investors.”14.

Team Depot was created in 1993 as a way of organizing associates who were eager to volunteer in their communities. For 30 years, Team Depot associates have worked side by side with non-profits around the United States. Focus areas include spending time with the elderly and activities with at-risk youth. Team Depot also improves the homes and lives of veterans and helps communities impacted by natural disasters.During the quarter, Home Depot set a goal for battery-powered products to represent over 85% of outdoor lawn equipment sales in the U.S. and Canada by the end of fiscal 2028.

This occurred in the midst of an ongoing strike by workers at two facilities that collectively contribute around 5% of the world's LNG production.

The revenue of $10.89 billion decreased 8.2% year-over-year, yet exceeded market estimates by $160 million. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

(NYSE:GS), one higher than the previous quarter. Boykin Curry’s Eagle Capital Management held a significant position in the company, with 2.8 million shares worth $904.64 million.Manole Capital Management made the following comment about The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Back in 2019, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) made a splash in the card industry by working with Apple and MasterCard on a credit card. The actual card is fairly sleek (as you can see below), as customers' names are etched into an Apple titanium card. The no-fee card generated a lot of hype, as many early users were quick to post their latest card on various social media sites.The initial goal of Marcus (back in 2016) was to leverage Goldman’s wonderful name brand and build a full-service digital bank. This card was a large piece of GS’s ambitions to grow its retail banking franchise called Marcus. After 5 years, Marcus now has 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances. Surprisingly, Marcus now represents nearly 20% of the firm’s total revenue.We thought it would be interesting to look at how the Apple Card is doing in terms of loans and exposures.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the retirement phenomenon within the U.S., and go directly to read the Retirement Stock Portfolio: 5 Low Risk Investments.In 2021, the economy faced persistent challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic's enduring impact. Despite recovery efforts, several significant hurdles created uncertainty regarding the revival. Inflation reached levels not seen in years, supply-chain disruptions hindered economic growth, and a limited labor pool presented ongoing difficulties for employers. This was further complicated by a record number of individuals either changing roles or leaving the workforce. Additionally, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic led to a growing interest in retirement among Americans.Retirees globally are exploring avenues to boost their income through investments due to the highest inflation recorded in nearly four decades. Addressing this concern, the Social Security Administration alleviated the situation by announcing an 8.7% increase in benefits earlier this year to mitigate the impact of inflation, as cited by Bloomberg. With this adjustment, the average retiree benefit has reached $1,827 per month, marking a $146 increase from the previous year. However, given the average annual household expenses for individuals aged 65-74 amounting to approximately $53,000, these social security benefits fall short of covering living costs adequately.Despite the data mentioned earlier, the United States possesses a thriving and robust retirement industry. McKinsey's research indicates that the U.S. retirement market boasts a substantial $26 trillion in assets. This data also forecasts a remarkable shift: by 2030, retirees are expected to contribute more to global consumption than individuals in the working age range of 15 to 59 years in China. Within the retirement industry, the largest segment—Defined Contribution—accounts for approximately 30% of the total assets, totaling around $8 trillion, and generates an impressive $30 billion in revenue for managing firms. This segment oversees approximately 110 million accounts and has shown consistent growth over the past decade.Story continuesLastly, an integral facet of retirement involves the assisted living community sector, commonly known as old age homes. These facilities offer seniors companionship and care during the later stages of their lives. As detailed in a research report by Grand View Market Research, the assisted living industry was valued at around $91.8 billion in 2022 and is anticipated to undergo a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.53% from 2023 to 2030. Within this market, the segment dedicated to individuals aged 85 and above held the largest market share in 2022. Looking towards 2040, the senior population in this age bracket is expected to more than double, rising from 6.4 million in 2016 to an estimated 14.6 million.Shares of prominent companies such as The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are favored by retirees due to their consistent free cash flow and impressive histories of dividend growth. In the following sections, we'll explore additional low-risk stock options suitable for retirement portfolios.Retirement Stock Portfolio: 10 Low Risk InvestmentsPhoto by Max Harlynking on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor our list of the 10 best low-risk stocks for a retirement portfolio, we used a stock screener to come up with a list of stocks with a beta value of less than 1. We further narrowed down this list to include stocks that have a notable history of paying dividends to investors.

CVS has been moving its portfolio to a more value-based outcome model, and Aetna was a major move in that direction. We were willing to accept the leverage that came with the deal because CVS has a very cash generative model, and we anticipated the free cash flow would enable the company to de-lever fairly quickly.By mid-2022, CVS was in a position to use the free cash flow that had been going to debt repayment to do bolt-on deals to further prepare for the value-based outcome model and/or return more cash to shareholders in the form of higher dividends or share repurchases. However, CVS lost a “star” in its largest Medicare plan in late 2022 and this will adversely impact earnings in 2024. This was a surprise and disappointment to us, but management should be able to regain the “star” in the back half of 2023, which will then give the company a nice tailwind in 2025…” (Click here to read the full text)7. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67Dividend Yield as of 12/10: 0.72%Beta Value: 0.78Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) operates an international chain of membership warehouses, mainly under the “Costco Wholesale” name, that carry quality, brand-name merchandise at substantially lower prices than are typically found at conventional wholesale or retail sources.

Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is one of the most prominent stakeholders of the company, with 807,709 shares worth more than $434.8 million.RiverPark Advisors mentioned Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its Q2 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), founded in 1983, is the world’s third-largest retailer with 850 stores, $240 billion in revenue and 68 million members spread across North America, Europe, Asia, and the Southern Pacific Region. The company is known for its strong value proposition driven by high-quality low-cost offerings including a well-regarded private-label brand. Costco regularly ranks at the top of customer surveys related to brand trust, product price and quality, and all-around experience. Historically, 90% of the company’s shoppers renew their memberships, which generate more than 50% of operating income.Through expanding market share, new store openings, increasing member productivity, and omnichannel expansion, we believe the company can grow revenues annually in the high single digit percentage range. This revenue growth should yield steadily growing margins and EPS growth in the low-to-mid-teens, which should drive shareholder returns in the same range.”6. PepsiCo, Inc.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Crown Castle (CCI) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.80 a share six days away from its upcoming earnings release on October 18, 2023.CCI has an Earnings ESP figure of 0.7%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.80 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.78.CCI is one of just a large database of Finance stocks with positive ESPs.

Expressing PD-L1 (CPS ≥1)",Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/merck-receives-positive-eu-chmp-114500494.html,1697197500,STORY,['MRK'],"[Opinion granted based on positive overall survival results from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-859 trialIf approved, a KEYTRUDA combination would become an option in the EU for the treatment of both HER2-negative and HER2-positive advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma in tumorsexpressing PD-L1 (CPS ≥1)RAHWAY, N.J., October 13, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, today announced that the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion recommending approval of KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, in combination with fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing chemotherapy, for the first-line treatment of locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-negative gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma in adults whose tumors express PD-L1 (Combined Positive Score [CPS] ≥1).""This positive CHMP opinion builds on our efforts to treat advanced gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancer in Europe, including in patients with HER2-negative disease, which accounts for the vast majority of gastric cancer cases,"" said Dr. Marjorie Green, senior vice president and head of late-stage oncology, global clinical development, Merck Research Laboratories. ""We look forward to the European Commission’s decision and are excited to potentially provide an immunotherapy regimen to patients in the EU with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-negative gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer, whose tumors express PD-L1 with a combined positive score ≥1.""The recommendation is based on results from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-859 trial in which KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival versus chemotherapy alone in patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 (CPS ≥1). In the study, approximately 80% of patients had tumors which expressed PD-L1 (CPS ≥1). The CHMP’s recommendation will now be reviewed by the European Commission for marketing authorization in the European Union (EU), and a final decision is expected in the fourth quarter of 2023.Story continuesIf approved, this will be the second indication for KEYTRUDA in advanced gastric or GEJ cancer in Europe. In August 2023, KEYTRUDA in combination with trastuzumab, fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing chemotherapy was approved for the first-line treatment of locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma in adults whose tumors express PD-L1 (CPS ≥1) in the EU.Merck has an extensive clinical development program evaluating KEYTRUDA in gastrointestinal cancers and is continuing to study KEYTRUDA for multiple uses in gastric, hepatobiliary, esophageal and colorectal cancers.About gastric cancerGastric (stomach) cancer tends to develop slowly over many years and rarely causes early symptoms, resulting in most patients presenting with advanced stage disease. Overall, more than 70% of patients with gastric cancer develop advanced-stage disease. Most gastric cancers are adenocarcinomas (about 90-95%), which develop from cells in the innermost lining of the stomach (known as the mucosa). More than half of patients with gastric cancer have tumors expressing PD-L1 (CPS ≥1), and the majority of gastric cancers are HER2-negative, affecting approximately four out of every five patients. Gastric cancer is the fifth most diagnosed cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer death worldwide, with approximately 1.1 million patients diagnosed and 768,000 patient deaths from the disease globally in 2020. In Europe, it is estimated there were approximately 136,000 patients diagnosed with gastric cancer and 97,000 patient deaths from the disease in 2020. The five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with gastric cancer at an advanced stage is only 6%.About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD- L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.Gastric CancerKEYTRUDA, in combination with trastuzumab, fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma.In May 2021, KEYTRUDA was approved in combination with trastuzumab, fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma in the U.S. This indication was approved by the FDA under accelerated approval based on ORR data from KEYNOTE-811, and continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. Merck is working with the FDA to update this indication to patients whose tumors are PD-L1 positive.See additional selected KEYTRUDA indications in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety Information.Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDASevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.Pneumonitis occurred in 7% (41/580) of adult patients with resected NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent for adjuvant treatment of NSCLC, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution.Immune-Mediated ColitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated HepatitisKEYTRUDA as a Single AgentKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.KEYTRUDA With AxitinibKEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT ≥3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event.Immune-Mediated EndocrinopathiesAdrenal InsufficiencyKEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 77% (17/22) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.3% (8) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.HypophysitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis.

All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Nephritis resolved in 56% of the 9 patients.Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, has occurred with anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate nonexfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% (38/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (1%) and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 40% (15/38) of patients. These reactions led to permanent discontinuation in 0.1% (2) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.6% (16) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 6% had recurrence. The reactions resolved in 79% of the 38 patients.Other Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsThe following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of &lt;1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received KEYTRUDA or were reported with the use of other anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection.Infusion-Related ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple MyelomaIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.Embryofetal ToxicityBased on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.Adverse ReactionsIn KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%).

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on stock market performance overall, head directly to 5 Worst Performing Dow Stocks YTD.In a July report by J.P. Morgan, it was stated that global economic growth is expected to slow down in the latter part of 2023, while inflation appears to be easing. However, it's worth noting that global core inflation is projected to remain elevated, staying above 3% until 2024. This ongoing high inflation will continue to exert pressure on central banks, potentially leading to further tightening measures. Bruce Kasman, Chief Global Economist at J.P. Morgan, said:“We do not think inflation is going to come back down to central bank comfort zones by themselves. Yes, there’s a decline going on. But no, we do not think you’re going to get inflation back below 3% in the U.S. or the euro area this year in an environment where supply has been damaged in a more lasting way and inflation psychology has shifted.”In the first half of 2023, global economic growth gained momentum, reaching a rate of 2.8%. So far, efforts to tighten monetary policies have balanced the diminishing impact of supply disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, starting in 2022, global policy rates have increased by nearly 400 basis points, affecting spending sensitive to interest rates and limiting industrial production. Despite the current growth momentum, it is believed that the global economy's resilience is decreasing. Consequently, it is expected that developed markets may undergo another round of tightening measures before the end of 2023 to control inflation. However, such actions may have adverse effects on the private sector's well-being. Consequently, there is a possibility of a synchronized global economic recession occurring, potentially before the end of 2024. J.P. Morgan Research anticipates that the United States may experience a mild recession toward the end of 2023. This is attributed to the Federal Reserve's conservative monetary policy, which is leading to stricter credit availability and a gradual decline in economic growth. The Western European economy faced challenges during the winter due to high energy prices. Although the first quarter of 2023 showed some improvement, overall economic growth remained relatively stagnant.Story continuesIn the first six months of 2023, there was a noticeable variance in stock performance, with differences observed in size, sectors, and investment styles. Surprisingly, this occurred amidst an unusual period of low volatility. Looking ahead, without any proactive measures from the Federal Reserve, experts expect a more difficult economic environment for stocks in the latter part of 2023. A similar less optimistic outlook is observed for equity markets in other regions across the world. Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, Global Head of Equity Macro Strategy at J.P. Morgan, stated:“Given that multiple expansion has been the main driver of performance year to date, we see unattractive risk-reward for equities and increasing investor complacency ahead of our expectation that the business cycle will further decelerate in the second half of the year, with the onset of a recession likely in the fourth quarter of 2023 or first quarter of 2024. What’s more, consumers are starting to show signs of weakness, and there is a risk that liquidity and credit conditions could tighten in the coming months.”According to S&amp;P Global, the Dow Jones Industrial Average showed improvement in September, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 but still experiencing a decline of 3.5%; -3.42% with dividends considered. However, when we consider the year-to-date performance, the Dow has lagged significantly behind the S&amp;P 500, with a gain of 1.09%;  2.73% with dividends, while the S&amp;P 500 has recorded an increase of 11.68%. This difference in performance is primarily attributed to how these indices are constructed, with factors like price weighting versus market value weighting playing a role. Historically, these differences tend to align, but in shorter time frames, disparities can emerge.In this article, we discuss some of the worst performing Dow stocks which include Verizon Communications Inc.

Disney’s Bob Iger returned to the CEO’s seat in November 2022, replacing Bob Chapek, who left following a turbulent tenure. As a result of disappointing quarterly results and incremental commentary suggesting a more inline strategy with other media, the market has become less confident that Iger will achieve a turnaround by the end of his 1.5- year contract. We continue to believe Disney has a unique collection of assets and owns some of the best content among all media companies. Their ability to monetize this content across many platforms — studio, theme park, toys, streaming — is incredibly valuable; thus we remain investors.”14.

The actual card is fairly sleek (as you can see below), as customers' names are etched into an Apple titanium card. The no-fee card generated a lot of hype, as many early users were quick to post their latest card on various social media sites.The initial goal of Marcus (back in 2016) was to leverage Goldman’s wonderful name brand and build a full-service digital bank. This card was a large piece of GS’s ambitions to grow its retail banking franchise called Marcus. After 5 years, Marcus now has 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances. Surprisingly, Marcus now represents nearly 20% of the firm’s total revenue.We thought it would be interesting to look at how the Apple Card is doing in terms of loans and exposures.

If you want to skip our discussion on the overall environmental conditions in the US, you can go directly to the 5 US Cities with Cleanest Air and Water.According to IQAir US, the air quality in the United States was rated as ""good"" compared to other countries in 2022. The US Air Quality Index (AQI) was recorded at 37, positioning it 99th out of 131 countries in the global ranking. The air quality challenges are not uniform within the United States itself. Some US cities, like Bellingham, enjoy air quality on par with the cities with the best air quality in the world. On the other hand, there are some US cities with the worst air quality, often due to specific regional challenges. For instance, the release of soot from wildfires in California often results in extremely hazardous air quality conditions in the area. Tragically, in 2020, these wildfires led to approximately 1,200 deaths and caused 4,800 emergency room visits due to breathing difficulties. Due to the severity of this issue, efforts are being made to control the harmful impact of wildfires, with an allocation of $1 billion for fire management as of 2021. Meanwhile, reports have brought to light concerns regarding Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) industrial facility located in Pennsylvania, which holds the distinction of being permitted as the second-largest emitter of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In September 2022, even before regular operations began, the plant emitted a significant 510.89 tons of VOCs, alarmingly close to its annual limit of 516.2 tons. Furthermore, in subsequent months, the plant consistently exceeded its 12-month permit limits, indicating a pattern of emissions surpassing legal allowances. While economic growth in sectors such as fossil fuels and agriculture can have positive effects on the economy, this development often comes at the cost of increased air pollution.

Moreover, over 3.5 million Americans experience health issues such as skin rashes, respiratory infections, and hepatitis due to exposure to contaminated coastal waters every year. A study by the US Geological Survey revealed that nearly half of the United States tap water may contain traces of chemicals, commonly referred to as “forever chemicals.” The actual concentration level may even be higher as the study only looked at 32 per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS), while the National Institutes of Health has identified over 12,000 PFAS. These chemicals have been linked with diseases like liver damage, cancer, and high cholesterol. The increase in water-borne diseases has also led multiple healthcare companies like Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) to invest more in their drug pipelines.Many companies are actively taking steps to eliminate or reduce their contributions to air and water pollution. This reflects a growing awareness of the importance of environmental sustainability and responsible business practices. For instance, Ikea, one of the leading home furnishings retailers, has undertaken many initiatives to combat air pollution over the years. Notably, as a co-founder of the Alliance for Clean Air, Ikea plays an active role in initiatives aimed at enhancing air quality. The company has also launched the ""Better Air Now"" program, which aims to utilize rice straw residue for both packaging materials and bioenergy production. Similarly, in 2022, Adidas partnered with Parley to combat water pollution. They produced 15 million pairs of shoes from recycled coastal plastic waste and aimed to increase production to 17 million pairs in 2021.25 US Cities with Cleanest Air and Watervovan/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyTo shortlist the 25 US cities with cleanest air and water, we referred to multiple reputable sources, such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the American Lung Association, and the Consumer Confidence Reports (CCR) database.

WMB emerged victorious on Tuesday in its dispute over the failed $33-billion merger with Energy Transfer LP ET after a prolonged seven-year legal struggle. The Delaware Supreme Court delivered a verdict, affirming WMB's $495-million court victory and dismissing Energy Transfer's challenge.The court's decision sided with Williams and endorsed a string of earlier judgments that placed the responsibility for the collapsed merger on Energy Transfer, which walked away from the agreement in 2016.Justice N. Christopher Griffiths upheld Glasscock's rulings from the Delaware Chancery Court, which granted Williams $410 million in damages and $85 million in legal fees. Additionally, the state's highest court supported Glasscock's dismissal of Energy Transfer's $1.48 billion breakup fee proposal.The decision was concurred by chief justice Collins J. Seitz Jr. and justices Abigail M. LeGrow, Karen L. Valihura and Gary F. Traynor. Williams was represented by Morris, Nichols, Arsht &amp; Tunnell LLP and Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore LLP, while Energy Transfer was represented by Young Conaway Stargatt &amp; Taylor LLP and Clement &amp; Murphy PLLC.This landmark judgment not only brings closure to a protracted legal battle but also solidifies WMB's position in the energy sector. Both Williams and Energy Transfer have yet to release official statements regarding the court's final ruling, but the impact of this decision is expected to have far-reaching implications in the corporate landscape.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, Williams carries a Zack Rank #3 (Hold).A couple of better-ranked stocks in the energy sector are Matador Resources Company MTDR and Pioneer Natural Resources Company PXD, each currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The program is used to conduct intelligence gathering for expeditionary marine countermeasure missions.Details of the DealValued at $347 million, the contract entails manufacturing up to 200 vehicles over the next five years. The award has been provided by the Naval Sea Systems Command.Per the terms of the deal, Huntington Ingalls will deliver these next-generation SUUVs to the U.S. Navy, along with providing afloat and auxiliary support equipment and engineering services for the same.What’s Supporting Huntington Ingalls?Huntington Ingalls is a prominent manufacturer of unmanned undersea vehicles (“UUV”) worldwide. Serving customers in more than 30 countries, HII provides design, autonomy, manufacturing, testing, operations and sustainment of unmanned systems, including UUVs and unmanned surface vessels (USV).Its REMUS family of UUVs are low logistics UUV that can be rapidly deployed from any vessel of opportunity, with their common usage in mine countermeasures, search and recovery and antisubmarine warfare.Notably, the U.S. Navy’s Lionfish System is based on HII's REMUS 300 UUV and is a highly portable, two-person SUUV with an open architecture design and versatile payload options. In early 2022, REMUS 300 was chosen as the Navy's official program of record for the next-generation SUUV.The aforementioned discussion surely reflects the proven expertise of HII in the UUV space that is likely to have led to a steady inflow of contracts for the company, like the latest one. This, in turn, should bolster its revenue generation prospects from the UUV product line.Growth ProspectusThe recent tiff between Ukraine and Russia has led other nations to strengthen their defense landscape to deter any war-like situation. In this context, it is imperative to mention that UUVs are noted for their ability to carry out dangerous maritime operations, such as mine countermeasure missions and harbor patrol. Therefore, as investments in undersea warfare capabilities have recently increased manifold, so has the demand for state-of-the-art UUVs.Story continuesLooking ahead, with technological advancement, nations are more rapidly adopting artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to increase the autonomy of UUVs. As a result, hefty investments in developing and acquiring autonomous marine systems can be expected in the coming days, thereby boosting the UUV market. To this end, the Fortune Business Insights firm projects the global unmanned underwater vehicles market to witness a CAGR of 13.5% during 2023-2030.Such growth trends should boost Huntington Ingalls along with other defense primes like Boeing BA, General Dynamics GD and Lockheed Martin LMT, which have a strong presence in the unmanned underwater vehicle market.Boeing’s Echo Voyager is a fully autonomous XLUUV class UUV that can be used for various missions, which were previously impossible due to traditional UUV limitations.Boeing’s long-term earnings growth rate is 4%. BA’s shares appreciated 48.1% in the past year.General Dynamics’ Bluefin SandShark is a one-person-portable, low-cost, autonomous unmanned underwater vehicle designed to leverage today’s miniaturized sensors and emerge as the development platform for the next generation.General Dynamics boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.2%. GD’s shares rallied 3.8% in the past year.Lockheed has more than four decades of experience developing unmanned and robotic systems for the sea. Notably, LMT’s Marlin autonomous underwater vehicle system offers a range of civilian and military customers and a quick and safe way to conduct subsea surveys and inspections.Lockheed’s long-term earnings growth rate is 8.4%. LMT’s shares rose 7.6% in the past year.Price MovementShares of HII have rallied 4.2% in the past six months against the industry’s decline of 12.6%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankHuntington Ingalls currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(Image: Boeing)Boeing's second ecoDemonstrator Explorer, a 737-10 destined for United Airlines, will fly with 100% SAF and conventional jet fuel in separate tanks and alternate fuels during testing. NASA's DC-8 Airborne Science Lab will fly behind the commercial jet and measure emissions produced by each type of fuel and contrail ice particles. NASA satellites will capture images of contrail formation as part of the testing.The researchers aim to understand how advanced fuels, engine combustor designs and other technologies may reduce atmospheric warming. For example, tests will assess how SAF affects the characteristics of contrails, the persistent condensation trails produced when airplanes fly through cold, humid air. While their full impact is not yet understood, some research has suggested certain contrails can trap heat in the atmosphere.World Energy is supplying SAF for the tests from its Paramount, Calif., facility. Additional support includes:U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is providing funding through the ASCENT Center of ExcellenceGE Aerospace is providing technical expertise and project fundingGerman Aerospace Center (Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt or DLR) is providing experts and instrumentationThe project is the latest phase in a multi-year partnership between Boeing and NASA to analyze how SAF can reduce emissions and enable other environmental benefits. Compared to conventional jet fuel, SAF – made from a range of sustainably produced feedstocks – can reduce emissions by up to 85% over the fuel's life cycle and offers the greatest potential to reduce aviation CO2 over the next 30 years. SAF also produces less soot which can improve air quality near airports.Story continuesWhat the test partners are saying:""We are honored to collaborate with NASA, United Airlines, and other valued partners on research that will strengthen the industry's understanding of the benefits of SAF beyond reducing carbon emissions,"" said Boeing Chief Sustainability Officer Chris Raymond. ""We've solved hard problems before, and if we continue to take meaningful actions, I'm confident we'll achieve a more sustainable aerospace future, together.""""Flight testing is complex and resource-intensive, yet it's the gold standard for understanding how sustainable aerospace innovations affect changes in contrails and climate,"" says Rich Wahls, NASA mission integration manager for the Sustainable Flight National Partnership. ""This is why we're bringing NASA's DC-8 to bear on this collaboration, where the valuable flight data will improve our predictive models.""""This collaboration between Boeing, NASA and United has the potential to not only help us better understand contrails but to provide the full scope of what our transition to SAF can provide beyond greenhouse-gas reductions,"" said United Chief Sustainability Officer Lauren Riley.""We at GE Aerospace proudly support this groundbreaking research collaboration that will deepen our scientific understanding of the impact of SAF on emissions for a more sustainable future of flight,"" said GE Aerospace Vice President of Engineering Mohamed Ali.""To achieve climate-compatible aviation, we need close international cooperation. The German Aerospace Center has decades of experience in research on the climate impact of the entire aviation system by advancing measurement technology and simulations,"" says Markus Fischer, DLR Divisional Board Member for Aeronautics. ""The continuation of transatlantic cooperation now finds a new summit and underlines the international commitment to reduce the climate impact from aviation's CO2 and non-CO2 effects.""The Boeing ecoDemonstrator program was expanded this year to include Explorer airplanes focused on short-term, specific test projects.

The grant will provide 1008 samples of the Infinium™ Global Diversity Array with Polygenic Risk Score Content plus Illumina Polygenic Risk Score software-Predict module to generate polygenic risk scores (PRS) for pain and opioid use disorder.""Polygenic risk scores represent a person's relative genetic liability for a behavior, disease, or psychiatric disorder, and are created using summary results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS),"" says Johnson. ""In this case, we're interested in using the results from GWAS for chronic pain and opioid use disorder-which have identified genetic variations between people who experience either chronic pain or opioid use disorder and those who don't-and using that data to create polygenic risk scores in a unique and diverse cohort.""The contest received submissions from noteworthy research groups in nine different countries spanning North and South America, Europe, and Asia. Each entry was judged on novelty, feasibility, scientific merit, potential impact on human health, and the authors' previous accomplishments.While chronic pain and opioid use are known to be genetically correlated, previous GWAS never investigated these disorders simultaneously in carefully characterized groups. Instead, the studies focused on the causal relationship between them.Johnson and collaborator Simon Haroutounian, PhD, chief of the Division of Clinical and Translational Research and chief of Clinical Pain Research at Washington University Pain Center, wondered if genetic factors might influence that relationship. For example, different genetics might affect the reward processes that govern how people perceive pain or respond to opioids.Story continues""Dr. Haroutounian has been studying a unique cohort with deep clinical phenotyping for chronic pain, opioid use, and opioid craving, as well as symptoms of depression and anxiety,"" says Johnson. ""Also, the DNA has already been extracted from this diverse group of 1500 samples. Winning this contest will allow us to genotype just over a thousand of those samples. Then we'll use Illumina's PRS software with the Predict module to create scores for chronic pain and opioid use disorder.""In addition, the team, which also includes collaborator Arpana Agrawal, PhD, will perform a cross-trait multivariate genome-wide study to look at potential genetic factors that are shared across chronic pain and opioid use disorder. From there, they can link these PRS to baseline preoperative pain and acute and chronic postoperative pain, as well as anxiety, depression, pain ratings, and analgesic craving.""This was the perfect opportunity to genotype this unique cohort to better understand the relationship between chronic pain, substance use, and other psychosocial factors,"" says Johnson. ""We hope this work will improve the management and treatment of chronic postsurgical pain, eventually giving clinicians a better tool to identify patients who might be at greater risk of developing an opioid use disorder alongside their chronic pain.""The Illumina Polygenic Risk Scores Research Grant was launched to recognize researchers who can drive advances in genetic risk prediction. Although PRS can impact complex disease research and healthcare in various ways, unraveling the complexities of the genome using the full potential of PRS-based research remains a developing field that is rich with opportunities for scientific advancements.

This will take the dividend yield to an attractive 1.9%, providing a nice boost to shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for TE Connectivity TE Connectivity's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. However, TE Connectivity's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 35.4% over the next year. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 28% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendTE Connectivity Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.84 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.36. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 11% per annum over that time. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. TE Connectivity has impressed us by growing EPS at 14% per year over the past five years. A low payout ratio and decent growth suggests that the company is reinvesting well, and it also has plenty of room to increase the dividend over time.TE Connectivity Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. Earnings growth generally bodes well for the future value of company dividend payments.

You can skip our detailed analysis of passive income ideas and dividend stocks, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks For Passive Income. Passive income is becoming increasingly popular among people from diverse backgrounds. It's an appealing idea, especially with the current economic uncertainty, and it's capturing the attention of investors more than ever. According to a survey by LendingClub Corp. and Pymnts.com conducted in March this year, nearly half of working people have a side job or another source of extra income, like selling handmade items. Surprisingly, it's not just those with lower income; even people making $100,000 a year often seek additional income to cover their expenses. The report also mentioned that consumers could be collecting over $50 billion in total every month from their extra earnings, and a significant part of this money might not be reported to tax authorities.Passive income often arises from investments, assets, or activities that need very little ongoing work after they are established. Passive exchange-traded funds, that aim to replicate the performance of a specific market index or asset class, are important in this regard. In one of our articles, we referred to James Seyffart’s statement from Bloomberg Intelligence, who mentioned that passive investing is steadily on the rise in the US. Currently, passive mutual funds and ETFs own around 19% of the average publicly traded U.S. stock, which is three times higher than it was in 2013.Investing in dividend stocks is also one of the most reliable ways to generate passive income. Dividend-paying stocks help investors receive regular dividend payments, typically on a quarterly basis, without having to actively work or make ongoing investments. This income can provide a steady cash flow, making it a reliable source of passive income. In addition to this, dividend stocks have significantly contributed to the market’s overall returns. Between 2013 and 2022, dividends accounted for 17% of the overall returns in the S&amp;P 500 Index. But if we consider a much longer period, going back to the 1930s, dividends contributed to 37% of the returns.Story continuesThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the best dividend stocks as these companies have been raising their payouts year after year. To create passive income, it's vital that dividends consistently increase over time. In this article, we will further discuss dividend stocks to earn passive income.12 Best Dividend Stocks For Passive IncomePhoto by Sharon McCutcheon on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of Q2 2023 and picked companies that have raised their dividends for at least 10 consecutive years or more. From that list, we narrowed down our options to companies with strong financial positions and steady cash flow, indicating reliable future dividends for generating passive income. We then sorted these companies in ascending order based on the number of funds that hold stakes in them as of the second quarter of 2023.12. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is an American multinational telecommunications and media conglomerate. The company is also one of the largest cable television and broadband internet service providers in the country.In the second quarter of 2023, Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) reported revenue of $30.5 billion, which showed a 1.6% growth from the same period last year. The company's operating cash flow for the quarter came in at roughly $7.3 billion and its free cash flow amounted to $3.4 billion. It also returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends during the quarter, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks for passive income.The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some other reliable options for generating passive income.Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) has raised its dividends for 15 years in a row. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.29 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.65%, as of October 12.At the end of Q2 2023, 66 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database reported having stakes in Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), down from 68 a quarter earlier. The consolidated value of these stakes is over $3.14 billion.ClearBridge Investments mentioned Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) in its Q3 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Long-term holdings Charter and Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) delivered strong second-quarter results relative to expectations; their stable recurring revenue streams and undemanding valuations were rewarded in the current environment. Cable multiples compressed over the past 24 months on fears of heightened competition in their core broadband business from fixed wireless and fiber providers. While fiber remains a competitive alternative to cable broadband over the long term, high upfront investments and a materially higher cost of capital are resulting in slower buildouts than previously expected. Fixed wireless also continues to gain traction, particularly in rural markets, but share gains also appear to be moderating. At the same time, both Comcast and Charter are expanding their footprints into rural and adjacent markets while gaining wireless market share, leveraging their mobile virtual network operator agreements with Verizon. We think both cable companies are well-positioned to continue to grow while generating substantial free cash flows. We added to Comcast during the quarter.”11. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is a well-known American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of membership-based warehouse clubs.

To that point, Adidas’ fiscal 2023 earnings estimates have climbed over the last quarter as the company continues to put its inventory concerns behind it following the fallout with its fashion collaborator Kanye West.Adidas’ FY23 earnings estimates are now expected at an adjusted loss of -$0.58 per share compared to estimates of -$1.58 a share 90 days ago. Plus, FY24 earnings estimates are still up 4% in the last 60 days to $1.93 per share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs for Nike, its bottom line remains ahead of its rival Adidas but the trend of earnings estimate revisions is less compelling.

OPRX shares soared 13% in the last trading session to close at $8.08. The move was backed by solid volume with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This compares to the stock's 8.9% loss over the past four weeks.The increase in share price can be attributed to the announcement of the acquisition of Medicx Health by OptimizeRx. Medicx Health is a consumer-focused omnichannel marketing and analytics company.The acquisition of Medicx Health technology and analytics solutions is likely to aid OptimizeRx in gaining a larger share in life science commercial digital budgets, which is forecast to grow 15% to 20% per year.OptimizeRx will be paying $95 million as total consideration for the acquisition, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2023. Notably, some members of Medicx Health’s management plan to invest $10.5 million of their proceeds into the company’s common stock.OptimizeRx noted that the consolidated revenue run rate will increase to nearly $100 million and the acquisition is anticipated to be immediately accretive to earnings.For the third quarter, OptimizeRx expects revenues ""to come in ahead of consensus"" and in the range of $15.2-$15.5 million. The top-line performance is driven by strong organic revenue growth, added the company.This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.01 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -85.7%. Revenues are expected to be $14.24 million, down 5.6% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.For OptimizeRx Corp., the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. And a stock's price usually doesn't keep moving higher in the absence of any trend in earnings estimate revisions. So, make sure to keep an eye on OPRX going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.Story continuesThe stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

For example, Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) reduced dividends during the 2008 financial crisis and in 2015, but its trend has been upward over the long term. A dividend cut alone shouldn't be an immediate signal to sell your shares in a company.

According to Janus Henderson, global dividends did better than expected in the second quarter. The total payout hit a new record of $568.1 billion, up 4.9% from the previous year. The real growth was 6.3% excluding special dividends, which was faster than the first quarter. Europe's strong dividend performance played a significant role in this.The report also mentioned that the dividend growth in the US slowed down in the second quarter. The total dividend payment of $148.0 billion increased by a modest 2.6% compared to the previous year. When considering the special, one-off dividends, the actual growth rate was 4.6%.

Its revenue of $40.7 billion was up 21%. Its net income and revenue beat Wall Street expectations.CEO Jamie Dimon said in a release that US consumers and businesses ""generally remain healthy"" but noted a number of economic risks, including the possibility that inflation remains elevated and interest rates continue to rise.Wars in Ukraine and Israel, he added, could also impact energy, food markets, global trade and geopolitical relationships.""This may be the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades,"" he said.JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) (Drew Angerer via Getty Images)Profits at Wells Fargo were up 61% from a year ago and 2% at Citigroup. Profits fell at a regional bank, PNC (PNC), a sign that smaller lenders are having a tougher time churning out higher results.The stocks of JPM, Citigroup and Wells Fargo were all higher Friday morning, while PNC fell.The results kicked off a closely watched earnings season where banks of all sizes will be trying to show how they are navigating an extended period of high interest rates that is proving to be one of the most challenging for the industry since the 2008 financial crisis.JPMorgan demonstrated its dominance during the chaos of the spring by winning a government-run auction to purchase the bulk of operations of First Republic after regulators seized the San Francisco lender.First Republic was one of three sizable regional banks to fail, along with Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Their seizures triggered a panic in the banking system and outflows of depositors from a number of smaller banks.A focus for many investors in the coming weeks will be what banks say about a key measure of profitability known as net interest income, which measures the difference between what banks earn on their loans and pay for deposits.Story continuesJPMorgan's net interest income of $22.9 billion beat expectations. It was up 5% from the last quarter and 30% jump from the same period a year ago. Excluding its purchase of First Republic, the figure was up 21%.It also raised expectations for full year net interest income to between $88.5-$89 billion.Wells Fargo’s net interest income topped Wall Street expectations and it also raised its full-year guidance.Citigroup also showed improvement in its investment-banking fees, which were up 34% from a year ago. That bodes well for some other giant banks such as Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) that are heavily reliant on dealmaking for their revenues.JPMorgan’s investment-banking fees were down 3% from a year ago but up 10% from the second quarter.These giant banks are certainly not immune from some of the challenges roiling the industry. JPMorgan took $1.5 billion in write-offs for bad loans this quarter, more than double the amount compared to the year ago period.That is a sign that consumers and businesses are having more problems paying their debts.However, the bank also set aside less to cover future loan losses, a sign that it may have more confidence about the future.Another challenge that JPMorgan noted Friday was how it will be affected by a new set of capital requirements recently proposed by US regulators. It said that the new rules will increased the amount of capital it will have to set aside by 25%, or $500 billion.That is higher than the 19% regulators said would likely apply to the largest banks. That 19%, the bank said in a presentation, ""does not tell the full story"" and it believes that ""increases of this magnitude are not warranted.""""There is a lot that does not make sense to us,"" JPMorgan CFO Jeremy Barnum told analysts Friday.David Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking and crypto.Click here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

The swiftest tightening of U.S. monetary policy in 40 years aimed at reining in sticky inflation has buoyed banks' interest income. Federal Reserve officials have said monetary policy will need to stay restrictive for a longer period to bring inflation back down to its 2% target but are debating whether another hike is needed this year. Wells Fargo said net interest income climbed 8% to $13.1 billion in the third quarter. The bank authorized a new share buyback program of up to $30 billion in July in a show of confidence. Still, Wells Fargo is working to fix a six-year-old scandal over sales practices that led to hefty fines and an asset cap imposed by the Fed. Net income climbed to $5.77 billion, or $1.48 per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, from $3.59 billion, or 86 cents per share, a year earlier, the bank reported on Friday.

Several patients see a relapse after stopping treatment, making it an area of unmet need that drugmakers can tap into.Pfizer's Elrexfio, or elranatamab, is administered under the skin and belongs to a class of therapies known as bispecific antibodies, which help the body's immune system kill cancerous cells.In August, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval for the therapy.(Reporting by Eva Mathews in Bengaluru; Editing by Devika Syamnath)]"

If you want to skip our discussion on the overall environmental conditions in the US, you can go directly to the 5 US Cities with Cleanest Air and Water.According to IQAir US, the air quality in the United States was rated as ""good"" compared to other countries in 2022. The US Air Quality Index (AQI) was recorded at 37, positioning it 99th out of 131 countries in the global ranking. The air quality challenges are not uniform within the United States itself. Some US cities, like Bellingham, enjoy air quality on par with the cities with the best air quality in the world. On the other hand, there are some US cities with the worst air quality, often due to specific regional challenges. For instance, the release of soot from wildfires in California often results in extremely hazardous air quality conditions in the area. Tragically, in 2020, these wildfires led to approximately 1,200 deaths and caused 4,800 emergency room visits due to breathing difficulties. Due to the severity of this issue, efforts are being made to control the harmful impact of wildfires, with an allocation of $1 billion for fire management as of 2021. Meanwhile, reports have brought to light concerns regarding Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) industrial facility located in Pennsylvania, which holds the distinction of being permitted as the second-largest emitter of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In September 2022, even before regular operations began, the plant emitted a significant 510.89 tons of VOCs, alarmingly close to its annual limit of 516.2 tons. Furthermore, in subsequent months, the plant consistently exceeded its 12-month permit limits, indicating a pattern of emissions surpassing legal allowances. While economic growth in sectors such as fossil fuels and agriculture can have positive effects on the economy, this development often comes at the cost of increased air pollution.

Moreover, over 3.5 million Americans experience health issues such as skin rashes, respiratory infections, and hepatitis due to exposure to contaminated coastal waters every year. A study by the US Geological Survey revealed that nearly half of the United States tap water may contain traces of chemicals, commonly referred to as “forever chemicals.” The actual concentration level may even be higher as the study only looked at 32 per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS), while the National Institutes of Health has identified over 12,000 PFAS. These chemicals have been linked with diseases like liver damage, cancer, and high cholesterol. The increase in water-borne diseases has also led multiple healthcare companies like Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) to invest more in their drug pipelines.Many companies are actively taking steps to eliminate or reduce their contributions to air and water pollution. This reflects a growing awareness of the importance of environmental sustainability and responsible business practices. For instance, Ikea, one of the leading home furnishings retailers, has undertaken many initiatives to combat air pollution over the years. Notably, as a co-founder of the Alliance for Clean Air, Ikea plays an active role in initiatives aimed at enhancing air quality. The company has also launched the ""Better Air Now"" program, which aims to utilize rice straw residue for both packaging materials and bioenergy production. Similarly, in 2022, Adidas partnered with Parley to combat water pollution. They produced 15 million pairs of shoes from recycled coastal plastic waste and aimed to increase production to 17 million pairs in 2021.25 US Cities with Cleanest Air and Watervovan/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyTo shortlist the 25 US cities with cleanest air and water, we referred to multiple reputable sources, such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the American Lung Association, and the Consumer Confidence Reports (CCR) database. The primary metric for shortlisting these cities was the American Lung Association’s year-round particle pollution data. The cities have been ranked in descending order of their pollution levels as of 2021. The water quality scores have been obtained from the EPA's Safe Drinking Water Information System and CCR database. For cities with no water quality score, we referred to individual city reports to get information regarding compliance with health standards. With this context in mind, let's take a look at the air and water quality by city in the USA.US Cities with Cleanest Air and Water25.

Strong portfolio performance, strength in both business units, and the continued momentum in Coors Light and Miller Lite in the United States bode well.This led to sales growth of 12% to $3,267 million in second-quarter 2023. On a constant-currency basis, net sales rose 12.1%, driven by a favorable price and sales mix, and higher financial volume. Net sales per hectoliter increased 8.7% on a reported basis and 9% on a constant-currency basis, driven by strong net pricing, and a favorable sales mix stemming from the premiumization and geographic mix.Molson Coors’ worldwide brand volumes rose 5% to 22.8 million, driven by strength in America, partially offset by the sluggishness in EMEA &amp; APAC. Financial volumes advanced 2.8% to 23.4 million hectoliters due to higher volumes in the Americas, partly offset by increased EMEA &amp; APAC volumes. Also, adjusted earnings of $1.78 per share jumped 50% year over year.We note that shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 24.9% in the past year compared with the industry’s growth of 0.3%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Analysts also seem optimistic about the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Molson Coors’ fiscal 2023 sales and EPS is pegged at $11.7 billion and $5.06, suggesting respective growth of 9.2% and 23.4% from the year-ago reported figures. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TAP’s 2023 earnings for the current financial year has inched up by a penny in the past 30 days.Other Strategic EffortsMolson Coors is on track with its revitalization plan focused on achieving sustainable top-line growth by streamlining the organization and reinvesting resources into its brands and capabilities. The company intends to invest in iconic brands and growth opportunities in the above-premium beer space, and expand in adjacencies and beyond beer. Additionally, the company’s cost-saving program announced in 2020 targets $600 million over three years.It is also building on the strength of its iconic core brands. Strength in Coors Light, Miller Lite and Coors Banquet together resulted in total industry share growth in the United States, driven by brand positionings and better marketing. Molson Canadian and Carling beer in the U.K., and national champion brands witnessed significant market share gains.Molson Coors is one of the largest brewers in the world and boasts a strong portfolio of well-established brands. The company is committed to growing its market share through innovation and premiumization. With a view to accelerating portfolio premiumization, it has been aggressively growing its above-premium portfolio in the past few years.The company is making efforts to change the shape of its product portfolio and expand in growth areas. Its U.S. above-premium portfolio witnessed sales that outpaced its U.S. economy portfolio, driven by rapid growth of its hard seltzers, the launch of Simply Spiked Lemonade, and the continued strength in Blue Moon and Peroni’s.Driven by these factors, management has raised the 2023 view on strength in core brands in the United States. The company intends to increase investment in C-store shopper marketing in the second half of this year. Also, favorable volume leverage is expected to partly offset cost increases. This, along with premiumization and lower contract brewing volumes, is anticipated to drive the gross margin expansion for the year.Net sales are projected to grow year over year in the high-single digits on a constant-currency basis, up from the prior mentioned low-single-digit growth. This will be backed by sturdy demand in the United States, with growth in rates and volumes. Underlying EBT is likely to grow 23-26% year over year compared with the earlier stated low-single-digit growth on a constant-currency basis.Story continuesOther Side of the StoryDespite such upsides, not all is good in the hood for Molson Coors. The company continues to witness softness in the beer industry. Also, inflationary pressures are likely to be headwinds.Molson Coors has been witnessing weakened consumer demand across the beer industry due to pricing actions. Although management raised the view for 2023, it highlighted the softness in the beer industry and caution around the consumer. The company’s business in the EMEA and APAC is likely to continue witnessing relatively high inflationary pressures.Management expects another headwind in relation to the large US contract brewing agreement. The agreement has started to wind down ahead of its termination at the end of 2024. Hence, it anticipates volume declines under this contract to be higher in the fourth quarter, with an impact of 2-3% of America's financial volume.The company has been affected by cost inflation related to materials and manufacturing expenses, and an unfavorable mix. Cost inflation drove an 80% rise in higher material and manufacturing costs. Management anticipates inflation impacts on cost of goods sold for 2023.Underlying MG&amp;A expenses are projected to be $100 million higher in the second half than that reported in the first half. The same indicates a year-over-year rise of 15%. This will be driven by elevated marketing spend, which is likely to be up $100 million, coupled with increased people-related costs.ConclusionWe believe brand strength, product innovation, the premiumization of its global portfolio and the revitalization plan will offset cost woes and drive growth for Molson Coors.The PEG ratio for Molson Coors is just 1.36, lower than the industry average of 1.82. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, TAP is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles. Topping it, a VGM Score of A raises optimism in the stock.Stocks to ConsiderFlowers Foods FLO emphasizes providing high-quality baked items. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Auto Workers are now setting up picket lines at the company's Kentucky truck plant, it's largest manufacturing facility. The plant is responsible for producing several top-selling Ford models, over $25 billion in annual revenue. Morningstar U.S. Autos Equity Analyst, David Whiston, joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the potential blowback from a prolonged strike, and whether or not any progress is being made in negotiations.""There's so much ramifications, not just in the auto supply chain but throughout the whole broader U.S economy."" Whiston tells Yahoo Finance.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]JOSH LIPTON: The United Auto Workers union expanding its strike again, this time hitting Ford's biggest truck-building plant in Kentucky. It is the automaker's most profitable plant bringing in around $25 billion each year. Analysts have previously said the strike hasn't been that concerning because truck plants have been spared until now.David Whiston, autos equity strategist and Morningstar Research joins us now. So David, let me ask you, this feels like a fairly significant escalation here. Is this how you saw it?DAVID WHISTON: Yes, definitely. This is basically with the Detroit 3, it's all about full-size SUVs and pickup trucks. And with Kentucky Truck, you're really going after both because you're getting part of the F-Series franchise with the Super Duty production, and then also expedition, and Lincoln Navigator. Probably not a surprise given the last week the UAW said they were on the verge of striking GM Arlington, Texas where they make all their full-size SUVs. So unfortunately, there's probably more to come on this as soon as tomorrow.JULIE HYMAN: I mean, David, what does this tell us about what's going on behind the scenes in the negotiations? Does it signal that there's not progress and that's why the UAW felt like it had to make this move? And does this then, in turn, put more pressure on Ford and really, you know, get them to make a deal?Story continuesDAVID WHISTON: Yeah. I was just-- Ford had a press conference actually just before we went on the air here and was listening to it. And from the Ford perspective, they thought they were making progress on issues like the battery JV plants and retirement benefits. The union clearly feels differently. And I think the unions just taking a more absolutist approach of if we don't get what we want, we just keep escalating the strike. And this week it's full-size SUVs.And then I think now that we're into the most lucrative vehicles and probably for its most profitable plant, this plant does roughly $5 billion a year in EBIT for Ford. The question that-- and hopefully management has made a decision here, but they need to do at all three firms is decide, do they want to end this strike soon and perhaps give in to avoid the bleeding in pickups and full-size SUVs or are they willing to wait this out. And to wait it out, they're going to have to lever up the company probably. And the math is, I think, on their side to do that, but you have to take a lot more debt. That's going to turn drive your stock price down quite a bit.JOSH LIPTON: And David, this latest action by the UAW, in addition to financial implications for Ford, are there ripple effects for suppliers as well?DAVID WHISTON: Yeah, that's a very underrated aspect of this strike. I mean, the UAW, of course, cares about its own members. But there's so much ramifications, not just in the auto supply chain, but throughout the whole broader US economy.I mean, generally an auto manufacturing job is roughly a multiplier effect to me as much as 8 to 10 other jobs in the economy beyond the auto sector. Just in the supplier space, Trade Organization this week is saying 30% of suppliers of the Detroit 3 have done the layoffs. They think that percentage, I think, is going up quite a bit, in fact maybe doubling, if I remember right, very shortly.And those workers, you know, they're not going to come back to work the supplier side. And everyone else is impacted by the strike directly or indirectly, they're not going to come back to work eventually with a fat new contract like the UAW workers will. They're just going to get to come back to work.And then things like restarting plants, these smaller suppliers, they have negative working capital for them to restart. They may not have the funds on hand to do that. The trade organizations are asking President Biden to give some money to suppliers who have under $200 million in revenue. We have to watch this pretty carefully because it's not going to be Lear or Magna, a big tier one supplier, that's going to take down Toyota and everyone else. It's going to be some random tier two, tier three supplier that nobody's heard of if it happens.]"

On late Wednesday, the UAW instructed 8,700 workers to strike at the Kentucky Truck Plant where its F Series pickups and full-size SUVs are built. Although this is not the first time that the UAW expanded the strike, it is the first time that it added a target without any previous public warning. With the additional workers, UAW’s total on strike is about 34,000 U.S. workers or 23% of its members who are covered by the expired contracts with Ford, General Motors (NYSE: GM) and Stellantis (NYSE: STLA).Hitting Ford Where It Hurts The MostThe Kentucky plant is where Ford’s most lucrative vehicles are made as they bring in annual revenue of $25 billion which makes about one-sixth of its global revenue. Reuters reported that Wells Fargo analysts estimated that Ford will lose about $150 million per week in core profit from this particular strike. While it does not make the best-selling F-150, it is where larger versions of the truck are built along with Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator SUVs. Before Wednesday night, the UAW targeted Ford’s facility at Wayne Michigan that builds the Ford Ranger small pickup truck and the Bronco, along with the Chicago Assembly plant that builds the Ford Expedition and Lincoln Aviator SUVs. While all of those are profitable vehicles these were not the profit drivers that are the Ford heavy duty pickups and full-size pickups but the UAW has now gone after those too, signaling major escalation in labor fight.This move puts GM and Stellantis on notice. Last Friday, Fain warned that UAW could strike GM’s Arlington Texas plant that makes high-priced EVs, if needed. As for Stellantis, the profit targets are its Ram pickup truck factories in Sterling Heights and Warren, Michigan, along with two Jeep SUV plants in Detroit.Story continuesA Transformative Win At GMLast week, General Motors agreed to include workers at its electric vehicle battery plant in the company’s national contract with the union. By being the first automaker to do so, GM inevitably put pressure on both Ford and Stellantis to follow suit.The UAW Is Hoping That A Win Against GM, Stellantis And Ford Could Help It With TeslaWorkers have attempted to organize at Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) several times but without success due to the EV king’s aggressive ‘anti-union’ tactics and rare offering of granting factory workers stock options. But in order to grow, the UAW will need to enter the EV universe as its membership has been declining over the recent decades. To grow, it will clearly need to go after Tesla who controls 60% of the EV market in the U.S. and 120,000 workers across the globe, with the average worker’s wage being about $55 compared to $66 to $71 an hour at General Motors, Stellantis and Ford, according to industry estimates that CNN Business quoted.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

If you would like to skip our detailed analysis of climate change and its impact on the economy, you can directly go to the 5 Cities With the Best Climate in the World Year-Round.Climate change has led to a rise in average global temperatures, along with an increase in extreme weather events like floods, hurricanes, and wildfires. The oceans are getting warmer, and the ice sheets are getting thinner, making many pleasant cities increasingly unlivable. Extreme summers and winters have both become common in the US due to the changing global conditions, making it much harder to find cities that offer a standard range of temperatures. The world is in a state of climate emergency, and as the call for better policies intensifies, so does the search for cities that offer the best climate in the world year-round. Research has showcased that increasing temperatures and high air pollution can negatively impact the productivity of workers, limiting the hours people can effectively perform their jobs. Industries that regularly expose workers to heat, such as construction, agriculture, or landscaping, are especially considered ‘high-risk’ in this scenario. Studies have shown that workers in these industries are prone to reducing their work hours when temperatures rise beyond 89.6° F. Just a few workers consistently leaving work early may create massive negative impacts on the economy, also affecting the profitability of ‘high-risk’ businesses. In order to put up protection against these elements, businesses need to consider policy measures that will help incentivize employees to continue working despite climate-related barriers. Climate-controlled workspaces should be established wherever they can, and in industries where that’s not an option, employers may often consider increasing wages as a form of incentive. In addition, if a corporation contributes to climate change as a whole, it’s also becoming a part of the long-term solution to the drastic problem of climate change. Story continuesAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is currently the world’s largest corporate buyer of renewable energy, having bought 10.9 gigawatts of clean power in just 2022 alone. The retail giant has made a pledge to use renewable energy as a power source for 100% of its operations by 2025. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has more than 150 wind and solar farms and over 200 on-site rooftop solar facilities. The company is currently operating almost 400 renewable energy projects in 22 countries, having adopted this method of decarbonization because of its rapid scalability. In the list of giant tech corporations working on climate sustainability, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is joined by companies like Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT). According to Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), the usage of their electric vehicles helped their customers avoid 5.0 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions in the year 2020 alone. The company has also provided disaster relief for regions that have experienced extreme weather events, along with delivering clean power solutions to many critical sites through the use of solar panels. In the year 2022, Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) sold almost 1.3 million electric vehicles globally, making them an industry leader in sustainable transportation. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is working on not just reducing its own carbon footprint but also helping its customers achieve the same thing. The corporation is focusing on using AI to develop sustainability initiatives that help alleviate the negative impacts of farming, which is also a high-risk profession due to climate change. The FarmBeats project reduces the costs of agriculture while simultaneously increasing productivity. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) also aims to become carbon-negative and water positive by 2030. The company has created a $1 billion fund to invest in innovative technologies with the potential for ‘measurable climate impact’. The idea of ‘going green’ has also opened up multiple climate investment opportunities within cities, with even the World Bank coming out with studies on how private investment can be catalyzed in climate-smart cities. Businesses can become critical contributors to strengthening the economic infrastructure of the cities they’re located in, which in turn, helps build better resilience towards extreme weather events. General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) has created a multi-million dollar climate equity fund that aims at building the resilience of local communities in the fight against climate change. Through its fund, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) is also funding non-profit organizations working in the climate equity domain, especially those focusing on a community level. These efforts by General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) have expanded access to employment opportunities, which has strengthened neighborhoods as a result. As businesses and city governments continue to find creative ways to fund climate progress, people are looking to shift toward cities that offer more favorable climates throughout the year. Keeping that demand in view, here are the 25 cities with the best climate in the world year-round. 25 Cities with the Best Climate in the World Year RoundCopyright: _ig0rzh_ / 123RF Stock PhotoOur MethodologyIn order to formulate the list of cities with the best climate throughout the year, we have taken into consideration the 2021 STC Climate Index by Global Residence Index. By taking the average of several years, they have ranked cities based on several factors, such as the number of months between 64.4°F and 86°F, the number of days above 89.6°F, and the number of days below 32°F. Using measures like these, the cities have been ranked on an index from 0 to 1, with 1 being the perfect climate to live in. The temperature range has been set keeping in view optimal temperatures for ‘work days’ instead of ‘vacation days’. Based on all of these elements, here are the 25 cities with the best climate in the world year-round: 25. San Francisco, USAClimate Index: 0.74The city’s closeness to the Pacific Ocean plays one of the key roles in maintaining moderate temperatures. The weather stays relatively stable and cool, making it one of the top US cities with the best year-round climate. The city is known for having a Mediterranean climate except for the hot and dry summers, which are much better due to the cold water of the Pacific. 24. Algiers, AlgeriaClimate Index: 0.75While many think that Algiers may have a desert-like climate, the city actually stays between 64.4°F and 86°F from March to November. This is the general trend, with the exception of August, which tends to be very hot. But unlike other parts of Algeria, Algiers does not have extreme temperatures and showcases all four seasons. Rain is also common, and the city is generally described as having a cold climate but a hot sun. 23. Cairo, Egypt Climate Index: 0.76Cairo is a fascinating city because it offers a mixture of Mediterranean and desert-like climates. One thing that remains constant throughout the year is the amount of rain, staying minimal. The best part is the winter months, which remain quite pleasant, far away from any freezing temperatures. 22. Barcelona, SpainClimate Index: 0.76Barcelona is constantly ranked as one of the best cities in Spain to live in, and its weather has a huge role to play in this. The hottest month is August, and even then, the temperature will generally go as high as 85°F. The weather is pleasant year-round, making Barcelona one of the cities with the best climate. 21. Gibraltar, GibraltarClimate Index: 0.77Gibraltar is a popular tourist location, greatly revered for its weather as well. Like many other cities on this list, August is the warmest month in the region, with an average temperature of 76°F. The Gibraltar Rock is one of the main elements that protects the territory from extreme bouts of both winter and summer. 20. Tegucigalpa, HondurasClimate Index: 0.77Tegucigalpa offers a temperate climate with very mild variations throughout the year, which is a plus point for individuals who may be looking for weather consistency. Famous for its well-preserved Spanish colonial architecture, Tegucigalpa is one of the cities with the best climate in the world all year round. 19. Amman, JordanClimate Index: 0.77The highest average temperature in Amman goes up to 89.6°F, while other parts of the country can feel much hotter. This is what sets the capital apart from the rest of the cities. Summers can feel hot but remain relatively pleasant due to low humidity levels. 18. Caracas, VenezuelaClimate Index: 0.77Even though Caracas is situated within a tropical climate zone, its position of altitude offers it a spring-like climate throughout the year. The city is much cooler than the rest of the country, but it also provides a varied range of temperatures. Any day can get hotter or rainier, so there’s a little more range in terms of the weather. 17. Addis Ababa, Ethiopia Climate Index: 0.79Addis Ababa has a subtropical climate, with summers that are warm but not hot and winters that are very mild. There is little variation in temperature throughout the year, although rain becomes more common from June to September, which may also be regarded as the monsoon months. 16. Montevideo, UruguayClimate Index: 0.79Montevideo has a temperate climate, with warm summers that leave the water pleasant enough to swim in. The summer months may also get the occasional afternoon thunderstorms, which slightly change the weather. The city receives a lot of rain, almost eight to ten days per month, but non-rainy days offer a significant amount of sun. These elements help the city strike the perfect balance between showers and sunlight. 15. Beirut, LebanonClimate Index: 0.79The general climate is subtropical, with both winters and summers remaining relatively clear. The city does see separate seasons, but the temperatures remain pleasant throughout the year, never getting too extreme. This is why Beirut is 15th on the list of the cities with the best climate in the world throughout the year. 14. Guatemala City, GuatemalaClimate Index: 0.81Guatemala City has a warm, spring-like temperature throughout the year. The high altitude is what helps the city maintain a moderate climate. The variation is very little, not even enough to distinguish heavily between hot and cold seasons. The warmest days can go up to 80°F. 13. Casablanca, MoroccoClimate Index: 0.83One can thank the cool currents of the Atlantic for the moderate temperature in Casablanca. The rainfall follows the Mediterranean pattern, with the summer months seeing almost none. Winters are mild, and both spring and autumn tend to be pleasantly warm. 12. Lisbon, PortugalClimate Index: 0.83Lisbon is situated on what we know as the Gulf Stream, meaning there are no ‘off-seasons’ in the city. The weather remains pleasant and favorable throughout the year, especially in the spring and autumn months. The mild temperature has made the city super popular with tourists because they can enjoy their activities any time of the year. 11. Limassol, CyprusClimate Index: 0.84Many regard the weather in Limassol as one of the best things about the city, as it remains mild throughout the year. Most days are sunny, making the city quite perfect for those who seek the outdoor lifestyle of the Mediterranean way of living. 10. Cape Town, South AfricaClimate Index: 0.84Cape Town has a Mediterranean climate with vast amounts of rain from June to August, but the temperature never gets too extreme. The best part about the city is that its environment offers activities throughout the year, in both winter and summer. 9. Santiago, ChileClimate Index: 0.85The evenings in Santiago tend to be cooler, even during the summer months. The winters can get moist, but average temperatures in summer don’t go above 67.1°F, keeping the overall climate pretty mild. This moderate range makes Santiago one of the cities with the best climate in South America. 8. Lima, PeruClimate Index: 0.85Many would be surprised to find Lima on the list because this is the second-largest desert city in the world after Cairo. However, the cold Humboldt Current in the Peruvian and Chilean waters regulates the temperature in this city. It ensures that the winters maintain some level of warmth and the summers some level of cool. 7. Luanda, AngolaClimate Index: 0.86In the case of Luanda, it’s the cool Benguela Current that moderates the temperature. One of the most prominent effects of this current is that it prevents much of the moisture from condensing into rain, saving the area from large chunks of rainfall. The cool ocean breeze also keeps the humidity in check, keeping the city's climate mildly tropical. 6. Johannesburg, South AfricaClimate Index: 0.86The climate in Johannesburg is mainly dominated by the summer season, but one that isn’t too humid or hot. While there is a good amount of sunshine throughout the year, the summer months can also get pretty rainy, which balances out the prolonged season.Click to continue reading and find out the 5 Cities with the Best Climate in the World Year-Round.Suggested Articles:15 Countries That Contribute The Most To Climate Change15 Countries That Have the Best Weather in the World50 Most Humid Cities in the USDisclosure: None. 25 Cities With the Best Climate in the World Year Round is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

(Image: Boeing)Boeing's second ecoDemonstrator Explorer, a 737-10 destined for United Airlines, will fly with 100% SAF and conventional jet fuel in separate tanks and alternate fuels during testing. NASA's DC-8 Airborne Science Lab will fly behind the commercial jet and measure emissions produced by each type of fuel and contrail ice particles. NASA satellites will capture images of contrail formation as part of the testing.The researchers aim to understand how advanced fuels, engine combustor designs and other technologies may reduce atmospheric warming. For example, tests will assess how SAF affects the characteristics of contrails, the persistent condensation trails produced when airplanes fly through cold, humid air. While their full impact is not yet understood, some research has suggested certain contrails can trap heat in the atmosphere.World Energy is supplying SAF for the tests from its Paramount, Calif., facility. Additional support includes:U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is providing funding through the ASCENT Center of ExcellenceGE Aerospace is providing technical expertise and project fundingGerman Aerospace Center (Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt or DLR) is providing experts and instrumentationThe project is the latest phase in a multi-year partnership between Boeing and NASA to analyze how SAF can reduce emissions and enable other environmental benefits. Compared to conventional jet fuel, SAF – made from a range of sustainably produced feedstocks – can reduce emissions by up to 85% over the fuel's life cycle and offers the greatest potential to reduce aviation CO2 over the next 30 years. SAF also produces less soot which can improve air quality near airports.Story continuesWhat the test partners are saying:""We are honored to collaborate with NASA, United Airlines, and other valued partners on research that will strengthen the industry's understanding of the benefits of SAF beyond reducing carbon emissions,"" said Boeing Chief Sustainability Officer Chris Raymond. ""We've solved hard problems before, and if we continue to take meaningful actions, I'm confident we'll achieve a more sustainable aerospace future, together.""""Flight testing is complex and resource-intensive, yet it's the gold standard for understanding how sustainable aerospace innovations affect changes in contrails and climate,"" says Rich Wahls, NASA mission integration manager for the Sustainable Flight National Partnership. ""This is why we're bringing NASA's DC-8 to bear on this collaboration, where the valuable flight data will improve our predictive models.""""This collaboration between Boeing, NASA and United has the potential to not only help us better understand contrails but to provide the full scope of what our transition to SAF can provide beyond greenhouse-gas reductions,"" said United Chief Sustainability Officer Lauren Riley.""We at GE Aerospace proudly support this groundbreaking research collaboration that will deepen our scientific understanding of the impact of SAF on emissions for a more sustainable future of flight,"" said GE Aerospace Vice President of Engineering Mohamed Ali.""To achieve climate-compatible aviation, we need close international cooperation. The German Aerospace Center has decades of experience in research on the climate impact of the entire aviation system by advancing measurement technology and simulations,"" says Markus Fischer, DLR Divisional Board Member for Aeronautics. ""The continuation of transatlantic cooperation now finds a new summit and underlines the international commitment to reduce the climate impact from aviation's CO2 and non-CO2 effects.""The Boeing ecoDemonstrator program was expanded this year to include Explorer airplanes focused on short-term, specific test projects. Boeing and NASA conducted SAF emissions ground testing on an Alaska Airlines 737-9 in 2021 and ecoDemonstrator 777-200ER and 787-10 flight-test jets in 2022. Boeing has committed to deliver commercial airplanes compatible with 100% SAF by 2030.The 737-10 is the largest airplane in Boeing's single-aisle 737 MAX family, which reduces fuel use and emissions by 20% compared to airplanes it replaces.As a leading global aerospace company, Boeing develops, manufactures and services commercial airplanes, defense products and space systems for customers in more than 150 countries.

Its revenue of $40.7 billion was up 21%. Its net income and revenue beat Wall Street expectations.CEO Jamie Dimon said in a release that US consumers and businesses ""generally remain healthy"" but noted a number of economic risks, including the possibility that inflation remains elevated and interest rates continue to rise.Wars in Ukraine and Israel, he added, could also impact energy, food markets, global trade and geopolitical relationships.""This may be the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades,"" he said.JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) (Drew Angerer via Getty Images)Profits at Wells Fargo were up 61% from a year ago and 2% at Citigroup. Profits fell at a regional bank, PNC (PNC), a sign that smaller lenders are having a tougher time churning out higher results.The stocks of JPM, Citigroup and Wells Fargo were all higher Friday morning, while PNC fell.The results kicked off a closely watched earnings season where banks of all sizes will be trying to show how they are navigating an extended period of high interest rates that is proving to be one of the most challenging for the industry since the 2008 financial crisis.JPMorgan demonstrated its dominance during the chaos of the spring by winning a government-run auction to purchase the bulk of operations of First Republic after regulators seized the San Francisco lender.First Republic was one of three sizable regional banks to fail, along with Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Their seizures triggered a panic in the banking system and outflows of depositors from a number of smaller banks.A focus for many investors in the coming weeks will be what banks say about a key measure of profitability known as net interest income, which measures the difference between what banks earn on their loans and pay for deposits.Story continuesJPMorgan's net interest income of $22.9 billion beat expectations. It was up 5% from the last quarter and 30% jump from the same period a year ago. Excluding its purchase of First Republic, the figure was up 21%.It also raised expectations for full year net interest income to between $88.5-$89 billion.Wells Fargo’s net interest income topped Wall Street expectations and it also raised its full-year guidance.Citigroup also showed improvement in its investment-banking fees, which were up 34% from a year ago. That bodes well for some other giant banks such as Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) that are heavily reliant on dealmaking for their revenues.JPMorgan’s investment-banking fees were down 3% from a year ago but up 10% from the second quarter.These giant banks are certainly not immune from some of the challenges roiling the industry. JPMorgan took $1.5 billion in write-offs for bad loans this quarter, more than double the amount compared to the year ago period.That is a sign that consumers and businesses are having more problems paying their debts.However, the bank also set aside less to cover future loan losses, a sign that it may have more confidence about the future.Another challenge that JPMorgan noted Friday was how it will be affected by a new set of capital requirements recently proposed by US regulators. It said that the new rules will increased the amount of capital it will have to set aside by 25%, or $500 billion.That is higher than the 19% regulators said would likely apply to the largest banks. That 19%, the bank said in a presentation, ""does not tell the full story"" and it believes that ""increases of this magnitude are not warranted.""""There is a lot that does not make sense to us,"" JPMorgan CFO Jeremy Barnum told analysts Friday.David Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking and crypto.Click here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Common shareholders' equity at September 30, 2023 increased $0.1 billion from June 30, 2023, driven by the benefit of net income, partially offset by a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income as well as dividends paid.As a Category III institution, PNC has elected to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income related to both available for sale securities and pension and other post-retirement plans from CET1 capital. Accumulated other comprehensive income at September 30, 2023 declined $0.8 billion from June 30, 2023 due to securities and swaps valuation changes as the benefit of paydowns and maturities was more than offset by the unfavorable impact of interest rate movements. Compared to September 30, 2022, accumulated other comprehensive income improved $0.2 billion, reflecting the benefit of paydowns and maturities.In the third quarter of 2023, PNC returned $0.6 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends on common shares. Consistent with the Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) framework, which allows for capital return in amounts in excess of the SCB minimum levels, our board of directors has authorized a repurchase framework under the previously approved repurchase program of up to 100 million common shares, of which approximately 46% were still available for repurchase at September 30, 2023.In light of the Federal banking agencies proposed rules to adjust the Basel III capital framework, share repurchase activity is expected to remain paused during the fourth quarter of 2023. PNC continues to evaluate the potential impact of the proposed rules and may resume share repurchase activity depending on market and economic conditions, as well as other factors.PNC's SCB for the four-quarter period beginning October 1, 2023 is the regulatory minimum of 2.5%.On October 2, 2023, the PNC board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $1.55 per share. The dividend, with a payment date of November 5, 2023, will be payable the next business day.At September 30, 2023, PNC was considered ""well capitalized"" based on applicable U.S. regulatory capital ratio requirements. For additional information regarding PNC's Basel III capital ratios, see Capital Ratios in the Consolidated Financial Highlights. PNC elected a five-year transition provision effective March 31, 2020 to delay until December 31, 2021 the full impact of the Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) standard on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. Effective for the first quarter of 2022, PNC is now in the three-year transition period, and the full impact of the CECL standard is being phased-in to regulatory capital through December 31, 2024. The fully implemented ratios reflect the full impact of CECL and exclude the benefits of this transition provision.CREDIT QUALITY REVIEWCredit QualityChangeChangeSeptember 30, 2023June 30, 2023September 30, 202209/30/23 vs09/30/23 vsIn millions06/30/2309/30/22Provision for credit losses$       129$      146$       241$        (17)$      (112)Net loan charge-offs$       121$      194$       119(38) %2 %Allowance for credit losses (a)$    5,407$   5,400$    5,263—3 %Total delinquencies (b)$    1,287$   1,212$    1,6266 %(21) %Nonperforming loans$    2,123$   1,913$    2,06811 %3 %Net charge-offs to average loans (annualized)0.15 %0.24 %0.15 %Allowance for credit losses to total loans1.70 %1.68 %1.67 %Nonperforming loans to total loans0.67 %0.59 %0.66 %(a) Excludes allowances for investment securities and other financial assets(b) Total delinquencies represent accruing loans more than 30 days past dueProvision for credit losses was $129 million in the third quarter of 2023.

To provide more meaningful comparisons of net interest margins, we use net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating average yields used in the calculation of net interest margin by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the Consolidated Income Statement. The taxable-equivalent adjustments to net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2023, June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022 were $36 million, $37 million and $29 million, respectively.

Under the standardized approach for determining credit risk-weighted assets, exposures are generally assigned a pre-defined risk weight. Exposures to high volatility commercial real estate, past due exposures and equity exposures are generally subject to higher risk weights than other types of exposures.PNC elected a five-year transition provision effective March 31, 2020 to delay until December 31, 2021 the full impact of the CECL standard on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. Effective for the first quarter 2022, PNC is now in the three-year transition period, and the full impact of the CECL standard is being phased-in to regulatory capital through December 31, 2024. See the table below for the June 30, 2023, September 30, 2022 and estimated September 30, 2023 ratios. For the full impact of PNC's adoption of CECL, which excludes the benefits of the five-year transition provision, see the September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023 (Fully Implemented) estimates presented in the table below.Our Basel III capital ratios may be impacted by changes to the regulatory capital rules and additional regulatory guidance or analysis.Basel lll Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratios Basel III (a)September 302023 (estimated) (b)June 302023 (b)September 30 2022 (b)September 30, 2023 (Fully Implemented)(estimated) (c)June 30, 2023 (Fully Implemented)(estimated) (c)Dollars in millionsCommon stock, related surplus and retained earnings, net of treasury stock$    52,958$    52,091$    50,654$         52,476$         51,608Less regulatory capital adjustments:Goodwill and disallowed intangibles, net of deferred tax liabilities(11,083)(11,101)(11,159)(11,083)(11,101)All other adjustments(99)(89)(123)(101)(90)Basel III Common equity Tier 1 capital$    41,776$    40,901$    39,372$         41,292$         40,417Basel III standardized approach risk-weighted assets (d)$  425,924$  429,634$  423,446$       426,117$       429,826Basel III Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio9.8 %9.5 %9.3 %9.7 %9.4 %(a)All ratios are calculated using the regulatory capital methodology applicable to PNC during each period presented.(b)The ratios are calculated to reflect PNC's election to adopt the CECL optional five-year transition provisions.(c)The September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023 ratios are calculated to reflect the full impact of CECL and exclude the benefits of the five-year transition provisions.(d)Basel III standardized approach risk-weighted assets are based on the Basel III standardized approach rules and include credit and market risk-weighted assets. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.Consolidated Financial Highlights (Unaudited)NON-GAAP MEASURESPretax Pre-Provision Earnings (non-GAAP)Three months endedSeptember 30June 30September 30Dollars in millions202320232022Income before income taxes and noncontrolling interests$             1,859$             1,775$             2,028Provision for credit losses129146241Pretax pre-provision earnings (non-GAAP)$             1,988$             1,921$             2,269Pretax pre-provision earnings is a non-GAAP measure and is based on adjusting income before income taxes and noncontrolling interests to exclude provision for credit losses.

As such, these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments. To provide more meaningful comparisons of net interest income, we use interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP. Taxable-equivalent net interest income is only used for calculating net interest margin and net interest income shown elsewhere in this presentation is GAAP net interest income.Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking InformationWe make statements in this news release and related conference call, and we may from time to time make other statements, regarding our outlook for financial performance, such as earnings, revenues, expenses, tax rates, capital and liquidity levels and ratios, asset levels, asset quality, financial position, and other matters regarding or affecting us and our future business and operations, including our sustainability strategy, that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as ""believe,"" ""plan,"" ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""see,"" ""look,"" ""intend,"" ""outlook,"" ""project,"" ""forecast,"" ""estimate,"" ""goal,"" ""will,"" ""should"" and other similar words and expressions.Forward-looking statements are necessarily subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time. Future events or circumstances may change our outlook and may also affect the nature of the assumptions, risks and uncertainties to which our forward-looking statements are subject. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. We do not assume any duty and do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Actual results or future events could differ, possibly materially, from those anticipated in forward-looking statements, as well as from historical performance. As a result, we caution against placing undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.Our forward-looking statements are subject to the following principal risks and uncertainties.Our businesses, financial results and balance sheet values are affected by business and economic conditions, including:Changes in interest rates and valuations in debt, equity and other financial markets,Disruptions in the U.S. and global financial markets,Actions by the Federal Reserve Board, U.S. Treasury and other government agencies, including those that impact money supply, market interest rates and inflation,Changes in customer behavior due to changing business and economic conditions or legislative or regulatory initiatives,Changes in customers', suppliers' and other counterparties' performance and creditworthiness,Impacts of sanctions, tariffs and other trade policies of the U.S. and its global trading partners,Impacts of changes in federal, state and local governmental policy, including on the regulatory landscape, capital markets, taxes, infrastructure spending and social programs,Our ability to attract, recruit and retain skilled employees, andCommodity price volatility.Our forward-looking financial statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be substantially different than those we are currently expecting and do not take into account potential legal and regulatory contingencies. These statements are based on our views that:Economic growth accelerated in the first half of 2023, but ongoing Federal Reserve monetary policy tightening to slow inflation is weighing on interest-rate sensitive industries. Sectors where interest rates play an outsized role, such as business investment and consumer spending on durable goods, will contract into 2024.PNC's baseline outlook is for a mild recession starting in the first half of 2024, with a small contraction in real GDP of less than 1%, lasting into the second half of 2024. The unemployment rate will increase through the rest of 2023 and throughout 2024, peaking at close to 5% in early 2025. Inflation will slow with weaker demand, moving back to the Federal Reserve's 2% objective by mid-2024.PNC expects the federal funds rate to remain unchanged in the near term, between 5.25% and 5.50% through mid-2024, when PNC expects federal funds rate cuts in response to the recession.PNC's ability to take certain capital actions, including returning capital to shareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or exceeding a stress capital buffer established by the Federal Reserve Board in connection with the Federal Reserve Board's Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process.PNC's regulatory capital ratios in the future will depend on, among other things, the company's financial performance, the scope and terms of final capital regulations then in effect and management actions affecting the composition of PNC's balance sheet. In addition, PNC's ability to determine, evaluate and forecast regulatory capital ratios, and to take actions (such as capital distributions) based on actual or forecasted capital ratios, will be dependent at least in part on the development, validation and regulatory review of related models and the reliability of and risks resulting from extensive use of such models.Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information (Continued)  Legal and regulatory developments could have an impact on our ability to operate our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, competitive position, reputation, or pursuit of attractive acquisition opportunities. Reputational impacts could affect matters such as business generation and retention, liquidity, funding, and ability to attract and retain employees. These developments could include:Changes to laws and regulations, including changes affecting oversight of the financial services industry, changes in the enforcement and interpretation of such laws and regulations, and changes in accounting and reporting standards.Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings or other claims and regulatory and other governmental investigations or other inquiries resulting in monetary losses, costs, or alterations in our business practices, and potentially causing reputational harm to PNC.Results of the regulatory examination and supervision process, including our failure to satisfy requirements of agreements with governmental agencies.Costs associated with obtaining rights in intellectual property claimed by others and of adequacy of our intellectual property protection in general.Business and operating results are affected by our ability to identify and effectively manage risks inherent in our businesses, including, where appropriate, through effective use of systems and controls, third-party insurance, derivatives, and capital management techniques, and to meet evolving regulatory capital and liquidity standards.Our reputation and business and operating results may be affected by our ability to appropriately meet or address environmental, social or governance targets, goals, commitments or concerns that may arise.We grow our business in part through acquisitions and new strategic initiatives. Risks and uncertainties include those presented by the nature of the business acquired and strategic initiative, including in some cases those associated with our entry into new businesses or new geographic or other markets and risks resulting from our inexperience in those new areas, as well as risks and uncertainties related to the acquisition transactions themselves, regulatory issues, the integration of the acquired businesses into PNC after closing or any failure to execute strategic or operational plans.Competition can have an impact on customer acquisition, growth and retention and on credit spreads and product pricing, which can affect market share, deposits and revenues. Our ability to anticipate and respond to technological changes can also impact our ability to respond to customer needs and meet competitive demands.Business and operating results can also be affected by widespread manmade, natural and other disasters (including severe weather events), health emergencies, dislocations, geopolitical instabilities or events, terrorist activities, system failures or disruptions, security breaches, cyberattacks, international hostilities, or other extraordinary events beyond PNC's control through impacts on the economy and financial markets generally or on us or our counterparties, customers or third-party vendors and service providers specifically.We provide greater detail regarding these as well as other factors in our 2022 Form 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs, including in the Risk Factors and Risk Management sections and the Legal Proceedings and Commitments Notes of the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in those reports, and in our other subsequent SEC filings.

(NYSE:PNC) Before It Goes Ex-Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sure-check-pnc-financial-services-183230258.html,1697135550,STORY,['PNC'],"[The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:PNC) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 3 days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Thus, you can purchase PNC Financial Services Group's shares before the 16th of October in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 5th of November.The company's upcoming dividend is US$1.55 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$6.20 per share to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, PNC Financial Services Group has a trailing yield of approximately 5.1% on its current stock price of $122.74. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. See our latest analysis for PNC Financial Services Group Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. PNC Financial Services Group paid out a comfortable 41% of its profit last year.Companies that pay out less in dividends than they earn in profits generally have more sustainable dividends. The lower the payout ratio, the more wiggle room the business has before it could be forced to cut the dividend.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at PNC Financial Services Group, with earnings per share up 7.1% on average over the last five years.Story continuesThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. PNC Financial Services Group has delivered an average of 15% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.To Sum It UpIs PNC Financial Services Group worth buying for its dividend? It has been growing its earnings per share somewhat in recent years, although it reinvests more than half its earnings in the business, which could suggest there are some growth projects that have not yet reached fruition. We think this is a pretty attractive combination, and would be interested in investigating PNC Financial Services Group more closely.So while PNC Financial Services Group looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. To help with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign for PNC Financial Services Group that you should be aware of before investing in their shares.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

Ascent Housing, which serves as the operating partner for HIF II, enlisted city and county funding sources and a senior mortgage from Freddie Mac to round out the financing.A relatively new strategy to bolster the supply of affordable housing in Mecklenburg County, NOAH preservation represents a less expensive and faster way to deliver affordable housing units than new construction and also mitigates the loss of affordable housing units and displacement of low- and moderate-income residents.""Delivering on the local housing challenge requires creativity, collaboration and a shared vision among public and private sectors - including developers, funders and business leaders,"" said Weston Andress, PNC regional president for Western Carolinas. ""PNC is committed to driving prosperity within the communities we serve, and we are confident that our investment in HIF II will create positive and lasting impact for Charlotteans.""Current residents of Charlotte Woods will be protected from displacement through rent stabilization, and the adoption of long-term covenants will help ensure housing remains affordable for households of various income levels over time.Story continues""Housing Impact Fund's NOAH preservation strategy is two-fold: Protecting existing residents from rising rents and creating new opportunities for low- and moderate-income households when units become available through natural turnover,"" said Mark Ethridge, principal at Ascent Housing. ""We're grateful for PNC Bank's investment in HIF II and for its commitment to be part of the solution to Mecklenburg County's affordable housing challenge.""PNC's investment in HIF II was facilitated by PNC's Community Development Banking group, which works to improve the quality of life in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods through affordable housing, community development lending, economic development, financial education and customized financial solutions.Other investors in HIF II include Truist, Atrium Health, Honeywell, the Leon Levine Foundation and numerous other companies, foundations and individuals.About Housing Impact Fund II Housing Impact Fund II is a $66.8 million social impact equity fund raised to preserve naturally occurring affordable housing in Mecklenburg County. HIF II acquires, renovates and sets long-term affordability covenants on large-scale apartment communities vulnerable to gentrification. The fund will set aside 30% of its portfolio for households earning less than 30% of area median income (AMI), 50% of units to households earning less than 60% AMI and 20% of units to households earning less than 80% AMI. HIF II follows the success of the initial Housing Impact Fund which preserved over 800 apartments in opportunity-rich areas of Charlotte housing more than 2,000 residents. Like HIF I, HIF II expects more than 90% of its work to be performed by minority-led contractors. HIF II is managed by Erskine Bowles and Nelson Schwab and operated in partnership with Ascent Housing.About PNC Bank PNC Bank, N.A., is a member of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE: PNC).

After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for PNC in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $3.22 per share for PNC, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.18 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for PNC, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.26% heading into earnings season.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc Price and EPS Surprise The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc price-eps-surprise | The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

248,70aee422-01ea-3da5-b2fa-38df708c2b01,RCL,2023-10-13,16 Best Vacations for Seniors with Limited Mobility,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/16-best-vacations-seniors-limited-094142153.html,1697190102,STORY,"['CUK', 'MAR', 'EXPE', 'RCL']","[This article takes a look at the 16 best vacations for seniors with limited mobility. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on accessible tourism, you may go to 5 Best Vacations for Seniors with Limited Mobility.Silver TourismAccording to Census data, Baby Boomers are the wealthiest generation of all cohorts, controlling an estimated 70% of disposable income in the USA. Over the next two decades, it is forecast that the generation will leave a staggering $30 trillion behind. If it happens, it is going to be the greatest transfer of wealth in history. However, given the current trends of baby boomer traveling; it is unlikely that such a significant transfer of wealth is going to happen at all. After all, this phase of life is often referred to as the ""golden period"" for a reason. It's only reasonable to anticipate that a significant portion of their accumulated wealth will be allocated to travel, leisure, and non-essential living expenses.On average, this generational cohort is likely to take 4 to 5 leisure trips each year, spending an estimated $6,600 annually. These travelers love to visit Florida and the Caribbean, the top warm-weather spots on their travel list. Moreover, while the average spend of these travelers on a leisure trip per year is an estimated $6,000; many baby boomers can afford to spend the same on a single vacation as well. This higher spend on leisure travel stems from their financial stability and strength. Having no children to take care of and enough time on their hands; traveling seems like the perfect solution.Based on travel data, it has also been found that 3 out of 10 boomers choose cruises when going on vacation trips. According to Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), baby boomers are especially splurging on restaurants and cruises. While a spike in Social Security payments due to an 8.7% COLA (Cost of Living Adjustment) has been responsible for the increased spending, high-income households that are unaffected by such spikes seem to be spending more, too. In 2022, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) reported a substantial increase in aggregated credit and debit card spending per household on travel. This category includes expenditures on airlines, lodging, cruises, and rental cars.Story continuesThe data reveals a robust year-over-year (YoY) growth of 27%, surpassing the 2019 figures by a notable 9%. A senior economist at Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), Tinsley; notes that these older consumers are spending more on hotels, cruises, and airfare now that the pandemic is over. Another reason the baby boomers increasingly prefer cruises over other vacation trips is the range of accessibility they offer. You pack and unpack once. There are amenities and conveniences available for passengers with limited mobility, onboard assistance, and even assistance for excursions.Accessible TourismAccording to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, over 25.5 million Americans have self-reported travel-limiting disabilities. Out of this figure, 11.2 million are aged 65 years and above. Moreover, many of these Americans with mobility disabilities spend $58.2 billion on leisure trips. Despite representing a significant part of the travel industry, this market segment continues to be poorly served. MMGY Travel Assistance, a research firm focused on the travel and hospitality industry, has researched travelers with mobility disabilities. The results report that 96% of respondents have been facing accommodation-related problems during travel, 86% had flight problems, and 40% also reported having their mobility equipment lost or damaged by their airline.Prioritizing accessibility can help those with mobility disabilities travel with ease, tapping a significant market segment along the way. Many organizations have already started creating a more accessible future for such travelers, including Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE), Carnival Corporation &amp; plc (NYSE:CCL), Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR), and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL). Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) has partnered with several companies working to increase access for underserved travelers. Companies include Becoming RentABLE, a company that finds accessible short-term rental properties; Be My Eyes, an app that connects people with sight impairments; and Wheel the World, an online resource for accessible travel experiences, amongst others.""We're excited to leverage our expertise with Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) on how we can make the world accessible; that's our purpose as a company.""Alvaro Silberstein, co-founder &amp; CEO of Accelerator finalist Wheel the World.Similarly, Carnival Corporation &amp; plc (NYSE:CCL); an American cruise firm and one of the best cruise stocks to buy according to Insider Monkey, has also been providing accessible cruises to its customers. AIDA Cruises, one of the brands under Carnival Corporation &amp; plc (NYSE:CCL), has adapted to the special needs and requirements of individuals with impairments. Customers can access barrier-free travel through advanced booking, with almost all areas of the cruise ship accessible to customers without barriers.Hotels such as Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR), an American multinational company that operates, franchises, and licenses lodging including hotel, residential, and timeshare properties, are also worthy of mention due to their commitment to accessibility. At Marriott International, Inc.

Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with UNH.As of 2023-10-12, Visa Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $241.34. It's currently trading at a price of $235.68. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 2.35%. The company is fair valued.The Art of Valuation: Discovering Visa Inc's Intrinsic ValueThe modelThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Visa Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.AssumptionsTermValueExplanationEPS without NRI$7.88GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.Discount Rate11%An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.56%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.Growth StageGrowth rate (g1) = 19.70% Years of Growth Stage = 10We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.Terminal StageGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.CalculationGrowth Stage=EPS without NRI*[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)*(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=122.16Terminal Stage=EPS without NRI*(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10*[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)+(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=119.18Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)=Growth Stage+Terminal Stage=241.34Discounted Free Cash Flow ModelGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $268.77. This valuation indicates that the Visa Inc is modestly undervalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of 12.31%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.Story continuesThe Bottom LinePlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation.  Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.Navigating with GuruFocus:Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

At the heart of the hotel's design story is 'the larrikin,' a quintessentially Australian character whose strong spirit informs and inspires the hotel's luxe yet unconventional interiors.From the moment guests step past the W sign, inspired by the Australian flower Waratah, they are on a design-led journey. The copper-clad entry pays homage to subterranean Sydney and its disused railway tunnels, and an illuminated vertical promenade sweeps guests up into Living Room, a vivid blue space that reinvents the conventions of a traditional lobby by turning it into a social hub. Embracing a 'Future Noir' theme, Living Room is punctuated by an electric blue circular bar and nest-like seating that reference the Australian Bowerbird, a larrikin of the bird world. W Sydney's 588 guestrooms, including 162 exceptional suites, draw inspiration from the hotel's harbourside location and nearby beaches, exuding marine-chic in their nautical white and navy-blue palette and undulating walls that echo the sails of yachts in the marina below. Bathrooms are rendered in deep oceanic blue and walk-in wardrobes feature a burst of graphic, inflorescent red and pink Waratah flowers for a playful touch.Story continuesCUISINE SCENEAcross all its spaces, W Sydney channels the boundless energy of the Harbour City and its culture of inclusivity with a tuned-in, curious attitude, amplified through always-on programming. Electrifying the city's culinary and nightlife scenes, W Sydney brings four new dining and bar venues across three exciting levels. BTWN embraces its unique setting adjacent to the flyover, drawing on its urban surroundings and weaving the iconography of night food markets into its spaces. Leading the culinary adventures at BTWN is Head Chef Chris Dodd, an alumnus of Aria and Blue Door, whose menus hero the produce of New South Wales. Just as other restaurants in town are winding down, BTWN comes alive with 2AM: dessertbar, a late-night hotspot created in collaboration with Singaporean dessert guru Janice Wong. Living Room's menus embrace the hotel's location on the edge of Asiatown with a focus on Sake and Soju, as well as Asian small bites. 29/30 is a two-level bar with uninterrupted harbour views, the perfect place to celebrate Sydney. A beacon at the apex of Darling Harbour, the WET Deck (pool) level bar evokes an underwater world with coral-inspired lighting and is a great spot for casual tapas and cocktails. Meanwhile, Level 30 above takes things up a notch with elevated cocktails, a menu of vintage Champagnes by the glass, and the above-sea-level décor of a superyacht.UP AND AWAYSwitching the mood, AWAY Spa is an oasis of concrete calm designed to leave guests feeling rested and recharged in an idiosyncratic but nevertheless deeply restorative space. The five treatment rooms and connecting spaces are gently enclosed by the meditative, geometric art of Bradley Eastman (aka Beastman). In addition to unique circular pods for beauty treatments, the spa features a bar for those who like to socialize while they decompress. The hotel's FIT Gym is complete with Technogym equipment, whereas WET Deck is a place to chill poolside with stellar views of Darling Harbour. The 30-metre open-air infinity pool showcases a giant jellyfish motif crafted from vivid glass mosaic tiles, a further nod to the hotel's joyful eccentricity.BUSINESS IS PLEASUREWhilst W Sydney is destined to be Sydney's newest playground, it also means business. Located just steps from Sydney's International Convention Centre, the hotel features 1300-square-meters of exceptional event space across eight versatile rooms. Set on level five, W Sydney's 592-square-meter pillarless Great Room features floor-to-ceiling windows that afford extraordinary views of the city. The design connects to the lively Darling Harbour setting, with light fittings and a graphic carpet that explode in a creative tribute to Sydney's famous fireworks.""W Sydney reimagines luxury for a new era, creating a vibrant new scene for Sydneysiders and visitors to the city,"" says Craig Seaward, General Manager of W Sydney. ""It's a complete departure from the city's traditional hotels and this unique W spirit is something you feel at every touchpoint, from our eclectic venues to the cool blue rooms and high energy programming. I can't think of a better location for our new W hotel than Sydney's amazing harbour. We can't wait to welcome guests again and again.""For more information and to book, please visit wsydney.com or follow on Instagram and Facebook.About W HotelsBorn from the bold, 24/7 culture of New York City, W Hotels has redefined hospitality for over two decades, breaking the norms of traditional luxury wherever the iconic W sign lands.

257,70aee422-01ea-3da5-b2fa-38df708c2b01,MAR,2023-10-13,16 Best Vacations for Seniors with Limited Mobility,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/16-best-vacations-seniors-limited-094142153.html,1697190102,STORY,"['CUK', 'MAR', 'EXPE', 'RCL']","[This article takes a look at the 16 best vacations for seniors with limited mobility. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on accessible tourism, you may go to 5 Best Vacations for Seniors with Limited Mobility.Silver TourismAccording to Census data, Baby Boomers are the wealthiest generation of all cohorts, controlling an estimated 70% of disposable income in the USA. Over the next two decades, it is forecast that the generation will leave a staggering $30 trillion behind. If it happens, it is going to be the greatest transfer of wealth in history. However, given the current trends of baby boomer traveling; it is unlikely that such a significant transfer of wealth is going to happen at all. After all, this phase of life is often referred to as the ""golden period"" for a reason. It's only reasonable to anticipate that a significant portion of their accumulated wealth will be allocated to travel, leisure, and non-essential living expenses.On average, this generational cohort is likely to take 4 to 5 leisure trips each year, spending an estimated $6,600 annually. These travelers love to visit Florida and the Caribbean, the top warm-weather spots on their travel list. Moreover, while the average spend of these travelers on a leisure trip per year is an estimated $6,000; many baby boomers can afford to spend the same on a single vacation as well. This higher spend on leisure travel stems from their financial stability and strength. Having no children to take care of and enough time on their hands; traveling seems like the perfect solution.Based on travel data, it has also been found that 3 out of 10 boomers choose cruises when going on vacation trips. According to Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), baby boomers are especially splurging on restaurants and cruises. While a spike in Social Security payments due to an 8.7% COLA (Cost of Living Adjustment) has been responsible for the increased spending, high-income households that are unaffected by such spikes seem to be spending more, too. In 2022, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) reported a substantial increase in aggregated credit and debit card spending per household on travel. This category includes expenditures on airlines, lodging, cruises, and rental cars.Story continuesThe data reveals a robust year-over-year (YoY) growth of 27%, surpassing the 2019 figures by a notable 9%. A senior economist at Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), Tinsley; notes that these older consumers are spending more on hotels, cruises, and airfare now that the pandemic is over. Another reason the baby boomers increasingly prefer cruises over other vacation trips is the range of accessibility they offer. You pack and unpack once. There are amenities and conveniences available for passengers with limited mobility, onboard assistance, and even assistance for excursions.Accessible TourismAccording to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, over 25.5 million Americans have self-reported travel-limiting disabilities. Out of this figure, 11.2 million are aged 65 years and above. Moreover, many of these Americans with mobility disabilities spend $58.2 billion on leisure trips. Despite representing a significant part of the travel industry, this market segment continues to be poorly served. MMGY Travel Assistance, a research firm focused on the travel and hospitality industry, has researched travelers with mobility disabilities. The results report that 96% of respondents have been facing accommodation-related problems during travel, 86% had flight problems, and 40% also reported having their mobility equipment lost or damaged by their airline.Prioritizing accessibility can help those with mobility disabilities travel with ease, tapping a significant market segment along the way. Many organizations have already started creating a more accessible future for such travelers, including Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE), Carnival Corporation &amp; plc (NYSE:CCL), Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR), and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL). Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) has partnered with several companies working to increase access for underserved travelers. Companies include Becoming RentABLE, a company that finds accessible short-term rental properties; Be My Eyes, an app that connects people with sight impairments; and Wheel the World, an online resource for accessible travel experiences, amongst others.""We're excited to leverage our expertise with Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) on how we can make the world accessible; that's our purpose as a company.""Alvaro Silberstein, co-founder &amp; CEO of Accelerator finalist Wheel the World.Similarly, Carnival Corporation &amp; plc (NYSE:CCL); an American cruise firm and one of the best cruise stocks to buy according to Insider Monkey, has also been providing accessible cruises to its customers. AIDA Cruises, one of the brands under Carnival Corporation &amp; plc (NYSE:CCL), has adapted to the special needs and requirements of individuals with impairments. Customers can access barrier-free travel through advanced booking, with almost all areas of the cruise ship accessible to customers without barriers.Hotels such as Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR), an American multinational company that operates, franchises, and licenses lodging including hotel, residential, and timeshare properties, are also worthy of mention due to their commitment to accessibility. At Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR), accessible stays are guaranteed through rooms with specific facilities, grab bars and walk-in showers, Braille signage, wheelchairs upon request, barrier-free access to common areas, restaurants, swimming pools, and much more.Many all-inclusive resorts are also popping up along the way to cater to the booming demand for senior traveling. Some all-inclusive resorts for seniors with limited mobility include Sandals Royal Bahamian Spa Resort &amp; Offshore Island, Bahamas; Riu Palace Riviera Maya, Mexico; and The Westin Golf Resort &amp; Spa, Playa Conchal, Costa Rica; to name a few.16 Best Vacations for Seniors with Limited MobilityMethodologyTo compile the list of best vacations for seniors with limited mobility, we checked out tourism websites, travel forums, accessibility guides such as World on Wheels, and travel blogs.

But inflation and dry weather conditions for sugar suppliers aren't dampening candy sales ahead of this year's Halloween festivities. Yahoo Finance Reporter Brooke DiPalma explains the year-over-year projections for consumer candy spend.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video Transcript- The latest inflation data is out. And it shows the price of sugar on the rise. But it isn't expected to put a damper on Halloween celebrations this year. Yahoo finance's Brooke Dipalma is here to tell us why. Brooke?BROOKE DIPALMA: Good afternoon, Josh. That's right, sugar and sweet prices jumped in the month of September. They were up 0.3% on a monthly basis, which then contributed to a year over year jump of up 6.5%. Now this comes as sugar futures were up 40% compared to a year ago, and prices are high and they ultimately are remaining high because of a lower global supply of sugar that we're seeing.Now extreme weather is to blame for that impact on global sugar supply. Countries that are major exporters like India, like Thailand, like Australia are suffering from what they say are really dry monsoon period. And ultimately that is impacting the amount in which they are producing.Now another contributor to these higher costs is cocoa futures, which one expert said is a bigger chunk of the total cost of manufacturing for candy producers than sugar is. But yet the good news here is that Americans are so eager to celebrate. More consumers are gearing up to celebrate this Halloween especially post pandemic. And they're tapping into nostalgia here as well, celebrating this. And higher prices also contributing to a record high of candy sales.This year $3.6 billion in candy sales are expected to hit a record high according to national retail federation. We also are expected to see 3/4 of Americans celebrate. That's up from last year. But one fun fact here is that nine out of 10 Americans are expected to wait and look for a good deal in the last two weeks of the holiday season. And Josh, Julie, I have to say that I have not done my Halloween shopping just yet. I am one of those people that is waiting for a good deal. And I can't wait to grab my favorite just Reese's coming out at hopefully-- you know, they're already on the shelves. They've been on the shelves I feel like since the middle of the summer. But I certainly will be grabbing for Reese's as well.Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: Wait Reese's the cups or the pieces? Very important.BROOKE DIPALMA: Good question. The cups. Always the cups. The pieces are good, but I have to go with cups.JULIE HYMAN: Always the cups. Yeah, I'm looking at the cups. Josh, what's your thing?- Milk Duds.JULIE HYMAN: Milk Duds?BROOKE DIPALMA: Oh, Milk Duds.- I'm a simple man. Little caramel, little chocolate.BROOKE DIPALMA: That is a hot take, Josh.- Where do you go for? What's your--JULIE HYMAN: Twix, Twix is my thing.- Twix. Really? Oh, there we go. Yeah. A mini Twix.BROOKE DIPALMA: Very different.JULIE HYMAN: Mini Twix because it's, you know--- It's very responsible. Very responsible.BROOKE DIPALMA: Yeah.- Thank you, Brooke Depalma.]"

Prices of other sweets rose nearly 3% compared to last year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) latest Consumer Price Index (CPI).On a yearly basis, the overall sugar and sweets category rose 6.5%, including a 0.3% jump compared to the month prior.That's higher than overall food inflation, which increased 0.2% in September on a monthly basis and 3.7% year over year. The cost of groceries — food at home — jumped 0.1% and 2.4%, respectively.But fret not, trick-or-treaters. Consumers are expected to spend $3.6 billion dollars on candy this year, a nearly 14% jump from last year's total of $3.1 billion. That figure is an all-time high, according to the National Retail Federation. And nearly three-fourths of Americans, 73%, are expected to participate in Halloween festivities, higher than 69% last year.Extreme weather is driving prices higherSugar futures (SB=F) are up 40% compared to a year ago.""A lot of that increase that you're seeing is attributed to what the world's supply is going to look like,"" Andraia Torsiello, Mintec US sugar analyst, told Yahoo Finance over the phone. ""India is actually a major exporter and they've had really poor weather conditions, so they're suffering from a really dry monsoon period.""It's partly the result of a climate pattern known as an El Niño over Asia, David Branch of Wells Fargo told Yahoo Finance over the phone: ""It's impacting India, Thailand, and Australia too.""As a result, ""India and Thailand did not get the monsoons they normally get,"" Branch said, which led to both governments basically shutting down exports.Last year, the growth rate of US sugar exports also dropped by 2.38%, per the USDA. Story continues""The reason why the prices are high and remain high is not only because of the inflation in the economy, but also just the supply not being as available as it was,"" Torsiello said.Another factor behind the rise: the cost of cocoa. Cocoa futures (CC=F) are up 46%.""There's a significant shortage of cocoa due to drought in those specific regions,"" Branch said, which spells bad news for candymakers. ""I imagine that's a bigger chunk of the total cost of manufacturing than sugar.""Halloween candy is for sale at a Harris Teeter grocery store last year. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) (Drew Angerer via Getty Images)Despite the noise, companies and consumers are moving forward, ready to celebrate.A Hershey (HSY) spokesperson told Yahoo Finance there are no candy shortages related to the cost of sugar.""[Movements] in sugar, as far as total manufacturing cost, are really very minimal to the manufacturer,"" Branch said, when compared to the cost to produce, ship, and distribute the candy.On a call with investors following its Q2 results, Hershey CEO Michele Buck said the company expects a ""very strong Halloween,"" with planned marketing and an approach of ""leaning into Halloween.""It's also business as usual at Mars. ""We met all our commitments to retailers, and even ended up being able to exceed the amount of candy we committed to in some cases,"" a spokesperson said.Consumers are leaning in too. In Advantage Solution's recent survey around Halloween this year, 9 out of 10 respondents said they'll buy candy.""Folks are still ready to celebrate ... we're still spinning out of a pandemic, people are spending more time celebrating, even elongating seasons,"" Andy Keenan, Advantage Solutions executive vice president, told Yahoo Finance over the phone. ""There's a lot of nostalgia with Halloween.""Consumers will be looking for deals, though. Nine out of 10 shoppers will wait to make their purchase during the last two weeks of October.""[Consumers] know prices will come down ... very few folks are buying on Oct. 12. They're highly inclined to start shopping on Oct. 27,"" Keenan added.—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

In early 2022, REMUS 300 was chosen as the Navy's official program of record for the next-generation SUUV.The aforementioned discussion surely reflects the proven expertise of HII in the UUV space that is likely to have led to a steady inflow of contracts for the company, like the latest one. This, in turn, should bolster its revenue generation prospects from the UUV product line.Growth ProspectusThe recent tiff between Ukraine and Russia has led other nations to strengthen their defense landscape to deter any war-like situation. In this context, it is imperative to mention that UUVs are noted for their ability to carry out dangerous maritime operations, such as mine countermeasure missions and harbor patrol. Therefore, as investments in undersea warfare capabilities have recently increased manifold, so has the demand for state-of-the-art UUVs.Story continuesLooking ahead, with technological advancement, nations are more rapidly adopting artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to increase the autonomy of UUVs. As a result, hefty investments in developing and acquiring autonomous marine systems can be expected in the coming days, thereby boosting the UUV market. To this end, the Fortune Business Insights firm projects the global unmanned underwater vehicles market to witness a CAGR of 13.5% during 2023-2030.Such growth trends should boost Huntington Ingalls along with other defense primes like Boeing BA, General Dynamics GD and Lockheed Martin LMT, which have a strong presence in the unmanned underwater vehicle market.Boeing’s Echo Voyager is a fully autonomous XLUUV class UUV that can be used for various missions, which were previously impossible due to traditional UUV limitations.Boeing’s long-term earnings growth rate is 4%. BA’s shares appreciated 48.1% in the past year.General Dynamics’ Bluefin SandShark is a one-person-portable, low-cost, autonomous unmanned underwater vehicle designed to leverage today’s miniaturized sensors and emerge as the development platform for the next generation.General Dynamics boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.2%. GD’s shares rallied 3.8% in the past year.Lockheed has more than four decades of experience developing unmanned and robotic systems for the sea. Notably, LMT’s Marlin autonomous underwater vehicle system offers a range of civilian and military customers and a quick and safe way to conduct subsea surveys and inspections.Lockheed’s long-term earnings growth rate is 8.4%. LMT’s shares rose 7.6% in the past year.Price MovementShares of HII have rallied 4.2% in the past six months against the industry’s decline of 12.6%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankHuntington Ingalls currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

KLA also provides inspection tools and systems for optical metrology and e-beam metrology. With a current stock price of $498.62, KLA Corp (NASDAQ:KLAC) has a market cap of $68 billion. But how does this compare to its GF Value?Unveiling KLA (KLAC)'s True Worth: A Comprehensive Guide to Its Market ValueUnderstanding GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure that estimates the current intrinsic value of a stock. This value is calculated based on historical trading multiples, an adjustment factor from GuruFocus based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line serves as a guide to the stock's ideal fair trading value.According to the GF Value, KLA (NASDAQ:KLAC) appears to be fairly valued. The GF Value estimates the stock's fair value at $475.01, considering historical multiples, internal adjustments based on past business growth, and future performance estimates. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it may be overvalued, indicating poor future returns. Conversely, if it's significantly below the GF Value Line, the stock may be undervalued, suggesting high future returns.Given that KLA is fairly valued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be close to the rate of its business growth.Unveiling KLA (KLAC)'s True Worth: A Comprehensive Guide to Its Market ValueLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with poor financial strength can lead to a higher risk of permanent capital loss. Therefore, it's crucial to review a company's financial strength before deciding to buy its stock. A great starting point is looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage. KLA has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.54, which is worse than 77.32% of 904 companies in the Semiconductors industry. GuruFocus ranks KLA's overall financial strength at 6 out of 10, indicating that it is fair.Story continuesUnveiling KLA (KLAC)'s True Worth: A Comprehensive Guide to Its Market ValueProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies carries less risk, especially those that have shown consistent profitability over the long term. Typically, a company with high profit margins offers better performance potential than a company with low profit margins. KLA has been profitable 10 years over the past 10 years. Its operating margin of 38.06% is better than 96.86% of 954 companies in the Semiconductors industry. Overall, GuruFocus ranks KLA's profitability as strong.One of the most important factors in the valuation of a company is growth. Companies that grow faster create more value for shareholders, especially if that growth is profitable.

Its 3-year average EBITDA growth is 40.6%, ranking better than 72.9% of 775 companies in the Semiconductors industry.Return on Invested Capital vs. Weighted Average Cost of CapitalReturn on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. In contrast, the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. Ideally, the ROIC should be higher than the WACC. For the past 12 months, KLA's ROIC is 37.17, and its cost of capital is 12.74.Unveiling KLA (KLAC)'s True Worth: A Comprehensive Guide to Its Market ValueConclusionOverall, KLA (NASDAQ:KLAC) stock appears to be fairly valued.

As recently as 2021 it commanded 40% of the mobile phone subscriber market and had a reputation for the best, most reliable network.Most Read from BloombergBiden Vows Aid for Gaza, Backs Israel Over Hospital BlastHospital Blast Kills Hundreds as Israel, Hamas Trade BlameQQQ Advances in Late Trading as Tesla Rebounds: Markets WrapTesla’s Runaway Growth Faces Reality Check in Turbulent EconomyUPenn Donors Pile Pressure on School as David Magerman Pulls SupportToday, a series of strategic errors have left Verizon in a precarious position. The costly purchases of AOL and Yahoo!, which were an attempt to grow in digital media, didn’t pan out. And a turn toward an alternative radio wave technology proved to be an unnecessary detour in the race to 5G, allowing T-Mobile USA Inc. to amass a two-year advantage. Verizon is now shedding more subscribers than it’s adding and has seen its market share shrink about 1.6% while T-Mobile has increased its share by about the same amount. Wall Street has made its disappointment known, sending the stock down 46% since the end of 2020.Two executives in as many years have tried and failed to pull Verizon out of this spiral. The third — the one widely seen as Verizon’s last chance to turn things around — is Sowmyanarayan Sampath. The nine-year company veteran was tapped earlier this year as the chief executive officer of Verizon’s consumer business, the unit that accounts for the vast majority of the company’s revenue. In May, he met with 400 managers and acknowledged the difficult path ahead.“You’ve onboarded more CEOs than most people do in a lifetime,” he said to his staff. “I’m going to work really hard so you don’t have to onboard another person.”The 47-year-old executive speaks softly but quickly, often peppering his sentences with a mix of self-deprecation and praise for others. But behind the bookish demeanor is a hard-driving tactician who isn’t afraid to butt heads with other department leaders to shake up the tradition-bound Bell Telephone culture. A history buff, Sampath has named his campaign to restore subscriber growth at Verizon “Project Trenton,” a reference to the 1776 against-all-odds victory that altered the course of the American Revolution.Story continuesThe stakes are high for Sampath and Verizon. If he’s successful in bringing Verizon back to sustained mobile phone subscriber growth — his target is 15% to 30% of the industry’s gains, or about 1 million new customers a year — he’ll undoubtedly earn a spot on a short list to eventually replace Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg, who has been in the role since 2019. If he fails, Verizon may be all but doomed to lose its leading position, one that could prove virtually impossible to regain in the fiercely competitive telecom industry.“We won’t lose,’’ Sampath said adamantly, during a recent lunch near Verizon’s corporate headquarters in Midtown Manhattan.Pulling Verizon out of its funk won’t be easy, as the big three phone companies are fighting fiercely for a shrinking pool of new subscribers. AT&amp;T Inc., after a costly attempt to compete with entertainment colossus Walt Disney Co., is now on a slash-and-burn mission to return to its roots as a mobile and broadband provider. And industry growth leader T-Mobile shows no signs of slowing, using its lead in 5G network technology as a selling point to trounce its bigger rival: T-Mobile is expected to gain more than ten times as many mobile phone customers this year.Verizon has lost about 200,000 mobile-phone customers since 2021, while T-Mobile has added more than 5 million, totaling 75.5 million now, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Verizon’s predicament is reminiscent of what happened to Nokia Oyj, said Tammy Parker, an analyst with GlobalData. For nearly a decade, the Finnish phone maker dominated the burgeoning mobile industry with its ubiquitous handsets. “But the success created a toxic mix of hubris, strategic mistakes and a lack of vision. Verizon’s fall from grace in consumer communications reflects all of those components.”Like Nokia, Verizon didn’t take its challengers seriously and failed to adjust to where the market was going. To avoid Nokia’s failure, Sampath isn’t bringing a radical new vision, he’s just trying to get Verizon to return to its priorities, which starts with customers.""Sampath has all the tools,” said Craig Moffett, an analyst with MoffettNathanson Research. “He’s incredibly smart, and he has a very clear view of each and every one of the levers he can pull.” But Moffett acknowledged Sampath faces a “hard problem to solve. It’s not a marketing problem, it’s a reality problem. Verizon charges a premium price for what used to be the best network in the country. But Verizon doesn’t have the best network anymore.""After spending more than $45 billion in 2021 to secure airwaves for faster wireless services, Verizon’s network upgrades will be largely complete by the end of the year. That should bolster Sampath’s efforts to woo back customers Verizon has lost to AT&amp;T through its aggressive free-phone campaign, and T-Mobile, with its 5G marketing juggernaut.While Sampath is a very qualified leader, consumer marketing isn’t one of his traditional strengths, said Peter Supino, an analyst at Wolfe Research. “Verizon is one of the largest consumer brands in the world and it’s pretty obvious it has had a rough run for the past few years,” Supino said. “I would love to hear Sampath’s vision for reviving the Verizon brand.”Sampath’s plan focuses on retail, where he’s moving more decision making to the front lines. Verizon has 6,500 stores and 65% of all its phone sales happen there. He wants to reduce the amount of time it takes to processes a new customer. “Thirty minutes is too long,” he said. To help improve responsiveness, he’s put a manager in every store, created a leaderboard system to measure wins and restored sales commissions. That effort has seemed to jumpstart the competitive juices among retail staff, according to some employees at a store in Manhattan’s Upper West Side, who weren’t happy that colleagues in Harlem were outselling them.Born in Kolkata, India, Sampath was always good with numbers. Instead of following his peers into engineering, he aimed at a career in accounting. After getting his MBA at Boston University, he worked as a finance consultant at KPMG, followed by a decade with the Boston Consulting Group, where he led the telecom practice.In 2014 he was hired by Verizon as the business transformation officer. To some longtime executives, Sampath was part of an annoying trend. One former Verizon executive said Sampath was seen as just another in a long procession of consultants that the company brought to help guide the way: guys with big ideas and lots of buzzwords.But Sampath isn’t a traditional Verizon executive. A practicing Hindu, he embraces his Indian culture and often wears vibrant traditional Nehru vests at the office, where the typical garb is a golf shirt under a blazer. Sampath loves to delve deeply into history and studies a different country every year. He prefers to read older material, nothing written in the past 20 years, to get beyond recent cultural associations, he said. He’s currently studying ancient China, which he’s given an extra year because there’s so much to learn. He sees himself as a bridge between a new generation and the old guard. He says his mentors are his parents, who taught him the importance of family and “not to be an ass.”Sampath has taken on many roles in nearly a decade at Verizon, coming on board during a difficult transitional period for the company as it modernized and moved toward a more nimble, software-run cloud centric network. He has had to twist arms to get a fiber rollout underway in Boston and corral far-flung regional chiefs to create a more efficient operation. But it was his ability to bring people together on tasks that earned him enough confidence from company leaders to be handed the toughest assignment of his life.“He has touched almost every part of the company in his time here,” said Vestberg. “He’s super smart and understands the broader industry. He’s turned into a fantastic operator with an intense focus on delivering results.”One of his first major assignments when he joined Verizon was to combine 21 different wireless territories into six regions. Mobile sales had been booming, growth was running at more than a 50% clip and the territories were given room to run wild during that time. But as growth slowed, some areas had to be roped in.“Each region was doing its own procurement and it’s own pricing plans. Each group was so autonomous that your badge would rarely work from one regional office and another,” Sampath said. He broke down the territorial divides and persuaded the all the managers that they were stronger if they worked together.Now, Sampath visits retail stores weekly and seeks progress reports from employees out in the field. He keeps a list of 30 people inside and outside the company that he talks to every week, trusting them to be candid about what’s working and what’s not. One of the biggest challenges Sampath faces is convincing staff that the old Verizon is no longer the best Verizon.“There are two types of people: those that tolerate change and those who embrace it,” Sampath said. “My whole career has been trying to take people who tolerate change and make them embrace it.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekJeep’s Jump to $100,000 SUVs Risks Leaving Loyal Buyers BehindThe Ozempic Effect Is Coming for Everything From Kidney to Heart Disease TreatmentsThe New Middle East Is an All-Too-Familiar NightmareBiden’s FCC Revives the Longest-Running Policy Fight in TechWall Street’s Surprising Quest for Ways to Finance Coal Again©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on stock market performance overall, head directly to 5 Worst Performing Dow Stocks YTD.In a July report by J.P. Morgan, it was stated that global economic growth is expected to slow down in the latter part of 2023, while inflation appears to be easing. However, it's worth noting that global core inflation is projected to remain elevated, staying above 3% until 2024. This ongoing high inflation will continue to exert pressure on central banks, potentially leading to further tightening measures. Bruce Kasman, Chief Global Economist at J.P. Morgan, said:“We do not think inflation is going to come back down to central bank comfort zones by themselves. Yes, there’s a decline going on. But no, we do not think you’re going to get inflation back below 3% in the U.S. or the euro area this year in an environment where supply has been damaged in a more lasting way and inflation psychology has shifted.”In the first half of 2023, global economic growth gained momentum, reaching a rate of 2.8%. So far, efforts to tighten monetary policies have balanced the diminishing impact of supply disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, starting in 2022, global policy rates have increased by nearly 400 basis points, affecting spending sensitive to interest rates and limiting industrial production. Despite the current growth momentum, it is believed that the global economy's resilience is decreasing. Consequently, it is expected that developed markets may undergo another round of tightening measures before the end of 2023 to control inflation. However, such actions may have adverse effects on the private sector's well-being. Consequently, there is a possibility of a synchronized global economic recession occurring, potentially before the end of 2024. J.P. Morgan Research anticipates that the United States may experience a mild recession toward the end of 2023. This is attributed to the Federal Reserve's conservative monetary policy, which is leading to stricter credit availability and a gradual decline in economic growth. The Western European economy faced challenges during the winter due to high energy prices. Although the first quarter of 2023 showed some improvement, overall economic growth remained relatively stagnant.Story continuesIn the first six months of 2023, there was a noticeable variance in stock performance, with differences observed in size, sectors, and investment styles. Surprisingly, this occurred amidst an unusual period of low volatility. Looking ahead, without any proactive measures from the Federal Reserve, experts expect a more difficult economic environment for stocks in the latter part of 2023. A similar less optimistic outlook is observed for equity markets in other regions across the world. Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, Global Head of Equity Macro Strategy at J.P. Morgan, stated:“Given that multiple expansion has been the main driver of performance year to date, we see unattractive risk-reward for equities and increasing investor complacency ahead of our expectation that the business cycle will further decelerate in the second half of the year, with the onset of a recession likely in the fourth quarter of 2023 or first quarter of 2024. What’s more, consumers are starting to show signs of weakness, and there is a risk that liquidity and credit conditions could tighten in the coming months.”According to S&amp;P Global, the Dow Jones Industrial Average showed improvement in September, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 but still experiencing a decline of 3.5%; -3.42% with dividends considered. However, when we consider the year-to-date performance, the Dow has lagged significantly behind the S&amp;P 500, with a gain of 1.09%;  2.73% with dividends, while the S&amp;P 500 has recorded an increase of 11.68%. This difference in performance is primarily attributed to how these indices are constructed, with factors like price weighting versus market value weighting playing a role. Historically, these differences tend to align, but in shorter time frames, disparities can emerge.In this article, we discuss some of the worst performing Dow stocks which include Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), 3M Company (NYSE:MMM), and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA).Worst Performing Dow Stocks YTDPhoto by nick chong on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe sorted the following Dow stocks based on year-to-date share price performance of each stock.

The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Year-to-Date Share Price Performance as of October 11: -4.63%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 92The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) functions as a global entertainment business. It is divided into two parts – Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution; and Disney Parks, Experiences and Products. On September 19, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)’s stock saw a decrease of over 3%. This decline followed the company's announcement of significant investments in its Parks segment, with the goal of doubling the current investment.The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) stock has faced setbacks due to the negative news surrounding its conflict with Florida legislators over a controversial education law. This has contributed to wider concerns that the streaming industry's growth is slowing down, impacting the outlook for The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)’s Disney+ streaming service.As per Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 92 hedge funds were bullish on The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), compared to the last quarter when 95 funds had invested in the stock. Nelson Peltz’s Trian Partners held a significant position in the company, with over 6.4 million shares worth $573.63 million.In addition to Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), 3M Company (NYSE:MMM), and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is one of the worst performing Dow stocks YTD.Diamond Hill Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Our bottom contributors in Q2 included health insurance company Humana, bio-pharmaceutical company Pfizer and global entertainment company The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). Disney’s Bob Iger returned to the CEO’s seat in November 2022, replacing Bob Chapek, who left following a turbulent tenure. As a result of disappointing quarterly results and incremental commentary suggesting a more inline strategy with other media, the market has become less confident that Iger will achieve a turnaround by the end of his 1.5- year contract. We continue to believe Disney has a unique collection of assets and owns some of the best content among all media companies. Their ability to monetize this content across many platforms — studio, theme park, toys, streaming — is incredibly valuable; thus we remain investors.”14.

(NYSE:GS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Back in 2019, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) made a splash in the card industry by working with Apple and MasterCard on a credit card. The actual card is fairly sleek (as you can see below), as customers' names are etched into an Apple titanium card. The no-fee card generated a lot of hype, as many early users were quick to post their latest card on various social media sites.The initial goal of Marcus (back in 2016) was to leverage Goldman’s wonderful name brand and build a full-service digital bank. This card was a large piece of GS’s ambitions to grow its retail banking franchise called Marcus. After 5 years, Marcus now has 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances. Surprisingly, Marcus now represents nearly 20% of the firm’s total revenue.We thought it would be interesting to look at how the Apple Card is doing in terms of loans and exposures. With over $100 billion in assets, this has been a successful source of cheap deposits for GS. Despite having an institutional / “white shoe” brand in the investment banking and trading world, GS’s Apple Card has been a disappointment.”8.

(Jonathan Newton / Associated Press)If you're unhappy with the high cost and low quality of your internet service — and who isn't? — the reason is easy to pinpoint.It can be found in an ill-considered, cynical and overtly pro-business decision in 2018 by the Trump-controlled Federal Communications Commission to abdicate its authority over broadband internet service and repeal rules guaranteeing network neutrality, a core principle of the open internet.As I wrote when the change was first proposed  by the FCC's Republican chair, the former telecommunications company lawyer Ajit Pai, consumers would inevitably feel the pain.[Broadband] is essential infrastructure for modern life. No one without it has a fair shot at 21st century success.FCC Chair Jessica RosenworcelInternet service would become more expensive, and users would have less choice. Internet service would be dominated by a few big content providers, with smaller and potentially more innovative providers shouldered out of the way.Every one of those predictions came true, I'm sorry to say.Now there's a glimmer of hope that the FCC could get its arms back around internet service. Current FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel, a former Democratic Senate aide, has proposed restoring the FCC's authority over broadband providers as well as the net neutrality rules that were in place until Pai killed them.The commission will vote Oct. 19 on whether to move ahead with the rule-making and start taking public comments.One quick primer about the meaning of net neutrality. It means simply that internet service providers can’t discriminate among content providers trying to reach you online — they can’t block websites or services, or degrade their signal, slow their traffic or, conversely, provide a better traffic lane for some rather than others.The principle is important because control over traffic gives ISPs tremendous power, especially if they control the last mile of access to end users, as do cable operators such as Comcast and telecommunications firms such as Verizon.Story continuesRead more: Column: This AI chatbot was 'trained' using my books, but don't blame me for its incredible stupidityRosenworcel laid out her proposal in a Sept. 26 speech in Washington. Her starting point was the observation that broadband connectivity is no longer a luxury in the modern world.""It is a necessity,"" she said. ""It is essential infrastructure for modern life. No one without it has a fair shot at 21st century success.""Yet the 2018 repeal left the U.S. without any regulatory supervision of this crucial industry. Left to their own devices, broadband companies spent the intervening years continuing a preexisting trend away from competition and toward consolidation through mergers.""That is why almost half of us lack high-speed service with 100 megabit-per-second download speeds or can only get it from a single provider,"" Rosenworcel said. ""In fact, only one-fifth of the country has more than two choices at this speed.""As a result, she pointed out, ""if your broadband provider mucks up your traffic, messing around with your ability to go where you want and do what you want online, you can't just pick up and choose another provider .... You need a referee on the field looking out for the public interest — and ensuring your access is fast, open and fair.""There's nothing particularly new about Rosenworcel's proposal — she's merely aiming to restore the level playing field in broadband services established as long ago as 2004, during the George W. Bush administration.The FCC's regulatory initiatives came under court attack by the telecommunications industry, but the legal uncertainties were ultimately resolved under President Obama and FCC Chair Tom Wheeler in 2015. The commission's ban on paid prioritization, blocking of content, and throttling — that is, degrading the signals from content the service providers wished to discourage for its own economic interests — remained in place until Trump's team of vandals overturned them.The telecom firms supported Pai's initiative with a campaign of unexampled dishonesty. As New York Atty. Gen. Letitia James later disclosed, the industry flooded the FCC with millions of fraudulent public comments, many signed by nonexistent or dead people. Three companies that handled the commenting for the industry had to pay $4 million in penalties.Read more: Column: The bogus, homophobic campaign against Biden's stellar FCC nomineePai cited that torrent of comments to justify his rollback of net neutrality; in fact, public opinion polls consistently showed 80% support for keeping net neutrality in place.The vacuum of regulatory oversight was felt almost immediately.While trying to quell the Mendocino Complex wildfire in Northern California in 2019, the Santa Clara County Fire Department discovered that its internet connection provider, Verizon, was throttling its data flow virtually down to zero, cutting off communications for firefighters in the field. One firefighter died in the blaze and four were injured.Verizon managers refused to restore service until the Fire Department signed up for a new account that more than doubled its bill. Verizon later acknowledged that it should not have done that.Telecom industry stooges maintained that the fiasco had nothing to do with net neutrality, since Verizon had the right to throttle traffic even before the policy change. But that's wrong.The change left the Fire Department with no regulatory recourse, because the FCC had withdrawn from virtually any oversight of internet services. As a result of the repeal, Rosenworcel said in her speech, ""the FCC lacked the authority to intervene.""The lack of federal authority over broadband has troubling implications not only for public safety, as it did in Santa Clara County, but for national security, cybersecurity, network reliability and privacy protection, Rosenworcel said. Federal officials have no authority to monitor outages or security standards. Rules guaranteeing privacy protection for telephone users exist, but not for anyone with a broadband subscription.With the federal government missing in action, the task of enforcing network neutrality has fallen to the states. California was the first to enact its own rules, passing a law in 2018 that replicated the original FCC standards almost verbatim, with enforcement left in the hands of city attorneys, county district attorneys and the state attorney general. Maine, New Jersey, Colorado, Oregon, Washington and Vermont soon followed.Read more: Column: Big business musters more lies to smear a Biden nominee because she would do her job (By the way, when the California Legislature was debating its law, seniors in the state were inundated with robocalls claiming that the measure would raise cellphone bills by $30 a month and slow down their speeds, neither of which was true. One of the organizations behind the calls listed AT&amp;T and Verizon as sponsors or supporters, though the companies disavowed responsibility for the calls.)The state laws are a gratifying certification of public opinion, but Rosenworcel is right to say that it's no substitute for consistent federal oversight. ""When you are dealing with the most essential infrastructure in the digital age, we benefit from one national policy"" rather than ""a patchwork of state regulations,"" she said in her speech.Don't be surprised if the telecom industry's attack on Rosenworcel's proposal exceeds the ugliness of its effort to support the rollback of net neutrality. Among other factors, big internet service providers have gotten bigger, richer and more entrenched since 2017, so they have more to lose by the revival of net neutrality.The industry signaled its determination to keep net neutrality dead and buried through its despicable campaign against Gigi Sohn, President Biden's original nominee for the vacant Democratic seat on the FCC.Sohn was an uncompromising supporter of net neutrality and an outspoken critic of the FCC's abandonment of its regulatory responsibilities. Her unquestioned expertise in telecommunications law would have made her a stellar spokesperson for the public interest as a commissioner.So the industry defamed her with the filthiest, most dishonest smears imaginable, culminating in a burst of homophobic slurs. Faced with this onslaught, Sohn withdrew her nomination in March. Biden subsequently nominated Anna Gomez, who was confirmed by the Senate last month, finally giving Rosenworcel the majority she needs to push her policies forward.The only question is whether she's too late. In government, it's often harder to correct a mistake than to commit it in the first place.There's no question that the FCC's repeal of network neutrality and its abandonment of broadband oversight were blunders of the first order. Making the internet fulfill its role as an indispensable utility in the modern age may be the most important imperative on the FCC's agenda.Get the latest from Michael HiltzikCommentary on economics and more from a Pulitzer Prize winner.Sign me up.This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

The survey data, comprising responses from 681 small and midsize businesses across the country, demonstrates that small businesses have a constant need to increase connectivity to meet business demands and are exploring the applications of emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), but as their technology dependence grows, looming concerns regarding cybersecurity persist.“The fact that nearly half of small and midsize businesses are either using or are aware of the AI-specific use cases that can drive their companies forward highlights what we hear from our customers every day regarding their desire to stay ahead of the pace of change to drive their business forward,” said Aparna Khurjekar, Chief Revenue Officer, Business Markets and SaaS, at Verizon Business. “For businesses looking to learn more about what emerging technologies can do for them, our upcoming Small Business Days is a fantastic opportunity to meet with one of our experts and through a complimentary tech check to understand what possibilities exist.”Key findings:Using AI to address labor challenges and more. More than a third of small and midsize businesses (35%) believe AI can help offset pain points caused by labor shortages. Additionally, to enable small business owners to spend more time on their core business and with customers, 46% would find value or are using AI to drive order processing, and the same amount also see AI being utilized in inventory management and supply chain operations.Concerns about AI. Though more and more small and midsize businesses are exploring AI solutions, many are still leery of its implementation. Nearly half (45%) are concerned about integrating AI solutions, and 43% are worried AI tools will expose them to cybersecurity risks.Upgrading internet bandwidth. In 2020, more than a quarter (27%) of small and midsize companies upgraded their internet connection bandwidth. The economic shutdown drove much of that, as businesses had no choice but to operate digitally in order to reach customers. But even after the economy reopened, businesses continue to upgrade their bandwidth: 52% in 2021, 51% in 2022 and 53% in 2023. This continued desire for increased bandwidth highlights the growing digital dependency for businesses of all sizes.Cybersecurity lags behind digitalization. A good portion of small and midsize businesses are failing to invest in cybersecurity proportionately to their investment in internet bandwidth and other technology upgrades. Only one in three have implemented new systems of technology to ensure security, and almost half (45%) do not offer their employees any training on cybersecurity practices.Inflation remains a top concern. Eighty-one percent of respondents are concerned about the impact inflation will have on their business. Four out of five business owners have experienced increased costs in the last year. Additionally, 59% have either raised or planned to raise the prices of goods and services and a similar number (57%) have either reduced or plan to reduce their spending on non-essential items and activities. In spite of these concerns, most business owners (63%) are expecting an increase in demand this holiday season.Story continuesVerizon Small Business Days (October 16-22)Small Business Days are back taking place October 16-22, providing businesses with special discounts, a free “tech check,” and business advice.

273,2e67f6e0-0b41-3c53-ac3a-13c466c3227e,TPR,2023-10-13,Investors in Tapestry (NYSE:TPR) have seen favorable returns of 53% over the past three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-tapestry-nyse-tpr-seen-165823722.html,1697129903,STORY,['TPR'],"[Tapestry, Inc. (NYSE:TPR) shareholders might understandably be very concerned that the share price has dropped 36% in the last quarter. But that shouldn't obscure the pleasing returns achieved by shareholders over the last three years. To wit, the share price did better than an index fund, climbing 43% during that period.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. See our latest analysis for Tapestry There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Tapestry became profitable within the last three years. So we would expect a higher share price over the period.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Tapestry has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on how its financial position has changed over time.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Tapestry, it has a TSR of 53% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveInvestors in Tapestry had a tough year, with a total loss of 6.8% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 20%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 5% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Tapestry better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Tapestry , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Story continuesIf you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

""Go all-in. Don't play to come back. Don't play as if there's another hand. If there's another hand, let that be a surprise, and we'll figure out what to do next.""Huang, speaking from the steps of his alma mater, had already made his next great gamble — this time on AI. A decade later, to say Nvidia has had a good 2023 would be an understatement.The company’s name — drawn from the Latin word for envy, “invidia” — has never been more apt, as Nvidia became a key player enabling and benefiting from the AI boom. The chipmaker’s graphics processing units, or GPUs, are in dizzying demand from giants like Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL).The problem is simple: If you want to train a large language model, like ChatGPT or Meta’s Llama 2, you need the processing power to do it, and that processing power comes from their graphics chips. These AI models would take decades to train without advanced GPUs, which Nvidia spent years perfecting. While competitors like Intel (INTC) and AMD (AMD) have been caught flat-footed, Nvidia is the only real player in town.(Right now, there’s such a high demand for their GPUs, that even they are running out of chips.)Over the last 12 months, Nvidia stock is up more than 300%. And over the past five years, the company's shares are up over 650%.But Nvidia could have died at the table years ago. Huang, famed for his love of leather jackets, has an almost swashbuckling instinct that's led the company to staggering highs — and dangerous lows.Amidst the AI gold rush, Nvidia’s past brushes with mortality seem distant. However, according to Acquired podcast co-host Ben Gilbert, they anchor Nvidia’s idiosyncratic identity, which is only now being recognized. (Nvidia was so criminally undercovered that no one has yet to publish a book about the company.)Story continues“Nvidia has gotten to where they are by at least two, maybe three, times completely going all in and betting the company on a new idea that could have killed the company, but they were right every single time,” said Gilbert.Huang wasn't available to be interviewed for this article.Nvidia Co-founder, President, and CEO Jensen Huang speaks at the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company in Phoenix on Dec. 6, 2022. (AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)An existential crisis: 1997In 1997, James Cameron's ""Titanic"" was a megahit and the PC market was almost as hot, dominated by the likes of Compaq, Dell, and Hewlett-Packard.Nvidia, founded four years before, was looking for a win. Started with just $40,000 in the bank and conceived of in meetings at Denny's, Nvidia had yet to release a product that would secure its future.“They got off on the wrong foot,” said Gilbert, about Nvidia's earliest chips. The NV1, released in 1995, tried to do too much too fast. It was an off-kilter shape, and though the 3D graphics weren't bad, the chip was expensive. Its other functions, like audio, were merely acceptable.By 1997, Huang and his co-founders, Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem, were at an impasse. With just nine months of runway left, Nvidia had to pull one out of the hat — or fold. Huang decided to shell out a third of their remaining cash up front to speed up the development of the Riva 128 chip, the first consumer GPU for 3D graphics.Soon, Nvidia was out of money and out of time. The Riva 128 went straight into production, with the company's fate in the balance.It worked.The chip, which combined 2D and 3D graphics for revolutionary picture quality, changed the standard for gaming graphics. The Riva 128 became Nvidia's first mainstream success, and the company went from near-disaster to listing on the Nasdaq two years later.Huang and his Nvidia co-founders had pushed in all their chips — and won another hand to play.An image of the Riva 128 chip, provided by Nvidia.Betting the farm: 2006-2017According to investors, for the better part of a decade, Nvidia wasn’t growing. Between 2009 and 2015, Nvidia’s market cap held relatively flat, lingering between $8.5 billion and $10 billion.But quietly, Nvidia was stretching its muscles. During this period, Huang made his most controversial gamble: CUDA, or “Compute Unified Device Architecture.” The platform enables GPUs to be used beyond video games for general processing in a range of fields, from physics to auto manufacturing to AI.Reading this in 2023, that might seem obvious. But turn back the clock by a decade, and central processing units, or CPUs, reigned in computers and phones. Graphics cards like Nvidia’s were siloed off and dismissed as gamer tech. The 2012 ImageNet competition, a vaunted software contest, showed that GPUs could ultimately do more than CPUs, with the right infrastructure. But no one cared… except for computer scientists and Huang.When Nvidia first released the CUDA in beta in 2006, it made waves in computer science circles but was hardly a conversation starter at cocktail parties, said Arthur Carvalho, a Miami University professor.""It was revolutionary. It was this breakthrough moment — but on the technical side,” he said via phone.Wall Street didn’t get it, but Huang bet the farm on CUDA anyway. SEC filings show that Nvidia invested nearly $12 billion in R&amp;D from 2006 to 2017 while reeling in revenues in the single billions. In 2014, for example, Nvidia spent over 30% of its $4.13 billion revenue on research and development. Much of the investments during that period went towards CUDA.Shareholders and analysts complained and scoffed, and many backed away from the company entirely.“Some investors were big Nvidia fans in the late 2000s and gave them the benefit of the doubt for the first five years of the CUDA investment,"" said Gilbert. ""But in the mid-2010s, market demand still wasn't showing up in a big way, and it was becoming a bigger and bigger investment.""A headshot of Bryan Catanzaro, VP of Applied Deep Learning Research at Nvidia, provided by the company.Bryan Catanzaro, Nvidia's vice president of applied deep learning research, has been with the company since 2008. His sense of that time was that Nvidia and Huang were the underdogs, that Wall Street and company watchers fully expected CUDA to be a company-changing — translation: ending — failure.""It made all of our products more expensive since we were selling these gamer cards while putting computing acceleration into them,"" he told Yahoo Finance on a video call. ""It took a lot of commitment to follow through. … I would say it was about 10 years before Wall Street really started to believe this investment was worth anything.""Today, that company-changing ""failure,"" CUDA, is what drove Nvidia to a trillion-dollar valuation — and made them the go-to for AI companies.An investor’s eye viewLike Taylor Swift, Nvidia's had distinct eras — but a number of long-term investors have stuck it out, waiting for a moment like this.Greg Halter, Carnegie Investment Counsel's research director, first bought Nvidia stock on the firm's behalf in 2011. The firm increased its position substantially in 2018 and, today, Nvidia is among Carnegie's 10 largest holdings.But Halter remembers tougher times. For example, in 2018 and 2022, Nvidia found itself with a ""crypto hangover,"" as sliding cryptocurrency prices led to stark declines in demand for Nvidia's chips, commonly used for crypto mining.""There are times where a stock price will move dramatically, as opposed to the actual business, actual revenues, and actual cash flow,"" said Halter. ""That’s something you have to tune out if you have a good company.”Nvidia, throughout its 30-year history, has also weathered life-threatening lawsuits from competitors, questionable acquisitions, and a sputtering push into mobile. A chief criticism of Nvidia is that the company trend-chases, an idea that Halter and others push back on. They produce processing power, and processing power takes the shape of the flavor of the month.But AI was their end game: The company delivered the very first GPU to a fledgling OpenAI in 2016, through a long-standing relationship with its co-founder Ilya Sutskever — one of the winners of that 2012 software competition.And now, their believers are rewarded for their patience. Nvidia’s tech and competitive moat in AI are real and the byproduct of risky, long-term investment, said Wealth Consulting Group CIO Jim Worden, who has been investing in Nvidia for a decade.""Nvidia has got the lead time in terms of competition, and I don't see AMD or Intel coming close to where they're at,"" said Worden over the phone. ""It's a race, it's a sprint, and if someone's a few laps ahead of you in that sprint, it's going to be hard to catch up.""'When an airplane is falling out of the sky, every foot matters'Despite its appetite for dangling from the precipice, Nvidia has maintained workplace stability for its crew of 26,000. There were some layoffs throughout its history — for example, in 2008 — but mass firings are few and far between.Huang has retained much of his staff over the years. Nvidia confirmed to Yahoo Finance that, of staff directly reporting to Huang today, seven have been at Nvidia for more than 20 years, four have been with Huang for more than 15 years, and three for more than 10 years. Nvidia’s institutional memory might just be its greatest asset.""Jensen often says that when an airplane is falling out of the sky, every foot matters,"" said Catanzaro.The lack of turnover at Nvidia is unusual and unexpected — both because it’s a tech company and because of Huang’s willingness to go to the edge. Or perhaps, it's that kind of in-the-weeds conviction among Huang and his team that has gotten Nvidia this far.“I think he has conviction to bet so boldly because he does understand the technologies, the markets, and the use cases soup to nuts,” said Gilbert.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaks during a press conference at The MGM during CES 2018 in Las Vegas on January 7, 2018. (MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images) (MANDEL NGAN via Getty Images)And Huang doesn’t hedge. He doesn’t make multiple bets. The employees at Nvidia are so used to living on the brink of disaster that in the face of overwhelming success, their behaviors and philosophies aren’t changing.“Working at Nvidia feels existential every day,” said Catanzaro. “It doesn’t matter what the market cap is. We feel like the company is going to go bankrupt tomorrow. We all feel that way.”The existential dread isn't entirely misplaced in a fast-evolving sector like tech. Nvidia, for all its preparations, isn't yet meeting the generational demand shock for its chips, leaving customers scrambling for any and all GPUs they can find.That gap — between the need for chips now and Nvidia's ability to provide them en masse — could make way for a future competitor to grab a piece of its pie. Analysts have previously warned Yahoo Finance that a surge in competition for Nvidia is inevitable. There are also concerns about an AI bubble from banks like Morgan Stanley and investors like Alan Patricof. Nvidia may have gained the upper hand, but the game is just beginning.Then, there's the final risk. Anyone willing to bet big over and over will someday lose — it's not a question of if, but of ""by how much?"" and when.Today, with a skyrocketing share price, Huang could cash in, walk away from the table, and make a killing. But he’s won another hand, and he’s going to play it.“What is the definition of success? A good share price is important, of course,” Huang told those college students 10 years ago. “However, are you doing work that is relevant? Are you doing work that is exquisite? Or are you doing work that results in a great stock price? I have not figured out how to do all three at one time. However, in the long term, it all seems to work out.”Allie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, CME Group Inc.'s CME and Coinbase Global, Inc. COIN.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:AZEK is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that engages in the manufacturing and selling of building products for residential, commercial, and industrial markets in the United States.The stock fell apart in 2022 but has rallied over 100% off those lows from last year. Investors have seen a 25% sell-off over the last month, so the question right now is if the stock is a buy before earnings.The bulls might have a case to stay long as analyst estimates are moving higher as the stock tests technical support. This makes the current trading level an attractive area to enter the stock.About the Company AZEK was founded in 2013 and is headquartered in Chicago, IL. The company operates through two segments: Residential and Commercial.The residential side designs and manufacturers decking, railing, trim, molding, and other similar products. The commercial side manufactures engineered polymer materials used in various industries.The stock has a Zacks Style Score of ""B"" in Growth and Momentum. It has a Forward PE of 27 and pays no dividend. AZEK currently employs over 2,100 and has a market cap of $4 billion.Q1 Earnings Beat In early August AZEK reported a Q3 beat of 15%. The company also saw a slight revenue beat and guided FY23 higher, seeing $1.34-1.36B v the 1.3B expected.The company also raised FY23 EBITDA and Capex. Margins were higher at 25% v 21.9% last year.Management commented that demand signals are providing a positive backdrop for the remainder of the building season. They added that the residential segment sell-through growth is improving versus the prior quarter.Story continuesThe stock reacted positively, moving about 5% higher after EPS. From there, the stock drifted to February 2022 highs before starting to trend lower.Analyst Estimates Analyst estimates have been trending higher since before earnings and have continued to be taken higher since the August earnings report.Looking at the current quarter, estimates are moving 20% higher over the last 90 days. For the next quarter, estimates have gone from $0.02 to $0.07 over that same time frame, a move of 250%.Looking at the longer term, estimates are moving higher as well.For the current year, analysts have taken numbers from $0.57 to $0.68, or 19%. For next year, we see estimates jump from $0.86 to $1.05, or 22%.Analyst have also raised their price targets since the earnings report.Goldman reiterated its Buy and lifted its price target to $37 from $32. JPMorgan Chase lifted its target to $37 from $30 and reiterated its Overweight.AZEK next reports in November and a recent note from Jefferies saying they expect a guide coming in line with consensus. They expect growth in 2024 and believe the stock will react favorably to earnings.The TechnicalsThe stock has recently sold off and now resides right at the 200-day moving average. The selling went hand in hand with the overall market sell-off and the move higher in interest rates.Investors have a solid entry point at the 200-day, which lines up with a 61.8% Fibonacci retracement drawn from May lows to recent highs. This setup provides a good risk reward against the March lows while looking for a return to 2023 highs.Bottom Line After a rough ride in 2022, AZEK looks poised to provide solid fundamentals into next year. Earnings are scheduled for the end of November and will be a catalyst for the direction of the stock.The recent pullback provides a good risk reward for bullish investors and a starter position should be considered at current levels.Bear of the Day:Morgan Stanley is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that provides various financial products and services to corporations, governments, financial institutions, and individuals.The stock is trading near lows as earnings approach next week. Investors should be cautious as the price action does not look great ahead of the print. Additionally, analyst estimates have been falling for the last few months.About the Company Morgan Stanley is one of the most recognizable names on Wall Street. It was founded in 1924 and is headquartered in New York, New York.The company employs over 80,000 people.The company's business is divided into three segments:The Institutional Securities segment contributed 45.5% of total net revenues in 2022 and includes activities such as capital raising, corporate lending, trading, and market-making.The Wealth Management segment also accounted for 45.5% of 2022 revenues. It provides brokerage and investment advisory services covering various investment alternatives.The Investment Management segment is the smallest, bringing in 9% of revenues. It provides global asset management products and services in equity, fixed-income, and alternative investments.MS is valued at $130 billion and has a Forward PE of 14. The stock holds Zacks Style Scores of ""F"" in Growth, Momentum and Value. The stock pays a dividend of 4.3%.Q2 Earnings Morgan Stanley last reported in July, seeing an 8% EPS beat. The company beat on revenues and the Wealth and Management segment added $100B in new assets.However, other areas including Institutional securities, fixed income, equity revenue and investment management were down year over year.Management commented that the firm delivered solid results in a challenging market environment. While this was certainly true for Q2, analyst have been lowering estimates for the upcoming quarter and beyond.EstimatesOver the last 90 days, numbers for the current quarter have been taken down from $1.45 to $1.28, or 12%.For the current year, analysts have lowered estimates by 8% over that same time frame.Looking at the longer term, numbers are going lower as well. For next year, estimates have fallen from $6.98 to $6.82 over the last 30 days or almost 2%.The company will report on October 18th and investors should be aware of this momentum lower. While expectations are low an earnings miss could bring the stock to new 2023 lows.Technical TakeOver the last two years, Morgan Stanley has traded between $70 and $105. The stock now sits at the bottom of that range and is at lows of the year, down 8% in 2023.While it might be tempting to buy into the pullback, the stock is well below its moving averages.

Trading at 2023 lows going into earnings is not a bullish sign and investors should be patient.Additional content:3 Crypto Stocks to Buy as Bitcoin Attempts Another ReboundThe cryptocurrency market staged a solid rebound this year after a disappointing 2022 as the Federal Reserve's monetary tightening campaign, which saw aggressive interest rate hikes to combat multi-decade high inflation, weighed on cryptocurrencies.However, cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE) and BNB (BNB), have been rangebound over the past three months as investors are yet to get a clear picture about the Fed's future course of action with its interest rate hikes.Bitcoin particularly had been on a rally till July, with its price hitting $31,500. However, the Fed has since hiked interest rates once in July, following which cryptocurrencies took a hit once again. In fact, Bitcoin has been falling since hitting its 52-week high in early July.However, it has also solidified its position over the past few weeks and is now hovering around $26,900 after falling as much as $25,400 in late August and September.The rebound has been taking place since the Fed kept its benchmark policy rate unchanged in its September FOMC meeting to its current range of 5.25-5.25%.A higher market interest rate has a negative impact on high-growth sectors such as technology, consumer discretionary and cryptocurrencies. The Fed's aggressive monetary tightening policy has also raised worries that the economy might slip into a recession.Fed Chair Jerome Powell, in his first post-FOMC comment, said that inflation remains elevated, which might require the central bank to hike interest rates by another 25 basis points before it starts cutting interest rates in 2024.Following Powell's hawkish comments, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury Note surged to its highest level since 2007. The 10-year Treasury yield holds immense significance as it mirrors market participants' outlook on the nation's economic situation, influencing consumers, businesses and government entities.However, cryptocurrencies are once again trying to rebound from their recent lows as investors' sentiments have been upbeat following dovish comments from a number of Fed officials. These officials believe that the recent tightening of credit conditions may make the central bank decide not to go for another interest rate hike in its November FOMC meeting.Our ChoicesNVIDIA Corp. is a major player in the semiconductor industry and has been one of the standout success stories of 2023.

The S&amp;P 500 was up by 14.8% in that same period.The phase III study evaluated Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic as a therapy for preventing the progression of renal impairment in people with type II diabetes and chronic kidney disease (“CKD”). The study’s promising outcome led to its early completion following a recommendation from an independent data monitoring committee.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOzempic Data Raises ConcernFresenius Medical has a major presence in the global dialysis market. The dialysis of patients also drives the majority of the company’s revenues. The positive data from Novo Nordisk’s late-stage study on Ozempic has raised concern about a potential rise in competition for Fresenius Medical’s dialysis business.Ozempic is currently approved in the United States for the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus in adults, adjunct to diet and exercise. However, the recent late-stage study data demonstrated its ability to delay the progression of CKD and lower the risk of kidney and cardiovascular mortality.A delay in the progression of CKD and a lower risk of kidney mortality will likely lead to fewer patients requiring dialysis. Any potential disruption in the dialysis market will have a significant impact on FMS’ topline. The company is already grappling with higher costs and expenses that have led to lower operating income guidance for 2023 during the second quarter’s earnings call.Any loss of sales for Fresenius Medical following the availability of NVO’s Ozempic will further put a strain on the company’s bottom line going forward. The availability of Ozempic may also lead to higher selling expenses to fight competition.Story continuesThese potential concerns have led investors to dump the stock, leading to a significant decline in the share price yesterday. The magnitude of yesterday’s fall may have provided momentum for further decline over the next few days.Fresenius Medical Care AG &amp; Co. KGaA Price Fresenius Medical Care AG &amp; Co.

283,ba7f491d-1467-3af6-b692-cd960edb7810,MCK,2023-10-13,McKesson (MCK) Upgraded to Strong Buy: Here's What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mckesson-mck-upgraded-strong-buy-160006132.html,1697126406,STORY,['MCK'],"[McKesson (MCK) appears an attractive pick, as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for McKesson basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for McKesson imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for McKessonThis prescription drug distributor is expected to earn $27.08 per share for the fiscal year ending March 2024, which represents a year-over-year change of 4.4%.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for McKesson. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 2.6%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of McKesson to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

286,9c1f5a5e-516a-3fbb-b4ee-1b25ceb2b6c8,TRV,2023-10-13,15 Worst Performing Dow Stocks YTD,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-worst-performing-dow-stocks-205251948.html,1697143971,STORY,"['^DJI', 'DIS', 'GSBD', 'HD', 'PG', 'CVX', 'MCD', 'MRK', 'JNJ', 'HON', 'TRV', 'VZ']","[In this article, we discuss 15 worst performing Dow stocks year-to-date. If you want to skip our detailed discussion on stock market performance overall, head directly to 5 Worst Performing Dow Stocks YTD.In a July report by J.P. Morgan, it was stated that global economic growth is expected to slow down in the latter part of 2023, while inflation appears to be easing. However, it's worth noting that global core inflation is projected to remain elevated, staying above 3% until 2024. This ongoing high inflation will continue to exert pressure on central banks, potentially leading to further tightening measures. Bruce Kasman, Chief Global Economist at J.P. Morgan, said:“We do not think inflation is going to come back down to central bank comfort zones by themselves. Yes, there’s a decline going on. But no, we do not think you’re going to get inflation back below 3% in the U.S. or the euro area this year in an environment where supply has been damaged in a more lasting way and inflation psychology has shifted.”In the first half of 2023, global economic growth gained momentum, reaching a rate of 2.8%. So far, efforts to tighten monetary policies have balanced the diminishing impact of supply disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, starting in 2022, global policy rates have increased by nearly 400 basis points, affecting spending sensitive to interest rates and limiting industrial production. Despite the current growth momentum, it is believed that the global economy's resilience is decreasing. Consequently, it is expected that developed markets may undergo another round of tightening measures before the end of 2023 to control inflation. However, such actions may have adverse effects on the private sector's well-being. Consequently, there is a possibility of a synchronized global economic recession occurring, potentially before the end of 2024. J.P. Morgan Research anticipates that the United States may experience a mild recession toward the end of 2023. This is attributed to the Federal Reserve's conservative monetary policy, which is leading to stricter credit availability and a gradual decline in economic growth. The Western European economy faced challenges during the winter due to high energy prices. Although the first quarter of 2023 showed some improvement, overall economic growth remained relatively stagnant.Story continuesIn the first six months of 2023, there was a noticeable variance in stock performance, with differences observed in size, sectors, and investment styles. Surprisingly, this occurred amidst an unusual period of low volatility. Looking ahead, without any proactive measures from the Federal Reserve, experts expect a more difficult economic environment for stocks in the latter part of 2023. A similar less optimistic outlook is observed for equity markets in other regions across the world. Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, Global Head of Equity Macro Strategy at J.P. Morgan, stated:“Given that multiple expansion has been the main driver of performance year to date, we see unattractive risk-reward for equities and increasing investor complacency ahead of our expectation that the business cycle will further decelerate in the second half of the year, with the onset of a recession likely in the fourth quarter of 2023 or first quarter of 2024. What’s more, consumers are starting to show signs of weakness, and there is a risk that liquidity and credit conditions could tighten in the coming months.”According to S&amp;P Global, the Dow Jones Industrial Average showed improvement in September, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 but still experiencing a decline of 3.5%; -3.42% with dividends considered. However, when we consider the year-to-date performance, the Dow has lagged significantly behind the S&amp;P 500, with a gain of 1.09%;  2.73% with dividends, while the S&amp;P 500 has recorded an increase of 11.68%. This difference in performance is primarily attributed to how these indices are constructed, with factors like price weighting versus market value weighting playing a role. Historically, these differences tend to align, but in shorter time frames, disparities can emerge.In this article, we discuss some of the worst performing Dow stocks which include Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), 3M Company (NYSE:MMM), and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA).Worst Performing Dow Stocks YTDPhoto by nick chong on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe sorted the following Dow stocks based on year-to-date share price performance of each stock. For each stock have mentioned the reason behind its underperformance. We have also assessed the hedge fund sentiment toward each stock from Insider Monkey’s database of 910 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2023. The list is arranged in order of the lowest to highest year-to-date share price loss of each firm as of October 11.Worst Performing Dow Stocks YTD (And Why)15. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Year-to-Date Share Price Performance as of October 11: -4.63%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 92The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) functions as a global entertainment business. It is divided into two parts – Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution; and Disney Parks, Experiences and Products. On September 19, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)’s stock saw a decrease of over 3%. This decline followed the company's announcement of significant investments in its Parks segment, with the goal of doubling the current investment.The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) stock has faced setbacks due to the negative news surrounding its conflict with Florida legislators over a controversial education law. This has contributed to wider concerns that the streaming industry's growth is slowing down, impacting the outlook for The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)’s Disney+ streaming service.As per Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 92 hedge funds were bullish on The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), compared to the last quarter when 95 funds had invested in the stock. Nelson Peltz’s Trian Partners held a significant position in the company, with over 6.4 million shares worth $573.63 million.In addition to Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), 3M Company (NYSE:MMM), and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is one of the worst performing Dow stocks YTD.Diamond Hill Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Our bottom contributors in Q2 included health insurance company Humana, bio-pharmaceutical company Pfizer and global entertainment company The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). Disney’s Bob Iger returned to the CEO’s seat in November 2022, replacing Bob Chapek, who left following a turbulent tenure. As a result of disappointing quarterly results and incremental commentary suggesting a more inline strategy with other media, the market has become less confident that Iger will achieve a turnaround by the end of his 1.5- year contract. We continue to believe Disney has a unique collection of assets and owns some of the best content among all media companies. Their ability to monetize this content across many platforms — studio, theme park, toys, streaming — is incredibly valuable; thus we remain investors.”14.

(NYSE:GS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Back in 2019, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) made a splash in the card industry by working with Apple and MasterCard on a credit card. The actual card is fairly sleek (as you can see below), as customers' names are etched into an Apple titanium card. The no-fee card generated a lot of hype, as many early users were quick to post their latest card on various social media sites.The initial goal of Marcus (back in 2016) was to leverage Goldman’s wonderful name brand and build a full-service digital bank. This card was a large piece of GS’s ambitions to grow its retail banking franchise called Marcus. After 5 years, Marcus now has 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances. Surprisingly, Marcus now represents nearly 20% of the firm’s total revenue.We thought it would be interesting to look at how the Apple Card is doing in terms of loans and exposures. With over $100 billion in assets, this has been a successful source of cheap deposits for GS. Despite having an institutional / “white shoe” brand in the investment banking and trading world, GS’s Apple Card has been a disappointment.”8.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 10 Best Dividend Aristocrats According to Analysts. With the stock market facing ongoing fluctuations, investors are experiencing the frustration of seeing their profits disappear. For instance, the S&amp;P 500 increased by 19.5% from January to July 2023 but has since fallen by 6%. Considering the Federal Reserve's inclination to maintain higher interest rates for an extended period, negative investor sentiment, and the typical seasonal decline, it appears that the momentum of this summer's market rally might continue to weaken as we enter the fall season. According to analysts, investors can mitigate their losses by investing in dividend stocks.Dividend stocks are already a popular choice among investors due to their reliability in providing a steady stream of income. Between 1993 and the end of last year, the S&amp;P 500 index increased by 777%. But with dividends included, the S&amp;P 500 grew by over 1,400% during that same time frame. In addition to this, when we examine the performance of the S&amp;P 500 on a decade-by-decade basis, we can see that the role of dividends in contributing to the total return has fluctuated over time. From 1930 to 2021, dividends accounted for an average of 40% of the S&amp;P 500's total return.A recent study conducted by Morgan Stanley's chief investment officer, Mike Wilson, found that stocks that pay dividends tend to perform better in the long run and are more resilient during market downturns. Here are some comments from the analyst, taken from his interview with Business Insider this month.""Our economists are of the view that inflation will continue to slow from elevated levels over the next 12 months. That backdrop is supportive of owning dividend-related factors and defensive dividend payers, in particular.""Story continuesHe further said:""Dividends provide a positive return cushion with a notable portion of outperformance for payers versus non-payers coming during periods of market volatility. Specifically, the majority of outperformance comes during large market pullbacks such as 2000, 2008, 2015, and 2020.""The Business Insider report also revealed that stocks that started paying dividends in 2000 have outperformed the market since then. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) have been raising their dividends for decades, becoming top choices for investors.

Here is what the firm has to say:“We were fairly active in the quarter as market dislocations allowed us to be opportunistic, while focusing on companies with stronger moats, better pricing power, more predictable long-term growth and higher returns. In the materials sector we exited PPG Industries, Inc. (NYSE:PPG) and initiated a position in Sherwin-Williams. While both companies operate in the paint and coating industry and are benefiting from improving margins as raw material prices have come down of late, we believe Sherwin-Williams’ dominant retail footprint affords it better pricing power through the cycle. The company provided conservative 2023 guidance and has been successfully gaining market share in the pro segment. While PPG has more European and industrial exposure, Sherwin-Williams’ residential and more domestic focus should also benefit the company as housing indicators appear to be troughing. Weak housing in the face of higher mortgage rates caused Sherwin-Williams stock to sell off in the first quarter, creating a compelling investment opportunity for long-term focused fundamental investors.”21.

288,a25533c2-fbef-3e89-9442-e598d8c1e4b9,GPC,2023-10-13,Genuine Parts (GPC) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/genuine-parts-gpc-reports-next-140036685.html,1697119236,STORY,['GPC'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Genuine Parts (GPC) reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 19, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis auto and industrial parts distributor is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.40 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +7.6%.Revenues are expected to be $5.89 billion, up 3.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.37% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Genuine Parts?For Genuine Parts, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.54%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Genuine Parts will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Genuine Parts would post earnings of $2.33 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.44, delivering a surprise of +4.72%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Genuine Parts doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

290,0fd4d496-c3ef-35ed-b31c-a22d13be4e9e,CMI,2023-10-13,Here's Why Cummins (NYSE:CMI) Has Caught The Eye Of Investors,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-cummins-nyse-cmi-112828763.html,1697196508,STORY,['CMI'],"[The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Cummins (NYSE:CMI). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. See our latest analysis for Cummins How Fast Is Cummins Growing?If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. We can see that in the last three years Cummins grew its EPS by 17% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. EBIT margins for Cummins remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 30% to US$32b. That's encouraging news for the company!You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Cummins.Story continuesAre Cummins Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$33b company like Cummins. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$147m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.5% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.While it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. Our quick analysis into CEO remuneration would seem to indicate they are. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to Cummins, with market caps over US$8.0b, is around US$12m.Cummins offered total compensation worth US$7.1m to its CEO in the year to December 2022. That comes in below the average for similar sized companies and seems pretty reasonable. While the level of CEO compensation shouldn't be the biggest factor in how the company is viewed, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.Does Cummins Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?As previously touched on, Cummins is a growing business, which is encouraging. The growth of EPS may be the eye-catching headline for Cummins, but there's more to bring joy for shareholders. Boasting both modest CEO pay and considerable insider ownership, you'd argue this one is worthy of the watchlist, at least. We should say that we've discovered 1 warning sign for Cummins that you should be aware of before investing here.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a free list of them here.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

Here are some takeaways.Read More: Hollywood Studios, Striking Actors in Standoff as Talks CrumbleSuperagent Emanuel likes where Warner Bros. Discovery Inc.’s David Zaslav and Walt Disney Co.’s Bob Iger are headed. Not so much Fox Corp. or Paramount Global.Netflix co-CEO Sarandos said contract talks with striking actors broke down over their demand for a “levy” on streaming customers.Hybe founder and Chairman Bang Si-Hyuk said the globally popular K-pop band BTS is working on a 10th anniversary album and will reunite.Kris Jenner, matriarch of TV’s Kardashian family, worries about the impact of social media, particularly on her grandchildren. She’s not alone.There are too many sports documentaries, according to Bill Simmons, founder of the sports and culture site the Ringer.Actor-writer-producer Issa Rae calls artificial intelligence “terrifying.”Ghostwriter, an anonymous producer and songwriter, sees record labels eventually embracing AI.Netflix Inc. co-Chief Executive Officer Sarandos said talks with striking actors broke down after the union asked for a “levy” on streaming customers on top of a bonus plan for successful shows that the media companies had already offered.The ask “just felt like a bridge too far to add this deep in the negotiations,” Sarandos said.Story continuesThe Screen Actors Guild has been on strike since July, seeking improved pay, a share of streaming revenue and restrictions on the use of artificial intelligence. A separate strike by writers just ended.Sarandos said that a sound editor working on the company’s first original series in Israel, Lior Waitzman, was among the victims of the Hamas attack over the weekend. His credits include the series Fauda and Tehran.“Our hearts are out to Lior and his family and anyone else who may have lost somebody in Israel on Saturday,” he said.Separately, Netflix announced plans to open two new permanent stores in the US in 2025, with the goal of opening more physical locations globally with restaurants, stores and activities tied to its TV shows and films.AI Booster Ghostwriter Sees Label Cooperation Coming (7:10 p.m.)Ghostwriter, the anonymous creator behind the viral AI-generated track Heart on My Sleeve, said record labels will soon find a business model around synthetic voices.“Everything has to start somewhere and it’s always rough when you kick it off,” he said Thursday. “It takes time to acclimate, to figure it out, to build the business model, and then once that happens it’ll find its place.”Ghostwriter foresees a future where labels officially license artists’ voices and share in the revenue made from songs using their sound.The artist — who took the stage in an all white outfit and goggles to mask his identity — said he’s a producer and songwriter. His viral song was meant to be an experiment and was wholly human-made, apart from the AI-generated voices of Drake and The Weeknd. Streaming services eventually removed the track, though people can still find it online.“This is bigger than me or who I am,” he said.Bill Simmons: Too Many Sports Documentaries (6:25 p.m.)One of the most successful sports podcasters, Bill Simmons said there are too many sports documentaries and he’s concerned that to get access to the best athletes you now have to cooperate with them on the productions.“A lot of the ideas have been done,” said Simmons, creator of The Ringer sports and culture network.Simmons also said regional sports networks are over and that Walt Disney Co. should sell ESPN to Apple Inc.Writer-Actor Rae Likens AI Debate to Sci-Fi (6 p.m.)“It feels like a Black Mirror episode,” writer-producer-actor Issa Rae said. “There has to be consent for your likeness.”Calling AI “terrifying,” Rae said a person’s likeness is what they bring to the table. While it may be cost efficient to use technology to fill people in as extras, actors need to participate in the success of their productions.Rae, who was featured in the blockbuster film Barbie, said her goal is to add to her music company Hoorae Media with a production studio to promote creators of color.AI negotiations will be an ongoing process, she said, and that studios and guilds need to work together to prevent technology companies from using existing scripts to train AI models.Lakshmi Says Mideast Conflict Hard to Talk About (4:45 p.m.)Padma Lakshmi, the author, activist and Emmy-nominated host of the Hulu food show Taste the Nation, said she found it difficult to comment on the Israeli-Hamas war on social media.“It’s one of those issues that’s really hard to talk about, especially online in short format in social media, because anything you say is going to be a platitude,” she said. “If you express empathy for one group that means you’re an anti-Semite. If you express empathy for the horrible, horrible thing that’s happened right now then you don’t believe that these people over here, the Palestinians, should have a homeland.”Lakshmi also shared how she uses Taste the Nation to talk about political issues through stories about food.“It’s really about giving communities that have never had mainstream exposure and sort of an A-List treatment like that,” she said. “That’s what we strive to do and I always wanted to do that because I think those stories are interesting, and I think they’re interesting to other people in the country.”BTS Works on 10th Anniversary Album (4:10 p.m.)Members of the K-pop group, which is on a short break from performing, renewed their contracts in September, with plans to reunite in 2025, Hybe Co. founder and Chairman Bang Si-Hyuk said at the Bloomberg Screentime conference.Read More: K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTS in LABang also said his 10-year goal is to establish a plan for the company to be sustainable without him.“I’m not announcing my retirement,” he said. “The ideal plan is that the company should be running and sustaining itself without, you know, any single person.”Maria Sharapova Cites Tennis’ ‘Untapped Potential’ (3:40 p.m.)The former No. 1 women’s tennis player, Maria Sharapova pointed said there remains a significant pay gap between men and women tennis pros outside of the sport’s four major tournaments.“The disparity is insane,” she said at the Bloomberg Screentime conference.Media reports have suggested the Women’s Tennis Association may merge with the Association of Tennis Professionals, which could alleviate some of that gender inequality, but Sharapova said she doubts it will happen anytime soon.Byron Allen Says Disney Isn’t Ready to Sell ABC (3:15 p.m.)Media mogul Byron Allen said he texted Walt Disney Co. CEO Bob Iger with his offer to buy ABC and other channels but that the executive isn’t ready to sell.“They’re not there,” Allen said, adding he won’t have any trouble raising money to fund the purchase and he is more likely to get regulatory approval because he doesn’t own as many stations as other bidders.“When Bob is ready I’m going to chase it down like a lion chasing a gazelle,” he said.Allen, a former stand up comic who now owns a string of TV stations and the Weather Channel, said NFL owners need to change limits on borrowing and minimum investment requirements so that people of color can buy a team.“I’d love to put a half a billion, a billion into an NFL team,” he said. “It is the true religion of America. It’s the highest rated television content by far.”Kris Jenner Discusses Move to Hulu (2:55 p.m.)The matriarch of the Kardashian family discussed the move to Hulu from E with their flagship TV series, now called The Kardashians.“I really felt like streaming was in the cards for us,” Kris Jenner said Thursday at the Bloomberg Screentime conference. “We wanted to elevate what we were doing and streamline the show and have it have a new audience.”She also discussed the plusses and minuses of being social-media celebrities.“I mean, it’s just an negative place at times, but then it’s a great place at times,” she said. “And it’s an amazing focus group, a built-in focus group. It’s such a tool, but it can be a little scary too.”Jenner wears an Oura Ring that measures sleep quality, and she competes with her daughter, Kim, for the highest score.“Now it’s become this little obsession,” she said.YouTube Live-Sports Focus Is NFL (2:20 p.m.)Neal Mohan, chief executive officer of Alphabet Inc.’s YouTube, says that when it comes to live sports competition his focus remains on the NFL, not the NBA.In December, YouTube TV outmaneuvered rivals to win the right to broadcast the National Football League’s Sunday Ticket games, starting with the current 2023 season, in a deal valued at more than $2 billion per year over seven years.Meanwhile, there’s been growing speculation over who will televise NBA games when the league’s deals expire in 2025.Asked at the Bloomberg Screentime conference about the NBA, Mohan said “they have been longtime partners” and operate “one of the largest channels on our platform.”But “in terms of our focus right not,” he added, “it’s about this NFL experience.”YouTube Draws 1.3M Fans to Sunday Ticket (1:45 p.m.)Die-hard fans of live sports are migrating online in big numbers, responding to the multibillion-dollar investments by major technology companies, the research firm Antenna suggests in a new report.The NFL Sunday Ticket, now distributed by YouTube, has attracted an estimated 1.3 million sign-ups, Antenna said Thursday. That exceeds the 1.2 million customers the service reportedly had under its old distributor, DirecTV.The package, which lets fans watch games not shown on local channels, is also driving new subscribers to YouTube TV, a $73-a-month online alternative to cable television. About 41% of Sunday Ticket subscribers are new customers to YouTube TV.“It’s a really great win-win for the NFL and YouTube,” Jonathan Carson, Antenna’s co-founder and chief executive officer, said in an interview.Superagent Ari Emanuel kicked the event off Wednesday evening with comments that touched on the hostilities in the Middle East, rival Creative Artists Agency, as well as his assessment of some of the largest media companies including Paramount Global and Fox Corp.EA May Still Seek FIFA PartnershipElectronic Arts Inc. executive Laura Miele, speaking at the conference on Thursday, said her company may seek to reengage with global soccer body FIFA even though the two organizations failed to reach a new agreement over the company’s use of the brand in its video games.“We will look to potentially do World Cup partnerships,” she said.Tune in here for continuing coverage of the Screentime event.(Updates with employee’s death in sixth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekJeep’s Jump to $100,000 SUVs Risks Leaving Loyal Buyers BehindThe Ozempic Effect Is Coming for Everything From Kidney to Heart Disease TreatmentsThe New Middle East Is an All-Too-Familiar NightmareWall Street’s Surprising Quest for Ways to Finance Coal AgainBiden’s FCC Revives the Longest-Running Policy Fight in Tech©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

The attraction will have two rides — a boat trip through a winter wonderland featuring music from the movies, and a sleigh-themed roller coaster — as well as a restaurant serving Nordic-inspired food.World of Frozen is a big bet for Disney in Hong Kong, with the firm already helping fund a HK$10.9 billion ($1.4 billion) expansion of the park that also includes a Marvel-themed attraction. The operation has reported eight consecutive annual losses, including last year’s HK$2.1 billion deficit, as it struggled to entice tourists to the world’s smallest Disneyland park and Covid curbs hammered the travel sector.“This beloved franchise will elevate Hong Kong Disneyland’s global presence,” said Michael Moriarty, managing director of Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. The firm is committed to continually delivering new and innovative offerings, he said.Beyond Hong Kong, though, Disney wants to expand its already dominant position as world’s largest theme-park operator.Read More: Disney Falls After Doubling Park Spending to $60 BillionIt’s laid out an ambitious plan to nearly double spending on its theme parks and resorts to $60 billion over the next 10 years, citing a boost to the bottom line from rides, cruises and other attractions. The company is looking to maximize a division that’s growing strongly, as it wrestles with seismic changes in the film and TV industry as well as challenges for its streaming business including market saturation in the West and increasing competition in Asia.Story continuesThe company says it has more than 1,000 acres of land it could develop and has signaled it wants to do more with some of its most popular characters. Disney already has plans to open Frozen-themed attractions in Tokyo and Paris. Meanwhile, Shanghai Disneyland will get a Zootopia attraction later this year.Read More: Chinese Swap Hermes for Cafes in Blow to Hong Kong TourismThe new attraction also serves as a litmus test for Hong Kong’s broader efforts to revive an economy that’s been battered by years of pandemic isolation. The government, which owns 52% of the city’s Disneyland park, has rolled out a series of campaigns aimed at reinvigorating the financial hub’s appeal to visitors and stimulating consumption, but which so far have fallen flat.Visitors to the Hong Kong park will have to shell out more cash should they go in peak season. Last month, the city’s Disneyland announced a one-day ticket for popular days and seasons will cost HK$879 for people aged 12 and older, while a standard one-day pass for other times will be HK$639. Annual pass holders will be able to go to World of Frozen on select dates starting Oct. 23.Frozen is one of Disney’s highest-grossing franchises. Combined, the two films — the first released in 2013 and the follow up in 2019 — have earned $2.7 billion worldwide, according to Box Office Mojo. The popularity of the movies has led to a sprawling empire that includes a Broadway musical, short films, a podcast and merchandise that spans toys to costumes.

294,9c1f5a5e-516a-3fbb-b4ee-1b25ceb2b6c8,DIS,2023-10-13,15 Worst Performing Dow Stocks YTD,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-worst-performing-dow-stocks-205251948.html,1697143971,STORY,"['^DJI', 'DIS', 'GSBD', 'HD', 'PG', 'CVX', 'MCD', 'MRK', 'JNJ', 'HON', 'TRV', 'VZ']","[In this article, we discuss 15 worst performing Dow stocks year-to-date. If you want to skip our detailed discussion on stock market performance overall, head directly to 5 Worst Performing Dow Stocks YTD.In a July report by J.P. Morgan, it was stated that global economic growth is expected to slow down in the latter part of 2023, while inflation appears to be easing. However, it's worth noting that global core inflation is projected to remain elevated, staying above 3% until 2024. This ongoing high inflation will continue to exert pressure on central banks, potentially leading to further tightening measures. Bruce Kasman, Chief Global Economist at J.P. Morgan, said:“We do not think inflation is going to come back down to central bank comfort zones by themselves. Yes, there’s a decline going on. But no, we do not think you’re going to get inflation back below 3% in the U.S. or the euro area this year in an environment where supply has been damaged in a more lasting way and inflation psychology has shifted.”In the first half of 2023, global economic growth gained momentum, reaching a rate of 2.8%. So far, efforts to tighten monetary policies have balanced the diminishing impact of supply disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, starting in 2022, global policy rates have increased by nearly 400 basis points, affecting spending sensitive to interest rates and limiting industrial production. Despite the current growth momentum, it is believed that the global economy's resilience is decreasing. Consequently, it is expected that developed markets may undergo another round of tightening measures before the end of 2023 to control inflation. However, such actions may have adverse effects on the private sector's well-being. Consequently, there is a possibility of a synchronized global economic recession occurring, potentially before the end of 2024. J.P. Morgan Research anticipates that the United States may experience a mild recession toward the end of 2023. This is attributed to the Federal Reserve's conservative monetary policy, which is leading to stricter credit availability and a gradual decline in economic growth. The Western European economy faced challenges during the winter due to high energy prices. Although the first quarter of 2023 showed some improvement, overall economic growth remained relatively stagnant.Story continuesIn the first six months of 2023, there was a noticeable variance in stock performance, with differences observed in size, sectors, and investment styles. Surprisingly, this occurred amidst an unusual period of low volatility. Looking ahead, without any proactive measures from the Federal Reserve, experts expect a more difficult economic environment for stocks in the latter part of 2023. A similar less optimistic outlook is observed for equity markets in other regions across the world. Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, Global Head of Equity Macro Strategy at J.P. Morgan, stated:“Given that multiple expansion has been the main driver of performance year to date, we see unattractive risk-reward for equities and increasing investor complacency ahead of our expectation that the business cycle will further decelerate in the second half of the year, with the onset of a recession likely in the fourth quarter of 2023 or first quarter of 2024. What’s more, consumers are starting to show signs of weakness, and there is a risk that liquidity and credit conditions could tighten in the coming months.”According to S&amp;P Global, the Dow Jones Industrial Average showed improvement in September, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 but still experiencing a decline of 3.5%; -3.42% with dividends considered. However, when we consider the year-to-date performance, the Dow has lagged significantly behind the S&amp;P 500, with a gain of 1.09%;  2.73% with dividends, while the S&amp;P 500 has recorded an increase of 11.68%. This difference in performance is primarily attributed to how these indices are constructed, with factors like price weighting versus market value weighting playing a role. Historically, these differences tend to align, but in shorter time frames, disparities can emerge.In this article, we discuss some of the worst performing Dow stocks which include Verizon Communications Inc.

We continue to believe Disney has a unique collection of assets and owns some of the best content among all media companies. Their ability to monetize this content across many platforms — studio, theme park, toys, streaming — is incredibly valuable; thus we remain investors.”14.

The actual card is fairly sleek (as you can see below), as customers' names are etched into an Apple titanium card. The no-fee card generated a lot of hype, as many early users were quick to post their latest card on various social media sites.The initial goal of Marcus (back in 2016) was to leverage Goldman’s wonderful name brand and build a full-service digital bank. This card was a large piece of GS’s ambitions to grow its retail banking franchise called Marcus. After 5 years, Marcus now has 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances. Surprisingly, Marcus now represents nearly 20% of the firm’s total revenue.We thought it would be interesting to look at how the Apple Card is doing in terms of loans and exposures.

The studios earlier smashed the guild that is led by Fran Drescher for making costly demands and abandoning productive negotiations while the SAF-AFTRA responded by accusing the AMPTP of using the “bullying tactics” that they already tried on the WGA to cripple their deliberations. It seems that studios mistakenly thought that they will easily solve their conflict with SAF-AFTRA after coming to an agreement with the WGA who recently approved a new three-year contract that includes pay raises, AI protection of writers and other gains, ending the five-month strike. Striking actors and raised prices is certainly not the challenge Disney needs right now as it looks for ways to renew the growth of its kingdom that has been lacking magic.Disney Hiked Prices For The Second Time This YearOn Thursday, Disney rose its streaming prices in response to DTC profitability challenges and loss of subscribers.Back in August, Disney posted streaming losses for the third quarter of $512 million with Disney+ subscribers dropping 7.4% from the previous quarter. to 146.1 million.Disney announced the price hikes in August, with these increases impacting the monthly price of the ad-free Disney+ and Hulu plans in addition to the Hulu live TV packages and ESPN+ subscription. The Disney+ ad-free plan is now 27% more expensive as its monthly cost in the U.S. is $13.99 which is double the $6.99 monthly cost Disney charged when it first launched its streaming star in 2019.Additionally, Disney will also be applying this strategy on its theme parks so visiting the world’s happiest places will also cost more.Story continuesIger Has Too Many Fires To Put DownAlong with streaming headwinds, Disney is also facing a parks business slowdown, a a broken linear TV business model and a weak box office that fails to impress. Although Iger came back to save Disney, things are clearly not going according to plan as the world’s biggest entertainment company entered what seems to be an existential crisis. His two-year CEO timeline has been extended to four years as the once-America’s-most-beloved-chief-executive-officer who orchestrated modern-day Disney’s biggest business magic isn’t able to Mary Poppins his way out of this mess. But then again, sequels almost always fail to live up to the original.Netflix Remains The King Of Streaming, But It Cannot Afford To Ignore The Harsh Reality Of The Industry.Netflix first launched streaming in the U.S. in 2007 and by being the leader for 16 years, it gathered a massive user base that now has 238 million global subscribers. With its first-mover advantage and tremendous scale, Netflix built a solid financial footing with even the iconic Disney lagging behind on the profitability front as its DTC segment which covers Disney+, Hulu and ESPAN+ delivered an operating loss of whopping $2.2 billion through the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 that ended on July 1st. But even Netflix will have to deal with increased costs due to writers’ and actors’ strikes, although it is still in a more favorable position than Disney. Additionally, the collapsed negotiations imply that that production of scripted shows scheduled for autumn remains on hold.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

This year's loan volume also eclipsed the previous high mark of 1,739 SBA loans M&amp;T approved in 2016.The average size of one of the bank's SBA loans in 2023 was $123,076 – about $18,500 lower than M&amp;T's average loan size in 2022.This is the first year M&amp;T has finished as the No. 1 SBA lender in Connecticut – an important milestone for the bank following its 2022 acquisition of Bridgeport, Conn.-based People's United Bank.

You can skip our detailed analysis of passive income ideas and dividend stocks, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks For Passive Income. Passive income is becoming increasingly popular among people from diverse backgrounds. It's an appealing idea, especially with the current economic uncertainty, and it's capturing the attention of investors more than ever. According to a survey by LendingClub Corp. and Pymnts.com conducted in March this year, nearly half of working people have a side job or another source of extra income, like selling handmade items. Surprisingly, it's not just those with lower income; even people making $100,000 a year often seek additional income to cover their expenses. The report also mentioned that consumers could be collecting over $50 billion in total every month from their extra earnings, and a significant part of this money might not be reported to tax authorities.Passive income often arises from investments, assets, or activities that need very little ongoing work after they are established. Passive exchange-traded funds, that aim to replicate the performance of a specific market index or asset class, are important in this regard. In one of our articles, we referred to James Seyffart’s statement from Bloomberg Intelligence, who mentioned that passive investing is steadily on the rise in the US. Currently, passive mutual funds and ETFs own around 19% of the average publicly traded U.S. stock, which is three times higher than it was in 2013.Investing in dividend stocks is also one of the most reliable ways to generate passive income. Dividend-paying stocks help investors receive regular dividend payments, typically on a quarterly basis, without having to actively work or make ongoing investments. This income can provide a steady cash flow, making it a reliable source of passive income. In addition to this, dividend stocks have significantly contributed to the market’s overall returns. Between 2013 and 2022, dividends accounted for 17% of the overall returns in the S&amp;P 500 Index. But if we consider a much longer period, going back to the 1930s, dividends contributed to 37% of the returns.Story continuesThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the best dividend stocks as these companies have been raising their payouts year after year. To create passive income, it's vital that dividends consistently increase over time. In this article, we will further discuss dividend stocks to earn passive income.12 Best Dividend Stocks For Passive IncomePhoto by Sharon McCutcheon on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of Q2 2023 and picked companies that have raised their dividends for at least 10 consecutive years or more. From that list, we narrowed down our options to companies with strong financial positions and steady cash flow, indicating reliable future dividends for generating passive income. We then sorted these companies in ascending order based on the number of funds that hold stakes in them as of the second quarter of 2023.12. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is an American multinational telecommunications and media conglomerate. The company is also one of the largest cable television and broadband internet service providers in the country.In the second quarter of 2023, Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) reported revenue of $30.5 billion, which showed a 1.6% growth from the same period last year. The company's operating cash flow for the quarter came in at roughly $7.3 billion and its free cash flow amounted to $3.4 billion. It also returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends during the quarter, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks for passive income.The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some other reliable options for generating passive income.Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) has raised its dividends for 15 years in a row. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.29 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.65%, as of October 12.At the end of Q2 2023, 66 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database reported having stakes in Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), down from 68 a quarter earlier. The consolidated value of these stakes is over $3.14 billion.ClearBridge Investments mentioned Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) in its Q3 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Long-term holdings Charter and Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) delivered strong second-quarter results relative to expectations; their stable recurring revenue streams and undemanding valuations were rewarded in the current environment. Cable multiples compressed over the past 24 months on fears of heightened competition in their core broadband business from fixed wireless and fiber providers. While fiber remains a competitive alternative to cable broadband over the long term, high upfront investments and a materially higher cost of capital are resulting in slower buildouts than previously expected. Fixed wireless also continues to gain traction, particularly in rural markets, but share gains also appear to be moderating. At the same time, both Comcast and Charter are expanding their footprints into rural and adjacent markets while gaining wireless market share, leveraging their mobile virtual network operator agreements with Verizon. We think both cable companies are well-positioned to continue to grow while generating substantial free cash flows. We added to Comcast during the quarter.”11.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the retirement phenomenon within the U.S., and go directly to read the Retirement Stock Portfolio: 5 Low Risk Investments.In 2021, the economy faced persistent challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic's enduring impact. Despite recovery efforts, several significant hurdles created uncertainty regarding the revival. Inflation reached levels not seen in years, supply-chain disruptions hindered economic growth, and a limited labor pool presented ongoing difficulties for employers. This was further complicated by a record number of individuals either changing roles or leaving the workforce. Additionally, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic led to a growing interest in retirement among Americans.Retirees globally are exploring avenues to boost their income through investments due to the highest inflation recorded in nearly four decades. Addressing this concern, the Social Security Administration alleviated the situation by announcing an 8.7% increase in benefits earlier this year to mitigate the impact of inflation, as cited by Bloomberg. With this adjustment, the average retiree benefit has reached $1,827 per month, marking a $146 increase from the previous year. However, given the average annual household expenses for individuals aged 65-74 amounting to approximately $53,000, these social security benefits fall short of covering living costs adequately.Despite the data mentioned earlier, the United States possesses a thriving and robust retirement industry. McKinsey's research indicates that the U.S. retirement market boasts a substantial $26 trillion in assets. This data also forecasts a remarkable shift: by 2030, retirees are expected to contribute more to global consumption than individuals in the working age range of 15 to 59 years in China. Within the retirement industry, the largest segment—Defined Contribution—accounts for approximately 30% of the total assets, totaling around $8 trillion, and generates an impressive $30 billion in revenue for managing firms. This segment oversees approximately 110 million accounts and has shown consistent growth over the past decade.Story continuesLastly, an integral facet of retirement involves the assisted living community sector, commonly known as old age homes. These facilities offer seniors companionship and care during the later stages of their lives. As detailed in a research report by Grand View Market Research, the assisted living industry was valued at around $91.8 billion in 2022 and is anticipated to undergo a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.53% from 2023 to 2030. Within this market, the segment dedicated to individuals aged 85 and above held the largest market share in 2022. Looking towards 2040, the senior population in this age bracket is expected to more than double, rising from 6.4 million in 2016 to an estimated 14.6 million.Shares of prominent companies such as The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are favored by retirees due to their consistent free cash flow and impressive histories of dividend growth. In the following sections, we'll explore additional low-risk stock options suitable for retirement portfolios.Retirement Stock Portfolio: 10 Low Risk InvestmentsPhoto by Max Harlynking on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor our list of the 10 best low-risk stocks for a retirement portfolio, we used a stock screener to come up with a list of stocks with a beta value of less than 1.

The primary stakeholder was John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors, possessing a significant stake in the company valued at $398.9 million.Coho Partners Relative Value Equity Fund made the following comment about CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“In December of 2017, CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) agreed to buy Aetna, which broadened its offering by entering the managed care business. CVS has been moving its portfolio to a more value-based outcome model, and Aetna was a major move in that direction. We were willing to accept the leverage that came with the deal because CVS has a very cash generative model, and we anticipated the free cash flow would enable the company to de-lever fairly quickly.By mid-2022, CVS was in a position to use the free cash flow that had been going to debt repayment to do bolt-on deals to further prepare for the value-based outcome model and/or return more cash to shareholders in the form of higher dividends or share repurchases. However, CVS lost a “star” in its largest Medicare plan in late 2022 and this will adversely impact earnings in 2024. This was a surprise and disappointment to us, but management should be able to regain the “star” in the back half of 2023, which will then give the company a nice tailwind in 2025…” (Click here to read the full text)7. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67Dividend Yield as of 12/10: 0.72%Beta Value: 0.78Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) operates an international chain of membership warehouses, mainly under the “Costco Wholesale” name, that carry quality, brand-name merchandise at substantially lower prices than are typically found at conventional wholesale or retail sources.

Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is one of the most prominent stakeholders of the company, with 807,709 shares worth more than $434.8 million.RiverPark Advisors mentioned Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its Q2 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), founded in 1983, is the world’s third-largest retailer with 850 stores, $240 billion in revenue and 68 million members spread across North America, Europe, Asia, and the Southern Pacific Region. The company is known for its strong value proposition driven by high-quality low-cost offerings including a well-regarded private-label brand. Costco regularly ranks at the top of customer surveys related to brand trust, product price and quality, and all-around experience. Historically, 90% of the company’s shoppers renew their memberships, which generate more than 50% of operating income.Through expanding market share, new store openings, increasing member productivity, and omnichannel expansion, we believe the company can grow revenues annually in the high single digit percentage range. This revenue growth should yield steadily growing margins and EPS growth in the low-to-mid-teens, which should drive shareholder returns in the same range.”6. PepsiCo, Inc.

In the prior week to Sept. 29, crude inventories saw a draw of 2.224M barrels.Industry analysts tracked by Investing.com had predicted a crude draw of 1.4M barrels instead for last week.US crude production jumps 300,000 barrels daily to reach record highBut more riveting than that crude inventory spike was the EIA’s estimate of crude production in the just-ended week, which the agency put at 13.2M barrels per day — up 300,000 from the prior week. It was the highest ever government estimate on crude production, which prior to this had not exceeded the 13.1M peak reached just before the March 2020 outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic that decimated crude demand.The EIA has been estimating higher crude production for the United States in recent months, citing higher efficiency in output at US shale oil basin despite a sheer cutback in the number of oil rigs actively deployed by drillers.“It’s staggering how far US oil production has come in just a few months this year to reach this record high cited by the EIA,” said John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital.Crude exports slow after hitting peak in Q3As for crude stockpiles, they ballooned last week as exports, often a juggernaut in the weekly EIA report, fell almost 2 million barrels to reach 3.067M per day versus the 4.956M per day level during the week to Sept. 29.Crude exports hit a record high just shy of 4 million barrels per day in the first half of the year, the EIA said in a separate report on Wednesday.Story continuesProcessing of crude oil into fuel and other products also dropped last week, by almost 2%, to 85.7% as refineries went into maintenance.“It’s the combination of lower exports and lower refinery runs that led to this humongous build in crude stockpiles,” observed Kilduff.While crude stocks rose, inventories of gasoline fell last week after the biggest build in nearly two years the prior. Gasoline stockpiles fell by 1.313 million barrels last week versus a forecast drop of 1.0M and the prior week’s build of 6.481M. Gasoline is the No. 1 US fuel product.Distillates inventories also fell by 1.837M last week, more than the forecast 1.0M and adding to the previous drop of 1.269M. Distillates are refined into heating oil, diesel for trucks, buses, trains and ships and fuel for jets.Related ArticlesUS oil production at record high, crude stocks up 10.2M barrels last week - EIAOil reverses gains after US posts large crude buildOil rallies, then pares gains sharply as US cites record production]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of passive income ideas and dividend stocks, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks For Passive Income. Passive income is becoming increasingly popular among people from diverse backgrounds. It's an appealing idea, especially with the current economic uncertainty, and it's capturing the attention of investors more than ever. According to a survey by LendingClub Corp. and Pymnts.com conducted in March this year, nearly half of working people have a side job or another source of extra income, like selling handmade items. Surprisingly, it's not just those with lower income; even people making $100,000 a year often seek additional income to cover their expenses. The report also mentioned that consumers could be collecting over $50 billion in total every month from their extra earnings, and a significant part of this money might not be reported to tax authorities.Passive income often arises from investments, assets, or activities that need very little ongoing work after they are established. Passive exchange-traded funds, that aim to replicate the performance of a specific market index or asset class, are important in this regard. In one of our articles, we referred to James Seyffart’s statement from Bloomberg Intelligence, who mentioned that passive investing is steadily on the rise in the US. Currently, passive mutual funds and ETFs own around 19% of the average publicly traded U.S. stock, which is three times higher than it was in 2013.Investing in dividend stocks is also one of the most reliable ways to generate passive income. Dividend-paying stocks help investors receive regular dividend payments, typically on a quarterly basis, without having to actively work or make ongoing investments. This income can provide a steady cash flow, making it a reliable source of passive income. In addition to this, dividend stocks have significantly contributed to the market’s overall returns. Between 2013 and 2022, dividends accounted for 17% of the overall returns in the S&amp;P 500 Index. But if we consider a much longer period, going back to the 1930s, dividends contributed to 37% of the returns.Story continuesThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the best dividend stocks as these companies have been raising their payouts year after year. To create passive income, it's vital that dividends consistently increase over time. In this article, we will further discuss dividend stocks to earn passive income.12 Best Dividend Stocks For Passive IncomePhoto by Sharon McCutcheon on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of Q2 2023 and picked companies that have raised their dividends for at least 10 consecutive years or more. From that list, we narrowed down our options to companies with strong financial positions and steady cash flow, indicating reliable future dividends for generating passive income. We then sorted these companies in ascending order based on the number of funds that hold stakes in them as of the second quarter of 2023.12. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is an American multinational telecommunications and media conglomerate. The company is also one of the largest cable television and broadband internet service providers in the country.In the second quarter of 2023, Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) reported revenue of $30.5 billion, which showed a 1.6% growth from the same period last year. The company's operating cash flow for the quarter came in at roughly $7.3 billion and its free cash flow amounted to $3.4 billion. It also returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends during the quarter, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks for passive income.The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some other reliable options for generating passive income.Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) has raised its dividends for 15 years in a row. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.29 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.65%, as of October 12.At the end of Q2 2023, 66 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database reported having stakes in Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), down from 68 a quarter earlier. The consolidated value of these stakes is over $3.14 billion.ClearBridge Investments mentioned Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) in its Q3 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Long-term holdings Charter and Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) delivered strong second-quarter results relative to expectations; their stable recurring revenue streams and undemanding valuations were rewarded in the current environment. Cable multiples compressed over the past 24 months on fears of heightened competition in their core broadband business from fixed wireless and fiber providers. While fiber remains a competitive alternative to cable broadband over the long term, high upfront investments and a materially higher cost of capital are resulting in slower buildouts than previously expected. Fixed wireless also continues to gain traction, particularly in rural markets, but share gains also appear to be moderating. At the same time, both Comcast and Charter are expanding their footprints into rural and adjacent markets while gaining wireless market share, leveraging their mobile virtual network operator agreements with Verizon. We think both cable companies are well-positioned to continue to grow while generating substantial free cash flows. We added to Comcast during the quarter.”11.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on stock market performance overall, head directly to 5 Worst Performing Dow Stocks YTD.In a July report by J.P. Morgan, it was stated that global economic growth is expected to slow down in the latter part of 2023, while inflation appears to be easing. However, it's worth noting that global core inflation is projected to remain elevated, staying above 3% until 2024. This ongoing high inflation will continue to exert pressure on central banks, potentially leading to further tightening measures. Bruce Kasman, Chief Global Economist at J.P. Morgan, said:“We do not think inflation is going to come back down to central bank comfort zones by themselves. Yes, there’s a decline going on. But no, we do not think you’re going to get inflation back below 3% in the U.S. or the euro area this year in an environment where supply has been damaged in a more lasting way and inflation psychology has shifted.”In the first half of 2023, global economic growth gained momentum, reaching a rate of 2.8%. So far, efforts to tighten monetary policies have balanced the diminishing impact of supply disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, starting in 2022, global policy rates have increased by nearly 400 basis points, affecting spending sensitive to interest rates and limiting industrial production. Despite the current growth momentum, it is believed that the global economy's resilience is decreasing. Consequently, it is expected that developed markets may undergo another round of tightening measures before the end of 2023 to control inflation. However, such actions may have adverse effects on the private sector's well-being. Consequently, there is a possibility of a synchronized global economic recession occurring, potentially before the end of 2024. J.P. Morgan Research anticipates that the United States may experience a mild recession toward the end of 2023. This is attributed to the Federal Reserve's conservative monetary policy, which is leading to stricter credit availability and a gradual decline in economic growth. The Western European economy faced challenges during the winter due to high energy prices. Although the first quarter of 2023 showed some improvement, overall economic growth remained relatively stagnant.Story continuesIn the first six months of 2023, there was a noticeable variance in stock performance, with differences observed in size, sectors, and investment styles. Surprisingly, this occurred amidst an unusual period of low volatility. Looking ahead, without any proactive measures from the Federal Reserve, experts expect a more difficult economic environment for stocks in the latter part of 2023. A similar less optimistic outlook is observed for equity markets in other regions across the world. Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, Global Head of Equity Macro Strategy at J.P. Morgan, stated:“Given that multiple expansion has been the main driver of performance year to date, we see unattractive risk-reward for equities and increasing investor complacency ahead of our expectation that the business cycle will further decelerate in the second half of the year, with the onset of a recession likely in the fourth quarter of 2023 or first quarter of 2024. What’s more, consumers are starting to show signs of weakness, and there is a risk that liquidity and credit conditions could tighten in the coming months.”According to S&amp;P Global, the Dow Jones Industrial Average showed improvement in September, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 but still experiencing a decline of 3.5%; -3.42% with dividends considered. However, when we consider the year-to-date performance, the Dow has lagged significantly behind the S&amp;P 500, with a gain of 1.09%;  2.73% with dividends, while the S&amp;P 500 has recorded an increase of 11.68%. This difference in performance is primarily attributed to how these indices are constructed, with factors like price weighting versus market value weighting playing a role. Historically, these differences tend to align, but in shorter time frames, disparities can emerge.In this article, we discuss some of the worst performing Dow stocks which include Verizon Communications Inc.

The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Year-to-Date Share Price Performance as of October 11: -4.63%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 92The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) functions as a global entertainment business. It is divided into two parts – Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution; and Disney Parks, Experiences and Products. On September 19, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)’s stock saw a decrease of over 3%. This decline followed the company's announcement of significant investments in its Parks segment, with the goal of doubling the current investment.The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) stock has faced setbacks due to the negative news surrounding its conflict with Florida legislators over a controversial education law. This has contributed to wider concerns that the streaming industry's growth is slowing down, impacting the outlook for The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)’s Disney+ streaming service.As per Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 92 hedge funds were bullish on The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), compared to the last quarter when 95 funds had invested in the stock. Nelson Peltz’s Trian Partners held a significant position in the company, with over 6.4 million shares worth $573.63 million.In addition to Verizon Communications Inc.

Disney’s Bob Iger returned to the CEO’s seat in November 2022, replacing Bob Chapek, who left following a turbulent tenure. As a result of disappointing quarterly results and incremental commentary suggesting a more inline strategy with other media, the market has become less confident that Iger will achieve a turnaround by the end of his 1.5- year contract. We continue to believe Disney has a unique collection of assets and owns some of the best content among all media companies. Their ability to monetize this content across many platforms — studio, theme park, toys, streaming — is incredibly valuable; thus we remain investors.”14.

(NYSE:GS) is one of the worst performing Dow stocks. On July 19, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) announced a Q2 GAAP EPS of $3.08, missing Wall Street expectations by $1.06. The revenue of $10.89 billion decreased 8.2% year-over-year, yet exceeded market estimates by $160 million. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

(NYSE:GS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Back in 2019, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) made a splash in the card industry by working with Apple and MasterCard on a credit card. The actual card is fairly sleek (as you can see below), as customers' names are etched into an Apple titanium card. The no-fee card generated a lot of hype, as many early users were quick to post their latest card on various social media sites.The initial goal of Marcus (back in 2016) was to leverage Goldman’s wonderful name brand and build a full-service digital bank. This card was a large piece of GS’s ambitions to grow its retail banking franchise called Marcus. After 5 years, Marcus now has 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances. Surprisingly, Marcus now represents nearly 20% of the firm’s total revenue.We thought it would be interesting to look at how the Apple Card is doing in terms of loans and exposures. With over $100 billion in assets, this has been a successful source of cheap deposits for GS. Despite having an institutional / “white shoe” brand in the investment banking and trading world, GS’s Apple Card has been a disappointment.”8.

Additionally, the company's decision to separate its turbocharger and HVAC businesses also affected the revenue growth.According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 61 hedge funds were bullish on Honeywell International Inc.

The Fed kept the benchmark lending rate unchanged at the existing 5.25-5.5% range at its September FOMC meeting. Market participants were widely expecting a status quo. However, the post-FOMC statement of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell created uncertainty among investors.Although the Fed paused its rate hike in the September FOMC meeting, the current dot plot has shown a strong likelihood of one more hike of 25 basis points in 2023. That will take the terminal interest rate of this hiking cycle to 5.6%, well above the 5.1% forecast in June. Notably, the current range of the Fed fund rate is the highest level since March 2001.More importantly, the central bank said it would keep interest rates higher for a longer time. The new projection has shown two rate cuts in 2024 instead of four projected in June. The first cut in interest rate is not expected before September 2024.Moreover, the unresolved war between Russia and Ukraine and the recent geopolitical conflict between Israel and the Palestine-based terrorist group Hamas may inject more volatility in the near future.Stocks to WatchAt this stage, dividend-paying stocks should be in demand as investors try to safeguard their portfolios. We believe one should consider stocks that have recently raised their dividend payments.Five such companies are — Bank OZK OZK, McDonald's Corp. MCD, RPM International Inc. RPM, Lockheed Martin Corp.

The move comes as part of the company’s acquisition-driven growth strategy.  Located at 2411 Santa Fe Avenue, the property comprises one industrial transshipment building containing roughly 67,000 square feet and one industrial flex building containing around 45,000 square feet on 6.7 acres. The property’s advantageous location — west of Interstate 405 between Los Angeles International Airport and the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach — is likely to attract tenants. Currently, it is 100% leased to two tenants, and the estimated stabilized cap rate is 5.3%.Amid an e-commerce boom, growth in industries and companies making efforts to improve supply-chain efficiencies, the demand for industrial real estate space has been shooting up. TRNO is banking on such opportunities and is focused on expanding its portfolio through acquisitions.Further, the company is targeting functional assets at in-fill locations. Such assets enjoy high population densities and are located near high-volume distribution points.With such expansion efforts, Terreno Realty is well-poised to enhance its portfolio in six major coastal U.S. markets, namely, Los Angeles, Northern New Jersey/New York City, San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, Miami and Washington, D.C. These markets display solid demographic trends and witness healthy demand for industrial real estate.In 2023, Terreno Realty continued to expand its portfolio through acquisitions. From the beginning of the year through Sep 30, TRNO’s acquisitions totaled five properties for $410.8 million. The company has approximately $76.3 million of acquisitions under contract as of Sep 30, 2023.Apart from the fast adoption of e-commerce, the industrial real estate space is poised to gain traction over the long run from a likely rise in the inventory levels of companies as a precaution for any supply-chain disruption. This will offer opportunities to industrial landlords, including TRNO, Prologis PLD and EastGroup Properties EGP, to enjoy a favorable market environment.Shares of Terreno Realty, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), have risen 4.5% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 3.2%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPrologis carries a Zacks Rank of 3 at present.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Prologis is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for PLD in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently higher than the broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.26 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for PLD, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.18% heading into earnings season.Prologis, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Prologis, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Prologis, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

Although the companies have seen a sales recovery in 2023, the ongoing headwinds are hurting margins. Revenues are expected to grow from the demand recovery for surgeries and procedures, new products and expansion into new markets. The industry players are raising prices to cope with the higher costs. The lower demand for COVID-19 related products is also affecting the revenues negatively.Industry participants like Stryker SYK, Boston Scientific BSX, Zimmer Biomet ZBH, Insulet PODD and Haemonetics HAE have adapted to changing consumer preferences and are witnessing a rise in share price.Industry DescriptionThe industry includes companies providing medical products and cutting-edge technologies for healthcare services. These companies are primarily focused on research and development, and primarily cater to vital therapeutic areas like cardiovascular, nephrology and urology devices. The strengthening of the dollar and labor shortage are hurting sales. Supply-chain disruptions following lockdowns across several countries, notably China, in the first half of 2022 continue to persist, affecting the availability of certain materials used to develop medical-related products like semiconductor chips. Recent inflationary pressure and labor shortages weigh on the gross and operating margins of the industry players. The trend is likely to persist in the rest of 2023, albeit weaker. However, rising demand for medical procedures and cost-cutting initiatives are likely to drive performance.Major Trends Shaping the Future of the Medical Products IndustryAI, Medical Mechatronics &amp; Robotics: The rising adoption of minimally-invasive robot-assisted surgeries, self-automated home-based care, use of IT for quick and improved patient care and the shift of the payment system to a value-based model underscore the growing influence of AI in the Medical Products space. In fact, mechatronics — a high-end technology incorporating electronics, machine learning and mechanical engineering — is rapidly becoming a defining characteristic of the space. Several companies have shown substantial prowess in AI, robotics and medical mechatronics. Advancements in robot-assisted surgical platforms continue to be crucial with respect to minimally-invasive surgery that helps in reducing the trauma associated with open surgery. With respect to Mechatronics, the benefits of the same have been demonstrated in the form of 3D printing, which has altered the face of the medical devices industry. Currently, 3D printing is being used to print stem cells, blood vessels, heart tissues, prosthetic organs and skin.Story continuesRising Demand for IVD: The COVID-19 outbreak led to a rise in global demand for diagnostic testing kits in order to curb the spread of the virus. Testing became the need of the hour and led to a shift in the pipeline of IVD products, with a large number of rapid, point-of-care devices going into development. Companies not only received emergency use authorization from the FDA but also bolstered production to aid testing shortages. The industry players anticipate significant demand for rapid diagnostic testing in the future as well and are poised to capitalize on the same.Emerging Markets Hold Promise: Given the rising medical awareness and economic prosperity, emerging economies have been witnessing solid demand for medical products. An aging population, relaxed regulations, cheap skilled labor, increasing wealth and government focus on healthcare infrastructure make these markets extremely lucrative for global medical device players.Zacks Industry RankThe Zacks Medical Products industry falls within the broader Zacks Medical sector.It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #107, which places it in the top 43% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects.

Internationally, the company continues to post strong organic growth, especially in Europe and emerging markets. Stryker is witnessing strong demand for its robotic-arm-assisted surgery platform, Mako, on the back of its unique features and healthy order book despite financial constraints stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.However, hospital staffing pressures weighed on pockets around the globe, impeding growth. Following its strong second-quarter results, the company expects total revenue growth at a constant exchange rate (CER) of 9.5-10.5% for 2023. Adjusted EPS is now expected in the band of $10.25-$10.45, up from the prior guidance of $10.05-$10.25. Currently, the company carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The consensus mark for earnings is pinned at $10.37 per share. The company delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 3.50%.Price and Consensus: SYKBoston Scientific: The company manufactures medical devices and products used in various interventional medical specialties worldwide. Its second-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings and revenues exceeded market expectations by decent margins. The company registered a strong year-over-year improvement in organic sales, indicating a solid rebound in the legacy business despite several macroeconomic issues. The 2023 guidance increases investors’ confidence, indicating that the company is well-poised to handle the industry-wise trend of currency headwinds and global inflationary pressure. However, rising operating expenses are putting pressure on the company’s gross margin.Following the encouraging second-quarter results, Boston Scientific raised total revenue growth guidance to the range of 10.5-11.5% on a reported basis (up from the prior projection of 8.5-10.5%). Organic revenue growth is currently expected in the range of 10-11%.

The company ended the second quarter with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. Each of its geographic segments and product divisions recorded year-over-year sales growth at CER. The expansion in the company’s adjusted gross and operating margins is encouraging.Despite the near-term pressure, Zimmer Biomet is putting efforts into business recovery. Meanwhile, the spin-off of its dental &amp; spine arm as part of its ongoing transformation to accelerate growth and drive value creation looks promising. The last few quarters witnessed gradual stability in the global musculoskeletal market with better-than-expected sales growth in certain geographies, banking on improved procedural volume. Following encouraging second-quarter results, the company expects revenues and adjusted earnings to grow 6.5-7% and 7.4-9.9%, respectively, year over year.

The Omnipod device comes equipped with the wireless and handheld Personal Diabetes Manager for pain-free automated cannula insertion and blood glucose meter integration. Insulet earns a huge share of revenues from the Omnipod System in the United States, Canada, Europe and Israel. The company’s performance benefited from record quarterly U.S. and Total Omnipod new customer starts during the first half of 2023. This was driven mainly by a strong start to the company’s U.S. full market release of the Omnipod 5 automated insulin delivery system.However, the substantial fall in Drug Delivery sales is discouraging. Contraction in margins does not bode well. On a year-over-year basis, the company expects gross margin to be adversely impacted by higher costs associated with the U.S. manufacturing ramp, product line mix due to the ramp-up of Omnipod 5 and lower drug delivery revenues. Supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressure continue to challenge business operations. Following the second-quarter results, Insulet raised the total revenue growth guidance to 22-25% on a reported basis (up from the prior projection of 18-22%).

The robust performance of the Plasma and Hospital business, with continued strength in the Hemostasis Management product line, instills optimism. Robust contributions from the Vascular Closure business also seem promising. The expansion of both margins is an added advantage.The company has witnessed strong growth in the Plasma franchise for quite some time. In the global plasma market, Haemonetics holds an approximate 80% equity. It is currently seeing plasma market growth above historic rates, driven by an industry striving to double collections by 2025 and the rising demand for plasma-based medicines.

One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Mondelez International achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 8.4% per year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 9% average annual increase in the share price. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Mondelez International's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Mondelez International's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Mondelez International's TSR for the last 5 years was 71%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveMondelez International provided a TSR of 12% over the last twelve months. But that return falls short of the market. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it's actually better than the average return of 11% over half a decade This suggests the company might be improving over time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Mondelez International better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Mondelez International .But note: Mondelez International may not be the best stock to buy.

340,ad5e49b0-b553-3c1f-9f95-1ccdc21a0be9,BSX,2023-10-13,5 Medical Product Stocks to Buy Amid Industry Recovery,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-medical-product-stocks-buy-121400196.html,1697112840,STORY,"['PODD', 'HAE', '^GSPC', 'BSX', 'SYK', 'ZBH']","[The Zacks Medical – Products industry continues to face supply-chain constraints, increased material costs and a shortage of workers. Although the companies have seen a sales recovery in 2023, the ongoing headwinds are hurting margins. Revenues are expected to grow from the demand recovery for surgeries and procedures, new products and expansion into new markets. The industry players are raising prices to cope with the higher costs. The lower demand for COVID-19 related products is also affecting the revenues negatively.Industry participants like Stryker SYK, Boston Scientific BSX, Zimmer Biomet ZBH, Insulet PODD and Haemonetics HAE have adapted to changing consumer preferences and are witnessing a rise in share price.Industry DescriptionThe industry includes companies providing medical products and cutting-edge technologies for healthcare services. These companies are primarily focused on research and development, and primarily cater to vital therapeutic areas like cardiovascular, nephrology and urology devices. The strengthening of the dollar and labor shortage are hurting sales. Supply-chain disruptions following lockdowns across several countries, notably China, in the first half of 2022 continue to persist, affecting the availability of certain materials used to develop medical-related products like semiconductor chips. Recent inflationary pressure and labor shortages weigh on the gross and operating margins of the industry players. The trend is likely to persist in the rest of 2023, albeit weaker. However, rising demand for medical procedures and cost-cutting initiatives are likely to drive performance.Major Trends Shaping the Future of the Medical Products IndustryAI, Medical Mechatronics &amp; Robotics: The rising adoption of minimally-invasive robot-assisted surgeries, self-automated home-based care, use of IT for quick and improved patient care and the shift of the payment system to a value-based model underscore the growing influence of AI in the Medical Products space. In fact, mechatronics — a high-end technology incorporating electronics, machine learning and mechanical engineering — is rapidly becoming a defining characteristic of the space. Several companies have shown substantial prowess in AI, robotics and medical mechatronics. Advancements in robot-assisted surgical platforms continue to be crucial with respect to minimally-invasive surgery that helps in reducing the trauma associated with open surgery. With respect to Mechatronics, the benefits of the same have been demonstrated in the form of 3D printing, which has altered the face of the medical devices industry. Currently, 3D printing is being used to print stem cells, blood vessels, heart tissues, prosthetic organs and skin.Story continuesRising Demand for IVD: The COVID-19 outbreak led to a rise in global demand for diagnostic testing kits in order to curb the spread of the virus. Testing became the need of the hour and led to a shift in the pipeline of IVD products, with a large number of rapid, point-of-care devices going into development. Companies not only received emergency use authorization from the FDA but also bolstered production to aid testing shortages. The industry players anticipate significant demand for rapid diagnostic testing in the future as well and are poised to capitalize on the same.Emerging Markets Hold Promise: Given the rising medical awareness and economic prosperity, emerging economies have been witnessing solid demand for medical products. An aging population, relaxed regulations, cheap skilled labor, increasing wealth and government focus on healthcare infrastructure make these markets extremely lucrative for global medical device players.Zacks Industry RankThe Zacks Medical Products industry falls within the broader Zacks Medical sector.It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #107, which places it in the top 43% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few medical product stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry PerformanceThe industry has underperformed its own sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 Composite in the past year.Stocks in this industry have collectively declined 8.3% compared the Zacks Medical sector’s fall of 8%. The S&amp;P 500 has increased 14.8% in the same time frame.One Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), which is commonly used for valuing medical stocks, the industry is currently trading at 19.4X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 18.6X and the sector’s 22.9X.Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 30X and as low as 18.9X, with the median being at 23.5X, as the charts show.Price-to-Earnings Forward Twelve Months (F12M)Price-to-Earnings Forward Twelve Months (F12M)5 Promising Medical Product StocksStryker continues to deliver strong organic sales growth on the back of robust demand for its MedSurg and Neurotechnology businesses, led by Endoscopy, Instruments and Neurocranial.Orthopedics and Spine businesses are also on an encouraging growth path, reflecting procedural recovery throughout the quarter. Internationally, the company continues to post strong organic growth, especially in Europe and emerging markets. Stryker is witnessing strong demand for its robotic-arm-assisted surgery platform, Mako, on the back of its unique features and healthy order book despite financial constraints stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.However, hospital staffing pressures weighed on pockets around the globe, impeding growth. Following its strong second-quarter results, the company expects total revenue growth at a constant exchange rate (CER) of 9.5-10.5% for 2023. Adjusted EPS is now expected in the band of $10.25-$10.45, up from the prior guidance of $10.05-$10.25. Currently, the company carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. For this Kalamazoo, MI-based company, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues is pegged at $20.23 billion. The consensus mark for earnings is pinned at $10.37 per share. The company delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 3.50%.Price and Consensus: SYKBoston Scientific: The company manufactures medical devices and products used in various interventional medical specialties worldwide. Its second-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings and revenues exceeded market expectations by decent margins. The company registered a strong year-over-year improvement in organic sales, indicating a solid rebound in the legacy business despite several macroeconomic issues. The 2023 guidance increases investors’ confidence, indicating that the company is well-poised to handle the industry-wise trend of currency headwinds and global inflationary pressure. However, rising operating expenses are putting pressure on the company’s gross margin.Following the encouraging second-quarter results, Boston Scientific raised total revenue growth guidance to the range of 10.5-11.5% on a reported basis (up from the prior projection of 8.5-10.5%). Organic revenue growth is currently expected in the range of 10-11%. The company also raised its guidance for adjusted earnings from $1.96-$2.00 to $1.90-$1.96.For this Natick, MA-based company, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues suggest an improvement of 10.9%. The consensus estimate for earnings indicates a rise of 16.4%. It delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 2.73%, on average. Presently, the company carries a Zacks Rank of 2.Price and Consensus: BSXZimmer Biomet is a leading musculoskeletal healthcare company that designs, manufactures and markets orthopedic reconstructive products. The company ended the second quarter with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. Each of its geographic segments and product divisions recorded year-over-year sales growth at CER. The expansion in the company’s adjusted gross and operating margins is encouraging.Despite the near-term pressure, Zimmer Biomet is putting efforts into business recovery. Meanwhile, the spin-off of its dental &amp; spine arm as part of its ongoing transformation to accelerate growth and drive value creation looks promising. The last few quarters witnessed gradual stability in the global musculoskeletal market with better-than-expected sales growth in certain geographies, banking on improved procedural volume. Following encouraging second-quarter results, the company expects revenues and adjusted earnings to grow 6.5-7% and 7.4-9.9%, respectively, year over year. Currently, the company carries a Zacks Rank #2.For this Warsaw, IN-based company, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues is pegged at $7.4 billion. The consensus mark for earnings is pinned at $7.51 per share. The company delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 4.47%.Price and Consensus: ZBHInsulet: The company is a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of the Omnipod Insulin Management System. The Omnipod device comes equipped with the wireless and handheld Personal Diabetes Manager for pain-free automated cannula insertion and blood glucose meter integration. Insulet earns a huge share of revenues from the Omnipod System in the United States, Canada, Europe and Israel. The company’s performance benefited from record quarterly U.S. and Total Omnipod new customer starts during the first half of 2023. This was driven mainly by a strong start to the company’s U.S. full market release of the Omnipod 5 automated insulin delivery system.However, the substantial fall in Drug Delivery sales is discouraging. Contraction in margins does not bode well. On a year-over-year basis, the company expects gross margin to be adversely impacted by higher costs associated with the U.S. manufacturing ramp, product line mix due to the ramp-up of Omnipod 5 and lower drug delivery revenues. Supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressure continue to challenge business operations. Following the second-quarter results, Insulet raised the total revenue growth guidance to 22-25% on a reported basis (up from the prior projection of 18-22%). Total Omnipod sales are likely to improve 25-28% in 2023.For this Acton, MA-based company, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues suggests an improvement of 24.5%. The consensus estimate for earnings indicates a rise of 2242.9%. It delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 126.94%, on average. Presently, the company has a Zacks Rank #2.Price and Consensus: PODDHaemonetics provides blood management solutions to customers encompassing blood and plasma collectors, hospitals and health care providers globally. The robust performance of the Plasma and Hospital business, with continued strength in the Hemostasis Management product line, instills optimism. Robust contributions from the Vascular Closure business also seem promising. The expansion of both margins is an added advantage.The company has witnessed strong growth in the Plasma franchise for quite some time. In the global plasma market, Haemonetics holds an approximate 80% equity. It is currently seeing plasma market growth above historic rates, driven by an industry striving to double collections by 2025 and the rising demand for plasma-based medicines. Strong volume growth in plasma and hospitals, including additional savings from the Operational Excellence Program, is likely to drive the company’s performance in 2023.Following the robust fiscal first-quarter 2024 results, Haemonetics expects GAAP total revenues to grow in the range of 6-9% on a reported basis. Organic revenue growth is currently expected in the band of 7-10%. HAE anticipates adjusted earnings between $3.60 and $3.90 per share.For this Boston, MA-based company, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2023 revenues indicates an improvement of 8.1% year over year.

341,eb116b18-e0c9-3e6b-8051-f6c992ecc967,COF,2023-10-13,Banks Boost Incentives to Lure Buyers With Office Deals Frozen,Bloomberg,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/banks-boost-incentives-lure-buyers-140000043.html,1697119200,STORY,"['COF', 'MS', 'JPM']","[(Bloomberg) -- In a tough market for US commercial real estate, sellers are stepping up efforts to entice buyers before plummeting property values force them to accept deeper discounts.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Egypt’s Sisi Urges Gazans to Remain on Their LandIsrael Latest: Hamas Leaders Targeted as Ground War LoomsTop House Republican Wants Help From Democrats to Pick a SpeakerStocks, Bonds Fall as CPI Boosts Fed-Hike Wagers: Markets WrapGhost in the Machine: How Fake Parts Infiltrated Airline FleetsJPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Morgan Stanley and Capital One Financial Corp. are among companies offering to act as the bank for sales of their real estate loans, or actual buildings in some cases.The incentives are designed to help deals get done at a time when soaring borrowing costs are freezing out buyers and fewer lenders are issuing new debt, especially for riskier properties like offices. Direct loans eliminate the need for buyers to find outside financing, and enable sellers to offload potentially troublesome assets more quickly while reducing their exposure to commercial real estate.“The debt markets right now may be as bad as I’ve ever seen them,” said Kevin Shannon, co-head of US capital markets at Newmark Group Inc. “People are providing it because conventional financing doesn’t exist for the sector, and because they want to create liquidity. It allows you to produce more bids and a more competitive process in addition to improving the math.”Seller-financing rates generally land around 5%, “and for offices, that could be about half of what market financing is,” Shannon said.In the first half of the year, seller financing accounted for 1.9% of all commercial-property lending, up from just 0.5% in the same period of 2022, when mortgage rates were still low, according to a report by MSCI Real Assets that called the speed of change “concerning.”That’s because if fewer lenders are willing to provide real estate loans, it means less liquidity across the sector, which will push up rates even more for borrowers.Story continues“Real estate is a levered business by definition, so if you have fewer sources of capital providing direct property loans, that means less credit available and higher costs of capital,” said Josh Zegen, co-founder of Madison Realty Capital.More UrgencyFor banks, often in the business of moving mortgages, the largely frozen commercial real estate market means they’re stuck with loans on their books for longer than expected. Repayments are also stalled and uncertain, with even the largest landlords defaulting on some debts. That’s creating more urgency for lenders to find an exit even for performing assets before property values drop further.Capital One financed some of Fortress Investment Group’s recent purchase of roughly $1 billion of its office loans, according to people with knowledge of the matter. JPMorgan has offered seller financing to find a buyer for the $350 million mortgage backed by Manhattan’s HSBC Tower, Bloomberg reported in July.Some office buildings themselves are trading with seller incentives. The California State Teachers’ Retirement System agreed last month to sell Santa Monica’s Pen Factory building to a unit of JPMorgan in a transaction that included some financing, people said. The purchase price was discounted almost 8% to $166 million.And Morgan Stanley’s Mesa West Capital is pitching financing in the 5% range to the buyer of the Aon Center in Los Angeles, according to people with knowledge of the plans.A Capital One representative didn’t respond to a request for comment. Spokespeople for Morgan Stanley, Fortress, JPMorgan, and CalSTRS declined to comment.Many deals are marketed behind the scenes as sellers look to avoid a public process that might reveal the severely discounted value of their assets. Value downgrades could in turn spook the broader world of real estate investors, or draw unwanted attention from regulators.Lenders are “pushing seller financing because they can’t get their pricing,” said David Aviram, co-founder of Maverick Real Estate Partners, a New York-based firm that has acquired $800 million in loans since 2010.Limiting RiskWhile terms can vary, banks may fund transactions with a straight commercial loan, which isn’t collateralized by a property. The buyer then uses the loan to purchase the asset off the bank’s book. In that way, the bank is no longer exposed to the real estate, but instead to the buyer’s credit.Banks need to ensure that the company they’re now lending to fits their underwriting standards, according to Gerard Cassidy, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.“Obviously you’re not going to want to take excess risk in lending to those asset gatherers,” Cassidy said.Banks can also make certain loan terms more restrictive to ensure they can get some returns on the deal. These types of seller-financed loans are usually “very aggressive” and it’s a “low-risk” proposition for banks, said Will Sledge, a senior managing director at Jones Lang LaSalle Inc.However, there are potential risks to buyers, who’d often have to adjust their investment strategy to suit the lender’s terms, limiting flexibility, according to Maverick’s Aviram.“In most cases, we see it as too risky to take on seller financing because the typical two-year term of seller financing doesn’t match the potential duration of the investment,” Aviram said. “To experienced note buyers like us, we think it’s dangerous to take on that financing.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTSThe War in Israel Shows How Social Media’s Idealistic Era Has EndedBusiness Schools Aim to Build Entrepreneurs With Expanded ProgramsPro-Putin Propaganda Flows Onto Android via Google LoopholeWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money Era©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of the retirement phenomenon within the U.S., and go directly to read the Retirement Stock Portfolio: 5 Low Risk Investments.In 2021, the economy faced persistent challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic's enduring impact. Despite recovery efforts, several significant hurdles created uncertainty regarding the revival. Inflation reached levels not seen in years, supply-chain disruptions hindered economic growth, and a limited labor pool presented ongoing difficulties for employers. This was further complicated by a record number of individuals either changing roles or leaving the workforce. Additionally, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic led to a growing interest in retirement among Americans.Retirees globally are exploring avenues to boost their income through investments due to the highest inflation recorded in nearly four decades. Addressing this concern, the Social Security Administration alleviated the situation by announcing an 8.7% increase in benefits earlier this year to mitigate the impact of inflation, as cited by Bloomberg. With this adjustment, the average retiree benefit has reached $1,827 per month, marking a $146 increase from the previous year. However, given the average annual household expenses for individuals aged 65-74 amounting to approximately $53,000, these social security benefits fall short of covering living costs adequately.Despite the data mentioned earlier, the United States possesses a thriving and robust retirement industry. McKinsey's research indicates that the U.S. retirement market boasts a substantial $26 trillion in assets. This data also forecasts a remarkable shift: by 2030, retirees are expected to contribute more to global consumption than individuals in the working age range of 15 to 59 years in China. Within the retirement industry, the largest segment—Defined Contribution—accounts for approximately 30% of the total assets, totaling around $8 trillion, and generates an impressive $30 billion in revenue for managing firms. This segment oversees approximately 110 million accounts and has shown consistent growth over the past decade.Story continuesLastly, an integral facet of retirement involves the assisted living community sector, commonly known as old age homes. These facilities offer seniors companionship and care during the later stages of their lives. As detailed in a research report by Grand View Market Research, the assisted living industry was valued at around $91.8 billion in 2022 and is anticipated to undergo a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.53% from 2023 to 2030. Within this market, the segment dedicated to individuals aged 85 and above held the largest market share in 2022. Looking towards 2040, the senior population in this age bracket is expected to more than double, rising from 6.4 million in 2016 to an estimated 14.6 million.Shares of prominent companies such as The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are favored by retirees due to their consistent free cash flow and impressive histories of dividend growth. In the following sections, we'll explore additional low-risk stock options suitable for retirement portfolios.Retirement Stock Portfolio: 10 Low Risk InvestmentsPhoto by Max Harlynking on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor our list of the 10 best low-risk stocks for a retirement portfolio, we used a stock screener to come up with a list of stocks with a beta value of less than 1. We further narrowed down this list to include stocks that have a notable history of paying dividends to investors. Their dividend growth histories make them suitable options for retiree investors who seek to generate stable income. In addition to this, the hedge fund sentiment was measured using data from 910 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in Q2 2023.10.

The company is responsible for managing various brands, including CVS Pharmacy, CVS Caremark, MinuteClinic, and Omnicare.Recently, CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) unveiled its Q2 results, showcasing an adjusted EPS of $2.21 for the quarter, surpassing expectations by $0.09.

CVS has been moving its portfolio to a more value-based outcome model, and Aetna was a major move in that direction. We were willing to accept the leverage that came with the deal because CVS has a very cash generative model, and we anticipated the free cash flow would enable the company to de-lever fairly quickly.By mid-2022, CVS was in a position to use the free cash flow that had been going to debt repayment to do bolt-on deals to further prepare for the value-based outcome model and/or return more cash to shareholders in the form of higher dividends or share repurchases. However, CVS lost a “star” in its largest Medicare plan in late 2022 and this will adversely impact earnings in 2024. This was a surprise and disappointment to us, but management should be able to regain the “star” in the back half of 2023, which will then give the company a nice tailwind in 2025…” (Click here to read the full text)7. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67Dividend Yield as of 12/10: 0.72%Beta Value: 0.78Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) operates an international chain of membership warehouses, mainly under the “Costco Wholesale” name, that carry quality, brand-name merchandise at substantially lower prices than are typically found at conventional wholesale or retail sources. The company provides a quarterly per-share dividend of $1.02, resulting in a dividend yield of 0.72% as of October 12. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) has consistently increased its dividends for the past 19 years, demonstrating its commitment to rewarding shareholders.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 67 hedge funds were long Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) at the end of Q2 2023, compared to 63 funds in the earlier quarter. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is one of the most prominent stakeholders of the company, with 807,709 shares worth more than $434.8 million.RiverPark Advisors mentioned Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its Q2 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), founded in 1983, is the world’s third-largest retailer with 850 stores, $240 billion in revenue and 68 million members spread across North America, Europe, Asia, and the Southern Pacific Region. The company is known for its strong value proposition driven by high-quality low-cost offerings including a well-regarded private-label brand. Costco regularly ranks at the top of customer surveys related to brand trust, product price and quality, and all-around experience. Historically, 90% of the company’s shoppers renew their memberships, which generate more than 50% of operating income.Through expanding market share, new store openings, increasing member productivity, and omnichannel expansion, we believe the company can grow revenues annually in the high single digit percentage range. This revenue growth should yield steadily growing margins and EPS growth in the low-to-mid-teens, which should drive shareholder returns in the same range.”6. PepsiCo, Inc.

(NYSE:MHK), the leading manufacturer of flooring products such as carpet, tile, wood, and vinyl products for the residential and commercial markets, ran into stiff headwinds in recent years as inflation increased costs on source materials. This compressed MHK’s margins, and the stock price was nearly cut in half between June 2021 and early this year. We believe the worst of those pricing pressures are behind the business, which stands to benefit from the ongoing growth in home remodeling and office space conversions as the commercial real estate market struggles with hybrid work.After initiating a position in Mohawk this Spring, we added to it during the quarter as the market sold off. While it’s not ideal that MHK continued to fall, the slide has allowed us to build an over 2% allocation in a name our research indicates is a long-term alpha generator at a compelling valuation.Mohawk is priced at half of sales, less than tangible book value, and 9X our estimate of ‘23 earnings.

The patients were randomized equally to receive either a once-daily dose of povorcitinib (15 mg, 45 mg or 75 mg) or placebo for 24 weeks. Among these, 168 patients were treated as part of the 24-week placebo-controlled period.The study had previously met its primary endpoint of percentage change from baseline in the total body Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (T-VASI) at week 24. The key secondary endpoint of the percentage of patients achieving T-VASI50 (≥50% reduction from baseline in the T-VASI) at week 24, was also achieved. Per the 52-week data readout, treatment with all doses of povorcitinib observed significant improvement in mean percentage total body depigmentation improvement from baseline as measured by T-VASI. Significant improvement in mean percentage facial depigmentation improvement from baseline as measured by the facial Vitiligo Area Scoring Index was also observed at week 52 for all dose ranges of povorcitinib.Story continuesEncouraging key secondary findings were also observed at the end of week 52 in patients receiving the four doses of povorcitinib.Incyte also reported that all dose strengths of the candidate were overall well tolerated and treatment-related adverse events were mostly mild-moderate in severity.Among the total enrolled patients, 32 patients who completed the follow-up period of the phase II study through week 76, observed the maintenance of total body and facial repigmentation. This signifies povorcitinib’s durability of response following treatment discontinuation.Vitiligo is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by the depigmentation of the skin that results from the loss of pigment-producing cells known as melanocytes.Apart from vitiligo, Incyte is currently studying povorcitinib in other indications including, hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) and prurigo nodularis. Phase III studies evaluating povorcitinib in HS are currently ongoing.Incyte Corporation Price and ConsensusIncyte Corporation Price and ConsensusIncyte Corporation price-consensus-chart | Incyte Corporation QuoteZacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderIncyte currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the overall medical sector areDynavax Technologies DVAX, Corcept Therapeutics CORT and Annovis Bio ANVS.

353,ad5e49b0-b553-3c1f-9f95-1ccdc21a0be9,SYK,2023-10-13,5 Medical Product Stocks to Buy Amid Industry Recovery,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-medical-product-stocks-buy-121400196.html,1697112840,STORY,"['PODD', 'HAE', '^GSPC', 'BSX', 'SYK', 'ZBH']","[The Zacks Medical – Products industry continues to face supply-chain constraints, increased material costs and a shortage of workers. Although the companies have seen a sales recovery in 2023, the ongoing headwinds are hurting margins. Revenues are expected to grow from the demand recovery for surgeries and procedures, new products and expansion into new markets. The industry players are raising prices to cope with the higher costs. The lower demand for COVID-19 related products is also affecting the revenues negatively.Industry participants like Stryker SYK, Boston Scientific BSX, Zimmer Biomet ZBH, Insulet PODD and Haemonetics HAE have adapted to changing consumer preferences and are witnessing a rise in share price.Industry DescriptionThe industry includes companies providing medical products and cutting-edge technologies for healthcare services. These companies are primarily focused on research and development, and primarily cater to vital therapeutic areas like cardiovascular, nephrology and urology devices. The strengthening of the dollar and labor shortage are hurting sales. Supply-chain disruptions following lockdowns across several countries, notably China, in the first half of 2022 continue to persist, affecting the availability of certain materials used to develop medical-related products like semiconductor chips. Recent inflationary pressure and labor shortages weigh on the gross and operating margins of the industry players. The trend is likely to persist in the rest of 2023, albeit weaker. However, rising demand for medical procedures and cost-cutting initiatives are likely to drive performance.Major Trends Shaping the Future of the Medical Products IndustryAI, Medical Mechatronics &amp; Robotics: The rising adoption of minimally-invasive robot-assisted surgeries, self-automated home-based care, use of IT for quick and improved patient care and the shift of the payment system to a value-based model underscore the growing influence of AI in the Medical Products space. In fact, mechatronics — a high-end technology incorporating electronics, machine learning and mechanical engineering — is rapidly becoming a defining characteristic of the space. Several companies have shown substantial prowess in AI, robotics and medical mechatronics. Advancements in robot-assisted surgical platforms continue to be crucial with respect to minimally-invasive surgery that helps in reducing the trauma associated with open surgery. With respect to Mechatronics, the benefits of the same have been demonstrated in the form of 3D printing, which has altered the face of the medical devices industry. Currently, 3D printing is being used to print stem cells, blood vessels, heart tissues, prosthetic organs and skin.Story continuesRising Demand for IVD: The COVID-19 outbreak led to a rise in global demand for diagnostic testing kits in order to curb the spread of the virus. Testing became the need of the hour and led to a shift in the pipeline of IVD products, with a large number of rapid, point-of-care devices going into development. Companies not only received emergency use authorization from the FDA but also bolstered production to aid testing shortages. The industry players anticipate significant demand for rapid diagnostic testing in the future as well and are poised to capitalize on the same.Emerging Markets Hold Promise: Given the rising medical awareness and economic prosperity, emerging economies have been witnessing solid demand for medical products. An aging population, relaxed regulations, cheap skilled labor, increasing wealth and government focus on healthcare infrastructure make these markets extremely lucrative for global medical device players.Zacks Industry RankThe Zacks Medical Products industry falls within the broader Zacks Medical sector.It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #107, which places it in the top 43% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few medical product stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry PerformanceThe industry has underperformed its own sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 Composite in the past year.Stocks in this industry have collectively declined 8.3% compared the Zacks Medical sector’s fall of 8%. The S&amp;P 500 has increased 14.8% in the same time frame.One Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), which is commonly used for valuing medical stocks, the industry is currently trading at 19.4X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 18.6X and the sector’s 22.9X.Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 30X and as low as 18.9X, with the median being at 23.5X, as the charts show.Price-to-Earnings Forward Twelve Months (F12M)Price-to-Earnings Forward Twelve Months (F12M)5 Promising Medical Product StocksStryker continues to deliver strong organic sales growth on the back of robust demand for its MedSurg and Neurotechnology businesses, led by Endoscopy, Instruments and Neurocranial.Orthopedics and Spine businesses are also on an encouraging growth path, reflecting procedural recovery throughout the quarter. Internationally, the company continues to post strong organic growth, especially in Europe and emerging markets. Stryker is witnessing strong demand for its robotic-arm-assisted surgery platform, Mako, on the back of its unique features and healthy order book despite financial constraints stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.However, hospital staffing pressures weighed on pockets around the globe, impeding growth. Following its strong second-quarter results, the company expects total revenue growth at a constant exchange rate (CER) of 9.5-10.5% for 2023. Adjusted EPS is now expected in the band of $10.25-$10.45, up from the prior guidance of $10.05-$10.25. Currently, the company carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. For this Kalamazoo, MI-based company, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues is pegged at $20.23 billion. The consensus mark for earnings is pinned at $10.37 per share. The company delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 3.50%.Price and Consensus: SYKBoston Scientific: The company manufactures medical devices and products used in various interventional medical specialties worldwide. Its second-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings and revenues exceeded market expectations by decent margins. The company registered a strong year-over-year improvement in organic sales, indicating a solid rebound in the legacy business despite several macroeconomic issues. The 2023 guidance increases investors’ confidence, indicating that the company is well-poised to handle the industry-wise trend of currency headwinds and global inflationary pressure. However, rising operating expenses are putting pressure on the company’s gross margin.Following the encouraging second-quarter results, Boston Scientific raised total revenue growth guidance to the range of 10.5-11.5% on a reported basis (up from the prior projection of 8.5-10.5%). Organic revenue growth is currently expected in the range of 10-11%. The company also raised its guidance for adjusted earnings from $1.96-$2.00 to $1.90-$1.96.For this Natick, MA-based company, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues suggest an improvement of 10.9%. The consensus estimate for earnings indicates a rise of 16.4%. It delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 2.73%, on average. Presently, the company carries a Zacks Rank of 2.Price and Consensus: BSXZimmer Biomet is a leading musculoskeletal healthcare company that designs, manufactures and markets orthopedic reconstructive products. The company ended the second quarter with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. Each of its geographic segments and product divisions recorded year-over-year sales growth at CER. The expansion in the company’s adjusted gross and operating margins is encouraging.Despite the near-term pressure, Zimmer Biomet is putting efforts into business recovery. Meanwhile, the spin-off of its dental &amp; spine arm as part of its ongoing transformation to accelerate growth and drive value creation looks promising. The last few quarters witnessed gradual stability in the global musculoskeletal market with better-than-expected sales growth in certain geographies, banking on improved procedural volume. Following encouraging second-quarter results, the company expects revenues and adjusted earnings to grow 6.5-7% and 7.4-9.9%, respectively, year over year. Currently, the company carries a Zacks Rank #2.For this Warsaw, IN-based company, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues is pegged at $7.4 billion. The consensus mark for earnings is pinned at $7.51 per share. The company delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 4.47%.Price and Consensus: ZBHInsulet: The company is a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of the Omnipod Insulin Management System. The Omnipod device comes equipped with the wireless and handheld Personal Diabetes Manager for pain-free automated cannula insertion and blood glucose meter integration. Insulet earns a huge share of revenues from the Omnipod System in the United States, Canada, Europe and Israel. The company’s performance benefited from record quarterly U.S. and Total Omnipod new customer starts during the first half of 2023. This was driven mainly by a strong start to the company’s U.S. full market release of the Omnipod 5 automated insulin delivery system.However, the substantial fall in Drug Delivery sales is discouraging. Contraction in margins does not bode well. On a year-over-year basis, the company expects gross margin to be adversely impacted by higher costs associated with the U.S. manufacturing ramp, product line mix due to the ramp-up of Omnipod 5 and lower drug delivery revenues. Supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressure continue to challenge business operations. Following the second-quarter results, Insulet raised the total revenue growth guidance to 22-25% on a reported basis (up from the prior projection of 18-22%). Total Omnipod sales are likely to improve 25-28% in 2023.For this Acton, MA-based company, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues suggests an improvement of 24.5%. The consensus estimate for earnings indicates a rise of 2242.9%. It delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 126.94%, on average. Presently, the company has a Zacks Rank #2.Price and Consensus: PODDHaemonetics provides blood management solutions to customers encompassing blood and plasma collectors, hospitals and health care providers globally. The robust performance of the Plasma and Hospital business, with continued strength in the Hemostasis Management product line, instills optimism. Robust contributions from the Vascular Closure business also seem promising. The expansion of both margins is an added advantage.The company has witnessed strong growth in the Plasma franchise for quite some time. In the global plasma market, Haemonetics holds an approximate 80% equity. It is currently seeing plasma market growth above historic rates, driven by an industry striving to double collections by 2025 and the rising demand for plasma-based medicines. Strong volume growth in plasma and hospitals, including additional savings from the Operational Excellence Program, is likely to drive the company’s performance in 2023.Following the robust fiscal first-quarter 2024 results, Haemonetics expects GAAP total revenues to grow in the range of 6-9% on a reported basis. Organic revenue growth is currently expected in the band of 7-10%. HAE anticipates adjusted earnings between $3.60 and $3.90 per share.For this Boston, MA-based company, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2023 revenues indicates an improvement of 8.1% year over year.

It is backed by consistent revenue growth momentum, courtesy of extraordinary patient outcomes with Lightning Flash, Lightning Bolt 7 and RED 72 with SENDit technology. The company’s vascular and neuro businesses are showing encouraging growth trends. Yet, currency movements and a challenging competitive landscape affect the top line.In the past year, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 16.2% compared with the industry’s 1.3% rise and the S&amp;P 500’s 19.2% rise.The global healthcare provider company has a market capitalization of $8.23 billion. It surpassed estimates in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 94.2%.Key Growth CatalystsSubstantial Portfolio Expansion: Penumbra is still in the early stages of its journey to bring the company’s proprietary thrombectomy technologies to patients in the United States and internationally. The company’s consistent revenue growth momentum is being driven by the extraordinary outcomes Penumbra is witnessing in patients treated with Lightning Flash, Lightning Bolt 7 and RED 72 with SENDit technology.According to the company, Lightning Flash's transformative power, speed, safety, and efficacy profile is the biggest driver of the exceptional early adoption of the product. In Lightning Bolt 7, Penumbra is seeing an acceleration of Lightning Bolt 7 cases in the last two months of the second quarter as conversion from surgery, lytics and other mechanical thrombectomy products are gaining momentum.Robust Vascular Business Growth: Penumbra is demonstrating strong growth within the company’s Vascular business, banking on the rapid increase in sales of the company’s vascular thrombectomy products in the United States.Lightning Flash is also driving an acceleration in Penumbra’s U.S. vascular thrombectomy franchise, which grew nearly 24% year over year in the second quarter. Additionally, the company successfully launched the Lightning Bolt 7 arterial thrombectomy system in June following its FDA clearance in March 2023. The company expects to see a robust growth trajectory in the Vascular arm in the next five years and beyond and has accordingly raised its 2023 revenue forecast significantly.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchImproving Neuro Trend: Within the Neuro franchise, Penumbra is witnessing an acceleration in the company’s stroke business. Further, it is experiencing strong customer uptake of RED 72 (with the proprietary SENDit technology), RED 43 and BMX81. These products represent meaningful advances in the trackability of 0.072-sized aspiration catheters and distal clot removal.In the second quarter, a substantial increase in the company’s Neuro product sales was driven by the rise in sales of neuro thrombectomy products and neuro access products, which globally increased by 32.4% and 27.6%, respectively.DownsidesForeign Exchange Impacts Sales: A significant portion of Penumbra’s sales and costs are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. In 2022, approximately 30.2% of the company's consolidated revenues came from the non-U.S. markets. The company uses multiple foreign currencies, including the euro and Japanese yen. Changes in those currencies relative to the U.S. dollar will impact its sales, cost of sales and expenses, and consequently, net income.Tough Competitive Landscape: The medical device industry is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. Penumbra competes with several manufacturers and distributors of neuro and vascular medical devices.Estimate TrendsIn the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its fiscal 2023 earnings has moved up 10.9% to $1.73.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $1.06 billion, suggesting a 10.9% rise from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are DaVita Inc.

Stock closed 17% lower on Wednesday.The Denver, Colorado-based company said it was closely monitoring developments related to GLP-1 drugs such as Novo's Ozempic and weight-loss drug Wegovy.The dialysis market has for decades been sustained by high rates of obesity and diabetes, which contribute to kidney damage, but GLP-1 drugs have shown to dramatically improve both conditions.Shares of dialysis service providers including DaVita slumped on Wednesday after Ozempic showed early signs of success in delaying the progression of kidney disease in diabetic patients.GLP-1 drugs could shrink the size of the eligible dialysis population over time, according to Citi analysts.DaVita provides kidney care services to patients in the United States through a network of outpatient clinics and at-home dialysis services.DaVita estimates less than 10% of all patients with chronic kidney disease would be eligible for treatment with Ozempic based on Novo's study requirements, and added that further studies will be required to determine whether the drug could benefit rest of the patient population.The study tested Ozempic in diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease as an additional treatment to the initial standard-of-care therapy, the Danish drugmaker said, adding that it expects detailed results in the first half of 2024.(Reporting by Bhanvi Satija and Mariam Sunny in Bengaluru; Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips)]"

The following statement can be attributed to Dr. Jeff Giullian, chief medical officer for DaVita Inc.""We've been closely monitoring the developments related to GLP-1s, and are excited about the potential benefits this class of drugs could have on society and patients with kidney disease. Like much of the medical community, we're eager to understand the results of the study and whether the results demonstrate improvements over the known effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on kidney disease or the previously announced effects of GLP-1s on cardiovascular mortality.Although it is nearly impossible to draw any conclusions from the FLOW study at this point because the study results have yet to be released, based on the inclusion criteria for study participants, we believe there may be limited application of the FLOW study findings to the overall CKD patient population.We will continue monitoring closely as further evidence becomes available to identify the potential benefit of GLP-1s to those afflicted with kidney disease. In the meantime, DaVita remains focused on providing exceptional patient care and advancing the practice of kidney care.""Our understanding of the FLOW clinical trial is the following:Patients enrolled in the study were required to have Type 2 diabetes, been diagnosed with CKD, and following a standard of care including ACE inhibitors or ARBs. These patients also needed to demonstrate a requisite amount of proteinuria, i.e., protein in the urine. DaVita estimates that fewer than 10% of all current CKD patients would have this combination of factors.The trial sought to demonstrate benefits for the composite endpoint comprised of five separate endpoints: death from kidney disease; death from cardiovascular disease; sustained reduction in GFR by at least 50%; progression to stage 5 CKD; and initiation of chronic kidney replacement therapy. Findings on any single endpoint, or any combination thereof, could be sufficient to halt the trial. It is unknown, however, which endpoint(s) was positive so as to close the study and whether it was a cardiovascular endpoint, a kidney endpoint, or both.Story continuesOnce released, the detailed results of the FLOW trial will identify which endpoint was proven. If it confirms prior evidence that GLP-1s reduce cardiovascular mortality, since approximately six times more CKD patients die of cardiovascular disease than progress to kidney replacement therapy, any similar findings in the FLOW study would be an additional positive in prolonging life through CKD progression for those taking the therapy.1 As it relates to CKD progression, if the study proves effective with respect to GFR, it will be interesting to note the efficacy relative to other drugs with similar proven effects such as SGLT2 inhibitors.Future trials and research will be required to determine whether any findings derived from the FLOW study could benefit a CKD population beyond those studied in the trial.Novo Nordisk's has announced that the FLOW study will be released in the first half of 2024 and the SELECT study will be released on or around November 11, 2023.About DaVita Inc.DaVita (NYSE: DVA) is a health care provider focused on transforming care delivery to improve quality of life for patients globally.

(SoCalGas) today issued the following statement in support of the U.S. Department of Energy's decision to award California up to $1.2 billion for a regional clean hydrogen hub[1]. SoCalGas is a proud partner of the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems (ARCHES), the statewide public-private partnership and the organizer for California's Department of Energy clean hydrogen hub application:""The Department of Energy's visionary investment in a California hydrogen hub is a watershed moment for a clean hydrogen economy,"" said SoCalGas President Maryam Brown. ""The DOE's investment demonstrates the essential role that clean hydrogen will play in accelerating California's energy goals, growing California's clean energy workforce, and improving our environment, air quality, and the lives of millions of Californians.""Working with ARCHES and state policymakers in support of California's clean energy and climate goals is a central focus of SoCalGas. Our company's mission is to build the cleanest, safest, and most innovative energy infrastructure company in America, and SoCalGas' Angeles Link project could deliver clean renewable hydrogen in an amount equivalent to almost 25% of the natural gas SoCalGas delivers today. This could displace a billion gallons of diesel fuel burned annually, allow conversion of natural gas plants, and eliminate nitrous oxide (NOX) and carbon dioxide (CO2) in an amount equivalent to taking 3.1 million cars off the road annually."" Background on Angeles LinkAngeles Link would be, as envisioned, the nation's largest clean renewable hydrogen energy pipeline system. Angeles Link could support the addition and integration of more renewable electricity resources like solar and wind to the grid and would significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from electric generation, industrial processes, heavy-duty trucks, and other hard-to-electrify sectors of the Southern and Central California economy. Over time and combined with other clean energy projects, Angeles Link could also help reduce natural gas demand served by the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility, facilitating its ultimate retirement. Angeles Link could also help advance California's and the region's climate and clean air goals while continuing reliable and affordable energy services.Story continuesHydrogen is increasingly recognized as a critical element of successful decarbonization. When coupled with renewable energy, clean hydrogen could help facilitate a globally scalable, resilient, and carbon free energy system.SoCalGas is working to shape California's 21st century energy system through investments in clean hydrogen, renewable natural gas, fuel cells, and carbon management.

(NYSE:LYB) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for LyondellBasell Industries The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.80bUS$3.47bUS$2.97bUS$3.14bUS$3.20bUS$3.26bUS$3.32bUS$3.39bUS$3.46bUS$3.54bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x5Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 1.86%Est @ 1.94%Est @ 2.01%Est @ 2.05%Est @ 2.08%Est @ 2.10% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.8% US$2.6kUS$3.0kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$2.0kUS$1.9kUS$1.8kUS$1.7k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$22bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.5b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.8%– 2.2%) = US$64bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$64b÷ ( 1 + 7.8%)10= US$30bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$52b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$92.4, the company appears quite good value at a 42% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at LyondellBasell Industries as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.132. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for LyondellBasell IndustriesStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual revenue is expected to decline over the next 3 years.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

As rising geopolitical tensions and volatility in oil prices forced investors to seek refuge in the less risky bond asset portfolio, bond prices surged while yields fell considerably, propelling the stocks higher.The uptrend was further buoyed by a solid September jobs report that portrayed a better-than-expected 336,000 job addition. While the unemployment rate was 3.8%, average hourly earnings were up 0.2% for the month and 4.2% from a year ago compared with respective estimates of 0.3% and 4.3%. This partially negated the rate hike fears as the Federal Reserve kept the road ajar for another hike before the end of the year.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of ""backing and filling"" in the market, they can benefit from ""cash cow"" stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. ON Semiconductor Corp., Dillard's, Inc., Valero Energy Corp., Upbound Group, Inc. and AGNC Investment Corp. are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.ROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders' EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Story continuesMoreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management's efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Here are five of the 21 stocks that qualified the screening:ON Semiconductor: Phoenix, AZ-based onsemi is an original equipment manufacturer of a broad range of discrete and embedded semiconductor components.

(NASDAQ:ADP). The company's shares saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Automatic Data Processing’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Automatic Data Processing What's The Opportunity In Automatic Data Processing?Good news, investors! Automatic Data Processing is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $354.65, but it is currently trading at US$248 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Automatic Data Processing’s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. If you believe the share price should eventually reach its true value, a low beta could suggest it is unlikely to rapidly do so anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range.What kind of growth will Automatic Data Processing generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 31% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Automatic Data Processing. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since ADP is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on ADP for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy ADP. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed buy.It can be quite valuable to consider what analysts expect for Automatic Data Processing from their most recent forecasts.

You can skip our detailed analysis of passive income ideas and dividend stocks, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks For Passive Income. Passive income is becoming increasingly popular among people from diverse backgrounds. It's an appealing idea, especially with the current economic uncertainty, and it's capturing the attention of investors more than ever. According to a survey by LendingClub Corp. and Pymnts.com conducted in March this year, nearly half of working people have a side job or another source of extra income, like selling handmade items. Surprisingly, it's not just those with lower income; even people making $100,000 a year often seek additional income to cover their expenses. The report also mentioned that consumers could be collecting over $50 billion in total every month from their extra earnings, and a significant part of this money might not be reported to tax authorities.Passive income often arises from investments, assets, or activities that need very little ongoing work after they are established. Passive exchange-traded funds, that aim to replicate the performance of a specific market index or asset class, are important in this regard. In one of our articles, we referred to James Seyffart’s statement from Bloomberg Intelligence, who mentioned that passive investing is steadily on the rise in the US. Currently, passive mutual funds and ETFs own around 19% of the average publicly traded U.S. stock, which is three times higher than it was in 2013.Investing in dividend stocks is also one of the most reliable ways to generate passive income. Dividend-paying stocks help investors receive regular dividend payments, typically on a quarterly basis, without having to actively work or make ongoing investments. This income can provide a steady cash flow, making it a reliable source of passive income. In addition to this, dividend stocks have significantly contributed to the market’s overall returns. Between 2013 and 2022, dividends accounted for 17% of the overall returns in the S&amp;P 500 Index. But if we consider a much longer period, going back to the 1930s, dividends contributed to 37% of the returns.Story continuesThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the best dividend stocks as these companies have been raising their payouts year after year. To create passive income, it's vital that dividends consistently increase over time. In this article, we will further discuss dividend stocks to earn passive income.12 Best Dividend Stocks For Passive IncomePhoto by Sharon McCutcheon on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of Q2 2023 and picked companies that have raised their dividends for at least 10 consecutive years or more. From that list, we narrowed down our options to companies with strong financial positions and steady cash flow, indicating reliable future dividends for generating passive income. We then sorted these companies in ascending order based on the number of funds that hold stakes in them as of the second quarter of 2023.12. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is an American multinational telecommunications and media conglomerate. The company is also one of the largest cable television and broadband internet service providers in the country.In the second quarter of 2023, Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) reported revenue of $30.5 billion, which showed a 1.6% growth from the same period last year. The company's operating cash flow for the quarter came in at roughly $7.3 billion and its free cash flow amounted to $3.4 billion. It also returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends during the quarter, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks for passive income.The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some other reliable options for generating passive income.Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) has raised its dividends for 15 years in a row. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.29 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.65%, as of October 12.At the end of Q2 2023, 66 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database reported having stakes in Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), down from 68 a quarter earlier. The consolidated value of these stakes is over $3.14 billion.ClearBridge Investments mentioned Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) in its Q3 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Long-term holdings Charter and Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) delivered strong second-quarter results relative to expectations; their stable recurring revenue streams and undemanding valuations were rewarded in the current environment. Cable multiples compressed over the past 24 months on fears of heightened competition in their core broadband business from fixed wireless and fiber providers. While fiber remains a competitive alternative to cable broadband over the long term, high upfront investments and a materially higher cost of capital are resulting in slower buildouts than previously expected. Fixed wireless also continues to gain traction, particularly in rural markets, but share gains also appear to be moderating. At the same time, both Comcast and Charter are expanding their footprints into rural and adjacent markets while gaining wireless market share, leveraging their mobile virtual network operator agreements with Verizon. We think both cable companies are well-positioned to continue to grow while generating substantial free cash flows. We added to Comcast during the quarter.”11. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is a well-known American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of membership-based warehouse clubs.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 10 Best Dividend Aristocrats According to Analysts. With the stock market facing ongoing fluctuations, investors are experiencing the frustration of seeing their profits disappear. For instance, the S&amp;P 500 increased by 19.5% from January to July 2023 but has since fallen by 6%. Considering the Federal Reserve's inclination to maintain higher interest rates for an extended period, negative investor sentiment, and the typical seasonal decline, it appears that the momentum of this summer's market rally might continue to weaken as we enter the fall season. According to analysts, investors can mitigate their losses by investing in dividend stocks.Dividend stocks are already a popular choice among investors due to their reliability in providing a steady stream of income. Between 1993 and the end of last year, the S&amp;P 500 index increased by 777%. But with dividends included, the S&amp;P 500 grew by over 1,400% during that same time frame. In addition to this, when we examine the performance of the S&amp;P 500 on a decade-by-decade basis, we can see that the role of dividends in contributing to the total return has fluctuated over time. From 1930 to 2021, dividends accounted for an average of 40% of the S&amp;P 500's total return.A recent study conducted by Morgan Stanley's chief investment officer, Mike Wilson, found that stocks that pay dividends tend to perform better in the long run and are more resilient during market downturns. Here are some comments from the analyst, taken from his interview with Business Insider this month.""Our economists are of the view that inflation will continue to slow from elevated levels over the next 12 months. That backdrop is supportive of owning dividend-related factors and defensive dividend payers, in particular.""Story continuesHe further said:""Dividends provide a positive return cushion with a notable portion of outperformance for payers versus non-payers coming during periods of market volatility. Specifically, the majority of outperformance comes during large market pullbacks such as 2000, 2008, 2015, and 2020.""The Business Insider report also revealed that stocks that started paying dividends in 2000 have outperformed the market since then. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) have been raising their dividends for decades, becoming top choices for investors.

Here is what the firm has to say:“We were fairly active in the quarter as market dislocations allowed us to be opportunistic, while focusing on companies with stronger moats, better pricing power, more predictable long-term growth and higher returns. In the materials sector we exited PPG Industries, Inc. (NYSE:PPG) and initiated a position in Sherwin-Williams. While both companies operate in the paint and coating industry and are benefiting from improving margins as raw material prices have come down of late, we believe Sherwin-Williams’ dominant retail footprint affords it better pricing power through the cycle. The company provided conservative 2023 guidance and has been successfully gaining market share in the pro segment. While PPG has more European and industrial exposure, Sherwin-Williams’ residential and more domestic focus should also benefit the company as housing indicators appear to be troughing. Weak housing in the face of higher mortgage rates caused Sherwin-Williams stock to sell off in the first quarter, creating a compelling investment opportunity for long-term focused fundamental investors.”21.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on stock market performance overall, head directly to 5 Worst Performing Dow Stocks YTD.In a July report by J.P. Morgan, it was stated that global economic growth is expected to slow down in the latter part of 2023, while inflation appears to be easing. However, it's worth noting that global core inflation is projected to remain elevated, staying above 3% until 2024. This ongoing high inflation will continue to exert pressure on central banks, potentially leading to further tightening measures. Bruce Kasman, Chief Global Economist at J.P. Morgan, said:“We do not think inflation is going to come back down to central bank comfort zones by themselves. Yes, there’s a decline going on. But no, we do not think you’re going to get inflation back below 3% in the U.S. or the euro area this year in an environment where supply has been damaged in a more lasting way and inflation psychology has shifted.”In the first half of 2023, global economic growth gained momentum, reaching a rate of 2.8%. So far, efforts to tighten monetary policies have balanced the diminishing impact of supply disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, starting in 2022, global policy rates have increased by nearly 400 basis points, affecting spending sensitive to interest rates and limiting industrial production. Despite the current growth momentum, it is believed that the global economy's resilience is decreasing. Consequently, it is expected that developed markets may undergo another round of tightening measures before the end of 2023 to control inflation. However, such actions may have adverse effects on the private sector's well-being. Consequently, there is a possibility of a synchronized global economic recession occurring, potentially before the end of 2024. J.P. Morgan Research anticipates that the United States may experience a mild recession toward the end of 2023. This is attributed to the Federal Reserve's conservative monetary policy, which is leading to stricter credit availability and a gradual decline in economic growth. The Western European economy faced challenges during the winter due to high energy prices. Although the first quarter of 2023 showed some improvement, overall economic growth remained relatively stagnant.Story continuesIn the first six months of 2023, there was a noticeable variance in stock performance, with differences observed in size, sectors, and investment styles. Surprisingly, this occurred amidst an unusual period of low volatility. Looking ahead, without any proactive measures from the Federal Reserve, experts expect a more difficult economic environment for stocks in the latter part of 2023. A similar less optimistic outlook is observed for equity markets in other regions across the world. Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, Global Head of Equity Macro Strategy at J.P. Morgan, stated:“Given that multiple expansion has been the main driver of performance year to date, we see unattractive risk-reward for equities and increasing investor complacency ahead of our expectation that the business cycle will further decelerate in the second half of the year, with the onset of a recession likely in the fourth quarter of 2023 or first quarter of 2024. What’s more, consumers are starting to show signs of weakness, and there is a risk that liquidity and credit conditions could tighten in the coming months.”According to S&amp;P Global, the Dow Jones Industrial Average showed improvement in September, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 but still experiencing a decline of 3.5%; -3.42% with dividends considered. However, when we consider the year-to-date performance, the Dow has lagged significantly behind the S&amp;P 500, with a gain of 1.09%;  2.73% with dividends, while the S&amp;P 500 has recorded an increase of 11.68%. This difference in performance is primarily attributed to how these indices are constructed, with factors like price weighting versus market value weighting playing a role. Historically, these differences tend to align, but in shorter time frames, disparities can emerge.In this article, we discuss some of the worst performing Dow stocks which include Verizon Communications Inc.

The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Year-to-Date Share Price Performance as of October 11: -4.63%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 92The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) functions as a global entertainment business. It is divided into two parts – Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution; and Disney Parks, Experiences and Products.

This decline followed the company's announcement of significant investments in its Parks segment, with the goal of doubling the current investment.The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) stock has faced setbacks due to the negative news surrounding its conflict with Florida legislators over a controversial education law. This has contributed to wider concerns that the streaming industry's growth is slowing down, impacting the outlook for The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)’s Disney+ streaming service.As per Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 92 hedge funds were bullish on The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), compared to the last quarter when 95 funds had invested in the stock.

Disney’s Bob Iger returned to the CEO’s seat in November 2022, replacing Bob Chapek, who left following a turbulent tenure. As a result of disappointing quarterly results and incremental commentary suggesting a more inline strategy with other media, the market has become less confident that Iger will achieve a turnaround by the end of his 1.5- year contract. We continue to believe Disney has a unique collection of assets and owns some of the best content among all media companies. Their ability to monetize this content across many platforms — studio, theme park, toys, streaming — is incredibly valuable; thus we remain investors.”14.

The actual card is fairly sleek (as you can see below), as customers' names are etched into an Apple titanium card. The no-fee card generated a lot of hype, as many early users were quick to post their latest card on various social media sites.The initial goal of Marcus (back in 2016) was to leverage Goldman’s wonderful name brand and build a full-service digital bank. This card was a large piece of GS’s ambitions to grow its retail banking franchise called Marcus. After 5 years, Marcus now has 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances. Surprisingly, Marcus now represents nearly 20% of the firm’s total revenue.We thought it would be interesting to look at how the Apple Card is doing in terms of loans and exposures. With over $100 billion in assets, this has been a successful source of cheap deposits for GS. Despite having an institutional / “white shoe” brand in the investment banking and trading world, GS’s Apple Card has been a disappointment.”8.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the retirement phenomenon within the U.S., and go directly to read the Retirement Stock Portfolio: 5 Low Risk Investments.In 2021, the economy faced persistent challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic's enduring impact. Despite recovery efforts, several significant hurdles created uncertainty regarding the revival. Inflation reached levels not seen in years, supply-chain disruptions hindered economic growth, and a limited labor pool presented ongoing difficulties for employers. This was further complicated by a record number of individuals either changing roles or leaving the workforce. Additionally, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic led to a growing interest in retirement among Americans.Retirees globally are exploring avenues to boost their income through investments due to the highest inflation recorded in nearly four decades. Addressing this concern, the Social Security Administration alleviated the situation by announcing an 8.7% increase in benefits earlier this year to mitigate the impact of inflation, as cited by Bloomberg. With this adjustment, the average retiree benefit has reached $1,827 per month, marking a $146 increase from the previous year. However, given the average annual household expenses for individuals aged 65-74 amounting to approximately $53,000, these social security benefits fall short of covering living costs adequately.Despite the data mentioned earlier, the United States possesses a thriving and robust retirement industry. McKinsey's research indicates that the U.S. retirement market boasts a substantial $26 trillion in assets. This data also forecasts a remarkable shift: by 2030, retirees are expected to contribute more to global consumption than individuals in the working age range of 15 to 59 years in China. Within the retirement industry, the largest segment—Defined Contribution—accounts for approximately 30% of the total assets, totaling around $8 trillion, and generates an impressive $30 billion in revenue for managing firms. This segment oversees approximately 110 million accounts and has shown consistent growth over the past decade.Story continuesLastly, an integral facet of retirement involves the assisted living community sector, commonly known as old age homes. These facilities offer seniors companionship and care during the later stages of their lives. As detailed in a research report by Grand View Market Research, the assisted living industry was valued at around $91.8 billion in 2022 and is anticipated to undergo a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.53% from 2023 to 2030. Within this market, the segment dedicated to individuals aged 85 and above held the largest market share in 2022. Looking towards 2040, the senior population in this age bracket is expected to more than double, rising from 6.4 million in 2016 to an estimated 14.6 million.Shares of prominent companies such as The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are favored by retirees due to their consistent free cash flow and impressive histories of dividend growth. In the following sections, we'll explore additional low-risk stock options suitable for retirement portfolios.Retirement Stock Portfolio: 10 Low Risk InvestmentsPhoto by Max Harlynking on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor our list of the 10 best low-risk stocks for a retirement portfolio, we used a stock screener to come up with a list of stocks with a beta value of less than 1.

CVS has been moving its portfolio to a more value-based outcome model, and Aetna was a major move in that direction. We were willing to accept the leverage that came with the deal because CVS has a very cash generative model, and we anticipated the free cash flow would enable the company to de-lever fairly quickly.By mid-2022, CVS was in a position to use the free cash flow that had been going to debt repayment to do bolt-on deals to further prepare for the value-based outcome model and/or return more cash to shareholders in the form of higher dividends or share repurchases. However, CVS lost a “star” in its largest Medicare plan in late 2022 and this will adversely impact earnings in 2024. This was a surprise and disappointment to us, but management should be able to regain the “star” in the back half of 2023, which will then give the company a nice tailwind in 2025…” (Click here to read the full text)7. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67Dividend Yield as of 12/10: 0.72%Beta Value: 0.78Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) operates an international chain of membership warehouses, mainly under the “Costco Wholesale” name, that carry quality, brand-name merchandise at substantially lower prices than are typically found at conventional wholesale or retail sources.

But it's unusual to see downgrades come after stocks have been pummeled, have no recent bad news and are near or at 52-week lows.The reason it's unusual is that analysts who downgrade stocks or slice price targets near 52-week lows run the risk of piling on too late and being embarrassed as an oversold stock rebounds and performs very well over the next few months.An example of this occurred earlier this year when several analysts jumped on the bandwagon to downgrade or cut the price target of SL Green Realty Corp. (NYSE:SLG) after it had already fallen from $41 to $21 in just two months. One particularly bad call was on March 28, when Citigroup maintained a Sell on SL Green and dropped the price target from $35 to $17, only to see it gap higher the next day and begin a run that would take it to $42.84 in six months.Don't Miss:Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes and you only need $100.Warren Buffett once said, ""If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die."" Here's how to collect $1,000 per month from Buffett's favorite dividend stock.Take a look at three real estate investment trusts (REITs) that one analyst recently downgraded on the same day — after all three had already seen major price collapses this year. As was the case with SL Green, it will be interesting to see whether these downgrades also turn out to be a bad call.Realty Income Corp.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance this year, and go directly to read 5 Biggest Dividend Cuts and Suspensions of 2023. It's not uncommon for companies to reduce or even suspend dividends during troubled times. For example, Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) reduced dividends during the 2008 financial crisis and in 2015, but its trend has been upward over the long term. A dividend cut alone shouldn't be an immediate signal to sell your shares in a company. It's important to investigate and understand why the company reduced its dividends.Dividend payouts have remained stable this year as many companies around the world held their dividends steady. According to Janus Henderson, global dividends did better than expected in the second quarter. The total payout hit a new record of $568.1 billion, up 4.9% from the previous year. The real growth was 6.3% excluding special dividends, which was faster than the first quarter. Europe's strong dividend performance played a significant role in this.The report also mentioned that the dividend growth in the US slowed down in the second quarter. The total dividend payment of $148.0 billion increased by a modest 2.6% compared to the previous year. When considering the special, one-off dividends, the actual growth rate was 4.6%. This marks the sixth quarter in a row where growth has been decreasing. Some top companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) reduced their dividends this year.

These funds underperformed last year, which helped the duo rally hard this year amid favorable operating environment. Even after such stupendous rise, housing stocks and ETFs are primed for further rally. Here’s why.Mortgage Rates to Decline in 2024?Although the Fed is likely to enact one more rate hike of this year worth 25-bps in November, the U.S. central bank has hinted that the rates have peaked and we might see a slump in rates in 2024. The Fed might cut rates twice next year. This fact might lead to a decline in mortgage rates in the medium term – a tailwind for the housing industry.Cheaper Valuation Despite a Huge Rally This YearThe homebuilding industry has forward P/E ratio of 8.10X versus 17.22X P/E possessed by the S&amp;P 500. Price-to-Book ratio of the industry is 1.06X versus S&amp;P 500’s 4.55X. Return-on Equity of the industry is 18.66X versus S&amp;P 500’s 17.39X. Debt-to-Equity ratio of the industry is 0.21X versus the S&amp;P 500’s 0.63X. Companies like D.R. Horton DHI, KB Home KBH and Lennar Corporation LEN reported impressive earnings this reporting season with all companies beating earnings estimates.Does Buffett's Approval Indicate Homebuilders' Value Proposition?Warren Buffett's repute as an investment achiever is known to all. Investors worldwide pay close attention to his strategies. In the second quarter, Buffett’s company Berkshire Hathaway established positions in three new stocks: NVR NVR, Lennar and D.R. Horton (read: Is It Time to Buy Homebuilding ETFs Following Warren Buffett?).Buffett and his experienced portfolio managers possess a strong conviction in the potential of the industry as a whole. Buffett is a fan of value investing. Berkshire’s acquisition of three stocks despite a great rally this year is tell-tale sign of the remaining value quotient in the homebuilding space.Story continuesReturn of Stable TrafficIn 2022, the Fed's aggressive measures against inflation led to a rapid rise in mortgage rates, causing a retreat of homebuyers. However, buyers seem to have accepted the increased borrowing costs this year and have returned to the market.NAHB/Wells Fargo Traffic of Prospective Buyers is at a current level of 30.00. Though the figure is down from 35.00 last month and down from 31.00 one year ago, we expect a dip in yields and rising home construction (which would keep home prices at check) would supply more buyers to the market in the coming months. Moreover, to attract price-conscious buyers, many builders are offering rates much lower than the prevailing ones through their financing arms.Improving Supply ChainAnother positive aspect for builders is an improving supply chain. With the decreasing costs of lumber (down 0.4% past month and up 2.5% in the past six months) and more available hiring options, some homebuilding companies, suggest that the issues regarding supply chain disruptions are largely behind them. Housing companies are thus on huge construction spree.Bottom LineThe housing market is still undersupplied, especially in the entry-level and affordable segments, where many homebuilders are focusing their efforts. This means that there is still strong demand for new homes, especially from first-time buyers and millennials.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, the consensus estimate for third-quarter earnings has been revised 63% downward over the past 60 days.Given this backdrop, let's delve deeper into the factors likely to have influenced AAL’s third-quarter 2023 performance.We expect upbeat air-travel demand, particularly on the domestic front, to have boosted American Airlines’ top-line performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Passenger revenues, which account for the bulk of the top line, are likely to have been high, in turn, strengthening total revenues.  Our estimate for passenger revenues is pegged at $12.47 billion, indicating a marginal rise year over year.Driven by the uptick, AAL expects third-quarter 2023 adjusted operating margin in the range of 8-10%. Our estimate is pegged at 8.6%. The carrier projects total revenue per available seat miles (a measure of unit revenue) to be between 4.5% and 6.5%, lower than third-quarter 2022 actuals. Our estimate hints at a 4.1% rise.Driven by upbeat traffic, load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) is likely to have been impressive in the September quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 83.4%.American Airlines Group Inc. Price and EPS Surprise American Airlines Group Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAmerican Airlines Group Inc. price-eps-surprise | American Airlines Group Inc. Quote However, high fuel costs might have affected the bottom-line performance in the quarter under review. Fuel cost per gallon is projected in the range of $2.55-$2.65 for third-quarter 2023. Even though fuel price has come down from the highs witnessed earlier, it still remains elevated.With the pandemic coming to an end, cargo revenues are on the wane.  Evidently, cargo revenues declined 39.2% year over year in the first half of 2023. Cargo yield per ton mile dipped 25.8% in the first six months of 2023. We estimated the metric to fall 11.2% year over year.Story continuesAAL projects third-quarter earnings per share (excluding net special items) in the 85-95 cents range. The midpoint of the revised guidance (90 cents) is way higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 33 cents.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for AAL this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. This is absolutely not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.American Airlines has an Earnings ESP of +0.00% (the Most Accurate Estimate is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 33 cents) and presently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Highlights of Q2American Airlines’ second-quarter 2023 earnings (excluding 4 cents from non-recurring items) of $1.92 per share easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.58. In the year-ago quarter, AAL reported earnings of 76 cents as air-travel demand was not so robust back then.Operating revenues of $14,055 million jumped 4.7% year over year. The top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13,736.3 million.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few stocks from the broader Zacks Transportation sector that investors may consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat on their third-quarter 2023 earnings.Old Dominion Freight Line ODFL has an Earnings ESP of +0.40% and a Zacks Rank #2.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis world's largest airline is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.33 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -52.2%.Revenues are expected to be $13.53 billion, up 0.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 54.23% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for American Airlines?For American Airlines, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that American Airlines will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that American Airlines would post earnings of $1.58 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.92, delivering a surprise of +21.52%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.American Airlines doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), which belongs to the Zacks Automotive - Retail and Wholesale - Parts industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This auto parts retailer has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 2.60%.For the most recent quarter, O'Reilly Automotive was expected to post earnings of $10.05 per share, but it reported $10.22 per share instead, representing a surprise of 1.69%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $8 per share, while it actually produced $8.28 per share, a surprise of 3.50%.For O'Reilly Automotive, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.O'Reilly Automotive currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.41%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on October 25, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 10 Best Dividend Aristocrats According to Analysts. With the stock market facing ongoing fluctuations, investors are experiencing the frustration of seeing their profits disappear. For instance, the S&amp;P 500 increased by 19.5% from January to July 2023 but has since fallen by 6%. Considering the Federal Reserve's inclination to maintain higher interest rates for an extended period, negative investor sentiment, and the typical seasonal decline, it appears that the momentum of this summer's market rally might continue to weaken as we enter the fall season. According to analysts, investors can mitigate their losses by investing in dividend stocks.Dividend stocks are already a popular choice among investors due to their reliability in providing a steady stream of income. Between 1993 and the end of last year, the S&amp;P 500 index increased by 777%. But with dividends included, the S&amp;P 500 grew by over 1,400% during that same time frame. In addition to this, when we examine the performance of the S&amp;P 500 on a decade-by-decade basis, we can see that the role of dividends in contributing to the total return has fluctuated over time. From 1930 to 2021, dividends accounted for an average of 40% of the S&amp;P 500's total return.A recent study conducted by Morgan Stanley's chief investment officer, Mike Wilson, found that stocks that pay dividends tend to perform better in the long run and are more resilient during market downturns. Here are some comments from the analyst, taken from his interview with Business Insider this month.""Our economists are of the view that inflation will continue to slow from elevated levels over the next 12 months. That backdrop is supportive of owning dividend-related factors and defensive dividend payers, in particular.""Story continuesHe further said:""Dividends provide a positive return cushion with a notable portion of outperformance for payers versus non-payers coming during periods of market volatility. Specifically, the majority of outperformance comes during large market pullbacks such as 2000, 2008, 2015, and 2020.""The Business Insider report also revealed that stocks that started paying dividends in 2000 have outperformed the market since then. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) have been raising their dividends for decades, becoming top choices for investors.

The company has been increasing its dividends for over 67 years, which is one of the longest streaks in the market. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share.

Here is what the firm has to say:“We were fairly active in the quarter as market dislocations allowed us to be opportunistic, while focusing on companies with stronger moats, better pricing power, more predictable long-term growth and higher returns. In the materials sector we exited PPG Industries, Inc. (NYSE:PPG) and initiated a position in Sherwin-Williams. While both companies operate in the paint and coating industry and are benefiting from improving margins as raw material prices have come down of late, we believe Sherwin-Williams’ dominant retail footprint affords it better pricing power through the cycle. The company provided conservative 2023 guidance and has been successfully gaining market share in the pro segment. While PPG has more European and industrial exposure, Sherwin-Williams’ residential and more domestic focus should also benefit the company as housing indicators appear to be troughing. Weak housing in the face of higher mortgage rates caused Sherwin-Williams stock to sell off in the first quarter, creating a compelling investment opportunity for long-term focused fundamental investors.”21.

395,8d86de2f-7a2e-30c4-b08e-a608dbbc1c9e,FRT,2023-10-13,5 Reasons to Add Federal Realty (FRT) Stock to Your Portfolio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-reasons-add-federal-realty-171200276.html,1697130720,STORY,['FRT'],"[Adding Federal Realty FRT to your portfolio seems a wise idea, given the strength of this retail REIT’s fundamentals and solid prospects.The increase in consumers’ preference for in-person shopping experiences, following the pandemic downtime, has been driving the recovery of the retail real estate industry. Also, the impending holiday season is of great importance to retailers, making up a significant portion of their annual revenues. Further, the less availability of retail spaces is an upside. Given this backdrop, Federal Realty is well-poised to benefit from its portfolio of premium assets in the United States.While shares of FRT have declined 10.5% in the past three months compared with the industry's drop of 9.7%, the recent estimate revision trend indicates that analysts are bullish on this stock. Over the past two months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 FFO per share has moved marginally upward to $6.53.The current price indicates a good entry point, and FRT currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFactors That Make Federal Realty a Solid PickSuperior Property Location &amp; Diversified Tenant Base: Federal Realty’s portfolio of premium retail assets — mainly situated in the major coastal markets from Washington, DC, to Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles — along with a diverse tenant base, both national and local, positions it well for decent growth.The company has strategically selected the first ring suburbs of nine major metropolitan markets. Due to the strong demographics and infill nature of its properties, the company has been able to maintain a high occupancy level over the years. A well-diversified tenant base of retailers minimizes the risks related to any particular retail industry and assures a stable source of rental revenues.Expansion, Development and Redevelopment Efforts: FRT has been capitalizing on expansion opportunities in premium markets, which leads to income growth and creates long-term value. In January 2023, the company acquired the remaining portions of Huntington Square in East Northport, NY, for $35.5 million, giving it full control of the 243,000 square feet property in the heart of Suffolk County's retail corridor.Moreover, in 2022, it acquired properties worth $443.1 million. As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, throughout the portfolio, Federal Realty has redevelopment projects underway, with a projected total cost of approximately $228 million, which it expects to stabilize over the next several years.Also, this retail REIT has ongoing improvements at 15 properties to better position the assets to capture a disproportionate amount of retail demand. Such efforts bode well for the company’s long-term growth.Mixed-Use Focus: Federal Realty is exploring the mixed-use development option, which has gained immense popularity in recent years as it helps catch the attention of people who prefer to live, work and play in the same area. As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, the company had active mixed-use redevelopment/expansion projects in San Jose, CA, North Bethesda, MD, and Darien, CT, with a projected cost of $610-$650 million. It has incurred $448 million of the cost as of Jun 30, 2023. This augurs well for long-term growth.Balance Sheet &amp; Cash Flow Strength: Federal Realty focuses on maintaining a decent balance sheet position with ample liquidity. The company exited second-quarter 2023 with $1.3 billion of total liquidity.FRT’s current cash flow growth is projected at 27.04% compared with the 14.92% growth projected for the industry. Moreover, this REIT’s trailing 12-month return on equity (“ROE”) highlights its growth potential. The company’s ROE of 13.65% compares favorably with the industry’s 4.21%, reflecting that FRT is more efficient in using shareholders’ funds than its peers. Given its balance sheet strength and prudent financial management, the company is well-poised to capitalize on growth opportunities.Dividend: Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for REIT shareholders, and Federal Realty remains committed to that. In August 2023, concurrent with the second-quarter 2023 earnings release, the company announced a hike in its regular quarterly cash dividend to $1.09 per share from $1.08 paid out earlier. The new dividend indicates an annual rate of $4.36 per share.FRT has paid out uninterrupted dividends since its inception in 1962, and the latest hike marked the 56th consecutive year of common dividend increases by the company. Moreover, backed by healthy operating fundamentals, we expect FFO to increase 5.4% in 2023. Given the company’s solid operating platform, our FFO growth projections and balance sheet strength compared with industry counterparts, this dividend rate is expected to be sustainable.Story continuesOther Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are Phillips Edison &amp; Company PECO and Tanger Factory Outlet Centers SKT, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 at present.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Phillips Edison’s current-year FFO per share has moved marginally northward over the past month to $2.33.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Tanger Factory’s ongoing year’s FFO per share has been raised marginally over the past month to $1.89.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In addition to this, when we examine the performance of the S&amp;P 500 on a decade-by-decade basis, we can see that the role of dividends in contributing to the total return has fluctuated over time. From 1930 to 2021, dividends accounted for an average of 40% of the S&amp;P 500's total return.A recent study conducted by Morgan Stanley's chief investment officer, Mike Wilson, found that stocks that pay dividends tend to perform better in the long run and are more resilient during market downturns. Here are some comments from the analyst, taken from his interview with Business Insider this month.""Our economists are of the view that inflation will continue to slow from elevated levels over the next 12 months. That backdrop is supportive of owning dividend-related factors and defensive dividend payers, in particular.""Story continuesHe further said:""Dividends provide a positive return cushion with a notable portion of outperformance for payers versus non-payers coming during periods of market volatility. Specifically, the majority of outperformance comes during large market pullbacks such as 2000, 2008, 2015, and 2020.""The Business Insider report also revealed that stocks that started paying dividends in 2000 have outperformed the market since then. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) have been raising their dividends for decades, becoming top choices for investors.

Here is what the firm has to say:“We were fairly active in the quarter as market dislocations allowed us to be opportunistic, while focusing on companies with stronger moats, better pricing power, more predictable long-term growth and higher returns. In the materials sector we exited PPG Industries, Inc. (NYSE:PPG) and initiated a position in Sherwin-Williams. While both companies operate in the paint and coating industry and are benefiting from improving margins as raw material prices have come down of late, we believe Sherwin-Williams’ dominant retail footprint affords it better pricing power through the cycle. The company provided conservative 2023 guidance and has been successfully gaining market share in the pro segment. While PPG has more European and industrial exposure, Sherwin-Williams’ residential and more domestic focus should also benefit the company as housing indicators appear to be troughing. Weak housing in the face of higher mortgage rates caused Sherwin-Williams stock to sell off in the first quarter, creating a compelling investment opportunity for long-term focused fundamental investors.”21.

If you want to skip our discussion on the commodities market, head directly to 5 Best Commodity ETFs. Agricultural commodities consist of livestock, grains, oilseeds, sugar, and cocoa, to name some. Ever since the pandemic in 2021, the commodities market was presented with a number of challenges. Disruptions to the labor market and the global supply chain triggered a volatile pricing. As people tried to acclimatize to the lockdowns, consumer behavior changed and shifts were observed in demand. According to the World Bank, the prices for commodities are expected to decline by roughly 21% in 2023 - the sharpest decline since the extreme conditions of the pandemic. According to Euromonitor International, the agricultural commodities can be expected to decrease by 5.6% due to the higher supply. As the supply chain improves, this increase is being spearheaded by the increased production of corn, wheat, soybeans, and palm oil in Brazil, Australia, Canada, Russia, and the United States. In contrast, the price for rice and sugar is expected to increase. This is due to the rising demand for rice and a restrictive market for sugar. Despite the global pressure for a recession, the economy is somewhat stable. Hence, the decrease in fuel prices have made for cheaper inputs for the farming industry. However, the average fertilizer cost is still twice as high as pre-pandemic levels. Given the recessionary pressure and the expectation of costs further increasing, the margins in the agricultural industry are faced with some pressure.Similar to this, the energy-based commodity prices are also estimated to decrease to be 23% lower than that in 2022. This can be attributed to the improved levels of energy conservation and the favorable weather, which has helped reduce the demand. According to S&amp;P Global, the demand for fossil fuels is expected to increase during the year, which is against the increased legislative efforts to reduce emissions. Mr. Dan Klein, the Head of Energy Pathways, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, stated China’s covid policy as the most important factor for the global demand for energy commodities in 2023. He commented: Story continues“As its (China’s) demand softness due to lockdowns in 2022 was a key safety valve for oil, gas, and coal markets, while Europe scrambled to replace Russian energy. With another year of vaccinations and growing frustrations with lockdowns domestically in China, restrictions will likely ease somewhat in 2023 and imports of fossil fuels can be expected to increase again.""Also Read: 10 Best Natural Resources ETFsAs per the S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights Energy Outlook for 2023, the total demand for China’s energy market is set to increase by 3.3 million barrels – this would make up 47% of the global energy demand growth. Just like China, India’s demand for energy will also be crucial for the industry. As tensions continue between Russia and Europe, India is expected to be a key buyer for Russian energy. Similar to the agricultural and energy sector, the prices for crucial metals have experienced a 17% decline during the first quarter of 2023. Much like the commodity sector as a whole, the pandemic caused major disruptions to the supply chain for precious metals. As people adjusted to an online model to work and study, the demand for precious metals such as lithium increased. To make things worse, mining was halted and the supply lines were stretched thin. Ever since 2021, the industry has been adjusting. During the year, the industry has experienced an improved supply of metals, as shipments for non-ferrous metals increased in 2023. Coupled with a lower than anticipated demand for these metals, the prices have significantly fallen. While the prices have definitely reduced since 2022, the industry has still not reverted back to pre-pandemic levels. The historically high price of metals is a crucial concern for manufacturers, as the cost of production and sourcing raw materials remains staggering. Furthermore, the increased cost of production will continue to adversely affect the purchasing power parity for consumers. The ETFs featured in this article also enjoy an exposure to the market for gold and silver. According to the London Bullion Market (LBMA), the price for gold is to be affected by the US dollar and federal reserve rates, inflation, and other geopolitical factors. The global economic pressure called central banks to act. Although favorable, these attempts are deemed not enough in dampening the inflationary pressures. Despite the rise in rates, the price for gold rose about 6.53% between January 3 and February 2. In comparison, the US dollar fell by 1.77% during the same period. The USD then rose as Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve Chair, announced the US interest rates would continue rising. However, the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, the bail-out of First Republic Bank, and the distressed sale of Credit Suisse to UBS in Europe resulted in a drop in the US dollar. Following this, on March 24, the price for gold reached £1634.84, the highest it ever has in GBP. In contrast, silver prices dropped during the first quarter of 2023. However, it also experienced a change in the market mood as the price increased by 18.8% during March. Some of the best commodity stocks to look out for include Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX), Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), and Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO). However, we discuss the best commodity ETFs in this article. Our Methodology For this article, we have specifically considered ETFs that include natural commodities.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 19. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis mining company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.34 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +30.8%.Revenues are expected to be $5.55 billion, up 10.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.81% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Freeport-McMoRan?For Freeport-McMoRan, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -8.13%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Freeport-McMoRan will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Freeport-McMoRan would post earnings of $0.28 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.35, delivering a surprise of +25%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Freeport-McMoRan doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of passive income ideas and dividend stocks, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks For Passive Income. Passive income is becoming increasingly popular among people from diverse backgrounds. It's an appealing idea, especially with the current economic uncertainty, and it's capturing the attention of investors more than ever. According to a survey by LendingClub Corp. and Pymnts.com conducted in March this year, nearly half of working people have a side job or another source of extra income, like selling handmade items. Surprisingly, it's not just those with lower income; even people making $100,000 a year often seek additional income to cover their expenses. The report also mentioned that consumers could be collecting over $50 billion in total every month from their extra earnings, and a significant part of this money might not be reported to tax authorities.Passive income often arises from investments, assets, or activities that need very little ongoing work after they are established. Passive exchange-traded funds, that aim to replicate the performance of a specific market index or asset class, are important in this regard. In one of our articles, we referred to James Seyffart’s statement from Bloomberg Intelligence, who mentioned that passive investing is steadily on the rise in the US. Currently, passive mutual funds and ETFs own around 19% of the average publicly traded U.S. stock, which is three times higher than it was in 2013.Investing in dividend stocks is also one of the most reliable ways to generate passive income. Dividend-paying stocks help investors receive regular dividend payments, typically on a quarterly basis, without having to actively work or make ongoing investments. This income can provide a steady cash flow, making it a reliable source of passive income. In addition to this, dividend stocks have significantly contributed to the market’s overall returns. Between 2013 and 2022, dividends accounted for 17% of the overall returns in the S&amp;P 500 Index. But if we consider a much longer period, going back to the 1930s, dividends contributed to 37% of the returns.Story continuesThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the best dividend stocks as these companies have been raising their payouts year after year. To create passive income, it's vital that dividends consistently increase over time. In this article, we will further discuss dividend stocks to earn passive income.12 Best Dividend Stocks For Passive IncomePhoto by Sharon McCutcheon on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of Q2 2023 and picked companies that have raised their dividends for at least 10 consecutive years or more. From that list, we narrowed down our options to companies with strong financial positions and steady cash flow, indicating reliable future dividends for generating passive income. We then sorted these companies in ascending order based on the number of funds that hold stakes in them as of the second quarter of 2023.12. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is an American multinational telecommunications and media conglomerate. The company is also one of the largest cable television and broadband internet service providers in the country.In the second quarter of 2023, Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) reported revenue of $30.5 billion, which showed a 1.6% growth from the same period last year. The company's operating cash flow for the quarter came in at roughly $7.3 billion and its free cash flow amounted to $3.4 billion. It also returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends during the quarter, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks for passive income.The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some other reliable options for generating passive income.Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) has raised its dividends for 15 years in a row. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.29 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.65%, as of October 12.At the end of Q2 2023, 66 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database reported having stakes in Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), down from 68 a quarter earlier. The consolidated value of these stakes is over $3.14 billion.ClearBridge Investments mentioned Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) in its Q3 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Long-term holdings Charter and Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) delivered strong second-quarter results relative to expectations; their stable recurring revenue streams and undemanding valuations were rewarded in the current environment. Cable multiples compressed over the past 24 months on fears of heightened competition in their core broadband business from fixed wireless and fiber providers. While fiber remains a competitive alternative to cable broadband over the long term, high upfront investments and a materially higher cost of capital are resulting in slower buildouts than previously expected. Fixed wireless also continues to gain traction, particularly in rural markets, but share gains also appear to be moderating. At the same time, both Comcast and Charter are expanding their footprints into rural and adjacent markets while gaining wireless market share, leveraging their mobile virtual network operator agreements with Verizon. We think both cable companies are well-positioned to continue to grow while generating substantial free cash flows. We added to Comcast during the quarter.”11.

That was the year when Robert Atkins, the eponymous father of a popular diet, slipped on a sheet of ice in New York and died. The low-carb king was at the peak of his powers. One of his books, “Diet Revolution”, briefly outsold even “Harry Potter”. His message, not of abstinence but of indulgence in the finer things of life such as steak, bacon, eggs and cream, spread joy through the livestock pits of Chicago, and alarm through bakeries and confectioneries. Wheat prices fell. Unilever, an Anglo-Dutch food giant, blamed the Atkins diet for shrinking sales. Yet by late 2003 the craze had gone the way of its founder, snuffed out by a blend of boredom, bad breath and bad publicity. As one newspaper summed it up: “Atkins is toast.”Every decade brings something new to avoid. In the 1970s it was calories; in the 1980s, salt; in the 1990s, fat; in the 2000s, carbs; in the 2010s gluten and dairy. But this time is different, isn’t it? The latest killjoys threatening the food, beverage and restaurant industries are not another dietary fad, but injectable medicines, such as Wegovy, approved in 2021 as an anti-obesity drug, and Ozempic and Mounjaro, anti-diabetes drugs used off-label for weight loss. Besides stimulating insulin production, the so-called GLP-1 medicines reproduce a feeling of fullness and suppress appetite in a way that has a similar effect in the food and drink aisles as dietary restraint, except people are less likely to cheat.Investors in Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, which make the drugs, are delighted. Those in the soft-drinks and snacking businesses, less so. In recent weeks the share prices of Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, as well as of retailers like Walmart and Costco, have swooned. Pundits were swift to link a big sell-off on October 6th to comments by a Walmart executive in America who revealed that, according to anonymised data, those who bought weight-loss drugs also purchased less food. It sounded like an echo of the Unilever scare from two decades ago. In all likelihood, it is a red herring.Story continuesIt is easy to see why people are inclined to get carried away by the impact of “skinny pen” injections. Besides being a curse upon whom it falls, the economic consequences of obesity, from higher medical and insurance costs to lower workplace productivity, provide a compelling case for regulatory support for the drugs, as long as they are safe. Demand for GLP-1s is already exceeding supply; there are shortages of Wegovy and Ozempic, leading some pharmacists to make copycat versions.The potential for disruption is huge. About 70% of Americans are obese or overweight, and by 2035 it is estimated that half the world will be; treatment could represent mountains of forgone calories. In some food categories, obesity is not just a consequence of unhealthy demand but almost a prerequisite; more than a third of what Americans call candy is eaten by mostly overweight people bingeing on many bars, bags and boxes each week. Theoretically, the sky could be the limit. According to Jefferies, a bank, even airlines would benefit from anti-obesity drugs if falling average passenger weights enabled them to burn less fuel.Yet for now most of the projections are based on guesswork. More painstaking analysis has to include calculations not just of absolute obesity numbers, but of who is and is not eligible for insurance, people’s willingness to submit to treatment, the impact if the drugs have side-effects, the drop-out rates and the risk of regaining weight once off the drugs. Alexia Howard of Bernstein, an investment firm, takes a stab at sifting through the fog of numbers to forecast that over the next five years, if one-tenth of American adults take the drug, overall calorie demand would fall by no more than 0.5% a year. As she says, that is hardly a “doomsday scenario”—though makers of processed foods and sweets may suffer worse than others.The $1trn-plus food industry, stalwarts of which have been around for generations, will not sit idly by and let someone else decide their fate. On October 10th Ramon Laguarta, PepsiCo’s boss, was the latest to play down the impact, saying that anti-obesity drugs were on the firm’s radar but were not expected to affect any of the long-term trends boosting its snacks business, such as urbanisation, busy lives and a growing middle class. The firm could, of course, “pivot” if necessary, he added. Other processed-food companies have noted that trends such as smaller pack sizes and healthier foods already align with GLP-1-style eating habits. And big food could use its influence to subtly raise concerns about the cost and safety of the new drugs. With such deeply entrenched incumbents, weaning the world off fattening foods is unlikely to be much easier than ending its addiction to fossil fuels.Losing hearts and minds, not weightSo why the stockmarket swoon? The best answer is that current conditions may be worse than the food-and-beverage industry likes to admit. PepsiCo’s third-quarter sales and profits beat analysts’ expectations, but mostly thanks to higher prices. Volumes fell by 2.5% compared with a year ago. This change signals a worrying cyclical trend. Consumers, who tolerated high prices during and after the pandemic, have been hit hard by inflation. With a cooling labour market, many Americans may soon face growing hardship. Though the well-off continue to splash out on fancy foods and restaurants, surveys suggest that the rest are buying more staples, cooking from scratch at home, and using up their leftovers. Moreover, food companies are reluctant to recognise that they may have overexploited their pricing power.This is not as eye-catching an explanation for weak share prices as a full-on assault on obesity. But for the next year at least, belt-tightening rather than girth may well be the biggest thing on consumers’ minds.Read more from Schumpeter, our columnist on global business: So long iPhone.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the retirement phenomenon within the U.S., and go directly to read the Retirement Stock Portfolio: 5 Low Risk Investments.In 2021, the economy faced persistent challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic's enduring impact. Despite recovery efforts, several significant hurdles created uncertainty regarding the revival. Inflation reached levels not seen in years, supply-chain disruptions hindered economic growth, and a limited labor pool presented ongoing difficulties for employers. This was further complicated by a record number of individuals either changing roles or leaving the workforce. Additionally, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic led to a growing interest in retirement among Americans.Retirees globally are exploring avenues to boost their income through investments due to the highest inflation recorded in nearly four decades. Addressing this concern, the Social Security Administration alleviated the situation by announcing an 8.7% increase in benefits earlier this year to mitigate the impact of inflation, as cited by Bloomberg. With this adjustment, the average retiree benefit has reached $1,827 per month, marking a $146 increase from the previous year. However, given the average annual household expenses for individuals aged 65-74 amounting to approximately $53,000, these social security benefits fall short of covering living costs adequately.Despite the data mentioned earlier, the United States possesses a thriving and robust retirement industry. McKinsey's research indicates that the U.S. retirement market boasts a substantial $26 trillion in assets. This data also forecasts a remarkable shift: by 2030, retirees are expected to contribute more to global consumption than individuals in the working age range of 15 to 59 years in China. Within the retirement industry, the largest segment—Defined Contribution—accounts for approximately 30% of the total assets, totaling around $8 trillion, and generates an impressive $30 billion in revenue for managing firms. This segment oversees approximately 110 million accounts and has shown consistent growth over the past decade.Story continuesLastly, an integral facet of retirement involves the assisted living community sector, commonly known as old age homes. These facilities offer seniors companionship and care during the later stages of their lives. As detailed in a research report by Grand View Market Research, the assisted living industry was valued at around $91.8 billion in 2022 and is anticipated to undergo a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.53% from 2023 to 2030. Within this market, the segment dedicated to individuals aged 85 and above held the largest market share in 2022. Looking towards 2040, the senior population in this age bracket is expected to more than double, rising from 6.4 million in 2016 to an estimated 14.6 million.Shares of prominent companies such as The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are favored by retirees due to their consistent free cash flow and impressive histories of dividend growth. In the following sections, we'll explore additional low-risk stock options suitable for retirement portfolios.Retirement Stock Portfolio: 10 Low Risk InvestmentsPhoto by Max Harlynking on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor our list of the 10 best low-risk stocks for a retirement portfolio, we used a stock screener to come up with a list of stocks with a beta value of less than 1. We further narrowed down this list to include stocks that have a notable history of paying dividends to investors. Their dividend growth histories make them suitable options for retiree investors who seek to generate stable income. In addition to this, the hedge fund sentiment was measured using data from 910 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in Q2 2023.10. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58Dividend Yield as of 12/10: 2.79%Beta Value: 0.45Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is a multinational corporation based in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, situated on Park Avenue.

In total, the company has increased its dividends for an impressive streak of 61 consecutive years. As of October 12, the stock's dividend yield stood at 2.79%.Insider Monkey database of the second quarter of 2023 showed that out of 910 hedge funds profiled, 58 had a stake in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The largest stockholder was First Eagle Investment Management which had 11.1 million shares of Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) with a combined value of $854.6 million.Much like The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is a favored stock among retirees.9. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Dividend Yield as of 12/10: 3.43%Beta Value: 0.59Established in 1892, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a renowned multinational American corporation primarily recognized for its production of the iconic beverage, Coca-Cola. Beyond its flagship product, the company engages in the manufacture, distribution, and promotion of an extensive range of non-alcoholic beverage concentrates, syrups, and notably, alcoholic beverages within the beverage industry.In the first half of FY23, the company generated $4.6 billion in operating cash flow, with free cash flow reaching $4 billion for the same period.

CVS has been moving its portfolio to a more value-based outcome model, and Aetna was a major move in that direction. We were willing to accept the leverage that came with the deal because CVS has a very cash generative model, and we anticipated the free cash flow would enable the company to de-lever fairly quickly.By mid-2022, CVS was in a position to use the free cash flow that had been going to debt repayment to do bolt-on deals to further prepare for the value-based outcome model and/or return more cash to shareholders in the form of higher dividends or share repurchases. However, CVS lost a “star” in its largest Medicare plan in late 2022 and this will adversely impact earnings in 2024. This was a surprise and disappointment to us, but management should be able to regain the “star” in the back half of 2023, which will then give the company a nice tailwind in 2025…” (Click here to read the full text)7. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67Dividend Yield as of 12/10: 0.72%Beta Value: 0.78Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) operates an international chain of membership warehouses, mainly under the “Costco Wholesale” name, that carry quality, brand-name merchandise at substantially lower prices than are typically found at conventional wholesale or retail sources.

The company is known for its strong value proposition driven by high-quality low-cost offerings including a well-regarded private-label brand. Costco regularly ranks at the top of customer surveys related to brand trust, product price and quality, and all-around experience.

406,aa5e44aa-ad0a-3e7d-a062-e901fd0e284c,UNP,2023-10-13,Union Pacific (UNP) Gears Up for Q3 Earnings: What's in Store?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/union-pacific-unp-gears-q3-161600585.html,1697127360,STORY,"['UNP', 'KEX']","[Union Pacific Corporation UNP is scheduled to report third-quarter 2023 results on Oct 19, before market open.UNP has a disappointing earnings surprise history, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the preceding four quarters (missed twice), the average miss being 0.33%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter 2023 earnings has declined 4.9% over the past 60 days.Given this backdrop, let’s check out the factors that might have influenced Union Pacific’s performance in the quarter under review.Union Pacific Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseUnion Pacific Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseUnion Pacific Corporation price-eps-surprise | Union Pacific Corporation QuoteWe expect Union Pacific’s performance to have been affected by soft revenues due to weak freight demand. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is currently pegged at $6.1 billion, indicating a 7.8% decline from third-quarter 2022 actuals.Freight revenues account for the bulk of the top line. We estimate the metric to decline 5% from third-quarter 2022 levels.On the flip side, we expect fuel costs to be down 26.6% from the year-ago levels to $2.91 (average fuel cost per gallon).Operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) is likely to have improved sequentially. Our third-quarter 2023 projection for this key metric is currently pegged at 61.9%. Operating ratio was 63% in second-quarter 2023. A lower value of this metric is preferable.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for UNP this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  Earnings ESP Filter.Union Pacific currently has an Earnings ESP of -5.32% (the Most Accurate Estimate is currently pegged at $2.40 per share, 14 cents below the Zacks Consensus Estimate) and a Zacks Rank #3.Story continuesHighlights of Q2Union Pacific's second-quarter 2023 earnings of $2.57 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.75. Moreover, the bottom line plunged 12.3% on a year-over-year basis.Operating revenues of $5,963 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6,121.3 million. The top line tumbled 4.9% on a year-over-year basis due to reduced fuel surcharge revenues, lower volumes and an unfavorable business mix.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few stocks from the broader Zacks Transportation sector that investors may consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat on their third-quarter 2023 earnings.Old Dominion Freight Line ODFL has an Earnings ESP of +0.40% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.ODFL is scheduled to report third-quarter 2023 earnings on Oct 25.

ODFL has an impressive earnings surprise history, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters (missing the mark on the other occasion), the average beat being 3.86%.Kirby Corporation KEX has an Earnings ESP of +6.52% and a Zacks Rank #2.

407,f30de76f-64fe-3f6e-b547-ae60196685aa,UNP,2023-10-13,Analysts Estimate Union Pacific (UNP) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-union-pacific-unp-140036622.html,1697119236,STORY,['UNP'],"[The market expects Union Pacific (UNP) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 19, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis railroad is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.54 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -20.4%.Revenues are expected to be $6.06 billion, down 7.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.82% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Union Pacific?For Union Pacific, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -5.32%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Union Pacific will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Union Pacific would post earnings of $2.75 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.57, delivering a surprise of -6.55%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Union Pacific doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

On the bright side the share price is up over the last half decade. However we are not very impressed because the share price is only up 18%, less than the market return of 67%.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. Check out our latest analysis for Quest Diagnostics To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, Quest Diagnostics achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 3.5% per year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 3% per year. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Quest Diagnostics' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Quest Diagnostics, it has a TSR of 31% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveInvestors in Quest Diagnostics had a tough year, with a total loss of 2.1% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 18%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 5% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Quest Diagnostics better, we need to consider many other factors.
