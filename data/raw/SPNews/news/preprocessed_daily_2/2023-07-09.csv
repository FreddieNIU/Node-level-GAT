Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like CF Industries Holdings (NYSE:CF), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. Check out our latest analysis for CF Industries Holdings CF Industries Holdings' Improving ProfitsCF Industries Holdings has undergone a massive growth in earnings per share over the last three years. So much so that this three year growth rate wouldn't be a fair assessment of the company's future. So it would be better to isolate the growth rate over the last year for our analysis. Outstandingly, CF Industries Holdings' EPS shot from US$7.73 to US$15.51, over the last year. Year on year growth of 101% is certainly a sight to behold.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. The music to the ears of CF Industries Holdings shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 43% to 46% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. That's great to see, on both counts.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyWhile we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for CF Industries Holdings?Story continuesAre CF Industries Holdings Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of CF Industries Holdings, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Holding US$66m worth of stock in the company is no laughing matter and insiders will be committed in delivering the best outcomes for shareholders. This should keep them focused on creating long term value for shareholders.Does CF Industries Holdings Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?CF Industries Holdings' earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So at the surface level, CF Industries Holdings is worth putting on your watchlist; after all, shareholders do well when the market underestimates fast growing companies. What about risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for CF Industries Holdings   (of which 1 is concerning!) you should know about.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

1,d96f7c5b-308a-3390-9a3c-16cfc43390d6,CF,2023-07-09,The 7 Most Undervalued S&P 500 Stocks to Buy Now,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-most-undervalued-p-500-191059978.html,1688325059,STORY,"['DAL', 'PFE', 'MPC', 'ALB', 'AIG', '^GSPC', 'MO', 'CF']","[Finding deals in undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks is similar to finding deals in anything. It always raises the same question: Why is this priced lower than it should be? If you can’t find a logical reason for the discount then you should buy. That’s the basic premise here. These stocks are undervalued and undeservedly so. All have strong upside narratives and solid businesses that present reasonable ongoing opportunities. In short, if you can find the rationale for ongoing business growth then any given stock deserves at least your attention. If the fundamentals look healthy, then it’s worth the gamble. Let’s look at 7 of the most undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks to now now.Undervalued S&amp;P 500 Stocks: Delta Airlines (DAL)man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buy. Stocks With 1000% UpsideSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comDelta Airlines (NYSE:DAL) already telegraphed a strong second quarter when it released Q1 earnings back in mid-April. Management said it in no unclear terms: “Expect record June quarter revenue.” Share prices have moved up since then but there is plenty of room for growth remaining based on Wall Street analyst projections. Surging summer travel should reward Delta and is a great reason to get on board now. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIt’s also worth noting that those same analysts overwhelmingly rate DAL stock as a buy. Part of the hesitation around Delta stock stems from the pandemic hangover. Airlines were losing money hand-over-fist as it dragged on due to grounded operations. The cost of idle planes is massive. Just to refresh your memory, Delta was burning through $27 million in cash per day in June 2020. That led to an incursion of debt that currently plagues all airlines. But Delta offers positive news there: The company reported record free cash flows in the March quarter that allowed it to complete its full-year planned debt reduction in the first half of the year. That’s a huge accomplishment and bodes well for the fact that so many pundits worry about debt reduction as their primary concern with Delta. Story continuesUndervalued S&amp;P 500 Stocks: Marathon Petroleum (MPC)An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockMarathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) stock remains inexpensive overall. The metrics surrounding the company point squarely to that notion. But before jumping into that, let’s first understand the oil firm’s business model. Marathon Petroleum is a midstream/downstream oil company. It basically transports crude in its midstream business and refines and markets it downstream. The company currently makes the bulk of its earnings via the downstream segment so it’s more accurately a downstream firm. However it’s defined, Marathon Petroleum is growing on both fronts. Midstream earnings (29% of the total) increased from $1.4 billion to $1.53 billion in the first quarter. The downstream segment boomed, moving from $1.37 billion to $3.8 billion in earnings.Investors aren’t particularly enthusiastic about MPC stock, however. Its P/E ratio is just about as low as it has been in the last decade. Investors simply aren’t willing to pay as much for a dollar of its earnings as they were previously. That’s the opportunity, frankly. It’s cheaper than it should be. CF Industries (CF)Man holding stacks of money. Unknown Millionaire-Maker StocksSource: Epic Cure / ShutterstockCF Industries (NYSE:CF) is much the same as Marathon Petroleum stock in that regard. It, too, is deeply undervalued based on its P/E ratio which stands at 4.73 currently but has a median of 14.06 over the past decade. The company manufactures hydrogen and nitrogen products that it sells to firms across clean energy, emissions abatement, fertilizer, and other industrial niches. The best way to summarize CF Industries is as an excellent operator that suffers unduly due to commodity prices largely out of its control. The firm’s operational excellence is on display across broad profitability, value, and growth metrics that all favor investing in the firm. CF Industries is basically growing faster than the vast majority of its competitors, more profitably, while remaining undervalued relative to that growth. Those signs suggest that it makes sense to get in now. The reason it is undervalued likely relates to lower prices the company reported for the ammonia, urea, and nitrogen products it sells during the first quarter. Those prices are transitory, CF Industries’ ability to operate at a high rate is not transitory. Altria (MO)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comAltria (NYSE:MO) stock has vacillated between $43 to $48 in 2023. It is now priced around $43 and that price is really too good to ignore. Altria manufactures and sells cigarettes, tobacco, and other forms of nicotine.  Share prices have come down dramatically over the past several years as cigarette smoking rates decline. But what Altria losses there benefits investors as the company is pivoting into a more diversified, more smokeless portfolio while paying a handsome income to investors. Companies across the space are racing to release reduced-risk products and have seen rapid revenue growth there per a recent Zacks report. As Altria pivots to do so, it continues to pay a dividend yielding 8.6%. The company last reduced it in 1970 and is unlikely to again anytime soon. It’s one of the primary benefits as the firm pivots. That and the notion that the company creates massive shareholder value as measured by a return on invested income that far outstrips its weighted average cost. Albemarle (ALB)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) has garnered a lot of attention recently as EVs have taken hold and lithium became a hot commodity. That status as a major producer of a hot commodity saw stock prices move steadily upward over the past few years. They’ve come down in 2023 somewhat as lithium supply and demand factors roiled the market. But prices seem to stabilize in recent months and Albemarle is offering strong upside again. Wall Street analysts believe it could rise from $220 now to as high as $360 over the next year. Gurufocus is even more optimistic about its upside, pegging ALB’s share value at $450. The gamble here is that commodities markets like that for lithium are notoriously difficult to predict. That said, even when the bottom falls out, as it did in late 2022, Albemarle prices remained strong. Growth projections for lithium are approximately 20% compounded annually through 2033. I’m guessing Albemarle’s recent growth is not a fluke. American International Group (AIG) tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comAmerican International Group (NYSE:AIG) stock is relatively cheap as the company shifts its model slightly. The company is divesting its life insurance business line while placing increased focus on its core business insurance segment. That segment is doing well which is part of the reason to consider AIG at present.The divestiture of its life insurance business is dragging down operational efficiency. That’s keeping prices lower than they might otherwise be. Meanwhile, the company delivered its highest-ever Q1 general insurance underwriting income at $502 million. Those policies are sold to corporate clients around the world and grew by 13% during the period. The narrative for AIG is that it is transitioning to a more profitable business that is seeing increased demand for its risk products but looks somewhat weak due to that transition. AIG shares also come with a stable, lower-yield dividend that has plenty of room to grow based on payout ratios. Pfizer (PFE)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Best Speculative StocksSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comA recent Wall Street Journal article about Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and other vaccine stocks summarized the current opportunity well. That article highlights the fact that the big 3 vaccine makers have fallen dramatically in 2023. Part of the reason is that fewer and fewer people are planning to get boosted as time goes on. Pfizer is expected to report $20 billion in Paxlovid sales this year, down from $55 billion in 2022. Analysts believe the market will remain resilient as elderly populations are likely to continue to get boosted. So, there’s perhaps an overreaction on the part of investors regarding waning demand for Pfizer’s Covid vaccines. The other point is this: Pfizer took windfall Covid profits and bought Seagen (NASDAQ:SGEN). It now has cancer assets in its portfolio that it didn’t have. The neverending biotech search for the next blockbuster drug continues. Pfizer hedges against a patent cliff with its Seagen acquisition and it’s entirely reasonable to believe it could make further acquisitions. The point here is Pfizer is much better for having won the vaccine race. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Not to break the fourth wall or anything but I have a feeling you didn’t come to read InvestorPlace articles because you wanted to hear a pitch about slow-and-steady risers. Instead, you likely came here for the exciting stuff.Of course, there’s plenty of material covering exactly that topic. However, buy-and-hold stocks command significant relevance, especially in this ambiguous environment. I’ve said this before but the May jobs report – while busting expectations – also demonstrated fissures in the economy. In particular, unemployment conspicuously increased while employers don’t appear to be aggressively competing on wage incentives. Given that it’s still possible for a recession to materialize, now might not be the time to carry exclusive exposure to risk-on enterprises. Instead, the below-stable stocks for long-term investing might be more appropriate.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCF Industries (CF)man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buy. Stocks With 1000% UpsideSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comAn American manufacturer and distributor of agricultural fertilizers, CF Industries (NYSE:CF) specializes in hydrogen and nitrogen products for clean energy, emissions abatement, fertilizer, and other industrial applications. Further, the company operates manufacturing complexes in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. Due to geopolitical flashpoints, CF Industries ranks among the most relevant boring stocks to buy.Unfortunately, the market doesn’t quite see it that way, sending CF down more than 14% since the start of the year. Over the past 365 days, it shed nearly 18% of its equity value. Nevertheless, in part because of the volatility, CF appears significantly undervalued. Notably, shares trade at a price-earnings-growth ratio of 0.13 times, well below the sector median value of 0.74 times.Also, it’s worth pointing out that in addition to its massive revenue growth, CF features a Piotroski F-Score of 9 out of 9. This stat indicates excellent operational efficiency. Finally, analysts peg CF as a moderate buy with an $87.06 price target (implying nearly 24% upside). For those interested in long-term investing, CF makes a compelling argument.Story continuesValero Energy (VLO)An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockAn international manufacturer and marketer of transportation fuels and petrochemical products, Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) is a Fortune 50 enterprise based in San Antonio, Texas. Per its corporate profile, Valero operates 15 petroleum refineries with a combined throughput capacity of approximately 3.2 million barrels per day. Also, it features 13 ethanol plants with a combined production capacity of approximately 1.68 billion gallons per year.Due to the softness in the energy space – in part due to the hawkish monetary environment – the hydrocarbon space features mixed performances. For VLO specifically, it declined about 3% since the January opener. Still, it’s one of the boring stocks to consider, just in case full social normalization materializes. Also, VLO stands among the buy-and-hold stocks due to its robust financials. As with CF Industries above, Valero enjoys above-average long-term revenue growth. At the same time, it runs a Piotroski F-Score of 9, indicating outstanding operational efficiency.Lastly, analysts peg VLO as a moderate buy with a $144.20 price target, implying nearly 24% upside. Arguably, it’s one of the stable stocks to put on your radar.STMicroelectronics (STM)Man holding stacks of money.

Per its public profile, ST offers discrete and standard commodity components, application-specific integrated circuits, full custom devices, and semi-custom devices for analog, digital, and mixed-signal applications.Of course, it’s hard to describe tech players as boring stocks to buy. However, ST operates in the background, almost like a stagehand for headline-generating innovators. So, under this context, ST might be a snoozer for some folks. Nevertheless, those interested in long-term investing should earmark shares on their must-watch list.Financially, ST posts impressive revenue and EBITDA growth over the past three years. At the same time, the company commands a Piotroski F-Score of 8, indicating strong operational efficiency. Also, its Altman Z-Score clocks in at 6.09, indicating a very low bankruptcy risk. To close, analysts peg STM as a unanimous strong buy with a $63 price target (implying over 29% upside). It’s easily one of the buy-and-hold stocks.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

3,590e9030-12c8-3d65-a59d-465514d9aee9,WMT,2023-07-09,Y2K fashion has taken over. And Gen Z is loving it,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/y2k-fashion-taken-over-gen-055712166.html,1688882232,STORY,['WMT'],"[NEW YORK (AP) — First came the supposed death of skinny jeans. Then, the resurgence of cargo pants, halter tops and baby tees.If there’s one thing retailers can agree on, it’s that Gen Z is hot for the early 2000s fashion trends now booming in popularity.College interns and young workers are donning wide-legged slacks at the office. The claw clip, a retro hair staple, is back; as are mesh tops, miniskirts and a host of colorful apparel that can make consumers look like they stepped out of a Disney Channel show from 2004.Fueled by social media platforms including TikTok, the so-called Y2K trend resurfaced as consumers began attending parties and going out after pandemic lockdowns. What began with hair accessories like butterfly clips and the comeback of straight-leg jeans has expanded to all-denim garments, cargo and flare pants and everything shiny, among other looks.Casey Lewis, a New York trend analyst, noted so many micro trends — often tagged with the suffix “core” — cranked up in the past few years that she created a newsletter about them.Think “Barbiecore” and “mermaidcore,” which highlight the hot pink reminiscent of Mattel Inc.'s Barbie doll or sheer materials with ocean-like hues and sequins. There's also “coastal granddaughter,” the youthful update that evolved from the “coastal grandmother” trend featuring oversized cardigans and linen sets.“Gen Z is not even close to being done revisiting these old trends,” said Lewis, whose “After School” newsletter documents youth consumer behavior. “They are going to dig into every weird trend from way back when and bring it back.”Retailers from high-end Nordstrom to discounters and fast fashion outlets are pushing the styles in campaigns and on shelves. And consumers seem to be eating it up.Sales of women’s cargo pants jumped 81% from January to May, the latest month of available data, according to Circana, which tracks retail purchases. Low-cost fashion chains H&amp;M and Zara say they’re seeing success with biker jackets, denim garments and crop tops. And Chinese fast-fashion retailer Shein, which markets to young women, said its baby tee sales have tripled this year, making them by far the hottest t-shirt style of 2023.Story continuesThe company also is seeing a big jump in sales of flared pants, corset tops, metallic-colored clothing and women's track suits, which are often made from bright velour fabric reminiscent of some wardrobe choices by socialite Paris Hilton at the height of her popularity.Style watchers classify it as part of the McBling era, which overlaps with Y2K but emphasizes flashier items personified by brands like Juicy Couture and Baby Phat, the iconic streetwear line by TV personality and designer Kimora Lee Simmons, which relaunched in 2019.As always, trends are fueled by celebrities like model Bella Hadid, whose outfit choices are analyzed by fashion magazines and other on-lookers. Style also bubbles up directly from consumers via social media, challenging retailers accustomed to runway shows setting the tone.“There’s not a year advanced notice that these trends are going to trickle down,” said Kristen Classi-Zummo, an analyst who covers fashion apparel for Circana.Retailers, including Macy’s and Walmart, said they are paying closer attention to what pops up on social sites and analyzing topics searched by users. But it can be challenging to recognize the difference between trends that just generate attention versus those shoppers will actually buy, said Jake Bjorseth, who runs trndsttrs, an agency helping companies reach young consumers.Alison Hilzer, Walmart editorial director for fashion apparel, said she's also seeing a lot of micro trends. Some have more longevity than others, making it challenging to figure out when to jump on them.The discounter, which is marketing Y2K inspired cargo pants and Barbiecore, has been speeding up development to get trends to market faster, though the company declined to offer more specific details. Walmart also is following key influencers such as Alix Earle, who has collaborated with A-listers including Selena Gomez.Despite retailers catering to young consumers, many aren't really buying. Instead, they are wearing items from each others' closets, helping fuel a resale market that has tripled since 2020, according to research by Boston Consulting Group and Vestiare Collective, a French luxury resale site. Affordability was the primary driver, but shoppers also bought used items to be more planet-friendly.Yasmeen Bekhit, a 22-year-old graduate student in Manheim, Pennsylvania, said she frequents a local thrift shop almost every week and shops at resale sites like Depop, which offers Y2K-heavy options such as baguette bags and baggy jeans.Bekhit typically gravitates toward looser, flowy pants, flare-legged jeans and tighter shirts like mesh tops, which help her stay cooler in the summer while wearing a hijab. She's inspired by the way former Disney Channel stars like Gomez and Hilary Duff used to style themselves, she said.Popular TikTok influencer Aliyah Bah, who amassed more than 2.5 million followers showcasing her Y2K-inspired look known as “Aliyahcore,” also inspires Bekhit. The look is a bit more alternative, often featuring miniskirts or shorts matched with crop tops, fishnet stockings and furry knee-high boots.“I really love her way of styling outfits,” Bekhit said.But for everyday, Bekhit said she typically looks up outfit ideas on social media and puts her own twist on them.Retro hair also is making a splash. Tahlya Loveday, a master stylist at the The Drawing Room New York Salon, said she has seen a lot more '90s and Y2K trends, like spiky updos and space buns, bouncy blow-dried looks and block coloring, where sections of hair are colored in contrasting colors. Gen Z clients embrace those looks more than millennials, she said.“For Gen Z, this is all new to them,” Circana’s Classi-Zummo said. “They’re really not reliving it. So while we might see it as something that’s cyclical and coming back, they’re kind of getting it for the first time.”]"

We will also explore the latest tax brackets and analyze the cooperation of big companies in terms of tax payments. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to 5 Least Tax-Friendly States For Middle-Class Families.In recent years, the topic of taxation has taken center stage in the realm of economic discourse, particularly as it pertains to the financial well-being of middle-class families. As these families strive to achieve stability and secure their future, the impact of state-level taxation cannot be overlooked. The burden of taxes on the middle class has become a subject of growing concern, prompting us to examine the various factors that contribute to a state's tax friendliness.The IRS has recently released the tax brackets for the upcoming 2023-2024 tax season. These brackets have been adjusted to account for the price increases that have occurred in recent years. The upper limits of the brackets have been raised by 7% compared to the previous year. The tax brackets consist of seven tiers, with tax rates ranging from 10% to 37%. Your specific tax rate depends on your filing status and taxable income. It's important to understand that the brackets determine how much you owe in taxes, with higher income levels being subject to higher tax rates.Which State Has Lowest Taxes For Middle Class?Alaska stands out as the best state for middle-class families due to its low tax burden. With no state income or sales tax, Alaskans enjoy a total state and local tax burden of just 5.10% of personal income, the lowest among all 50 states. Additionally, residents receive an annual payment from the Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation, providing further financial support, making it one of the friendliest tax states in the US. However, Alaska's cost of living is high, primarily due to the fact that high shipping costs are priced-in due to its remoteness.  On the other hand, according to Kiplinger, the most tax-friendly state for retirees is Delaware.Story continuesMoreover, as of 2022, there are nine states in the United States that do not impose a state income tax. These states include Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming. Residents in these states are not subject to state income tax on their earnings. This tax advantage can be particularly beneficial for individuals and families looking to minimize their tax burden and retain more of their income. Moreover, of all these, Wyoming is considered to be the most tax-friendly state for high earners. Speaking of most tax-friendly states, Wyoming and South Dakota are considered to be the most tax-friendly states for businesses.Corporate Tax Responsibility: Examining the Big NamesWhile we have looked at the states with the lowest taxes for high earners and businesses, let’s explore whether big giants are fulfilling their responsibilities of taxes or not and whether they are making it any easier for citizens when it comes to taxation.In 2022, Shell Plc (NYSE:SHEL) made hefty payments to governments that totaled around $68.2 billion despite the rising inflation. Of this amount, $13.4 billion was paid in corporate income taxes and $8.2 billion in government royalties. Moreover, Shell Plc (NYSE:SHEL) also collected $46.6 billion in excise duties, sales taxes, and similar levies on their fuel and other products on behalf of governments. Moreover, Shell Plc (NYSE:SHEL) has been voluntarily transparent about its tax payments since 2012.Scott Galloway, who is a marketing professor at NYU, mentioned that Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), despite being worth half as much as Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), has paid significantly more income tax since 2008. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)'s tax payments amount to $64 billion, which is 46 times higher than Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s tax payment of $1.4 billion.In another instance, customers at Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) outlets in Topeka, Kansas, reported being overcharged at the checkout due to a ""Walmart tax"" issue. After the reduction in the state sales tax rate on food items took effect, some customers were mistakenly charged both the higher, outdated tax rate and the new rate, resulting in double taxation. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) promptly acknowledged the issue, apologized for any inconvenience caused, and assured customers that the problem has been resolved.They provided a solution for affected customers to seek a refund by presenting their receipts to a store manager. This responsive action reflects Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)'s commitment to addressing customer needs and ensuring satisfaction.H &amp; R Block Inc. (NYSE:HRB) has announced a partnership with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to leverage Azure OpenAI services and generative AI technology, aiming to enhance the tax experience for its customers.

Our ranking was based on the states with the highest income tax and sales tax rates. To assign importance to each tax, we assigned a weight of 0.6 to income tax and 0.4 to sales tax. By calculating the weighted average, we have arranged the list in descending order of least tax-friendliness. We also made sure that our rankings align with the tax burden borne by middle class families by picking the highest tax brackets relevant to the income of middle class families in the US.15 Least Tax Friendly States For Middle Class FamiliesAndrey_Popov/Shutterstock.comHere is a list of the least tax-friendly states for middle-class households:15. WisconsinIncome Tax: 5.35% Sales Tax: 5% Weighted Average Tax: 5.21%Wisconsin maintains a flat corporate income tax rate of 7.90 percent. Furthermore, with 5% sales tax rate, and a maximum local sales tax rate of 1.75 percent, it becomes one of most tax unfriendly states for middle class families. When combined, the average of the overall tax burden of the state and local sales tax rate in Wisconsin stands at 5.43 percent.14. MarylandIncome Tax: 4.75% Sales Tax: 6% Weighted Average Tax: 5.25%Maryland imposes heavy state and local income taxes, placing a heavy burden on middle-class families. However, when it comes to property taxes, they align closely with the national average. On the bright side, Maryland's tax system is shopper-friendly, with only a 6% state sales tax and no additional local sales taxes, resulting in a below-average overall sales tax burden for its residents.13. New YorkIncome Tax: 6.25% Sales Tax: 4% Weighted Average Tax: 5.35%It goes without saying; New York is not among the middle-class friendly states. New York is known for its high-income tax rates, particularly in New York City. However, the state is generally tax-friendly for retirees as it does not tax Social Security benefits. On the other hand, the tax situation for the middle class in New York is less favorable due to the high-income tax rates, which can result in a higher tax burden compared to other states.12. IllinoisIncome Tax: 4.95% Sales Tax: 6.25% Weighted Average Tax: 5.47%Illinois residents experience the highest effective total state and local tax rate in the nation, exceeding 15% based on the median U.S. household income. When considering the combined impact of state and local taxes, Illinois ranks at the top in terms of the total taxes borne by its residents compared to other states. It is also 29th in our list of States With the Lowest to Highest Capital Gains Tax Rate.11. VirginiaIncome Tax: 5.75% Sales Tax: 5.3% Weighted Average Tax: 5.57%In Virginia, the state sales tax rate stands at 5.30 percent, with a maximum local sales tax rate of 0.70 percent. When combined, the average sales tax rate, including both state and local taxes, amounts to 5.75 percent in Virginia. It is one of the Worst States to Retire in for Taxes and Cost of Living.10. OregonIncome Tax: 9.9% Sales Tax: 0% Weighted Average Tax: 5.94%While Oregon's tax structure eschews a statewide sales tax, it compensates with higher income tax rates. This approach probably aims to promote consumer spending and economic growth while maintaining a progressive tax system. The revenue generated from income tax plays a crucial role in funding public services, particularly education and healthcare, ensuring stable funding for essential programs within the state.9. IowaIncome Tax: 6.0% Sales Tax: 6% Weighted Average Tax: 6%Iowa's tax rates can pose challenges for middle-class families due to their relatively high levels. The state imposes a corporate income tax rate ranging from 5.50 percent to 8.40 percent. Moreover, Iowa has a state sales tax rate of 6.00 percent, along with a maximum local sales tax rate of 1.00 percent. When combined, the average state and local sales tax rate in Iowa amounts to 6.94 percent. These higher tax burdens can create financial difficulties for middle-class families, impacting their ability to meet everyday expenses and achieve financial stability.8. KansasIncome Tax: 5.7% Sales Tax: 6.5% Weighted Average Tax: 6.02%In recent years, the state underwent significant tax reforms that led to increased tax burdens. However, these reforms resulted in budgetary challenges and revenue shortfalls. To address these issues, the state implemented higher taxes across different categories, including income taxes and sales taxes, to generate additional revenue. These tax hikes have contributed to Kansas being perceived as having a relatively high tax burden compared to other states.7. ConnecticutIncome Tax: 6.0% Sales Tax: 6.35% Weighted Average Tax: 6.14%Connecticut has a burdensome taxation in place, primarily because of its high government costs. The influence of public-sector labor unions on state and local policies has also led to higher expenses for residents, coupled with lower-quality services and the weight of unfunded pension and retiree healthcare obligations from decades ago.This is evident in the state's education sector, particularly in K-12 costs. In 2020, Connecticut's schools expended $21,346 per student, surpassing Massachusetts by 14% ($18,733) and exceeding the national average by 58% ($13,494). These figures shed light on the financial strain imposed on residents as they contend with the consequences of Connecticut's high tax burden and its impact on critical public services like education.6. VermontIncome Tax: 6.6% Sales: To be calculated: 6% Weighted Average Tax: 6.36%Vermont holds the fourth highest tax burden according to WalletHub's ""2023's Tax Burden By State"" report. With an overall tax burden of 10.28%, Vermont ranks second (out of all states) in property taxes at 4.98%, 27th in individual income taxes at 2.07%, and 27th in sales and excise taxes at 3.23%. The high tax rates have led to relocations, impacting economic growth, while property taxes act as regressive wealth taxes at the local level. Hence, this makes it one of the least tax friendly states for middle class families.Click here to see 5 Least Tax Friendly States for Middle-Class Families.Suggested Articles:15 Most Tax Friendly Countries in Europe20 Worst States to Retire in for Taxes and Cost of LivingTop 15 Offshore Tax Havens in the WorldDisclosure: None. 15 Least Tax Friendly States for Middle-Class Families is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

In fact, the shiny overhyped stocks often blind us to the inherent risks in capital markets, trading at prices completely divorced from their fundamentals. Several such stocks faced a reality check last year, with their frothy valuations melting away to more reasonable levels. However, many of them still trade at unattractive, inflated values.If you’re knee-deep in popular growth investments, it might be ideal for pocketing some gains. So, let’s dig into the stocks to sell now, enabling you to build a more balanced portfolio. In curating the list, I’ve used an app called Ape Wisdom that lists the most trending stocks on the internet.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCarnival (CCL)Figurines of two little men in suits looking at downward stock arrow going through the floorSource: shutterstock.com/Black SalmonCarnival (NYSE:CCL) has essentially donned the cape of the comeback kid of late, turning heads with its stellar performance since bottoming out in May. However, the voyage ahead isn’t exactly smooth sailing. The pandemic-led challenges continue to haunt the company’s economic fortress, with its balance sheet bearing the brunt.CCL’s liquidity ratios are firmly in the red, and analysts’ forecasts point to a rocky road ahead. CCL’s adjusted earnings per share depict a steady recovery through 2025. Hence, its EPS is forecasted to be at a negative 14 cents this year, followed by a major improvement to 92 cents in fiscal 2024. That said, it’s still a far cry from the robust $4.4 it generated in fiscal 2019. Moreover, income investors are waiting in the wings, and their return hinged on the unlikely resumption of share repurchases and dividends.Virgin Galactic (SPCE)Grayish photo of investor's hands hovering over laptop with red stock graph showing downward arrow overlayed on top of the imageSource: shutterstock.com/Leonid SorokinVirgin Galactic’s (NYSE:SPCE) Galactic 01 mission soared triumphantly into the cosmos yesterday, marking its first successful foray with paying customers onboard.Nevertheless, the victorious ascent is an eye-wash from the company’s financial gravity. Virgin Galactic’s balance sheet tells a sobering tale of operational hurdles and looming losses. Despite a backlog of 800 tickets for its suborbital joyrides, the company is trapped in a maze of operational challenges. Moreover, Unity’s four-passenger capacity with the company’s lofty operating expenses paints a bleak financial picture ahead. Future hopes rest on its forthcoming spaceship Delta, promising substantially greater capacity and higher flight frequency. However, with a 2026 launch date and competitors like Blue Origin not waiting for the dust to settle, and hence the road to success for Virgin Galactic remains clouded with uncertainty.Story continuesAMC Entertainment (AMC)little girl holding a stock chart with athumbs down. stocks to avoidSource: ShutterstockAMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) has been a popular high-risk meme stock that stayed afloat despite the pandemic-induced waves. To fuel its recovery, AMC now aims to ramp up equity and potentially execute a reverse stock split.With a staggering debt load of more than $4.8 billion, AMC’s journey remains tumultuous. Even as cinephiles gradually return to theaters, the box office is barely catching a break. Its first-quarter sales were $1.8 billion, lagging 25% behind the pre-Covid era. The narrative further twists with streaming services gaining ground and consumer habits evolving in this period. A comeback for AMC isn’t out of sight, but it seems to have fallen off the meme stock radar. AMC stock is down more than 50% in the past year, and more volatility is expected with the stock ahead.Lucid Group (LCID)a frustrated man with a white board behind him that features a black downward arrowSource: ShutterstockThe electric vehicle realm’s sparkling debutant, Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID), burst onto the scene with a high-profile SPAC merger. Led by Tesla alums and auto industry veterans, many had envisioned the company to become a juggernaut in its niche. However, the going has been remarkably tough for Lucid.Its financials bear the brunt of its limited production, with losses mounting swiftly. In the first quarter, the firm chalked up sales of $149.43 million, but a staggering net loss of approximately $780 million, or 43 cents per share, overshadowed its sales figure. Following a $3 billion common stock offering, Lucid now eyes global expansion and the launch of new models, potentially stoking its cash burn. Worryingly, the pace of deliveries is lagging, with positive free cash flow unlikely until 2026 or 2027. With this backdrop, the specter of equity dilution seems to loom large over Lucid’s financial future.Gartner (IT)earningsSource: ShutterstockGartner (NYSE:IT) is an established research and advisory firm catering to a myriad of sectors, including IT, HR, and marketing. Anchored in a fascinating sector offering long-term appeal, the firm recently outpaced analyst estimates and boosted its outlook for the year, a feat worth noting. However, despite a promising scenario, Gartner’s journey isn’t devoid of challenges. The rapid tech evolution propelling the demand for its services also mandates constant vigilance and adaptability. Nevertheless, it has done well for the years to adapt effectively, and its lofty double-digit growth numbers seem plausible for the foreseeable future. The main concern, though, with Gartner stock is its lofty share price. IT stock trades over 26 times forward cash flows and more than 4.5 times forward sales estimates.Carvana (CVNA)a keyboard with a greet enter key marked sell, representing overvalued stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockAnother popular pick among meme stock traders is Carvana (NYSE:CVNA), which has recently been soaking up the Wall Street spotlight. The online used car retailer has seen its shares triple in value last few months, but its financial condition remains in shambles beneath the gloss of its sterling performance.Though its second-quarter outlook strikes a positive chord, it could be a flash in the pan. It could potentially be a spike propelled by a quirk in loan sales timing. Moreover, the company grapples with a staggering $9 billion in debt and cumulative losses north of $2.2 billion. Negative cash flows, debt-driven capital infusions, and equity fundraisers continue to weigh down its business. Despite the allure of its stock market performance, Carvana’s path forward seems littered with multiple stumbling blocks.BlackBerry (BB)sell written on a chalkboard representing overvalued stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockOnce a darling in the smartphone realm, BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) has effectively morphed into an infamous meme stock. The firm effectively ceded its dominance post the iPhone’s advent, reinventing itself as a cybersecurity and Internet-of-Things specialist. However, BlackBerry’s current image casts a stark contrast against its past glory as financial turmoil unfolds.As part of its strategic reshuffle, BlackBerry embarked on a cash-raising journey, selling off 32,000 patents pertaining to its legacy mobile devices and wireless networking business. Despite these questionable moves, its management remains incredibly optimistic about its future. Projections indicate a heartening 13.5% compounded annual growth over the next three years, powered by its IoT and automotive ventures. However, with a decade of waiting for a BlackBerry revival and a checkered past, the path to a successful resurgence appears elusive.On the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing GuidelinesMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to 5 Least Tax-Friendly States For Middle-Class Families.In recent years, the topic of taxation has taken center stage in the realm of economic discourse, particularly as it pertains to the financial well-being of middle-class families. As these families strive to achieve stability and secure their future, the impact of state-level taxation cannot be overlooked. The burden of taxes on the middle class has become a subject of growing concern, prompting us to examine the various factors that contribute to a state's tax friendliness.The IRS has recently released the tax brackets for the upcoming 2023-2024 tax season. These brackets have been adjusted to account for the price increases that have occurred in recent years. The upper limits of the brackets have been raised by 7% compared to the previous year. The tax brackets consist of seven tiers, with tax rates ranging from 10% to 37%. Your specific tax rate depends on your filing status and taxable income. It's important to understand that the brackets determine how much you owe in taxes, with higher income levels being subject to higher tax rates.Which State Has Lowest Taxes For Middle Class?Alaska stands out as the best state for middle-class families due to its low tax burden. With no state income or sales tax, Alaskans enjoy a total state and local tax burden of just 5.10% of personal income, the lowest among all 50 states. Additionally, residents receive an annual payment from the Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation, providing further financial support, making it one of the friendliest tax states in the US. However, Alaska's cost of living is high, primarily due to the fact that high shipping costs are priced-in due to its remoteness.  On the other hand, according to Kiplinger, the most tax-friendly state for retirees is Delaware.Story continuesMoreover, as of 2022, there are nine states in the United States that do not impose a state income tax. These states include Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming. Residents in these states are not subject to state income tax on their earnings.

It could also answer some questions about the strength of the larger US labor market.The unionized workforce at UPS was a big advantage for the package carrier earlier in the pandemic as demand for deliveries surged and rivals that lacked a steady supply of labor struggled to find enough available workers.But now that job gains are slowing and demand is cooling in some parts of the economy, it is less clear how much longer labor will hold the upper hand, either at UPS or the economy at large.New data released Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed the labor market is still tight, as the US economy added 209,000 jobs in June. That was the 30th straight month the US economy created jobs. Hourly wages also rose 4.4% over the same month last year, while the unemployment rate fell to 3.6%.But the data also showed some softening. Friday’s report marked the first in 15 months that job creation came in below what Wall Street economists had expected, reflecting a slowdown from the previous month.In the part of the economy where UPS operates — transportation and warehousing — employment actually dropped by 7,000 jobs in June.The labor market is cooling from ""from overheated to lukewarm,"" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead US economist at Oxford Economics, said in a note on Friday.The direction of the labor market is important to the Federal Reserve as it decides whether to keep raising interest rates as a way of bringing down inflation. Officials at the central bank are watching for signs that companies are reducing hiring and wages.New wave of union activismPay is still a major issue for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which is pressing UPS to meet its demands for a new five-year collective bargaining agreement. It wants higher wages for the carrier’s part-time workers, among other benefits.Story continues""We need to drive up the starting rates of pay,"" Sean O’Brien, general president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said this week on CNN.UPS has said it already offers industry-leading pay, with delivery drivers earning up to $42 per hour after four years on the job.On Wednesday, the Teamsters said the company failed to come to the table with an acceptable offer. Workers have authorized a strike to begin August 1 should no deal be reached.Sean O’Brien, general president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. REUTERS/Aude Guerrucci (Aude Guerrucci / reuters)The approach of the Teamsters is the latest sign of a new wave of union activism that took hold during the pandemic as demand for labor surged.Over the past week, Teamsters workers have expanded strikes against Amazon for delivery drivers in California and New York.The union is also testing Yellow, the nation’s third largest trucking company, to stick to the contract negotiated for its 22,000 union workers despite the company’s request to modify the agreement in efforts to avoid another bankruptcy.Amazon (AMZN), which runs its own shipping service, Amazon Logistics, has been facing unionization efforts from its warehouse workers in several states, while Apple (APPL) and Starbuck (SBUX) have been countering union pressure from retail workers.Is this 'a temporary or fundamental change'?Strikes that can jolt the nation’s supply chains are economic risks that the Biden administration has proven it is not willing to take.Over the past year, the administration has intervened in the dispute between West Coast Ports and the Dockworkers Union, and tapped Congress to settle differences between railroad companies and a dozen unions backing railway conductors. It is also monitoring talks between the auto companies and the United Auto Workers.Julie Su, acting Labor Secretary, said the White House does not plan to intervene in the UPS talks. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)""All of a sudden we find ourselves in a situation we really haven’t experienced for some time,"" labor and employment expert and Penn State University law professor Paul Clark told Yahoo Finance.""The big question is whether this is a temporary or fundamental change between unions and employers. We are trying to answer that right now, and it’s pretty difficult to say.""Wayne State University labor law professor Michael Oswalt said even small disruptions in transportation, shipping and warehousing can be devastating across multiple industries. Still, he said, absent changes to labor law, which governs union campaigns and elections, unions are unlikely to regain the power they once had.""So today what can matter more than a union’s size is its proximity to a company’s choke-point – and especially its willingness to strike,"" Oswalt said. ""UPS Teamsters know the value they bring to the company, to the broader economy, and they have a history of pulling off successful strikes. That trifecta equates to a lot of union power right now.""In January, the BLS reported that 10.1% of wage and salary workers belonged to unions in 2022, down from 10.3% in 2021. In the same timeframe the number of wage and salary workers who belonged to unions increased 1.9% or 273,000 workers. The total number of workers belonging to unions in 1983, according to BLS was around 20.1%, nearly double what it is today.Acting US Labor Secretary Julie Su told Yahoo Finance on Friday that the White House does not plan to intervene in the UPS situation.“I have faith that the parties are going to find a path and continue to try to work things out,” she said Friday.Jennifer Schonberger, Josh Shafer and Jared Mitovich contributed to this report.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

We will also explore the growth projection of dentistry and the difficulty level of dental schools while looking at the efforts of big companies in ensuring sustainability in the dental industry. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to 5 Dental Schools With Highest Acceptance Rates.The Global Outlook of DentistryThe global dental market had a value of $36.32 billion in 2021 and is anticipated to witness considerable growth in the coming years. It is projected to reach USD 63.93 billion by 2029, with a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.4% during the forecast period. This growth is expected to result in around 8,400 additional job openings in the dental field during that period. However, the market experienced a decline of -7.6% in 2020 due to the unprecedented impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic, which led to lower demand for dental products across all regions compared to pre-pandemic levels.According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), dentists in the United States earned a median pay of $163,220 per year or $78.47 per hour in 2021. It is also one of the highest paying jobs in the world. The U.S. has more than 70 accredited dental schools that are responsible for preparing dentists for coming generations.How Difficult Are Dental Schools?Dental school is no walk in the park, and it can be just as demanding as medical school. Many students find themselves grappling with the sheer volume of studying they need to do. Not only do they have to memorize a vast amount of dental knowledge, but they also have to apply it in practical settings. One difference between medical and dental school is that dental students get into hands-on practice much earlier. Practical courses kick in within the first couple of years, piling on more stress alongside heavy coursework and challenging exams.The second year of dental school is often considered the toughest because it serves as a preparation phase for the clinic. During this period, students can expect little free time and a whole lot of stress. To add to the difficulty, dental school acceptance rates are generally low due to the limited number of dental schools. Prospective students need to demonstrate exceptional grades, solid university credentials, and acceptable scores on the Dental Admission Test (DAT) to even stand a chance.Story continuesIt is worth noting that the average Dental Admission Test (DAT) score for dental students in 2020 was 20.2, and the average GPA was 3.55. Moreover, while DAT is a prerequisite for almost all dental schools across the US, the Workman School of Dental Medicine is one of the few dental schools that do not require the DAT or any degrees. There are no application or supplemental fees involved either.The competitiveness of dental schools can also be judged from the fact that Tufts Dental School’s acceptance rate is approximately 5% while the NYU College of Dentistry’s acceptance rate is 11%, which are quite low, given that these are not even among the top 10 dental schools in the world.Data from the American Dental Education Association (ADEA) reveals that in the year 2000, approximately 54.5 % of dental school applicants were accepted and enrolled in a dental school. As of 2019, the acceptance rate had only slightly increased to 55.9%.Sustainability in Dentistry: Role of the Big NamesIn the midst of the challenges faced by dental school students and the limited acceptance rates, companies like Dentsply Sirona Inc (NASDAQ:XRAY), Henry Schein, Inc (NASDAQ:HSIC), and Patterson Companies, Inc (NASDAQ:PDCO) are actively promoting sustainability.Dentsply Sirona Inc (NASDAQ:XRAY) has recently launched a free Sustainability in Dentistry Resource Kit, providing dental professionals with valuable resources to understand and implement sustainable practices in their practices and labs.  Additionally, Dentsply Sirona Inc (NASDAQ:XRAY) also recently participated in the virtual Summit on Sustainability in Dentistry, organized by the FDI World Dental Federation on World Environment Day. The company's sustainability efforts have also been recognized through its inclusion in Newsweek's rankings of America's Most Responsible Companies of 2023.In terms of corporate social responsibility, Dentsply Sirona Inc (NASDAQ:XRAY) has partnered with Smile Train to support children with clefts. Through equipment donations, fundraising activities, and financial contributions, they have helped provide access to high-quality cleft care. This collaboration has funded over 730 cleft surgeries, and Dentsply Sirona Inc (NASDAQ:XRAY)'s efforts have been acknowledged through its ranking on Newsweek's list.Dentsply Sirona Inc (NASDAQ:XRAY)'s dedication to sustainability extends to its educational initiatives. They have launched a comprehensive Sustainability Educational Curriculum, offering free online courses through the Dentsply Sirona Academy. These courses address the knowledge gap in dentists' understanding of sustainability and provide practical guidance on implementing sustainable practices.On the other hand, Henry Schein, Inc (NASDAQ:HSIC) has launched the Practice Green global initiative to encourage healthcare practitioners to adopt sustainable practices for a healthier planet. The program provides eco-friendly solutions and support to dental and medical customers in the U.S. and Canada, with plans for expansion.Apart from their sustainability efforts, Henry Schein, Inc (NASDAQ:HSIC) has announced the acquisition of S.I.N which is a leading dental implant company in Brazil, which will enable the entry of Henry Schein, Inc. (NASDAQ:HSIC) into the Brazilian implant market and complement their dental consumables and equipment business. The acquisition is expected to accelerate S.I.N.'s growth in Brazil and expand its presence in other markets.Patterson Dental, which is a division of Patterson Companies, Inc. (NASDAQ:PDCO), has also not been inactive with these efforts. By implementing SAP Field Service Management, a cloud-based solution, the company has been able to optimize routing and reduce mileage, resulting in a 5% reduction in miles traveled per day.This has led to the saving of 40 metric tons of carbon emissions per year, contributing to a more sustainable environment. Moreover, the solution has helped Patterson Companies, Inc (NASDAQ:PDCO) streamline field service management processes, saving time for technicians and improving customer satisfaction.Through improved coordination and scheduling, the company has achieved savings of two to five minutes per job for coordinators which has further allowed them to serve more customers. Patterson Companies, Inc (NASDAQ:PDCO) is one of the largest dental companies in the world.You can also check out our lists of colleges with the highest and lowest acceptance rates here and here, respectively.

19,b28f5adf-7f63-38c4-89c7-ba0c1115a189,QCOM,2023-07-09,Here's Why QUALCOMM (NASDAQ:QCOM) Can Manage Its Debt Responsibly,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-qualcomm-nasdaq-qcom-110014816.html,1688900414,STORY,['QCOM'],"[Howard Marks put it nicely when he said that, rather than worrying about share price volatility, 'The possibility of permanent loss is the risk I worry about... and every practical investor I know worries about.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. We note that QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) does have debt on its balance sheet. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?Why Does Debt Bring Risk?Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for QUALCOMM How Much Debt Does QUALCOMM Carry?As you can see below, QUALCOMM had US$16.0b of debt, at March 2023, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. On the flip side, it has US$6.68b in cash leading to net debt of about US$9.31b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is QUALCOMM's Balance Sheet?Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that QUALCOMM had liabilities of US$7.87b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$20.8b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$6.68b in cash and US$3.69b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$18.3b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.Story continuesSince publicly traded QUALCOMM shares are worth a very impressive total of US$129.2b, it seems unlikely that this level of liabilities would be a major threat. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).QUALCOMM's net debt is only 0.64 times its EBITDA. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 32.1 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. QUALCOMM's EBIT was pretty flat over the last year, but that shouldn't be an issue given the it doesn't have a lot of debt. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine QUALCOMM's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. During the last three years, QUALCOMM produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 64% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.Our ViewThe good news is that QUALCOMM's demonstrated ability to cover its interest expense with its EBIT delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. And the good news does not stop there, as its net debt to EBITDA also supports that impression! When we consider the range of factors above, it looks like QUALCOMM is pretty sensible with its use of debt. That means they are taking on a bit more risk, in the hope of boosting shareholder returns. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for QUALCOMM (1 is a bit concerning)  you should be aware of.If you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free list of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet.Have feedback on this article?

20,cc604e66-21dc-307b-89bf-3dad34eb69b1,PHM,2023-07-09,3 Homebuilder Stocks to Buy to Profit From the Housing Shortage,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-homebuilder-stocks-buy-profit-101828867.html,1688379508,STORY,"['LEN-B', 'TMHC', 'PHM']","[On two occasions in 2022, homebuilder stocks, as represented by the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (BATS:ITB), looked dead in the water. The first seismic shock to ITB’s share price came in June 2022, when its share price fell below $50 for the first time since July 2020. Four months later, it came close, hitting a low of $50.28, before resuming its march higher. Since that October 2022 low, ITB’s share price is up 68%. And if the housing data is any indication, it’s not about to lose its momentum.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWhat homebuilders have going for them is a U.S. housing shortage. This gives a rise to the tailwind for homebuilder stocks.According to a June 20 article in Axios, the housing shortage — Freddie Mac estimates we’re 3.8 million housing units short — keeps home prices high. The median home price in America is $419,103. According to Redfin (NASDAQ:RDFN), that’s 40% higher than in January 2020, before the pandemic. As Axios points out, the consensus was that higher interest rates would end higher prices. Nope. Thanks to a reasonably strong economy, only some people want to sell, putting home inventories at deficient levels. Supply and demand is doing its job. The good news for homebuilders is that prospective home buyers are turning to new builds due to the resale inventory shortage. Once again, homebuilders’ stocks are a screaming buy. Here are my three choices.       Lennar (LEN)Coins stacked in front of graphic 2D cutout of house with sunlight shining on coins; growth in the housing market; housing stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CHOTTHANIN THITIAKARAKIATLennar (NYSE:LEN) raised its full-year forecast for home deliveries in mid-June. Its prior guidance called for 64,000 homes at the midpoint of its outlook. It now expects to deliver 69,000, an increase of 5,000 homes from the end of Q1 2023.For the first six months of 2023, it delivered 30,733 homes, 6% higher than a year ago. A 5% decrease in the average selling price ($449,000) offset that. Due to higher costs, its gross margin in the first six months was 21.9%, 650 basis points lower than in the first six months of 2022. However, the second quarter gross margin rose 130 basis points from Q1 2023.Story continuesThe company continues to strengthen its balance while the business remains healthy. It’s always smart to do what’s important before it becomes necessary. This makes it one of those homebuilder stocks to consider.“While our operating performance remains strong, we continue to strengthen and fortify our balance sheet and our future,” stated Executive Chairman Stuart Miller in Lennar’s Q2 2023 press release.“We ended the quarter with homebuilding debt to capital of 13.3%, the lowest in our history, no borrowings on our $2.6 billion revolver and cash of $4.0 billion. With liquidity of $6.6 billion and cash on hand exceeding our debt, our balance sheet has never been in a stronger position.”While a homebuilder’s financial situation can turn south quickly, Lennar’s making as much hay as possible while the sun shines.   PulteGroup (PHM)Real estate growth graph, housing marketSource: bluebay / Shutterstock.comI recently recommended PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM) because it was a bargain stock trading for less than 7x earnings — 4.7x the trailing 12 months and 6.8x forward earnings. By comparison, the S&amp;P 500’s multiple is 25.5x. However, there is a caveat to Pulte’s valuation: most building stocks currently have single-digit price-to-earnings ratios. The average P/E ratio of the ITB ETF (65% of its holdings are homebuilders) is 9.52x, so PHM is cheap, but so are many of its peers. My June 21 commentary arguing Pulte’s case still applies, especially as it relates to my introduction comments. Deutsche Bank analyst Joe Ahlersmeyer’s comments about improved demand fundamentals leading to higher orders and excess cash ring true. A tight inventory of resales equals a bonanza for homebuilders. The big issue continues to be whether or not Pulte can keep up with demand. In April, when Pulte announced its Q1 2023 results, the company was optimistic about its ability to meet demand. “Within an evolving macro environment, consumers across all buyer segments and price points continue to demonstrate a strong desire for homeownership. With interest rates more stable and the supply of new and existing homes generally in balance with demand, we remain optimistic about the housing industry as we navigate this phase of the housing cycle,” stated CEO Ryan Marshall.It finished the first quarter with a backlog of 13,129, valued at $8 billion, or an average of $608,000, 5% higher than a year earlier and considerably higher (35%) than Lennar’s. Taylor Morrison Home (TMHC)Instability In Real Estate Market, housing market crashSource: Romolo Tavani / Shutterstock.comIn February 202o, I discussed seven reasons why Taylor Morrison Home (NYSE:TMHC) was an excellent stock to own. My timing was a bit off — the markets hit the skids in March 2020, with the index losing 32% of its value in 34 days. The good news is that TMHC is up 485% from its April 3, 2020, low of $8.21. One of the reasons I like Taylor Morrison is that veteran CEO Sheryl Palmer runs it. She’s run the Homebuilder since August 2007. That’s a 16-year tenure. Most CEOs last less than half that time. Shareholders are lucky to have her.I’m a big proponent of women CEOs, directors, top senior management, and everywhere else in an organization. Women bring so much to the corporate table. Why more women aren’t leading America’s top companies remains a mystery. At the time of my article, TMHC had four women out of seven directors. Today, it’s still high, at 50%. Women account for 32% of all S&amp;P 500 directors, so it’s 56% higher than the average. That’s a big reason to invest in the company.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Although, when we looked at Baxter International (NYSE:BAX), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Baxter International:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.074 = US$1.8b ÷ (US$28b - US$4.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Therefore, Baxter International has an ROCE of 7.4%. In absolute terms, that's a low return but it's around the Medical Equipment industry average of 9.1%. See our latest analysis for Baxter International roceIn the above chart we have measured Baxter International's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Baxter International.The Trend Of ROCEIn terms of Baxter International's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 11%, but since then they've fallen to 7.4%. Although, given both revenue and the amount of assets employed in the business have increased, it could suggest the company is investing in growth, and the extra capital has led to a short-term reduction in ROCE. And if the increased capital generates additional returns, the business, and thus shareholders, will benefit in the long run.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Baxter International's ROCEEven though returns on capital have fallen in the short term, we find it promising that revenue and capital employed have both increased for Baxter International. However, despite the promising trends, the stock has fallen 35% over the last five years, so there might be an opportunity here for astute investors. So we think it'd be worthwhile to look further into this stock given the trends look encouraging.Baxter International does come with some risks though, we found 2 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 1 of those shouldn't be ignored...While Baxter International isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

It always raises the same question: Why is this priced lower than it should be? If you can’t find a logical reason for the discount then you should buy. That’s the basic premise here. These stocks are undervalued and undeservedly so. All have strong upside narratives and solid businesses that present reasonable ongoing opportunities. In short, if you can find the rationale for ongoing business growth then any given stock deserves at least your attention. If the fundamentals look healthy, then it’s worth the gamble. Let’s look at 7 of the most undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks to now now.Undervalued S&amp;P 500 Stocks: Delta Airlines (DAL)man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buy. Stocks With 1000% UpsideSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comDelta Airlines (NYSE:DAL) already telegraphed a strong second quarter when it released Q1 earnings back in mid-April. Management said it in no unclear terms: “Expect record June quarter revenue.” Share prices have moved up since then but there is plenty of room for growth remaining based on Wall Street analyst projections. Surging summer travel should reward Delta and is a great reason to get on board now. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIt’s also worth noting that those same analysts overwhelmingly rate DAL stock as a buy. Part of the hesitation around Delta stock stems from the pandemic hangover. Airlines were losing money hand-over-fist as it dragged on due to grounded operations. The cost of idle planes is massive. Just to refresh your memory, Delta was burning through $27 million in cash per day in June 2020. That led to an incursion of debt that currently plagues all airlines. But Delta offers positive news there: The company reported record free cash flows in the March quarter that allowed it to complete its full-year planned debt reduction in the first half of the year. That’s a huge accomplishment and bodes well for the fact that so many pundits worry about debt reduction as their primary concern with Delta. Story continuesUndervalued S&amp;P 500 Stocks: Marathon Petroleum (MPC)An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockMarathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) stock remains inexpensive overall. The metrics surrounding the company point squarely to that notion. But before jumping into that, let’s first understand the oil firm’s business model. Marathon Petroleum is a midstream/downstream oil company. It basically transports crude in its midstream business and refines and markets it downstream. The company currently makes the bulk of its earnings via the downstream segment so it’s more accurately a downstream firm. However it’s defined, Marathon Petroleum is growing on both fronts. Midstream earnings (29% of the total) increased from $1.4 billion to $1.53 billion in the first quarter. The downstream segment boomed, moving from $1.37 billion to $3.8 billion in earnings.Investors aren’t particularly enthusiastic about MPC stock, however. Its P/E ratio is just about as low as it has been in the last decade. Investors simply aren’t willing to pay as much for a dollar of its earnings as they were previously. That’s the opportunity, frankly. It’s cheaper than it should be. CF Industries (CF)Man holding stacks of money. Unknown Millionaire-Maker StocksSource: Epic Cure / ShutterstockCF Industries (NYSE:CF) is much the same as Marathon Petroleum stock in that regard. It, too, is deeply undervalued based on its P/E ratio which stands at 4.73 currently but has a median of 14.06 over the past decade. The company manufactures hydrogen and nitrogen products that it sells to firms across clean energy, emissions abatement, fertilizer, and other industrial niches. The best way to summarize CF Industries is as an excellent operator that suffers unduly due to commodity prices largely out of its control. The firm’s operational excellence is on display across broad profitability, value, and growth metrics that all favor investing in the firm. CF Industries is basically growing faster than the vast majority of its competitors, more profitably, while remaining undervalued relative to that growth. Those signs suggest that it makes sense to get in now. The reason it is undervalued likely relates to lower prices the company reported for the ammonia, urea, and nitrogen products it sells during the first quarter. Those prices are transitory, CF Industries’ ability to operate at a high rate is not transitory. Altria (MO)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comAltria (NYSE:MO) stock has vacillated between $43 to $48 in 2023. It is now priced around $43 and that price is really too good to ignore. Altria manufactures and sells cigarettes, tobacco, and other forms of nicotine.  Share prices have come down dramatically over the past several years as cigarette smoking rates decline. But what Altria losses there benefits investors as the company is pivoting into a more diversified, more smokeless portfolio while paying a handsome income to investors. Companies across the space are racing to release reduced-risk products and have seen rapid revenue growth there per a recent Zacks report. As Altria pivots to do so, it continues to pay a dividend yielding 8.6%. The company last reduced it in 1970 and is unlikely to again anytime soon. It’s one of the primary benefits as the firm pivots. That and the notion that the company creates massive shareholder value as measured by a return on invested income that far outstrips its weighted average cost. Albemarle (ALB)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) has garnered a lot of attention recently as EVs have taken hold and lithium became a hot commodity. That status as a major producer of a hot commodity saw stock prices move steadily upward over the past few years. They’ve come down in 2023 somewhat as lithium supply and demand factors roiled the market. But prices seem to stabilize in recent months and Albemarle is offering strong upside again. Wall Street analysts believe it could rise from $220 now to as high as $360 over the next year. Gurufocus is even more optimistic about its upside, pegging ALB’s share value at $450. The gamble here is that commodities markets like that for lithium are notoriously difficult to predict. That said, even when the bottom falls out, as it did in late 2022, Albemarle prices remained strong. Growth projections for lithium are approximately 20% compounded annually through 2033. I’m guessing Albemarle’s recent growth is not a fluke. American International Group (AIG) tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comAmerican International Group (NYSE:AIG) stock is relatively cheap as the company shifts its model slightly. The company is divesting its life insurance business line while placing increased focus on its core business insurance segment. That segment is doing well which is part of the reason to consider AIG at present.The divestiture of its life insurance business is dragging down operational efficiency. That’s keeping prices lower than they might otherwise be. Meanwhile, the company delivered its highest-ever Q1 general insurance underwriting income at $502 million. Those policies are sold to corporate clients around the world and grew by 13% during the period. The narrative for AIG is that it is transitioning to a more profitable business that is seeing increased demand for its risk products but looks somewhat weak due to that transition. AIG shares also come with a stable, lower-yield dividend that has plenty of room to grow based on payout ratios. Pfizer (PFE)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Best Speculative StocksSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comA recent Wall Street Journal article about Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and other vaccine stocks summarized the current opportunity well. That article highlights the fact that the big 3 vaccine makers have fallen dramatically in 2023. Part of the reason is that fewer and fewer people are planning to get boosted as time goes on. Pfizer is expected to report $20 billion in Paxlovid sales this year, down from $55 billion in 2022. Analysts believe the market will remain resilient as elderly populations are likely to continue to get boosted. So, there’s perhaps an overreaction on the part of investors regarding waning demand for Pfizer’s Covid vaccines. The other point is this: Pfizer took windfall Covid profits and bought Seagen (NASDAQ:SGEN). It now has cancer assets in its portfolio that it didn’t have. The neverending biotech search for the next blockbuster drug continues. Pfizer hedges against a patent cliff with its Seagen acquisition and it’s entirely reasonable to believe it could make further acquisitions. The point here is Pfizer is much better for having won the vaccine race. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

26,e510c269-3b27-32ba-a4a0-f27181704866,TAP,2023-07-09,25 Largest Craft Breweries in the US by Volume,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/25-largest-craft-breweries-us-175904750.html,1688839144,STORY,"['BUD', 'STZ', 'TAP-A']","[In this article, we are going to discuss the 25 largest craft breweries in the US by volume. You can skip our detailed analysis of the oldest recipe for beer, the craft beer revolution, the Brewers Association, the largest beer producer by volume, the top craft brewer state, alliances in the craft beer industry and the craft beer market, and go directly to 10 Largest Craft Breweries in the US by Volume. It is hypothesized that beer was probably produced independently in different parts of the world. Some believe that beer was the by-product of cereal-based agriculture, with natural fermentation playing its part in the ‘accidental’ lead-up to the brewing. The oldest recipe for beer was left on a Mesopotamian tablet found near Mount Ararat, and it was contained within a 3900-year-old poem – Hymn to Ninkasi (the Sumerian goddess of beer). Beer consumption was, in fact, an important marker for societal and civilized virtues in the Sumerian society. To give an example, in the Epic of Gilgamesh, the world’s oldest known epic, the wild man Enkidu ‘did not know how to eat bread, nor had he ever learned to drink beer!’, with the second phrase suggesting how beer consumption was seen as a ‘quality’ of a civilized person. Craft Beer Revolution:Most immigrants who traveled centuries ago to the New World brewed their own beer. There was wheat beer from Germany, various types of ales from England and dry stouts from Ireland. However, after prohibition, there were only a handful of breweries left in the country. By the 1950’s, only three large brewing groups dominated the entire U.S. market, brewing only pilsners, and the beer brewing model had evolved into a mass-production industry, a far cry from ‘craft’. Everything changed in 1978 when President Jimmy Carter lifted the ban on homebrewing and hobby brewers were now able to sell their beers. Old beer recipes and styles were revived by these newly-legalized homebrewers and the rest is history. Story continuesThe Brewers Association: Established in 2005, the Brewers Association is an American trade group of more than 5,600 U.S. brewery members and 37,000 members of the American Homebrewers Association, joined by members of the allied trade, beer distributors etc. The B.A. works to promote and protect small and independent American brewers, their craft beers and the community of brewing enthusiasts. The American Homebrewers Association is a division of the Brewers Association focused on homebrewers of beer, cider and mead. The Ninkasi Award, named after the Sumerian goddess, is given by the AHA every year to the best homebrewers in the country. Largest Beer Producer by Volume:Anheuser-Busch InBev Sa/NV (NYSE:BUD) is the largest beer producer by volume in the world. The company had a global production volume of 595 million hectoliters, or over 25% of the global beer production in 2022. Anheuser-Busch InBev Sa/NV (NYSE:BUD) has a market cap of $113.2 billion and owns a multitude of beer brands all over the world, and even a variety of regional craft brewing companies in the U.S. Anheuser-Busch InBev Sa/NV (NYSE:BUD) shares witnessed a yearly high of $67.03 at the end of March 2023, but then its share price plummeted to a yearly low of $52.93 in May, due to the recent Bud Light Controversy.Top Craft Brewer State:California, with its rich craft history, is the top craft beer producing state in the country, with the Golden State boasting 957 craft breweries in 2021. California produced the most craft beer of any state in America in 2021, with over 3.5 million barrels, or 3.8 gallons per every 21+ adult in the state. Alliances in the Craft Beer Industry:Craft beer has created a new buzz in the beer industry and it’s creating some strange bedfellows. Though domestic beer brands like Budweiser and Miller etc. still control a 64.5% share of the American beer market, sales of those labels have remained relatively flat while the craft beer industry has boomed over the last few decades. As the craft brewing sector has flourished, the small breweries have had to keep up, and many are entering into what their fans regard as ‘unholy’ alliances with the giants of the industry. For one thing, part of the appeal of a specialty beer is that it is usually produced in a small brewery by obsessive beer lovers, instead of some mass-production factory by a huge corporation. Devotees of craft beers also worry that such corporations will tamper with the recipes of their favorite drinks. Beer industry giants, like Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP) and Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ), want a piece of the sweet craft pie and have invested heavily in either acquiring regional breweries, or creating their own craft brands. The Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP) acquired the Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company in 1988, enabling the family brewery to grow and expand into a national brand. The Leinenkugel Specialty brands had dollar sales of over $100 million in U.S. multi-outlets in 2022. Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP) also took full ownership of the Blue Moon brand after paying $12 billion to acquire SABMiller brands in North America. Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP) marketed its beer as craft. Enraged, The Brewer’s Association called out Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP) for ""unfairly"" encroaching on the craft beer market and even excluded such brands from its definition of craft beers. Blue Moon is still one of the best selling “craft” beer brands in the country but it doesn’t match the Brewer’s Association definition of craft, so it’s not in our list of the Largest Craft Breweries in the U.S. by Volume. Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) also seems to have had enough of the craft beer sector. The company bought Ballast Point Brewing in 2016 for $1 billion, at the absolute peak of the craft brewery acquisition craze. Only a few years later, Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) sold the Ballast Point brand to Illinois-based Kings and Convicts Brewing Co. for something around $40 million. It was also revealed in May this year that Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) is now re-selling the Funky Buddha Brewery back to its original founders, a news warmly welcomed by craft beer enthusiasts around the country. The Craft Beer Market:The Brewers Association has revealed that retail dollar sales of craft beer increased 5% to $28.4 billion in 2022, accounting for 24.6% of the overall $115 billion American beer market. The craft brewing industry also contributed $72.2 billion to the U.S. economy in 2022 and provided 460,000 jobs in the country, including 190,000 direct jobs at breweries and brewpubs. As we mentioned in our article – 25 Most Imported Beer Brands in the World – the global craft beer market was valued at $93.69 billion in 2021, and is expected to reach $243.15 billion by 2030, with a CAGR of 11.2% in the forecast period. With that said, let's head over to our list of the Biggest Craft Breweries in the U.S. by Volume. 25 Largest Craft Breweries in the US by VolumePixabay/Public DomainMethodology:According to the Brewers Association, the American craft brewer is a ‘small’ and ‘independent’ brewer. ‘Small’ means that the brewer’s annual production must not exceed 6 million barrels, or approximately 3% of the annual U.S. beer sales. ‘Independent’ means that less than 25% of the craft brewery is owned or controlled by a beverage alcohol industry member that is not itself a craft brewer.  To collect reliable data for this article, we have referred to the May/June 2023 issue of The New Brewer, the journal of the Brewers Association. We have ranked the Largest Craft Breweries in America according to their sales volumes in barrels (bbls) in 2022.

29,59ffb47b-d562-3469-9186-78c58e0a84fe,TPR,2023-07-09,7 High-Profit Stocks to Buy to Cash in on Inflation,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-high-profit-stocks-buy-183523735.html,1688322923,STORY,"['CVX', 'PEP', 'MDLZ', 'XOM', 'TPR', 'MSFT', 'TTI']","[Market watchers have been calling for an earnings recession since the end of 2022. That’s because there’s an expectation that high inflation coupled with rising interest rates could lead to contracting earnings. With that, there are still opportunities to be found. So, what’s the best way to spot high-profit stocks in this situation? One way might be to look at inflation. While inflation is bad for some stocks, some stocks are a good inflation hedge. Investors should look for companies that continue to grow their earnings despite inflation. This shows pricing power and brands that consumers will continue to seek out.  And since markets are forward-looking, now may be a good time to consider stocks in sectors that have been beaten down because of inflation. These sectors tend to be the first to recover and, if they offer a compelling dividend, can be a good hedge against inflation. Here are seven high-profit stocks to look at for the second half of 2023 and beyond.  Chevron (CVX) An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockTwo energy stocks lead off this list of high-profit stocks. The first of those is Chevron (NYSE:CVX). After being one of the best-performing sectors in 2022, energy stocks have been lagging behind the market in 2023. Crude oil prices are finding it hard to crack the $70 mark despite OPEC announcing production cuts.  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBut so far, that hasn’t prevented big oil stocks from generating solid profits. For its part, Chevron posted earnings per share of $3.55 in the first quarter of 2023. Analysts are now forecasting full-year EPS of $15.11 which would be 9% higher than for the full year in 2022. And don’t forget that Chevron prioritizes its shareholders when it comes to what to do with that profit. The company continues to buy back shares at a rate that delights shareholders (like Warren Buffett) and infuriates Congress.  Yet, CVX stock is down 10% in 2023. That disparity between earnings growth and stock price performance should get the attention of investors. Particularly if you believe that oil prices are likely to rise as the economy recovers. And even if oil prices remain sluggish, you’ll be able to pocket a healthy dividend from this Dividend King that currently pays $6.04 per share on an annual basis. Story continuesExxon Mobil (XOM) Man holding stacks of money. Unknown Millionaire-Maker StocksSource: Epic Cure / ShutterstockExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is another big oil stock that makes this list of high-profit stocks. To be fair, you can largely copy and paste the points I made with Chevron for XOM stock. But there’s another story that caught my eye as it relates to Exxon Mobil.  Specifically, the oil giant is partnering with Tetra Technologies (NYSE:TTI) to develop over 6,100 lithium-rich acres in Arkansas. Tetra had previously made a deal with Saltwerx – a subsidiary of Exxon Mobil – to develop the acreage.  Lithium is in high demand as a crucial asset needed to produce a variety of items such as the lithium-ion batteries that are the de facto standard for electric vehicles. And traditional energy companies continue to look for ways to diversify into renewable energy. Partnering with Tetra allows Exxon to play off its core competency in drilling. It also gives the company a foothold in the growing lithium space in the United States at a time when the government is doling out incentives to onshore the lithium supply chain. As of this writing, XOM stock is down 3% for the year. But that comes after a strong rally in the last week of the quarter.  Microsoft (MSFT) A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comTech stocks have been on an AI-fueled tear this year and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the names leading the charge. MSFT stock is up 39% for the year which mirrors the performance of the NASDAQ index.  Currently, any company that has anything to do with artificial intelligence is making sure investors know about it. Microsoft doesn’t have to work that hard. The company’s leadership in generative AI will continue with its multi-year, multi-billion investment in OpenAI. The company’s stock will likely serve as a proxy for the entire sector. But Microsoft was a cash cow before AI and they’ll continue to be a cash cow afterwards. Analysts project the company will increase revenue by approximately 11.8% on a year-over-year basis. The company gives investors optionality with several ways to generate revenue. And that story will hold up whether or not the company’s proposed deal to buy Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) is denied by regulators.  Kroger (KR) hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Despite being down from its 2022 highs, inflation remains sticky in particular areas such as food. That’s a good reason to put Kroger (NYSE:KR) stock on your shopping list when you’re looking for high-profit stocks. The company missed slightly on revenue in the first quarter, but it beat the bottom line. And both revenue and earnings were higher on a year-over-year basis.  Consumer spending has held up but continues to shift away from discretionary items as consumers are forced to spend more on essentials. But those are the consumers that Kroger can capture. And it will benefit as consumers will continue to trade down if the economy teeters into recession in the second half of the year. Like Microsoft, Kroger’s proposed acquisition of Albertsons (NYSE:ACI) is being held up and may not pass muster. But even if it does fall through, investors are getting a stock that trades at about 10.5x forward earnings. Plus, investors get a secure dividend that currently yields 2.25% and the company has increased it for 16 consecutive years.  Mondelez (MDLZ) tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comMondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ) is another company that serves as an inflation hedge for investors. First, the company is expected to post year-over-year earnings growth of approximately 9%. And after beating on both the top and bottom lines in the first quarter of 2023, many analysts have raised their price target for MDLZ stock.  That highlights the diversity of the company’s products which includes the Oreo and CLIF bar brands. It also showcases the company’s ability to leverage the popularity of its brands to pass along its rising input costs to consumers. And as most investors, who are also consumers, know once prices go up, they take a long time to come back down.  At approximately 22x forward earnings, Mondelez is not trading at a discount. But the consumer staples sector has been outperforming the broader market, so there’s room for Mondelez to move higher. And it does offer a reasonable dividend with a 2.13% yield.  PepsiCo (PEP) Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Best Speculative StocksSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is another ideal choice for investors looking at high-profit stocks. You’ll notice a familiar theme with Pepsi. The company is projected to post a year-over-year increase in earnings of about 8%. It’s also coming off a first quarter when it beat expectations on the top and bottom lines.  Pepsi is best known for its iconic soft drink brand. However, what differentiates Pepsi from its competitors is its snack food division. And the strength of those brands allows Pepsi to pass along its higher input costs to its customers. Plus, the company continues to spend aggressively on advertising and marketing. PEP stock trades at 25x forward earnings which is a premium to the market. But the stock has increased more than 67% over the last five years. That doesn’t include the dividend. Pepsi is a Dividend King that has increased its dividend in each of the last 52 consecutive years.  Tapestry (TPR) a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comTapestry (NYSE:TPR) sells leather goods under the Coach, Kate Spade, and Stuart Weitzman brands. The company falls into the high-end retail sector which has been holding up decently despite sticky inflation. The company is expected to grow earnings about 7% year-over-year. In the first quarter of 2023, the company beat expectations on both its top and bottom lines. Tapestry may not be a true luxury company, and TPR stock may not be a long-term choice for investors. Nevertheless, it’s an intriguing short-term play on consumer spending as consumers look for high-end brands even as they continue to look for ways to fight inflation. Plus, investors shouldn’t overlook the stock’s tempting valuation. It trades at just 11x earnings and has a dividend that currently yields approximately 2.8%. On the date of publication, Chris Markoch had a LONG position in CVX.

We will also explore the growth projection of dentistry and the difficulty level of dental schools while looking at the efforts of big companies in ensuring sustainability in the dental industry. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to 5 Dental Schools With Highest Acceptance Rates.The Global Outlook of DentistryThe global dental market had a value of $36.32 billion in 2021 and is anticipated to witness considerable growth in the coming years. It is projected to reach USD 63.93 billion by 2029, with a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.4% during the forecast period. This growth is expected to result in around 8,400 additional job openings in the dental field during that period. However, the market experienced a decline of -7.6% in 2020 due to the unprecedented impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic, which led to lower demand for dental products across all regions compared to pre-pandemic levels.According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), dentists in the United States earned a median pay of $163,220 per year or $78.47 per hour in 2021. It is also one of the highest paying jobs in the world. The U.S. has more than 70 accredited dental schools that are responsible for preparing dentists for coming generations.How Difficult Are Dental Schools?Dental school is no walk in the park, and it can be just as demanding as medical school. Many students find themselves grappling with the sheer volume of studying they need to do. Not only do they have to memorize a vast amount of dental knowledge, but they also have to apply it in practical settings. One difference between medical and dental school is that dental students get into hands-on practice much earlier. Practical courses kick in within the first couple of years, piling on more stress alongside heavy coursework and challenging exams.The second year of dental school is often considered the toughest because it serves as a preparation phase for the clinic. During this period, students can expect little free time and a whole lot of stress. To add to the difficulty, dental school acceptance rates are generally low due to the limited number of dental schools. Prospective students need to demonstrate exceptional grades, solid university credentials, and acceptable scores on the Dental Admission Test (DAT) to even stand a chance.Story continuesIt is worth noting that the average Dental Admission Test (DAT) score for dental students in 2020 was 20.2, and the average GPA was 3.55. Moreover, while DAT is a prerequisite for almost all dental schools across the US, the Workman School of Dental Medicine is one of the few dental schools that do not require the DAT or any degrees. There are no application or supplemental fees involved either.The competitiveness of dental schools can also be judged from the fact that Tufts Dental School’s acceptance rate is approximately 5% while the NYU College of Dentistry’s acceptance rate is 11%, which are quite low, given that these are not even among the top 10 dental schools in the world.Data from the American Dental Education Association (ADEA) reveals that in the year 2000, approximately 54.5 % of dental school applicants were accepted and enrolled in a dental school. As of 2019, the acceptance rate had only slightly increased to 55.9%.Sustainability in Dentistry: Role of the Big NamesIn the midst of the challenges faced by dental school students and the limited acceptance rates, companies like Dentsply Sirona Inc (NASDAQ:XRAY), Henry Schein, Inc (NASDAQ:HSIC), and Patterson Companies, Inc (NASDAQ:PDCO) are actively promoting sustainability.Dentsply Sirona Inc (NASDAQ:XRAY) has recently launched a free Sustainability in Dentistry Resource Kit, providing dental professionals with valuable resources to understand and implement sustainable practices in their practices and labs.  Additionally, Dentsply Sirona Inc (NASDAQ:XRAY) also recently participated in the virtual Summit on Sustainability in Dentistry, organized by the FDI World Dental Federation on World Environment Day. The company's sustainability efforts have also been recognized through its inclusion in Newsweek's rankings of America's Most Responsible Companies of 2023.In terms of corporate social responsibility, Dentsply Sirona Inc (NASDAQ:XRAY) has partnered with Smile Train to support children with clefts. Through equipment donations, fundraising activities, and financial contributions, they have helped provide access to high-quality cleft care. This collaboration has funded over 730 cleft surgeries, and Dentsply Sirona Inc (NASDAQ:XRAY)'s efforts have been acknowledged through its ranking on Newsweek's list.Dentsply Sirona Inc (NASDAQ:XRAY)'s dedication to sustainability extends to its educational initiatives. They have launched a comprehensive Sustainability Educational Curriculum, offering free online courses through the Dentsply Sirona Academy. These courses address the knowledge gap in dentists' understanding of sustainability and provide practical guidance on implementing sustainable practices.On the other hand, Henry Schein, Inc (NASDAQ:HSIC) has launched the Practice Green global initiative to encourage healthcare practitioners to adopt sustainable practices for a healthier planet. The program provides eco-friendly solutions and support to dental and medical customers in the U.S. and Canada, with plans for expansion.Apart from their sustainability efforts, Henry Schein, Inc (NASDAQ:HSIC) has announced the acquisition of S.I.N which is a leading dental implant company in Brazil, which will enable the entry of Henry Schein, Inc. (NASDAQ:HSIC) into the Brazilian implant market and complement their dental consumables and equipment business. The acquisition is expected to accelerate S.I.N.'s growth in Brazil and expand its presence in other markets.Patterson Dental, which is a division of Patterson Companies, Inc. (NASDAQ:PDCO), has also not been inactive with these efforts. By implementing SAP Field Service Management, a cloud-based solution, the company has been able to optimize routing and reduce mileage, resulting in a 5% reduction in miles traveled per day.This has led to the saving of 40 metric tons of carbon emissions per year, contributing to a more sustainable environment. Moreover, the solution has helped Patterson Companies, Inc (NASDAQ:PDCO) streamline field service management processes, saving time for technicians and improving customer satisfaction.Through improved coordination and scheduling, the company has achieved savings of two to five minutes per job for coordinators which has further allowed them to serve more customers. Patterson Companies, Inc (NASDAQ:PDCO) is one of the largest dental companies in the world.You can also check out our lists of colleges with the highest and lowest acceptance rates here and here, respectively.

It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Prudential Financial, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Prudential Financial. The company's largest shareholder is BlackRock, Inc., with ownership of 9.0%. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.7% and 4.5% of the stock.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Prudential FinancialThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that Prudential Financial, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$57m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 43% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Prudential Financial. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Prudential Financial better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance.

It could also answer some questions about the strength of the larger US labor market.The unionized workforce at UPS was a big advantage for the package carrier earlier in the pandemic as demand for deliveries surged and rivals that lacked a steady supply of labor struggled to find enough available workers.But now that job gains are slowing and demand is cooling in some parts of the economy, it is less clear how much longer labor will hold the upper hand, either at UPS or the economy at large.New data released Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed the labor market is still tight, as the US economy added 209,000 jobs in June. That was the 30th straight month the US economy created jobs. Hourly wages also rose 4.4% over the same month last year, while the unemployment rate fell to 3.6%.But the data also showed some softening. Friday’s report marked the first in 15 months that job creation came in below what Wall Street economists had expected, reflecting a slowdown from the previous month.In the part of the economy where UPS operates — transportation and warehousing — employment actually dropped by 7,000 jobs in June.The labor market is cooling from ""from overheated to lukewarm,"" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead US economist at Oxford Economics, said in a note on Friday.The direction of the labor market is important to the Federal Reserve as it decides whether to keep raising interest rates as a way of bringing down inflation. Officials at the central bank are watching for signs that companies are reducing hiring and wages.New wave of union activismPay is still a major issue for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which is pressing UPS to meet its demands for a new five-year collective bargaining agreement. It wants higher wages for the carrier’s part-time workers, among other benefits.Story continues""We need to drive up the starting rates of pay,"" Sean O’Brien, general president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said this week on CNN.UPS has said it already offers industry-leading pay, with delivery drivers earning up to $42 per hour after four years on the job.On Wednesday, the Teamsters said the company failed to come to the table with an acceptable offer. Workers have authorized a strike to begin August 1 should no deal be reached.Sean O’Brien, general president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. REUTERS/Aude GuerrucciThe approach of the Teamsters is the latest sign of a new wave of union activism that took hold during the pandemic as demand for labor surged.Over the past week, Teamsters workers have expanded strikes against Amazon for delivery drivers in California and New York.The union is also testing Yellow, the nation’s third largest trucking company, to stick to the contract negotiated for its 22,000 union workers despite the company’s request to modify the agreement in efforts to avoid another bankruptcy.Amazon (AMZN), which runs its own shipping service, Amazon Logistics, has been facing unionization efforts from its warehouse workers in several states, while Apple (APPL) and Starbuck (SBUX) have been countering union pressure from retail workers.Is this 'a temporary or fundamental change'?Strikes that can jolt the nation’s supply chains are economic risks that the Biden administration has proven it is not willing to take.Over the past year, the administration has intervened in the dispute between West Coast Ports and the Dockworkers Union, and tapped Congress to settle differences between railroad companies and a dozen unions backing railway conductors. It is also monitoring talks between the auto companies and the United Auto Workers.Julie Su, acting Labor Secretary, said the White House does not plan to intervene in the UPS talks. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)""All of a sudden we find ourselves in a situation we really haven’t experienced for some time,"" labor and employment expert and Penn State University law professor Paul Clark told Yahoo Finance.""The big question is whether this is a temporary or fundamental change between unions and employers. We are trying to answer that right now, and it’s pretty difficult to say.""Wayne State University labor law professor Michael Oswalt said even small disruptions in transportation, shipping and warehousing can be devastating across multiple industries. Still, he said, absent changes to labor law, which governs union campaigns and elections, unions are unlikely to regain the power they once had.""So today what can matter more than a union’s size is its proximity to a company’s choke-point – and especially its willingness to strike,"" Oswalt said. ""UPS Teamsters know the value they bring to the company, to the broader economy, and they have a history of pulling off successful strikes. That trifecta equates to a lot of union power right now.""In January, the BLS reported that 10.1% of wage and salary workers belonged to unions in 2022, down from 10.3% in 2021. In the same timeframe the number of wage and salary workers who belonged to unions increased 1.9% or 273,000 workers. The total number of workers belonging to unions in 1983, according to BLS was around 20.1%, nearly double what it is today.Acting US Labor Secretary Julie Su told Yahoo Finance on Friday that the White House does not plan to intervene in the UPS situation.“I have faith that the parties are going to find a path and continue to try to work things out,” she said Friday.Jennifer Schonberger, Josh Shafer and Jared Mitovich contributed to this report.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"
43,59ffb47b-d562-3469-9186-78c58e0a84fe,MDLZ,2023-07-09,7 High-Profit Stocks to Buy to Cash in on Inflation,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-high-profit-stocks-buy-183523735.html,1688322923,STORY,"['CVX', 'PEP', 'MDLZ', 'XOM', 'TPR', 'MSFT', 'TTI']","[Market watchers have been calling for an earnings recession since the end of 2022. That’s because there’s an expectation that high inflation coupled with rising interest rates could lead to contracting earnings. With that, there are still opportunities to be found. So, what’s the best way to spot high-profit stocks in this situation? One way might be to look at inflation. While inflation is bad for some stocks, some stocks are a good inflation hedge. Investors should look for companies that continue to grow their earnings despite inflation. This shows pricing power and brands that consumers will continue to seek out.  And since markets are forward-looking, now may be a good time to consider stocks in sectors that have been beaten down because of inflation. These sectors tend to be the first to recover and, if they offer a compelling dividend, can be a good hedge against inflation. Here are seven high-profit stocks to look at for the second half of 2023 and beyond.  Chevron (CVX) An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockTwo energy stocks lead off this list of high-profit stocks. The first of those is Chevron (NYSE:CVX). After being one of the best-performing sectors in 2022, energy stocks have been lagging behind the market in 2023. Crude oil prices are finding it hard to crack the $70 mark despite OPEC announcing production cuts.  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBut so far, that hasn’t prevented big oil stocks from generating solid profits. For its part, Chevron posted earnings per share of $3.55 in the first quarter of 2023. Analysts are now forecasting full-year EPS of $15.11 which would be 9% higher than for the full year in 2022. And don’t forget that Chevron prioritizes its shareholders when it comes to what to do with that profit. The company continues to buy back shares at a rate that delights shareholders (like Warren Buffett) and infuriates Congress.  Yet, CVX stock is down 10% in 2023. That disparity between earnings growth and stock price performance should get the attention of investors. Particularly if you believe that oil prices are likely to rise as the economy recovers. And even if oil prices remain sluggish, you’ll be able to pocket a healthy dividend from this Dividend King that currently pays $6.04 per share on an annual basis. Story continuesExxon Mobil (XOM) Man holding stacks of money. Unknown Millionaire-Maker StocksSource: Epic Cure / ShutterstockExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is another big oil stock that makes this list of high-profit stocks. To be fair, you can largely copy and paste the points I made with Chevron for XOM stock. But there’s another story that caught my eye as it relates to Exxon Mobil.  Specifically, the oil giant is partnering with Tetra Technologies (NYSE:TTI) to develop over 6,100 lithium-rich acres in Arkansas. Tetra had previously made a deal with Saltwerx – a subsidiary of Exxon Mobil – to develop the acreage.  Lithium is in high demand as a crucial asset needed to produce a variety of items such as the lithium-ion batteries that are the de facto standard for electric vehicles. And traditional energy companies continue to look for ways to diversify into renewable energy. Partnering with Tetra allows Exxon to play off its core competency in drilling. It also gives the company a foothold in the growing lithium space in the United States at a time when the government is doling out incentives to onshore the lithium supply chain. As of this writing, XOM stock is down 3% for the year. But that comes after a strong rally in the last week of the quarter.  Microsoft (MSFT) A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comTech stocks have been on an AI-fueled tear this year and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the names leading the charge. MSFT stock is up 39% for the year which mirrors the performance of the NASDAQ index.  Currently, any company that has anything to do with artificial intelligence is making sure investors know about it. Microsoft doesn’t have to work that hard. The company’s leadership in generative AI will continue with its multi-year, multi-billion investment in OpenAI. The company’s stock will likely serve as a proxy for the entire sector. But Microsoft was a cash cow before AI and they’ll continue to be a cash cow afterwards. Analysts project the company will increase revenue by approximately 11.8% on a year-over-year basis. The company gives investors optionality with several ways to generate revenue. And that story will hold up whether or not the company’s proposed deal to buy Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) is denied by regulators.  Kroger (KR) hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Despite being down from its 2022 highs, inflation remains sticky in particular areas such as food. That’s a good reason to put Kroger (NYSE:KR) stock on your shopping list when you’re looking for high-profit stocks. The company missed slightly on revenue in the first quarter, but it beat the bottom line. And both revenue and earnings were higher on a year-over-year basis.  Consumer spending has held up but continues to shift away from discretionary items as consumers are forced to spend more on essentials. But those are the consumers that Kroger can capture. And it will benefit as consumers will continue to trade down if the economy teeters into recession in the second half of the year. Like Microsoft, Kroger’s proposed acquisition of Albertsons (NYSE:ACI) is being held up and may not pass muster. But even if it does fall through, investors are getting a stock that trades at about 10.5x forward earnings. Plus, investors get a secure dividend that currently yields 2.25% and the company has increased it for 16 consecutive years.  Mondelez (MDLZ) tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comMondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ) is another company that serves as an inflation hedge for investors. First, the company is expected to post year-over-year earnings growth of approximately 9%. And after beating on both the top and bottom lines in the first quarter of 2023, many analysts have raised their price target for MDLZ stock.  That highlights the diversity of the company’s products which includes the Oreo and CLIF bar brands. It also showcases the company’s ability to leverage the popularity of its brands to pass along its rising input costs to consumers. And as most investors, who are also consumers, know once prices go up, they take a long time to come back down.  At approximately 22x forward earnings, Mondelez is not trading at a discount. But the consumer staples sector has been outperforming the broader market, so there’s room for Mondelez to move higher. And it does offer a reasonable dividend with a 2.13% yield.  PepsiCo (PEP) Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Best Speculative StocksSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is another ideal choice for investors looking at high-profit stocks. You’ll notice a familiar theme with Pepsi. The company is projected to post a year-over-year increase in earnings of about 8%. It’s also coming off a first quarter when it beat expectations on the top and bottom lines.  Pepsi is best known for its iconic soft drink brand. However, what differentiates Pepsi from its competitors is its snack food division. And the strength of those brands allows Pepsi to pass along its higher input costs to its customers. Plus, the company continues to spend aggressively on advertising and marketing. PEP stock trades at 25x forward earnings which is a premium to the market. But the stock has increased more than 67% over the last five years. That doesn’t include the dividend. Pepsi is a Dividend King that has increased its dividend in each of the last 52 consecutive years.  Tapestry (TPR) a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comTapestry (NYSE:TPR) sells leather goods under the Coach, Kate Spade, and Stuart Weitzman brands. The company falls into the high-end retail sector which has been holding up decently despite sticky inflation. The company is expected to grow earnings about 7% year-over-year. In the first quarter of 2023, the company beat expectations on both its top and bottom lines. Tapestry may not be a true luxury company, and TPR stock may not be a long-term choice for investors. Nevertheless, it’s an intriguing short-term play on consumer spending as consumers look for high-end brands even as they continue to look for ways to fight inflation. Plus, investors shouldn’t overlook the stock’s tempting valuation. It trades at just 11x earnings and has a dividend that currently yields approximately 2.8%. On the date of publication, Chris Markoch had a LONG position in CVX.

45,9448ae72-41bc-3bde-9ab5-de6040be297e,DVA,2023-07-09,The 7 Most Undervalued Buffett Stocks to Buy Now: June 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-most-undervalued-buffett-stocks-184208196.html,1688323328,STORY,"['BRK-A', 'AXP', 'DVA', 'TSLA', 'BRK-B', 'CHTR', 'KR', 'GM']","[Plenty of investors are interested in the stocks that legendary investor Warren Buffett has selected for the Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) equity portfolio. However, instead of buying every single stock in this category, you may want to focus mainly on the undervalued Buffett stocks instead.Alongside the scores of “wonderful companies at a fair price” style investments held by Buffett’s firm, such as its large stakes in American Express (NYSE:AXP), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Berkshire portfolio holds scores of other stocks, many of which are arguably undervalued, and in some cases, deep value, stocks.Although growth stocks have been crushing it thus far in 2023, long-term investors may want to focus on value stocks instead. According to a 2022 report from Dimension Fund Advisors, over a nearly century-long time frame, value stocks have beaten growth stocks by an average of 4.1% annually.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsGiven this, plus the fact that Buffett has crushed the market over a multi-decade time frame, the undervalued Buffett stocks currently in the Berkshire portfolio could end up generating above-average returns. Let’s take a look at seven of them, most of which are high-profile, and one of which is more under the radar.Charter Communications (CHTR)man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buy. Stocks With 1000% UpsideSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comCharter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) is one of America’s largest cable and internet service providers. Marketing its services under the brand name Spectrum, Charter has over 32 million customers in 41 U.S. states. As a GuruFocus commentator discussed in April, Buffett built up Berkshire’s position in CHTR stock during 2016 and 2017 but has since trimmed the position, taking advantage of Charter’s big run-up in price, before, during, and after the pandemic. Since 2021, Charter has declined sharply, due to concerns about slowing growth and rising debt.Story continuesStill, CHTR continues to be one of the Warren Buffett stocks. Berkshire currently holds a 2.5% stake, worth around $1.3 billion. Trading for just 11.1 times estimated 2023 earnings, and 9.2 times estimated 2024 earnings, it’s possible that Buffett is riding things out right now, with the intention of selling into strength, if/when earnings begin to jump again.DaVita (DVA)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comLast year, DaVita (NYSE:DVA) seemed more like a “Buffett value trap” than an undervalued Buffett stock. In mid-2022, I discussed how uncertainty regarding healthcare stocks kicked off a sell-off in this dialysis center operator’s shares. At the time, I saw it as a buy.Unfortunately, the DVA stock slide continued through year’s end, pushing it to the mid-$60s per share. Flash forward to now, however, and DaVita has started to make a comeback. The stock has bounced back to just under $100 per share. Better yet, even after this partial recovery, DVA may have more room to run. Trading for only 14.5 times forward earnings, analysts also forecast further steady increases in earnings per share (or EPS) during 2024 and 2025. This could mean further gains ahead for not just Berkshire, which owns a 39.8% stake in DVA, but for anyone deciding to buy it today.General Motors (GM)image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocksSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.comTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fans may think Buffett’s big bet on General Motors (NYSE:GM) is a foolish one. In their view, Tesla will thrive while this Detroit automaker will flounder, as EVs become a larger percentage of vehicles on the road. However, recent developments suggest this take is unwarranted.As InvestorPlace’s Ian Bezek recently pointed out, the company’s Chevy Bolt EV is experiencing a sales surge. Far from getting left in the dust by Tesla, GM’s upcoming low-price, high-range Silverado electric truck could leave Tesla’s Cybertruck in the dust. Besides being a formidable EV contender, GM stock is also dirt-cheap, at 5.7 times earnings. This valuation prices in a possible recession, and leaves GM poised for a big rebound once economic conditions normalize. Rather than a Buffett stock to avoid, ignore the critics, and consider it one of the Buffett stocks to buy. It could outperform richly-priced TSLA from here.Kroger (KR)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comFrom 2021, up until early 2022, Kroger (NYSE:KR) was one of the top-performing undervalued Warren Buffett stocks. At the time, the grocery chain operator was managing to stay ahead of rising inflation. Yet throughout 2022, inflation started to take a bite out of the company, causing shares to start moving lower. Last fall, Kroger’s announcement of plans to merge with Albertsons (NYSE:ACI) seemed like something that could get KR stock back on track. However, political and regulatory scrutiny casts doubt about the deal getting approved and completed. With this, why follow Buffett’s lead into Kroger?Already knocked lower by these negatives, shares trade for just 10.2 times forward earnings. It may not take much positive news to spark a rebound for KR. While you wait, collect KR’s solid, growing dividend. Recently raised by 11.5%, Kroger’s current quarterly payouts give the stock a 2.5% forward yield.Mitsubishi (MSBHF)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Best Speculative StocksSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comAlongside the many high-profile U.S.-listed undervalued Warren Buffett stocks, there are quite a few international value stocks in the mix. Namely, shares in five Japanese general trading companies, one of which is Mitsubishi (OTCMKTS:MSBHF).MSBHF stock and the four other names in this basket have performed very well since Buffett’s position in them became public knowledge. However, the “Oracle of Omaha” hasn’t started to cash out. Rather, Berkshire has raised its positions in each of them. Buffett’s firm appears ready to hold these names over a long time horizon.This could prove to be very profitable, especially in the case of MSBHF. Not only do shares (trading for only 8 times earnings) have plenty of room for multiple expansions. As InvestorPlace’s Samuel O’Brient recently pointed out, Mitsubishi’s big move into EV battery metals like lithium and nickel could result in strong growth for the company.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comBerkshire’s positions in blue chips like Apple and Coca-Cola may dwarf its position in Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), but one can argue that Oxy has been the subject of the greatest level of chatter among Buffett stocks since 2022.As you likely know, Buffett’s steady increase of Berkshire’s OXY stock position, coupled with soaring oil prices, led to strong returns for shares last year. This year, though, the stock has underperformed. Largely, due to sliding oil prices. Yet while the market leans bearish on oil stocks, Buffett remains very bullish on this one.Continuing to buy shares, Berkshire now owns a more than 25% stake in this energy company. While this oil stock may not seem all that cheap at 12.5 times forward earnings, it’s possible Berkshire sees big value in the company’s carbon capture strategy. Carbon capture technology could help create a deep moat for this currently commoditized business.Paramount Global (PARA)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) is one of the undervalued Buffett stocks that at first doesn’t appear all that undervalued. Shares in the media conglomerate today trade for around 24.3 times forward earnings, not exactly deep value territory.Yet while PARA stock seems pricey relative to current earnings, two factors point to it being undervalued. First, weakness in advertising demand, plus expenses related to the buildout of its streaming businesses, have depressed earnings. Forecasts call for earnings to bounce back in a big way starting next year.Second, given its extensive media properties and content library, PARA may be cheap relative to the value of its assets. Analysts at Wells Fargo have recently argued that the company may be worth $30 billion to a buyer like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).

Not to break the fourth wall or anything but I have a feeling you didn’t come to read InvestorPlace articles because you wanted to hear a pitch about slow-and-steady risers. Instead, you likely came here for the exciting stuff.Of course, there’s plenty of material covering exactly that topic. However, buy-and-hold stocks command significant relevance, especially in this ambiguous environment. I’ve said this before but the May jobs report – while busting expectations – also demonstrated fissures in the economy. In particular, unemployment conspicuously increased while employers don’t appear to be aggressively competing on wage incentives. Given that it’s still possible for a recession to materialize, now might not be the time to carry exclusive exposure to risk-on enterprises. Instead, the below-stable stocks for long-term investing might be more appropriate.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCF Industries (CF)man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buy. Stocks With 1000% UpsideSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comAn American manufacturer and distributor of agricultural fertilizers, CF Industries (NYSE:CF) specializes in hydrogen and nitrogen products for clean energy, emissions abatement, fertilizer, and other industrial applications. Further, the company operates manufacturing complexes in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. Due to geopolitical flashpoints, CF Industries ranks among the most relevant boring stocks to buy.Unfortunately, the market doesn’t quite see it that way, sending CF down more than 14% since the start of the year. Over the past 365 days, it shed nearly 18% of its equity value. Nevertheless, in part because of the volatility, CF appears significantly undervalued. Notably, shares trade at a price-earnings-growth ratio of 0.13 times, well below the sector median value of 0.74 times.Also, it’s worth pointing out that in addition to its massive revenue growth, CF features a Piotroski F-Score of 9 out of 9. This stat indicates excellent operational efficiency. Finally, analysts peg CF as a moderate buy with an $87.06 price target (implying nearly 24% upside). For those interested in long-term investing, CF makes a compelling argument.Story continuesValero Energy (VLO)An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockAn international manufacturer and marketer of transportation fuels and petrochemical products, Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) is a Fortune 50 enterprise based in San Antonio, Texas. Per its corporate profile, Valero operates 15 petroleum refineries with a combined throughput capacity of approximately 3.2 million barrels per day. Also, it features 13 ethanol plants with a combined production capacity of approximately 1.68 billion gallons per year.Due to the softness in the energy space – in part due to the hawkish monetary environment – the hydrocarbon space features mixed performances. For VLO specifically, it declined about 3% since the January opener. Still, it’s one of the boring stocks to consider, just in case full social normalization materializes. Also, VLO stands among the buy-and-hold stocks due to its robust financials. As with CF Industries above, Valero enjoys above-average long-term revenue growth. At the same time, it runs a Piotroski F-Score of 9, indicating outstanding operational efficiency.Lastly, analysts peg VLO as a moderate buy with a $144.20 price target, implying nearly 24% upside. Arguably, it’s one of the stable stocks to put on your radar.STMicroelectronics (STM)Man holding stacks of money. Unknown Millionaire-Maker StocksSource: Epic Cure / ShutterstockHailing from Switzerland, STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM) designs, develops, manufactures, and markets products for the broader digital ecosystem, which encompasses relevant arenas such as smart mobility, renewable energy, and the Internet of Things. Per its public profile, ST offers discrete and standard commodity components, application-specific integrated circuits, full custom devices, and semi-custom devices for analog, digital, and mixed-signal applications.Of course, it’s hard to describe tech players as boring stocks to buy. However, ST operates in the background, almost like a stagehand for headline-generating innovators. So, under this context, ST might be a snoozer for some folks. Nevertheless, those interested in long-term investing should earmark shares on their must-watch list.Financially, ST posts impressive revenue and EBITDA growth over the past three years. At the same time, the company commands a Piotroski F-Score of 8, indicating strong operational efficiency. Also, its Altman Z-Score clocks in at 6.09, indicating a very low bankruptcy risk. To close, analysts peg STM as a unanimous strong buy with a $63 price target (implying over 29% upside). It’s easily one of the buy-and-hold stocks.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. With that in mind, the ROCE of UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) looks decent, right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on UnitedHealth Group is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.18 = US$30b ÷ (US$284b - US$116b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).So, UnitedHealth Group has an ROCE of 18%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Healthcare industry average of 9.5% it's much better. View our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group roceIn the above chart we have measured UnitedHealth Group's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for UnitedHealth Group.How Are Returns Trending?While the returns on capital are good, they haven't moved much. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 18% and the business has deployed 90% more capital into its operations. 18% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that UnitedHealth Group has consistently earned this amount. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders.Story continuesOn a side note, UnitedHealth Group's current liabilities are still rather high at 41% of total assets. This can bring about some risks because the company is basically operating with a rather large reliance on its suppliers or other sorts of short-term creditors. While it's not necessarily a bad thing, it can be beneficial if this ratio is lower.What We Can Learn From UnitedHealth Group's ROCETo sum it up, UnitedHealth Group has simply been reinvesting capital steadily, at those decent rates of return. And since the stock has risen strongly over the last five years, it appears the market might expect this trend to continue. So even though the stock might be more ""expensive"" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research.One more thing to note, we've identified   1 warning sign  with UnitedHealth Group and understanding this should be part of your investment process.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Sherwin-Williams' (NYSE:SHW) returns on capital, so let's have a look.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Sherwin-Williams, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.19 = US$3.1b ÷ (US$23b - US$6.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Thus, Sherwin-Williams has an ROCE of 19%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Chemicals industry average of 11% it's much better. See our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Sherwin-Williams compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Sherwin-Williams here  for free.The Trend Of ROCESherwin-Williams' ROCE growth is quite impressive. The figures show that over the last five years, ROCE has grown 49% whilst employing roughly the same amount of capital. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward.The Bottom LineTo sum it up, Sherwin-Williams is collecting higher returns from the same amount of capital, and that's impressive. And investors seem to expect more of this going forward, since the stock has rewarded shareholders with a 92% return over the last five years. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.Story continuesIf you'd like to know about the risks facing Sherwin-Williams, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should be aware of.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

(NASDAQ:PEP)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-intrinsic-value-pepsico-inc-140017042.html,1688824817,STORY,['PEP'],"[Key InsightsPepsiCo's estimated fair value is US$171 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityWith US$183 share price, PepsiCo appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value Analyst price target for PEP is US$199, which is 16% above our fair value estimateToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for PepsiCo The ModelWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$10.4bUS$10.6bUS$11.2bUS$11.7bUS$12.1bUS$12.4bUS$12.8bUS$13.1bUS$13.4bUS$13.7bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 3.29%Est @ 2.94%Est @ 2.69%Est @ 2.52%Est @ 2.39%Est @ 2.31% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$9.7kUS$9.3kUS$9.2kUS$9.0kUS$8.7kUS$8.3kUS$8.0kUS$7.7kUS$7.4kUS$7.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$84bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$14b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.1%) = US$294bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$294b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$152bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$236b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$183, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at PepsiCo as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for PepsiCoStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Beverage market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatDividends are not covered by earnings and cashflows.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For PepsiCo, we've compiled three further elements you should further research:Risks: For example, we've discovered 4 warning signs for PepsiCo (1 is a bit concerning!) that you should be aware of before investing here.Future Earnings: How does PEP's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?
