However, Broadcom has gone through several major transformations since its founding in 1991, and it has outperformed a lot of other tech stocks over the past eight years.', 'On Feb. 1, 2016, Singapore\'s Avago Technologies closed its acquisition of the original Broadcom and adopted the American chipmaker\'s name. Two years later, the ""new"" Broadcom moved its headquarters from Singapore back to America. Its stock has rallied more than 700% since that takeover as the S&P 500 has risen about 150%.', 'Broadcom is now worth $519 billion, but could it double its market cap by 2030 to become another trillion-dollar chipmaker like Nvidia?', ""Prior to buying Broadcom, Avago had already acquired a long list of smaller companies to expand its portfolio of wireless, optical, and data storage chips. By paying $37 billion for Broadcom, it gained even more mobile, networking, wireless, and industrial chips. That inorganic growth strategy made it one of the world's largest chipmakers."", ""Broadcom subsequently expanded into the infrastructure software market by buying CA Technologies in 2018, Symantec's enterprise security division in 2019, and the cloud software giant Vmware in 2023. Those acquisitions should diversify its business away from the cyclical semiconductor market and curb its dependence on Apple, which still accounted for 20% of its revenue over the last two fiscal years."", ""From fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2023 (which ended last October), Broadcom's adjusted revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15%, its adjusted gross margin rose from 60.5% to 74.7%, and its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) increased at a CAGR of 21%. For reference, Texas Instruments grew its revenue and EPS at a CAGR of 7% and 18%, respectively, from 2016 to 2022 -- but analysts expect its revenue and EPS to decline 12% and 25%, respectively, in 2023."", ""Broadcom's stock still looks reasonably valued at 24 times forward earnings and 10 times this year's sales (which includes its acquisition of VMware) after its multi-year rally. Assuming its current valuations hold steady, it would need to grow its revenue and EPS at a CAGR of about 10% to nearly double its market cap to $1 trillion by 2030."", 'That goal seems fairly achievable. From fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, analysts expect its revenue to grow at a CAGR of 18% as its EPS increases at a CAGR of 16%.', 'That growth should be driven by three long-term catalysts. First, the expansion of the generative artificial intelligence (AI) market should spark stronger sales of its data center and infrastructure chips over the next few years. Second, its sales of chips to mobile and IT infrastructure customers should warm up again as the macro environment improves. Apple also signed a new ""multibillion-dollar agreement"" to buy Broadcom\'s 5G radio frequency components and other wireless connectivity components for several more years last May, so it won\'t lose its top semiconductor customer anytime soon.', ""Lastly, Broadcom's infrastructure business should continue to expand as it profits from the secular expansion of the cloud and cybersecurity markets, which have generally been less prone to deep cyclical downturns than the semiconductor market over the past few years. It expects to generate roughly half its revenue from software following its acquisition of Vmware, and that percentage could continue rising as it acquires more software companies."", ""Broadcom's stock could double by 2030, but investors shouldn't overlook its two weaknesses. First, it accumulated a lot of debt as it expanded its business, and its high debt-to-equity ratio of 2.0 could limit its gains as long as interest rates remain elevated. Second, it's increased its share count by 20% since its acquisition of the original Broadcom to fund its acquisitions and stock-based compensation. Texas Instruments reduced its share count by nearly 10% during the same period."", 'Broadcom\'s aggressive expansion strategies have paid off so far, but it could reach a point where its reach exceeds its grasp and it ""di-worsifies"" its sprawling business. If that happens, investors will be a lot less forgiving of its rising debt and dilution.', ""That said, I believe Broadcom's strengths still outweigh its weaknesses. It's repeatedly proven the bears wrong with its bold investments, it's still growing rapidly, its stock is reasonably valued, and it pays a decent forward dividend yield of 1.9%. Those strengths could help it join the 12-zero club by the end of this decade."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Broadcom wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years."", 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

The bullish inventory numbers, together with a cold blast sweeping through North America drove up weather-related demand and buoyed natural gas futures, which settled with another healthy gain week over week.Despite the spike, the market hasn't been kind to natural gas, with the commodity trading considerably lower over the past 12 months over growing worries about record output and concerns of an ongoing supply glut. At this time, we advise investors to focus on stocks like Range Resources RRC, Coterra Energy CTRA and Cheniere Energy LNG."", 'Stockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states fell 140 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the holiday-shortened week ended Jan 5, above the guidance of a 122 Bcf withdrawal, per a survey conducted by S&P Global Commodity Insights. The decrease compared with the five-year (2019-2023) average net shrinkage of 89 Bcf and last year’s decline of 23 Bcf for the reported week.The latest draw puts total natural gas stocks at 3,336 Bcf, which is 436 Bcf (15%) above the 2023 level and 348 Bcf (11.6%) higher than the five-year average.The total supply of natural gas averaged 110.8 Bcf per day, down a marginal 0.1 Bcf per day on a weekly basis due to a decrease in dry production, almost offset by higher shipments from Canada.Meanwhile, daily consumption rose to 131.2 Bcf from 126.2 Bcf in the previous week, mainly reflecting strength in residential/commercial usage and higher power burn, to go with a pickup in exports to Mexico.', 'Natural gas prices surged last week following the higher-than-expected inventory decrease. Futures for February delivery — ended Friday at $3.31 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, surging some 14.5% from the previous week’s closing. The jump in natural gas realization is also the result of a pullback in supply and predictions of colder weather.As is the norm with natural gas, changes in temperature and weather forecasts can lead to price swings. With forecasts of cold arctic blasts in the days ahead, usage of the commodity to generate electricity is likely to be strong.Apart from bullish weather conditions, natural gas has been pushed higher by signs of curtailment in domestic output. According to energy services provider Baker Hughes, the U.S. natural gas rig count — a pointer to where production is headed — is down some 22% from last year. Industry observers believe this could set the stage for a pullback in near-term drilling and supplies.Meanwhile, a stable demand catalyst in the form of continued strong LNG feedgas deliveries is supporting natural gas. LNG shipments for export from the United States have been elevated for months, reaching record levels due to environmental reasons and Europe’s endeavor to move away from its dependence on Russian natural gas supplies due to the war in Ukraine.', 'Despite last couple of week’s healthy increase, the natural gas market remains an oversupplied one. As a matter of fact, it endured a torrid year in 2023, as prices tumbled more than 40%, briefly breaking below the $2 threshold for the first time since 2020.Based on several factors, the space is currently quite unpredictable and spooked by the sudden changes in weather and production patterns. As such, investors are clueless about what to do. As of now, the lingering uncertainty over the fuel means that they should preferably hold on to fundamentally strong stocks like Range Resources, Coterra Energy and Cheniere Energy.Range Resources: RRC is a leading operator in the prolific Appalachian Basin — a premier natural gas play — with huge inventories of low-risk drilling sites that are likely to provide production for several decades.

The company’s quarterly revenues and earnings are expected to have decreased on a year-over-year basis.In the last reported quarter, STT’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were largely driven by an increase in fee revenues and no provisions. However, higher expenses and a decline in net interest revenues (NIR) hurt results to some extent.State Street has a decent earnings surprise history.

Our estimate for sales is $2.95 billion.', ""Net Interest Revenues: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest-earning assets for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $220.4 billion, which implies a fall of almost 1% from the previous quarter. Our estimate for the metric is pegged at $217.6 billion.Lending activities continued at a slower pace in the fourth quarter, and the Federal Reserve kept the rates unchanged at a 22-year high of 5.25-5.5%. These factors are expected to have supported State Street’s NIR to some extent. However, an increase in funding costs weighed on NIR as interest rates remained high. Thus, NIR is likely to have been adversely impacted.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NIR (on a fully taxable-equivalent or FTE basis) of $590 million indicates a sequential fall of 5.7%. We project NIR on FTE basis of $585.2 million.Management projects NIR to be in the $550-$600 million range. This includes expected non-interest-bearing deposit rotation (expected to be $3-4 billion) and the impact of deposit repricing, which will likely be partially offset by stability in the total average deposit balance.Fee Revenues: Lower volatility in foreign exchange (FX) markets is likely to have aided State Street’s FX trading services income. The consensus estimate is pegged at $312.8 million, which is relatively stable with the last quarter. Also, management projects FX markets revenues to be down modestly from the last-year quarter level. Our estimate for the metric is pegged at $362.4 million.The consensus estimate for management fees of $464.8 million implies a 3% decline on a sequential basis. The company expects the metric to be stable on a year-over-year basis.

Our estimates for the same is pegged at $97.1 billion.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for software and processing fees suggests a 26.6% jump to $238.1 million. Driven by the timing of on-premise renewals and expected new SaaS installations, STT projects software and processing fees to go up in the range of 10-12% year over year. Our estimates for the same is pegged at $240 billion.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total fee revenues of $2.36 billion indicates a slight fall from the prior quarter. We project the metric to be $2.39 billion.Management expects fee revenues to be flat to up 1% year over year.Expenses: Higher information systems and communication expenses, inflationary pressure and the company’s strategic buyouts and investments in franchises are expected to have led to a rise in operating expenses in the fourth quarter.Further, State Street is set to trim around 4% or 1,500 of its workforce as part of its “multiyear transformation journey to drive increased productivity and create efficiencies.” As a result, the company is expected to incur $175-$200 million as a repositioning charge in the quarter.Management expects adjusted expenses to be relatively stable on a sequential basis.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), as well as a handful of travel stocks and homebuilders. While there are questions about how consumers will fare in 2024, one growing apparel company with strong profitability trends appears poised for more gains."", 'PVH Corp. (NYSE:PVH) sports a low valuation and high earnings growth over the coming quarters. While its technical situation is mixed, I see more upside ahead.', 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with WBD.', 'According to Bank of America Global Research, PVH has an international presence in the apparel industry through two primary segments: Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. It operates through three distribution channels: wholesale, retail and licensing operations. It designs and markets apparel in more than 40 countries, primarily through e-commerce outlets and physical stores.', 'Sporting a $7 billion market cap, the New York-based apparel, accessories and luxury goods company within the consumer discretionary sector trades at a low 11.2 forward 12-month non-GAAP price-earnings ratio, and the company pays a low 0.1% dividend yield. With earnings not due out until March, the stock carries a moderately high 30% implied volatility percentage with a material short interest of 4.30% as of Jan. 10.', ""Back in November, PVH reported a significant bottom-line beat. Fourth-quarter non-GAAP earnings per share verified at $2.90, easily topping the Wall Street consensus estimate of $2.74. Top-line growth of 3.5% from year-ago levels led to $2.36 billion in net sales, slightly missing analysts' expectations. The company's 15% operating margin goal by 2025 remains intact following the solid quarter, even with a more modest sales outlook given the weakening consumer environment. The next few quarters will be critical to watch given the rise in the stock, with particular attention being paid to how its European geographic segment performs with significant revenue from that region, and any weakness there is a risk. But with improved inflation trends in Europe, there's reason for optimism. Big picture, the company reduced selling, general and administrative costs while its North America segment produced robust margin numbers in both Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger as it grows its direct-to-consumer channel."", ""If the company can hit its 15% operating margin target, then this year's earnings forecast should easily be hit. Execution is key in 2024 amid several macro crosscurrents, and the latest advance in the share price sets the bar a bit higher than what was seen during the middle of last year. Still, PVH's strong international presence, top-line momentum and improved balance sheet are tailwinds for the coming years."", ""Compared to its peers, PVH is relatively undervalued given its earnings multiple and modest enterprise value/Ebitda ratio under 9. For shareholders, the stock lacks a decent yield, and you can find retailers more focused on distributions, but I assert that PVH's improved margin story and international growth opportunities are worthy of being invested in right now. Also consider that PVH has among the best growth prospects in its industry while share price momentum trends have been robust in recent months. Finally, amid weak apparel company earnings per share revisions lately, PVH stands out with a slew of earnings upgrades over the past 90 days."", ""Key risks for the company include a softer macroeconomic environment, particularly if consumer spending trends weaken. Being a company with a mix of U.S. and international sales, adverse currency movements are always a risk. Rising input costs and labor challenges could also derail the margin expansion story. A particular concern heading into 2024 is what could unfold in Europe. About half of PVH's sales stem from Europe, with an even larger share of its profits from that region. If we see continued soft economic data, including retail sales, then PVH could be a laggard. I will also be keeping a watchful eye on PVH's promotional activity."", ""On valuation, analysts at Bank of America see earnings jumping 17% this year after a dip in 2023. Per-share profit growth is expected to accelerate in 2025 with continued ample earnings growth in 2026. The current consensus outlook calls for mid-teens earnings per share increases, with perhaps easing growth by 2026, however. The improved profitability trend will likely be driven by margin expansion given that forecasters see PVH's top line rising by just 1% this year and near 0% next year."", ""Dividends, meanwhile, are projected to hold at a very low rate as the company focuses on reinvesting capital into high-growth initiatives. With a low teens operating earnings multiple, the company appears as a solid value play with significant growth opportunities. If we apply a low to mid-teens price-earnings ratio, between PVH's long-term average (10.7) and the sector median (15.6), and assume $10.80 of non-GAAP earnings per share over the next 12 months, then the share price should be near $142, making the stock significantly undervalued today."", 'Looking ahead, corporate event data provided by Wall Street Horizon show an unconfirmed fourth-quarter 2023 earnings date of Monday, March 25. No other volatility catalysts are seen on the calendar.', 'PVH has been a major winner from the stock market bottom in October of 2022. Notice in the chart below that shares nearly tripled from a low near $43 to the December 2023 peak above $123. A pullback is currently underway, which is not surprising given the stock rallied right up to its 2021 range highs between $121 and $125. I would expect further consolidation, potentially forming a bullish cup with handle pattern. The thinking is investors who bought the stock in 2021 may look to sell in order to get back to breakeven, creating some pressure on the stock. Once that supply is out of the way then I see technical opportunities for PVH to continue its rally, potentially up to its 2018 high near $169.', ""I also spot a high amount of volume by price from the low $80s up to $110 that makes for a natural support area on pullbacks. Also consider that PVH's long-term 200-day moving average is now upwardsloping, suggesting the bulls are in control, though shares are working off technical overbought conditions, as seen in the relative strength indicator momentum oscillator at the bottom of the graph."", 'Overall, the technical situation is healthy long term, though a pullback is in the works and a major area of support is seen at the 2023 range highs in the mid-$90s.', 'I see shares of PVH as undervalued, though a pause in the uptrend appears to be taking place. With support in the mid-$90s and fundamental upside to the low to mid-$140s, this apparel company looks strong as 2024 progresses.', 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

Robust demand from the health care, education and government verticals is boosting the Uniform Rental and Facility Services unit’s performance.

Also, Cintas’ efforts to reward shareholders are impressive. Amid these positives, shares of the company have outperformed its industry in the past six months. However, the rising cost of sales and increasing selling and administrative expenses pose a threat to the company’s bottom line. The high tax rate is an added concern for Cintas.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So when we looked at Under Armour (NYSE:UAA) and its trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.', ""If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Under Armour is:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.086 = US$299m ÷ (US$4.7b - US$1.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""Thus, Under Armour has an ROCE of 8.6%.  Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Luxury industry average of 12%."", ' View our latest analysis for Under Armour ', ""In the above chart we have measured Under Armour's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company."", ""Under Armour is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 76% in that same time. So our take on this is that the business has increased efficiencies to generate these higher returns, all the while not needing to make any additional investments. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking."", ""To bring it all together, Under Armour has done well to increase the returns it's generating from its capital employed. Given the stock has declined 61% in the last five years, this could be a good investment if the valuation and other metrics are also appealing. That being the case, research into the company's current valuation metrics and future prospects seems fitting."", ""Like most companies, Under Armour does come with some risks, and we've found 1 warning sign  that you should be aware of."", 'If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.', 'Have feedback on this article?

To provide designers with a reliable and robust network solution with deterministic communication, Microchip Technology (Nasdaq: MCHP) today announces its next-generation of LAN969x Ethernet switches with Time Sensitive Networking (TSN), scalable bandwidths from 46 Gbps to 102 Gbps and a powerful 1 GHz single-core Arm® Cortex®-A53 CPU.', 'For applications that require greater redundancy, the LAN969x Ethernet switches can be configured with High-availability Seamless Redundancy (HSR) and Parallel Redundancy Protocol (PRP). HSR and PRP are hardware protocols that provide zero-loss redundancy in Ethernet networks. The LAN969x Ethernet switches support multiple HSR and PRP Redundancy Box (RedBox) instances that can operate in parallel and in series, as well as at Ethernet port speeds from 10 Mbps to 10 Gbps.', 'The LAN969x can implement a QuadBox, which is a function that connects two HSR networks to each other. This feature is particularly useful in applications where high reliability and zero downtime are critical. Alternative solutions that implement a QuadBox typically require multiple different components that can drive up design complexity and system costs.', '“Prior to the introduction of Microchip’s LAN969x Ethernet switches, customers who wanted to implement TSN and HSR/PRP features required multiple ICs. Microchip’s new LAN969x solution is a single chip that can reduce the number of components and system level costs,” said Charles Forni, vice president of Microchip’s USB and networking business unit. “These devices are also supported with our VSC6817SDK IStaX Linux® application software package that can enable designers to quickly bring products to market.”', 'The LAN969x Ethernet switches are highly configurable with options of up to 30 ports. The Ethernet ports support multiple interfaces including RGMII, SGMII, QSGMII, USGMII, and USXGMII. The LAN969x family targets secure and safety-critical applications where high-port-count 10M/100M/1G/2.5G/10G switching links are required.', 'The LAN969x family is available with security add-ons such as secure boot and secure firmware execution based on the customer’s root-of-trust manufacturing process. Security is provided through Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM)-based frame processing using a Versatile Content Aware Processor (VCAP), Arm Trusted Firmware methodology for fast secure boot, crypto libraries and hardware security accelerators for boot and code encryption, and one-time programmable immutable key storage.', 'The new family of LAN969x mid-range Ethernet switches rounds out Microchip’s portfolio of TSN switches.

So, let's look at these two REITs and see whether they are worthy of your portfolio."", ""If you frequent movie theaters, eat-and-play concepts like TopGolf, amusement parks, or ski hills, chances are you've visited a location owned by EPR Properties. The REIT owns 359 properties across 44 states and Canada, collecting rent from its experiential tenants. The company has paid a regular dividend since going public in 1997 and switched from a quarterly to a monthly payout in 2013."", 'Today, EPR Properties pays a monthly dividend of $0.275 per share, resulting in a hefty annual dividend yield of 6.9%. In addition to the monthly payout, the stock has had a nice run over the past year, with a 20% price appreciation. The stock is still down roughly 30% from pre-pandemic levels, as the company obviously suffered during the pandemic when people were unable to visit its properties, forcing it to modify its leases with its tenants unable to meet rent obligations.', ""The good news is that revenue and net income are on the rise again, with the company's trailing-12-month revenue of $662 million surpassing its 2019 revenue of $652 million. And while the company's trailing-12-month net income of $176 million hasn't quite reached its 2019 level of $202 million, it's quite an improvement from its 2020 net loss of $132 million."", 'Despite the challenging macro environment for EPR Properties, management expanded its portfolio from 280 properties in 2020 to 359 properties today.

Even before the pandemic, the movie theater business was declining, selling 200 million fewer domestic tickets in 2019 compared to its highs in the early oughts. As a result, management has stated its intention to reduce its strategic focus on theater properties in favor of its other experiential property types.', 'Nonetheless, EPR Properties stock looks cheap on a valuation basis when you look at its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.

Additionally, Realty Income recently entered into a merger agreement with Spirit Realty Capital, a REIT investing in single-tenant real estate assets, in an all-stock deal valued at $9.3 billion and expected to close sometime in 2024.

Notably, Realty Income paid $660 million in interest expenses over the trailing 12 months, another record high.', ""Nonetheless, there's still reason for optimism; at the end of the quarter, occupancy was 98.8%, just shy of the company's recent record of 99%. Looking ahead, the unprecedented growth provides an exciting opportunity for investors, but it will be crucial to keep an eye on how management handles its debt."", ""Investing in REIT stocks isn't for everyone, as dividends are prioritized over share price appreciation. Still, REITs provide exposure to real estate without the challenge of managing physical properties."", ""These two stocks provide steady and reliable payments, and despite each having exposure to movie theaters, the rest of their portfolios are relatively stable.

Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don\'t have the same features.', ""On the face of it, Align Technology's ROE is not much to talk about. However, its ROE is similar to the industry average of 9.5%, so we won't completely dismiss the company. But then again, Align Technology's five year net income shrunk at a rate of 7.3%. Remember, the company's ROE is a bit low to begin with. So that's what might be causing earnings growth to shrink."", ""So, as a next step, we compared Align Technology's performance against the industry and were disappointed to discover that while the company has been shrinking its earnings, the industry has been growing its earnings at a rate of 9.1% over the last few years."", ""Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Align Technology is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry."", ""Because Align Technology doesn't pay any dividends, we infer that it is retaining all of its profits, which is rather perplexing when you consider the fact that there is no earnings growth to show for it. So there could be some other explanations in that regard. For instance, the company's business may be deteriorating."", ""On the whole, we feel that the performance shown by Align Technology can be open to many interpretations. Even though it appears to be retaining most of its profits, given the low ROE, investors may not be benefitting from all that reinvestment after all. The low earnings growth suggests our theory correct.

It highlights just how impactful the surging Magnificent Seven returns were on the actual S&P 500. If you didn't own that group of stocks last year, your portfolio probably lagged the market."", ""But it's not all about blockbuster gains, because some of the Magnificent Seven stocks also pay dividends. I'm going to show you how much you could earn with a $350,000 investment split equally across the seven stocks."", 'The Magnificent Seven companies operate across every major segment of the technology sector. Artificial intelligence (AI) was the largest driver of value in 2023, which is why Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) led the group higher. Its H100 and upcoming H200 data center chips are designed to process AI workloads, and demand continues to surge as more businesses seek to develop AI applications.', ""Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) are some of the world's largest data center operators, and therefore some of Nvidia's biggest customers. They use those centralized data centers to deliver cloud services -- and the computing power necessary to develop AI -- to millions of businesses around the world. Plus, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet offer cloud customers a growing number of large language models (LLMs), which are the building blocks of many AI applications."", 'Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is using AI to show more relevant content to each of its 3.1 billion monthly users. The company also created an LLM of its own called Llama, which is open source, so any developer can use it to build advanced AI applications.', ""Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) created its own LLM in-house, which it's using to develop an AI chatbot similar to ChatGPT. It will pair nicely with the company's latest iPhone 15, because it's fitted with the Apple-designed A17 Pro chip, which is capable of processing AI workloads on-device. This will place AI at the fingertips of billions of people around the world."", ""Finally, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) was the world's leading electric vehicle company by sales up until the end of 2023, when it was edged out by China-based BYD. However, Tesla's future will likely be determined by the success of its AI-powered autonomous self-driving vehicle technology. It's yet to be publicly released, but it has the potential to transform the company's economics."", ""Some companies generate so much profit they can't possibly reinvest it all into their operations to fuel more growth, so they pay some of it to shareholders instead. Dividends are the most common form of distribution, and they usually come as quarterly cash payments."", 'Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia are the only three Magnificent Seven stocks that pay dividends. Each of them less than a 1% yield, which are the payouts investors can expect to receive annually, calculated based on the value of their holdings.', ""Yields often change. If a stock doubles, its yield will halve organically unless the company raises its dividend. It doesn't mean the payout shrinks in dollar terms, but it falls as a percentage of the value of your investment."", 'Microsoft offers the highest yield, and while it seems small at face value, it translates to around $20 billion in dividend payments each year based on its current market capitalization of $2.8 trillion.', ""If you'd invested $350,000 in the Magnificent Seven (split equally with $50,000 invested into each stock) you would earn a dividend yield of 0.37% on $150,000, and no yield on the other $200,000. That translates to an effective yield of 0.18% on the $350,000, or an annual payment of $659.56."", ""It's a paltry sum given the yield investors can earn on cash in a savings account right now, but it's a nice bonus on top of the spectacular capital growth these stocks have delivered over the past year."", ""A dividend isn't the only way companies return money to shareholders. They can also execute stock buyback programs, where they purchase their own shares on the open market. Those shrink the number of available shares in circulation, which leads to a higher price per share."", ""Stock buybacks are preferable to dividends for many companies, because they give them the flexibility to distribute the money at a time of their choosing -- they aren't locked into paying out a specified sum each quarter."", 'Five of the Magnificent Seven companies have active share repurchase programs, worth a combined $186.6 billion over the last 12 months. Tesla and Amazon are the two without active programs.', ""As I touched on at the top, investors who didn't own the Magnificent Seven stocks in 2023 likely underperformed the S&P 500 index. The law of large numbers makes it somewhat counterintuitive to expect these enormous companies to continue delivering the best returns in the entire market, because it gets harder for them to grow their revenue and earnings each year."", ""However, it so happens that the Magnificent Seven companies operate at the forefront of the fastest growing industries in the world. For any investor seeking exposure to technologies like AI, cloud computing, e-commerce, digital advertising, or electric vehicles, it's nearly impossible to look past these stocks."", 'Depending on which Wall Street forecast you rely on, AI alone could add between $7 trillion and $200 trillion to the global economy in the coming decade.

The video conferencing company went public at $36 on April 18, 2019, and its stock soared to its all-time high of $568.34 on Oct. 19, 2020.', ""But today, Zoom's stock trades at $70 -- so a $1,000 investment would have grown to nearly $15,800 before shrinking back to just over $1,900. The bulls initially rushed to Zoom as its growth accelerated throughout the pandemic, but they hastily retreated as it lost momentum in a post-pandemic market and rising rates popped its bubbly valuations."", ""Nevertheless, Zoom's stock has still nearly doubled in just under five years. It's also expanding its platform with new products and services to evolve into a more diversified cloud-based communications company. So, could Zoom keep growing over the next few decades and become the tech sector's next Microsoft?"", ""Zoom's revenue surged 326% in fiscal 2021 (which ended in January 2021) as more people used its video conferencing platform for online classes, remote work, and staying in touch with friends and family throughout the pandemic. Its revenue rose another 55% in fiscal 2022,\xa0even as the lockdowns ended and more people returned to their schools and offices."", ""However, Zoom's revenue grew just 7% in fiscal 2023\xa0as rising rates and other macro headwinds drove companies to rein in their software spending. It expects its revenue to rise a mere 3%\xa0to $4.5 billion in fiscal 2024 as its slower growth in Europe and Asia offsets its stronger growth in North America."", ""From fiscal 2023 to 2026, analysts expect its revenue to increase at a compound annual growth rate\xa0(CAGR) of only 3.5% as it continues to face macro headwinds and intense competition from similar cloud-based video conferencing and collaboration platforms, like Cisco Systems' Webex, Microsoft's Teams, and Alphabet's Google Meet."", 'Based on its current growth trajectory, Zoom doesn\'t look like it will become the ""next Microsoft"" anytime soon. When Microsoft generated $4.65 billion in revenue back in fiscal 1994 (which ended in June 1994), it grew 24%\xa0from the previous year. It subsequently grew its revenue at a CAGR of 14% over the following 29 years.', 'To match that impressive growth rate, Zoom will need to make a few major acquisitions to remain a leader in the global video conferencing market, which Fortune Business Insights estimates could still grow at a CAGR\xa0of 12% from 2023 to 2030.', 'Zoom tried to buy the cloud-based contact center company Five9\xa0for $14.7 billion back in 2021,\xa0but that deal eventually fell apart. Five9 reportedly rejected a second buyout offer from Zoom\xa0in late 2023. Those bids suggest Zoom is desperate to inorganically expand its ecosystem to lock in its customers and widen its moat.', 'The global cloud contact center market could grow at a CAGR of 26% from 2024 to 2029, according to Mordor Intelligence. So, acquiring Five9 could have given Zoom a foothold in a higher-growth market and expanded its reach among enterprise customers. Even if Zoom never buys Five9, it could still acquire smaller players or expand its own Zoom Contact Center -- which is currently used to handle intra-office and customer calls.', 'On its own, Zoom continues to expand its ecosystem with new AI-powered features, like Zoom Scheduler, which schedules meetings with people outside of an organization; Intelligent Director, which uses AI-powered cameras to capture the clearest angles during a video call; and its Zoom Virtual Agent chatbot for customer support services.', ""It's also targeting enterprise customers with its Zoom Phone for audio calls and text messages; Zoom Rooms, which mixes on-site and remote attendees; and Zoom IQ platform for video-based sales team calls. All those services could diversify its business and boost its average revenues per customer."", 'Zoom has also been gradually testing ads to monetize its free users. If it ramps up those efforts, it could generate a new stream of high-margin ad revenues to complement its core stream of subscription-based revenues. It could also bundle its video conferencing and advertising plans for its enterprise customers.', ""With an enterprise value of $15 billion, Zoom is still a tiny company compared to Microsoft, which is worth $2.8 trillion. For Zoom to join Microsoft's weight class in the distant future, it will need to buy more companies, expand with more cloud-based communications tools, and add more enterprise services to its ecosystem.\xa0It might even need to launch its own cloud infrastructure platform to eliminate its dependence on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud and set a firmer bedrock for its own software services."", 'But that\'s all speculation for now. Instead of wondering whether Zoom will ever become ""the next Microsoft,"" investors should see whether it can make some smart acquisitions, accelerate its top-line growth again, and prove it isn\'t just a pandemic-era growth stock.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Zoom Video Communications right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Zoom Video Communications, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Zoom Video Communications wasn't one of them.

If you want to skip our overview of the global coffee industry, an introduction to how coffee companies have evolved over the years, and other recent trends and news, then you can check out 5 Highest Quality Coffee Beans In The World. ', 'When we talk about coffee, it can very well be argued that just like gasoline, the beverage is responsible for a lot of work that takes place in the world. Companies such as Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) are multi-billion dollar enterprises that are capable of selling millions of coffee cups a day. Coffee powers up officer workers during their lunch and break times, making sure that the monotonous working environment of the modern day office does not lead to any productivity drops.', ""Apart from being crucial for productivity, coffee's history also makes it quite important when we talk about social gatherings. Beverages such as coffee and tea are consumed by vast chunks of the global population, a fact that is evident when we consider that in 2021, China, the world's biggest tea producer, produced a whopping 3 million tons of beverage. Insider Monkey also took a look at global tea production in terms of unprocessed tea leaves. This also revealed that China was the world's biggest tea producer as it churned out a cool 13.76 million tons of tea leaves in 2021."", ""Coming back to coffee, there are a lot of coffee stocks that are available for trading on the stock market apart from Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX). Just like they do with high growth sectors such as technology, hedge funds also invest in coffee stocks. Some broader factors that can influence coffee stocks are quite similar to what one would expect from energy stocks. For instance, for commodities such as coffee, weather plays an important role in ensuring global supply chain stability. A destroyed coffee crop creates imbalances in the supply chain and prevents processors' ability to meet the requirements of their customers. Negative weather disruptions drive prices higher, and other factors include political turmoil in major coffee producing countries. Insider Monkey took a look at the forecasted coffee production of countries for the marketing year 2023/2024 as part of our coverage of the Top 20 Coffee Producing Countries in the World to discover that the three top coffee producing countries in the world are Brazil, Vietnam, and Colombia."", ""Shifting to coffee stocks, when it comes to the number of hedge funds out of the 910 that were part of Insider Monkey's database for the third quarter of last year, seven companies saw more than twenty hedge fund investors. Among the 11 Best Coffee Stocks to Invest In, the top three were The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR), Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), and McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), with 41, 60, and 70 hedge fund investors, respectively. Looking at the recent news surrounding the more coffee focused companies in this list such as Restaurant Brands International Inc. (NYSE:QSR), The J.M. Smucker Company (NYSE:SJM), and Starbucks, all three have exhibited a degree of financial stability during the highly inflationary environment that has characterized consumer spending patterns in 2023 and before. Among the trio, J.M. Smucker has beaten analyst EPS estimates in all of its four latest quarters, while the other two have missed estimates only for the fiscal results of Q4 2022."", ""\xa0These firms are responsible for delivering the processed coffee bean to the consumer and they lie downstream in the global coffee supply chain. A coffee bean goes through a long process from the seeds that are planted in countries such as Brazil before it can make it to a bottle of Nestlé S.A. (OTC:NSRGY)'s instant coffee. Coffee beans are roasted after being harvested, with this part in the production process responsible for different blends such as Arabica and Robusta. A coffee's flavor depends on the time that the coffee bean spends being roasted, after which it is ground up and then prepared into a ready made form for daily consumption."", ""As to the outlook of the global coffee industry, it's quite bright when we consider comments made by the management of Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) during a recent earnings call where they shared:"", 'The outstanding financial returns of new stores give us confidence we will reach our goal of 9,000 stores by 2025, opening nearly 1,000 net new stores every year. Finally, the September opening of the China Coffee Innovation Park, designed to be our most energy-efficient and sustainable coffee manufacturing and distribution center in the world, further signaled our commitment to the largest consumer market in the world and the growth of our business in China for China. We look forward to sharing more on the headroom we see in China later today. The momentum against the backdrop of headwinds in China this past year gives us optimism in our position and affirm our distinctive competitive advantages for our business. These advantages include our uplifting partners, including our China leadership team, our distinctive stores, our vertically integrated and highly digitized efficient operations, and our relevant innovation.', ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the best quality coffee beans in the world."", 'A close-up of a freshly roasted coffee bean, accompanied by a vintage aluminum scoop.', 'Our Methodology ', 'To make our list of the highest quality coffee beans in the world, we consulted eight (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8) sources and assigned each coffee bean a score according to its ranking. Then, if a bean did not appear on a list, it was assigned a score of 11, and the scores were averaged. Finally, the top 15 coffee beans with the lowest scores were chosen and ranked accordingly. While the beans were typically classified according to their country of origin, if a particular kind of bean was present in multiple sources, its name was also mentioned - leading to multiple entries from the same country on our list.', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

Coffee beans have been grown in the country for decades now, and like Brazilian coffee, El Salvadoran growers are also known for their bourbon breeds that lend a fruity taste to the beverage.', ""Insider Monkey's Score: 10 "", ""Nicaragua is the largest country in Central America. Coffee has been growing in the country for more than a century now. The primary Nicaraguan coffee bean growing regions are San Marcos, Nueva Segovia, Jinotepe, and Lake Nicaragua. The coffee industry is a crucial sector of Nicaragua's economy, and along with other agricultural products such as food and cotton, accounts for a large portion of the economy."", ""Insider Monkey's Score: 9.5 "", 'Brazil is one of the biggest coffee producing countries in the world. Estimates show that as much as 30% of the total global coffee production comes from Brazil, making Brazilian coffee beans important for the stability of the global coffee industry. Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Espiritos Santos account for most of Brazilian coffee bean production. Due to its scope, Brazil also has a well developed coffee bean processing industry. Thousands of companies sell Brazilian coffee beans, and the industry for instant coffee is much less saturated.', ""Insider Monkey's Score: 9.25"", 'The Ethiopian Harrar is one of the most well known coffee beans in the world. It is a dry processed coffee bean, which is quite flavorful when compared to some other Ethiopian coffee beans. The Harrar is also one of the oldest coffee beans in the world, and the fact that it is dry roasted means that generations of coffee roasters pass down the right skill through time.', ""Insider Monkey's Score: 9 "", 'Panama is a Central American country that is also one of the smallest in the world when it comes to the area. The bulk of Panamanian coffee production is Arabica, and one of the best known Panamanian coffee beans is the Gesha bean. One major reason that Gesha is popular is because it offers drinkers a complete taste palate ranging from flavors such as tea to a more fruity touch.', ""Insider Monkey's Score: 8.875 "", 'Guatemala is another Central American country. Guatemalan coffee beans are typically grown in the Antigua and Atitlan regions of the country. Guatemala also ranks its coffees by the altitude at which the coffee beans are grown, with higher altitude coffee beans thought to be better.', ""Insider Monkey's Score: 8.625"", 'The peaberry coffee bean is different from standard coffee beans due to its flavor and aroma. One of the best coffee beans in the world is the Tanzania Peaberry. The Tasmanian Peaberry coffee bean is grown near Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Meru - providing it with the desired elevation characteristics for a stronger flavor.', ""Insider Monkey's Score: 8.375"", ""Most of the Mexican coffee beans are of the Arabica variety. Mexico's large land border with the U.S. also means that a large portion of its coffee bean exports head to America. Most Mexican coffee beans are produced in four states, and producers also have to contend with disease to keep up their output."", ""Insider Monkey's Score: 7.875 "", 'The Brazilian Bourbon Santos is a special kind of Brazilian coffee bean that is grown in Minas Gerais. This particular coffee bean is known for its chocolatey undertones and low acidity.', ""Insider Monkey's Score: 7.5"", 'Indonesia is one of the few countries in the world whose coffee beans are primarily of the Robusta variety. One feather that the Indonesian coffee industry has in its cap is the kopi luwak coffee bean.

And stock-split stocks could be an excellent way to bet on this positive trend continuing in 2024. Although stock splits don't impact business fundamentals, they can boost investor interest in a company and signify that it is moving in the right direction.

"", 'While food and beverage companies may not attract the hype of traditional growth sectors like technology, Monster Beverage bucks the trend.

Although these products have no caffeine or stimulant ingredients, they share Monster's traditional imagery and flavor profile, helping them appeal to its existing customer base."", 'Alcohol sales grew by an impressive 58% to $42.3 million in the third quarter. While that is still a small fraction of the total $1.86 billion Monster earned in the period, it shows that the drink maker is still capable of successfully launching new products into the market, giving new investors a lot to be optimistic about for the future.', ""While Shopify was hit hard by the bear market in 2022, it hasn't always been an underperformer. Shares of the e-commerce enabler have risen by an impressive 2,750% since hitting public markets in 2015. The company conducted its first stock split in June 2022, giving shareholders a whopping 10 units for each one they previously owned. It isn't too late for investors to bet on Shopify's long-term success as it reworks its business model to maximize margins and profit potential. "", 'Shopify operates a digital platform designed to help small businesses sell their products online by facilitating things like website creation and payments. The e-commerce market faced challenges in the post-pandemic economy as stay-at-home shopping waned, while inflation and rising interest rates hurt consumer purchasing power. Now, macroeconomic conditions are improving. And Shopify has emerged from the crisis more streamlined and focused than before. ', ""Shopify's third-quarter revenue rose 25% year over year to $1.7 billion as more merchants joined the platform. The spinoff of its logistics arm to Flexport in 2023 provided a much-needed boost to gross margins (which rose from 48.5% to 52.6% in the period)."", ""With a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 79, Shopify stock is quite expensive compared to the S&P 500 average of 21. But the premium price tag makes sense considering Shopify's burgeoning profitability. The company generated an operating income of $122 million, up from a loss of $346 million in the prior-year period. And it can quickly justify its valuation as it continues to scale up its business. "", ""While Monster Beverage and Shopify are both great stock split companies poised for success in 2024, they serve different investment strategies.

But the source and scope of these disruptions are different from the meltdown the airline endured a year ago.', 'As of Monday afternoon, the airline had canceled more than 700 flights, about 18% of its schedule, setting off alarm bells that the nightmarish travel weekend could be the start of another operational fiasco for the company.', 'But, according to the airline, this isn’t a technology issue like the 10-day service meltdown that left more than 2 million travelers stranded during the 2022 holiday season and cost the company more than a billion dollars.', 'The problem is the weather. A huge swath of the country has been pummeled with harsh winter conditions this weekend, and more than 140 million people are currently under\xa0wind\xa0chill\xa0alerts stretching from the Rockies to central Texas. Over 140 daily cold records could be broken Monday and Tuesday from Oregon to Mississippi, and temperatures in Memphis, Dallas and Nashville are expected to stay below freezing for at least 72 consecutive hours.', 'Southwest said the delays had been pre-planned and communicated to customers in advance. The scheduling changes were carried out “to anticipate forecasted operating conditions across a wide swath of our route map – everything from wintry precipitation including blizzard conditions, to airfield and airspace constraints, and dangerous wind chill environments that require rotating ground crews to limit exposure,” a spokesperson told CNN in a statement.', 'Cancellations and delays should ease up considerably on Tuesday “as the storm moves East and the cold temperatures begin to moderate,” the spokesperson added. The airline pointed to a list of operational steps that it says it took in 2023 to ensure that the level of disruption that happened in 2022 does not repeat itself, including updates to crew scheduling systems and more de-icing equipment at airports.', 'Unlike the Southwest Airlines holiday travel meltdown of 2022, the company says the recent string of cancellations are mostly due to where Southwest flies in and out of, rather than technical issues, and that unlike the last incident, it should recover quickly.', 'Southwest is a major carrier at some airports that are now engulfed in an Arctic blast paralyzing much of the country. In particular, it maintains a significant presence in Chicago and Denver, which are both under wind chill advisories from the National Weather Service, and Dallas, which the NWS says could face dangerous winter conditions this week.', 'And Southwest isn’t the only airline that has found the icy conditions challenging. American Airlines requested a ground stop at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport earlier Monday morning. “The ground stop from earlier was a temporary effort to alleviate the lines at the de-icing pads and free up space at the gates for inbound aircraft during our busiest arrival bank at DFW,” the airline told CNN.', 'The relentless winter weather caused major delays over the long holiday weekend. Saturday and Sunday saw more than 16,500 flight delays and nearly 3,000 cancellations across the United States, according to FlightAware. On Monday, the number of cancellations climbed past 3,000 while more than 8,600 flights have been postponed, making it the day with the most cancellations since the Southwest meltdown in late 2022, FlightAware data show.', 'The airlines experiencing the most effects are Southwest with more than 760 cancellations followed by United, which has more than 430 flights canceled.', 'So far, more than 700 flights have been canceled on Tuesday, FlightAware data said.', 'These weather-related delays are exacerbating an already difficult week for airlines and their passengers. Last week, more than 200 United and Alaska Airlines flights were canceled each day due to the federally mandated grounding of Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft. The Federal Aviation Administration instated the order after a\xa0piece of the fuselage blew off\xa0an Alaska Airlines flight on January 5 with 177 people on board. The incident left a gaping hole in the side of the plane and ripped headrests off seats as the plane flew at 16,000 feet, shortly after taking off from Portland, Oregon.', 'United and Alaska Airlines, the two largest US carriers using the Max 9 aircraft, are among the airlines canceling the most flights, according to the Anuvu Pulse industry dashboard. United has canceled nearly 13% of its flights, making it the second most affected airline behind Southwest, which doesn’t fly any Max 9 planes. Alaska Airlines experienced the third-highest rate of cancellations on Sunday, having called off about 15% of its total flights.', 'Both airlines said last week they have canceled all flights on their Max 9 planes until mid-January.', 'This story has been updated with new information.', 'CNN’s Ross Levitt, Nouran Salahieh,\xa0Allison Chinchar\xa0and\xa0Mary Gilbert contributed to this reporting.', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

With major constituents moving south, the NYSE ARCA Airline index fell consequently, ending Friday’s session at $62.29, down 4.4%.', 'Of the abovementioned stocks, American Airlines presently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) while the rest currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see\xa0the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.', 'Delta kickstarted the fourth-quarter 2023 earnings season for airlines on Jan 12. The Atlanta-based airline behemoth reported better-than-expected revenues and earnings per share in the December quarter. Strong holiday air travel demand aided results. However, high labor costs resulted in the bottom line shrinking 13.5%.Salaries and related costs rose 23% to $3,769 million. The increase was due to higher wages arising from the contract with pilots that was ratified in March 2023. Another disappointing aspect of the quarterly earnings report was the 24% year-over-year decline in cargo revenue.', 'More than the above disappointments, it was the trimming of the 2024 earnings guidance due to supply-chain woes and economic uncertainty, which spooked investors. Management now expects 2024 adjusted earnings in the range of $6-$7 (projected to be above $7 previously). Supply chain disruptions are leading to high maintenance costs, which increased 13% and 23% in fourth-quarter 2023 and full-year 2023, respectively. Since DAL’s results generally serve as a harbinger of what to expect across the industry, its disappointing guidance and the resultant stock price depreciation caused other airlines to shed value on Friday.', 'DAL’s earnings guidance apart, the northward movement in oil price on Friday was a headwind for airline stocks, leading to their price depreciation. Oil price climbed nearly 1% on Friday to settle at $72.68 a barrel. The airstrikes carried out by the United States and the UK against Houthi targets in Yemen, in response to recent ship attacks in the Red Sea, resulted in an uptick in oil prices.', 'The northward movement in oil prices is not a welcome development for airline stocks. This is because expenses on fuel represent a significant input cost for airlines. Therefore, an increase in fuel costs hurts bottom-line growth.', 'For example, oil price increased in third-quarter 2023, primarily due to the extension of production cut by Saudi Arabia and Russia through 2023-end. At UAL, average fuel price increased 10.3% sequentially in the September quarter. UAL expects the metric to be $3.28 in fourth-quarter 2023. UAL will release its fourth-quarter results on Jan 22.', 'At American Airlines, average fuel price increased 11% sequentially in third-quarter 2023 to $2.91 per gallon. The metric is expected to be in the $3.01-$3.11 band in fourth-quarter 2023. AAL will release its fourth-quarter results on Jan 25.', 'At the Dallas-based Southwest Airlines, economic fuel price per gallon in third-quarter 2023 was $2.78, up 6.9% from second-quarter 2023 levels. LUV forecasts fourth-quarter economic fuel cost per gallon in the $3 to $3.1 band. Like AAL, LUV too will release its fourth-quarter results on Jan 25.', 'Like Delta, labor costs are likely to have been high for other airlines too, in turn hurting bottom-line growth. With U.S. airlines grappling with labor shortage in the post-COVID-19 high-demand scenario, the bargaining power of various labor groups has naturally increased. As a result, we have seen pay-hike deals being inked in the space. This is resulting in a spike in labor costs.', 'For example, in August 2023, American Airlines pilots, represented by Allied Pilots Association, approved a four-year deal pertaining to wage increases. The approval makes AAL’s pilots eligible for an immediate pay raise in excess of 21% on average. Also, the deal includes provisions aimed at improving pilots’ quality of life. In September 2023, United Airlines’ pilot union ratified a $10 billion contract to increase their pay up to 40.2% over the four-year duration of the contract.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Smoke-free products accounted for 36.2% of the company's total revenues in the third quarter of 2023.

These next-generation devices are backed by substantial scientific insights and research. The company expects such advanced and high-quality products to aid adult smokers in switching from traditional cigarettes to smoke-free options.Among other initiatives, Philip Morris became the majority owner of Swedish Match on Nov 11, 2022.

It consolidated these businesses to form the Wellness and Healthcare category on Mar 31, 2022.', ""Philip Morris' ability to leverage robust pricing power has been providing some cushion against soft cigarette shipment volumes. The addictive nature of cigarettes allows the company to pass on higher prices to consumers, supporting revenues. Pricing is likely to remain a driver in the forthcoming periods as well.Incidentally, Philip Morris has been witnessing low cigarette volumes. Cigarette volumes, in general, have been affected by consumers’ rising health consciousness and a shift to low-risk tobacco alternatives. Additionally, the impact of macroeconomic headwinds like inflation on Adult Tobacco Consumers’ disposable income has been affecting cigarette industry volumes. In the third quarter of 2023, Philip Morris’ cigarette shipment volumes dropped 0.5% to 161.1 billion units.Apart from this, high costs are a concern. On its third-quarter earnings call, Philip Morris stated that it expects to make additional growth-oriented investments in 2023, including the commercialization of ILUMA. Though beneficial in the long run, these investments are likely to weigh on margins in the near term.However, strong pricing and transformation toward a smoke-free future pave a solid path for PM’s growth.

And while past performance doesn't necessarily guarantee future results, there are plenty of reasons why this trend could continue, as the Federal Reserve has hinted on cutting rates and ease monetary policy in 2024. "", ""Meanwhile, many dividend stocks are still trading at a sharp discount, making their current yields unusually attractive. Let's explore why shares in two of them, Phillip Morris International (NYSE: PM) and Income Realty (NYSE: O), are good enough to buy and hold forever. "", 'The tobacco industry has long been a favorite of defensive investors because its products tend to stay in demand, no matter what is going on in the wider economy. These companies are also highly profitable and have a culture of returning most of this value to investors in the form of consistently increasing dividend payouts and share buybacks. ', ""Phillip Morris is unique among its peers because of its advanced push into reduced-risk tobacco products like IQOS, a unique product that heats tobacco instead of burning it to release fewer harmful chemicals. Altogether, Phillip Morris's smoke-free products (including vaporizers and oral tobacco) make up 35.4% of net revenue, giving its operations significant diversification away from traditional cigarettes.

', 'Since its founding in 1969, Realty Income has curated a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate tenants under long-term agreements to maximize the reliability of its income streams. While brick-and-mortar businesses have generally come under pressure from e-commerce, Realty Income protects its economic moat by betting on resilient categories like grocery stores, convenience stores, and pharmacies. Recession-proof businesses like Walgreens and Dollar General are its two largest clients. ', 'Realty Income Shares have fallen by around 8% over the last 12 months because of macroeconomic challenges like high interest rates. High rates can be a problem for REITs because they increase the cost of capital needed to grow their businesses and could cause income-hungry investors to avoid their shares in favor of higher-yielding new bond issuances. With that said, this is a temporary headwind. Most economists expect the Federal Reserve to cut rates three times this year. ', ""With an annual dividend yield of 5.2%, it isn't too late to scoop up Realty Income shares while they are still cheap. The company sweetens the deal by conducting its payouts monthly instead of quarterly. "", ""Phillip Morris International and Realty Income are stable, mature companies that probably won't post earth-shattering growth rates any time soon.

The emergence of generative AI created what might have otherwise been a disastrous year. Its emergence also created a situation in which a select few mega cap stocks accounted for an outsized portion of returns. The result was that sectors including communications and Information Technology were extraordinarily strong.', 'On the flip side, sectors including utilities, energy, and defensive stocks performed poorly in 2023. That’s where we’ll be looking at today in an attempt to identify contrarian stocks with strong rebound potential. Without further ado, let’s look into those companies and their stocks.', 'Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com', 'NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is beginning 2024 by showing flashes of breakout potential that promise to lift its stock price higher. On the second and the 4th, share prices jumped upward— which is a strong sign overall.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'My guess is that the market is responding to the notion that 2024 won’t be exactly like 2023 was. What I mean is simple: Utilities firms constituted the worst performing sector in 2023.', 'Investors can point to a lot of factors for the poor performance from the sector. For example, the utilities business is capital intensive and requires heavy investment to create the infrastructure that provides power. With interest rates higher than they’ve been in decades it should be little wonder why utilities then performed so poorly.', 'Additionally, bond yields were historically high which made the dividends that utilities stocks pay, ordinarily lower than the 5% bonds were yielding, comparatively unattractive. Meanwhile, NextEra Energy continued to perform well while growing and operating a fundamentally strong business. I believe investors won’t continue to ignore the company in 2024.', 'Source: Kodda / Shutterstock.com', 'Public Service Enterprise Group (NYSE:PEG) is perhaps a lesser-known utilities stock than NextEra Energy, but one to consider nonetheless.', 'Let’s run some quick numbers just to give you a better idea of what the potential returns look like based on Wall Street’s target prices. Should Public Service Enterprise Group’s shares increase to their average target price, that will equate to 10.4% returns including a $0.57 quarterly dividend. At the high end list price, those returns rise above 17%.', 'Again, it’s reasonable to assume that utilities stocks will move higher in 2024. Bond yields are not as attractive as they were and that makes utilities and their dividends again look attractive. The company is the largest transmission and distribution utility in the state of New Jersey and regulated operations account for more than 90% of earnings at the firm. In other words, the company has a monopoly over its geographic area, making it very stable overall and arguably a wise investment because of that stability.', 'Source: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.com', 'Investors have consistently heard that Pfizer’s (NYSE:PFE) post-pandemic outlook is bleak. That seemed to be the prevailing narrative around the company and its stock all throughout 2023. Share prices fell steadily without much relent until very recently.', 'The reason that investors have been so skeptical is simple: not only is the pandemic over but people are generally more reluctant to get follow-up vaccines as well. The result was that Pfizer warned in mid-December that 2024 revenue could fall.', 'Ironically, that was about the same time that the stock’s free-fall changed course. A lot of that inversion probably has to do with the company’s acquisition of Seagen and its cancer therapies. However, I think it’s more than that. Pfizer has a strong pipeline of drugs scheduled to come out in the next year or so all funded by its pandemic win. I think the market is finally simply allowing itself to be a bit more optimistic about a company that has been a major name in the pharma sector for a long time.', 'Source: viewimage / Shutterstock.com', 'Altria (NYSE:MO) can be classified as a sin stock or a consumer staple, depending upon how you look at it. In either case, it’s a strong choice for investors who are seeking reliable income and who have no compunction about directing their capital towards nicotine and cigarettes.', 'Cigarettes are primarily where Altria continues to make its money. And yes, cigarette smoking continues to decline. In fact, Altria saw cigarette shipment volume decrease by roughly 10% during the third quarter. The company owns Marlboro and overall revenues declined by more than 5% during the period.', 'Marlboro cigarettes account for 42.3% of cigarette market share so Altria is still in a good place even if cigarette smoking continues to decline. The company has a strong cash cow that can subsidize it through its next phase of development. That phase, of course, will be all about developing smokeless tobacco products that will hopefully lead to greater and greater revenues.', 'For those willing to get behind the company there’s a big fat dividend yielding 9.44% at the moment.', 'Source: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com', 'Visa (NYSE:V) is one of the most obvious defensive stock choices available to investors in 2024. It’s no secret that Americans are spending or using their credit cards more than ever and racking up serious debt. In fact, credit card debt is now above $1 trillion which is a record.', 'The American consumer will not be deterred by higher interest rates or the prospect of a recession: spending is King and even if cash is low, credit is readily available and highly utilized. While I remain highly skeptical that the U.S. can\xa0indefinitely indebt itself through credit, Visa is going to win.', 'Consumers continue to use credit to subsidize all kinds of spending that is itself a reflection of pent-up demand from the pandemic. Those consumers were especially keen on travel which is reflected in the rapid increase in cross border payments at Visa. That, in turn, is reflected in revenues that increased by 11% during the most recent quarter and income that increased by 14%.', 'Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.com', 'Chevron (NYSE:CVX) shares continue to trade at a low price that make the stock very much worthwhile as a contrarian pick. Given that the energy sector was especially weak in 2023, investors remain curious to know if 2024 is expected to be any different.', 'The news there is frankly mixed. Many headlines highlight the idea that prices at the pump will continue to fall throughout 2024. That’s obviously good news for consumers who continue to deal with high prices everywhere.', 'While that would seem to suggest that Chevron may have a difficult 2024 there’s a reason to believe that will not be the case.', 'There are two primary factors to consider that have the potential to send Chevron’s price much higher. The Energy Information Administration expects that crude oil prices will rise from $78 in December to $84 by mid 2024. That’s clearly a good sign for Chevron. Beyond that, the EIA also predicts that crude oil and petroleum exports will reach a record high of 2 million barrels per day in 2024.', 'Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com', 'BP (NYSE:BP) is pretty much the antithesis of Chevron as energy companies go. The company is a European energy firm and as a result is much more oriented toward green energy overall. Chevron, on the other hand, is all about taking more and more oil out of the ground.', 'I’d argue that it’s pretty clear that Chevron is winning relative to BP as far as business strategy goes. In fact, BP is currently in quite a bit of trouble as it canceled a joint wind project with Equinor (NYSE:EQNR) off New York.', 'To be clear here, I don’t think BP is doing well at all. However, I do think that there is going to be a buying opportunity moving forward. Share prices will probably continue to fall and BP will likely be forced to implement impairment charges. Those impairment charges will serve as a reminder of the company’s overzealous push to decarbonize that has resulted in poor returns.', 'Again, that doesn’t signal that BP has done well. However, BP shares are probably going to remain lower for some time and there’s going to be an opportunity to pick them up at a discounted price. Hopefully, the company will then signal that exploration and production are the most important facet of its business.

Though casinos immediately come to mind when you hear of the Las Vegas strip, it’s not the only thing that makes the place truly unique. In fact, you don’t even need to gamble to have the time of your life in Vegas, with the rapidly growing number of Las Vegas entertainment options.', 'Therefore, in this piece, we’ll focus on two of the best Vegas entertainment stocks on the Strip and check in with TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to see which (SPHR or WYNN) offers more upside for 2024.', 'The Sphere is a first-of-its-kind type of entertainment venue that’s only available in Las Vegas. The venue boasts the highest-resolution screen on Earth, with its 160,000-pixel by 160,000-pixel screen. You may have seen pictures of the venue from the outside, but it’s what’s on the inside, I believe, that makes the experience well worth the hefty price of admission. Though I’m impressed with the venue, I have to stay neutral until there’s more clarity regarding the long-term growth narrative.', 'The venue, which opened in late 2023, is currently showing U2, and tickets are not cheap. Unless you’re a massive fan of who’s performing or you get lucky on the slot machines, tickets in the Sphere may be unaffordable relative to the other entertainment options on the Vegas strip. Despite this, people aren’t shying away from packing into the 18,000-seat theatre. Indeed, part of the allure of the Sphere is the novelty.', 'That said, only time will tell how the venue holds up relative to rivals in the Vegas scene. Personally, I view the Sphere and its game-changing technologies as essentially reinventing the live event experience. Reportedly, the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) has booked the venue for a future bout. It’s a big deal that could test what the futuristic venue is capable of.', 'It’s not just hosting events that make Sphere an intriguing play. The outside of the Sphere acts as a super-sized billboard capable of pulling in the big bucks. Reportedly, firms can rent out an ad on the outside of the Sphere in the ballpark of $450,000 per day.', 'For now, it seems a tad too early in the game to be loading up on the stock just because of how impressive it looks, outside or inside. The Sphere hopes to grow beyond Las Vegas. However, given how incredibly bright (and perhaps distracting) the venue’s exterior can be, I think it will be a challenge to grow into new markets following the recent mayoral blocking of Sphere’s bid to expand into the London market.', 'Indeed, Sphere seems like something that only Vegas can make possible at this juncture. As good as this is for Vegas, I view it as a potential roadblock standing in front of the firm’s long-term growth story. For this reason, I’m hesitant to pound the table on the stock this early in the game.', 'Sphere Entertainment stock is a Moderate Buy, according to analysts, with two Buys and three Holds assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average SPHR stock price target\xa0of $35.00 implies 11.6% upside potential.', 'If you’re looking for luxury in the Vegas hotel and a gaming experience, it’s hard to top Wynn Resorts, the firm behind the signature Wynn Resort and its Encore companion. Of course, Wynn also has significant exposure to Macau, which isn’t doing well amid China’s horrid slowdown. Still, I view ongoing strength in Vegas as a potential needle-mover for shares. As a premium player in the resort scene, I’m staying bullish on the stock for 2024.', 'WYNN stock has been a dud over the past five and 10 years, down 14% and 47%, respectively. The cyclical nature of Vegas travel has come into play. However, as the macro environment heals over time, I think Wynn, perhaps the best resort play in Vegas (and Macau), is worth a sizeable bet.', 'Deutsche Bank’s (NYSE:DB) Carlo Santarelli recently praised Wynn Resorts as one of the top gaming stocks for the year, citing sales expansion as one potential share price driver. Santarelli has a $124 price target on the stock, entailing more than 31% upside for the year ahead.', 'Wynn stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with nine Buys and three Holds assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average WYNN stock price target\xa0of $112.14 implies 19.2% upside potential.', 'From hockey games at the T-Mobile arena to the jaw-dropping venue over at the MSG Sphere, there’s no shortage of spectacles to draw in massive numbers of travelers to the timeless Vegas Strip. Sphere and Wynn are standout entertainment options that I view as intriguing plays for 2024. Nonetheless, at this juncture, analysts expect more upside (19.2%) from WYNN stock.', 'Disclosure']"

In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.', 'Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.', 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Zoetis currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.31%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on February 13, 2024."", ""When the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss."", 'Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.', ""Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. The fourth quarter marked a solid close to a year in which we supported our clients in navigating through a challenging operating environment with geopolitical tensions, macroeconomic uncertainty and evolving monetary policy. We started to show some early evidence that we can deliver higher financial performance in the near and medium term. We clarified our strategic priorities and we laid the foundation for a multi-year transformation of our company for the long-term. With a clearer focus on our direction of travel and having restored some confidence in our ability to deliver on our plans, today we are publishing financial targets for each of our business segments and the firm overall.', ""Dermot will review our fourth quarter financials, the outlook for 2024, and our medium-term financial targets in more detail. But let me first briefly address our performance in 2023. Referring to Page 2 of the financial highlights presentation. Our results for the year not only highlight BNY Mellon's characteristic resilience, but they demonstrate the strength of our execution when we are appropriately organized and focused. On a reported basis, 2023, earnings per share increased by 38% year-over-year. On a core basis, excluding notable items, EPS of $5.05 increased by 10% year-over-year. Both pre-tax margin and return on tangible common equity improved on the back of significant operating leverage. Excluding notable items, we generated approximately 180 basis points of positive operating leverage."", 'ROTCE improved 0.5 percentage point to 21.6%, and pre-tax margin improved roughly 80 basis points to 30%. Moving on to Page 3. At the beginning of last year, we communicated three financial goals for 2023. First, we expected to generate approximately 20% net interest revenue growth year-over-year. We delivered 24%. Second, we set out to half our constant-currency expense growth rate in 2022 to approximately 4% year-over-year expense growth, excluding notable items in 2023. We delivered 2.7%. And third, we sought to return north of 100% of 2023 earnings to common shareholders through dividends and buybacks. We delivered 123%. Over the course of 2023, we returned $3.9 billion of capital to common shareholders, all while having further strengthened our regulatory capital ratios to be well-positioned for a wide range of macroeconomic and regulatory outcomes.', ""So we are still at the beginning of our transformation journey. Our ability this past year, not just to deliver on our commitments but to exceed them gives us confidence that we can effect meaningful change and consistently improve our financial performance over time. While mindful, there is a lot more work ahead of us. I'm proud of the effort that our people put in over the last 12 months as we embraced a focus on commerciality, accountability and efficiency, which drove these results. We are committed to improving the firm's financial performance in the near, medium and long term, and we have framed this work for our people with three strategic pillars, which we describe on Page 4. Last year we introduced these three pillars to get at the heart of how we operate and who we are day-to-day for our clients, managing their money, moving it and keeping it safe."", ""Pillar number one, be more for our clients; number two, run our company better; and number three, power our culture. They are deliberately simple and our people are rallying around them. As I've said before, strategy is important, but ultimately just a set of words. Actually doing it and how we do it matters a lot. I'm encouraged by the progress we made in 2023, some of which we highlight on Slide 5. Our global clients across government's pension funds, mutual funds, unions, endowments, corporations, financial services firms, and individuals, both trust and want to do more business with us. And our analysis clearly shows that is more for them to do with us as we continue to partner alongside them to help achieve their ambitions. As the global financial system grows and becomes ever more complex, demand for a trusted resilient partner with the scale to service clients across the entire financial life-cycle, such as BNY Mellon, grows as well."", ""In 2023, we launched several new solutions that allow us to deepen our relationships with existing clients and to open the door to new ones. Of course, that includes the launch of Wove, Pershing's wealth advisory platform, as well as the rollout of our buy-side trading solutions offering, but it goes far beyond these more visible product launches. All of our businesses are bringing new client solutions to the market, Bankify, real-time payments on FedNow, white labeling Liquidity Direct, bond-wise intraday repo settlement, BNY Mellon Advisors are all examples. And in 2023, we filed more patent applications than ever before. At the same time, we have an opportunity to bring more of BNY Mellon to clients who currently use us for just a single service."", 'Last year, we hired our first Chief Commercial Officer as we began to operationalize our one BNY Mellon initiative across the organization. As part of enhancing the organizational setup and focus of our client coverage organization, we created an integrated team to facilitate multi-line of business solutions at scale, and we also formed a coverage practice group to implement consistency and approach and tooling. Next, while 2023 was a foundational year and what will be a multi-year journey to transform to a more streamlined and effective operating model, we took important steps toward running our company better to improve efficiency, reduce bureaucracy, and be more intentional with how we spend so our investments in the business go further.', ""We generated nearly double the amount of efficiency savings versus the prior year, which allowed us to self-fund over $0.5 billion of incremental investments, and we laid the foundation needed to transition to a platform's operating model, including successful pilots in two areas of the organization, which were important proof points as we start to unlock the power of our platforms in several phases over the next couple of years. While we focus on being more for our clients and running our company better, we know none of it can happen without our people, which is why we are powering our culture to make BNY Mellon a place where people are proud to work and excited to grow their careers. We elevated recruitment and retention programs, including welcoming the largest class of campus analysts in BNY Mellon's history, a class double the size of the previous year and we're going to double it again this year."", ""We launched our BK shares program to grant shares to the 45,000 employees who didn't previously receive stock as part of their compensation to cascade a sense of ownership and accountability across our company. And we rolled out enhanced employee benefits recognizing value in fostering both a human and high-performing work environment. I'll wrap up where I began. We remain confident in the strength of our culture, our strategy and our ability to execute to help us unlock value for our clients, our shareholders, and our people. 2023 was an important year in which we assembled more of the team that can deliver on what is needed and we got ourselves pointed in the right direction for what we need to achieve, but it was also a year where being humble and resilient mattered."", ""While we have a lot of work ahead of us, what started as a theory and a belief now has early proof points, and we can see the possibility of what we can achieve. We have an ambitious agenda as we move forward, but I continue to be optimistic about the opportunity ahead. With that, I'll turn it over to Dermot."", ""Dermot McDonogh: Thank you, Robin, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm picking up on Page 6 of the presentation with our consolidated financials for the fourth quarter, and as Robin noted, I'm also going to speak to our 2024 outlook and medium-term targets, including how we are going to execute on our goals. For the fourth quarter, our reported results reflect several notable items. Approximately $750 million of non-interest expense is related to the FDIC special assessment severance and litigation reserves. And we had $150 million reduction in investment and other revenue, primarily related to a fair-value adjustment of a contingent consideration receivable. Total revenue of $4.3 billion was up 10% year-over-year, or up 2% excluding notable items."", 'Total fee revenue was flat, reflecting 3% growth in investment services fees, which was offset by a 5% decline in investment management and performance fees, and 25% decline in foreign-exchange revenue. Investment and other revenue was a negative $4 million in the quarter, reflecting the fair-value adjustments as I mentioned before. Net interest revenue was up 4% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher interest rates, partially offset by changes in balance sheet size and mix. Expenses were up 20% year-over-year on a reported basis, primarily reflecting the FDIC special assessment. Excluding notable items, expenses were up 4%, reflecting higher investments and the impact of a weaker dollar, as well as inflation, partially offset by efficiency savings.', 'Provision for credit losses was $84 million, primarily driven by reserve builds for commercial real-estate exposure. Reported earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $0.33. Pre-tax margin was 8% and return on tangible common equity was 6%. Excluding notable items, earnings per share were $1.28, pre-tax margin was 28%, and return on tangible common equity was 21%. Turning to capital and liquidity on Page 7. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio of 6% remained largely unchanged, down 8 basis points to be precise compared to the prior quarter. Tier 1 capital remained essentially flat at $23.1 billion as the impacts of capital distributions to common shareholders and our redemption of $500 million preferred stock were offset by an improvement in AOCI and capital generated through earnings.', 'Average assets increased by 1% sequentially, primarily reflecting deposit inflows in the fourth quarter. Our CET1 ratio was 11.6% which represents a 20 basis points improvement compared with the prior quarter. CET1 capital was up 3% sequentially, primarily reflecting capital generated through earnings and the improvement in AOCI, partially offset by the impact of capital distributions to common shareholders. Risk-weighted assets increased by 1%. Consistent with the prior quarter, we returned $450 million of capital to our common shareholders through share repurchases, and we paid approximately $330 million of common stock dividends in the fourth quarter. The consolidated liquidity coverage ratio was 117%, a 4 percentage points sequential decrease, primarily reflecting deposit inflows in the quarter, which are considered non-operational until they are seasoned under our operational deposit model, and our consolidated net stable funding ratio remained roughly unchanged at 135%.', ""Next, on Page 8, net interest revenue and additional details on the underlying balance sheet trends. Net interest revenue was $1.1 billion. It was up 4% year-over-year and up 8% quarter-over-quarter. The sequential increase was primarily driven by balance sheet growth and changes in balance sheet mix. Total deposits averaged $273 billion in the fourth quarter, up 4% sequentially, a strong finish to the year. Interest-bearing deposits were up 5%, and non-interest-bearing deposits remained flat. Interestingly, since August, we've seen four consecutive months of growth in average total deposit balances. Our team is highly engaged with our clients and we're encouraged by the demand we've been seeing for our on-balance sheet liquidity solutions, and we are pleased with the stabilization."", 'We remain vigilant, preparing for a variety of different outcomes and financial conditions in 2024. On the asset side, average interest-earning assets increased by 2% quarter-over-quarter. This includes cash and reverse repo up 5%, and loan balances up 3%. The size of our investment securities portfolio decreased by 3% sequentially. Moving to our business segments starting with Securities Services on Page 9. Securities Services reported a total revenue of $2.2 billion, flat year-over-year. Investment services fees were up 1% year-over-year. In asset servicing, investment services fees were flat as the positive impact of higher market levels, net new business, and a weaker dollar was offset by lower client activity. We ended the year on a high note, with our strongest sales quarter of 2023, including wins in the Middle East, new mandates from several mid-sized investment managers, and expanded mandates from some of our largest existing clients.', 'And we saw continued strength in our ETF servicing business with another quarter of strong net inflows capped a year of above-market growth. Within Issuer Services, investment services fees were up 5%, reflecting healthy new business and higher client activity. Foreign exchange revenue was down 21% year-over-year on the back of lower volatility and lower volumes. And net interest revenue was down 3% year-over-year. Expenses of $1.7 billion were up 5% year-over-year, reflecting higher investments and higher revenue-related expenses, as well as inflation, partially offset by efficiency savings. Pre-tax income was approximately $460 million, representing a 21% pre-tax margin. Next, Market and Wealth Services on Page 10. This segment reported a total revenue of $1.5 billion, up 7% year-over-year.', 'Total investment services fees were up 6% year-over-year. In Pershing investment services fees were up 1%, reflecting higher equity market values and higher client activity, partially offset by the impact of expected lost business. Net-new assets were negative $4 billion for the quarter, also reflecting this expected loss business. In Treasury Services, investment services fees increased by 5%, primarily reflecting higher client activity, partially offset by higher earnings credits for non-interest-bearing deposit balances. In Clearance and Collateral Management, investment services fees were up 16%, reflecting broad-based strength across Clearance and Collateral Management, both in the US and internationally. Net interest revenue increased by 10% year-over-year.', 'Expenses of approximately $840 million were up 7% year-over-year, reflecting higher investments and inflation, partially offset by efficiency savings. Pre-tax income was approximately $630 million, representing a 42% pre-tax margin. Turning to Investment and Wealth Management on Page 11. Investment and Wealth Management reported total revenue of $676 million, down 18% year-over-year. In investment management, revenue was down 26%, reflecting the fair-value adjustment of the receivable and the impact of the prior year divestiture, as well as the mix of AUM flows, partially offset by higher market values, seed capital gains and the weaker dollar. In our wealth management business, revenue decreased by 3%, driven by changes in product mix, partially offset by higher market values.', 'Expenses of approximately $680 million were down 2% year-over-year, primarily reflecting efficiency savings and the impact of the divestiture in 2022, partially offset by higher investments, inflation and the unfavorable impact of the weaker dollar. Pre-tax income was a loss of $5 million. Excluding the impact of notable items, pre-tax income of $151 million increased 1% year-over-year and represents an 18% pre-tax margin. Assets under management of $2 trillion increased by 8% year-over-year, reflecting higher market values and the weaker dollar, partially offset by cumulative net outflows. In the quarter, we saw $7 billion of net inflows into short-term strategies and $4 billion of net inflows into long-term active strategies, while we saw $10 billion of net outflows from index strategies.', ""Wealth management client assets of $312 billion increased by 16% year-over-year, reflecting higher equity market values and cumulative net inflows. Page 12 shows the results of the other segments. Total revenue improved year-over-year, primarily reflecting the absence of a net loss from repositioning the securities portfolio recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022, and expenses of $693 million included $505 million related to the FDIC special assessment. Having reviewed our results, I will now turn to Page 14, and our current outlook for 2024. We're entering the year on a strong footing and we set ourselves up determined to at least break even from an operating leverage perspective. Considering our healthy pipeline across the businesses, we expect fee revenue growth to turn positive in 2024."", ""With regards to net interest revenue, our expectation for an approximately 10% decrease year-over-year is based on the assumption of market-implied forward interest rates and we assume ongoing quantitative tightening puts further downward pressure on deposit balances. We intend to keep expenses excluding notable items, roughly flat in 2024. And finally, with regard to capital management, we expect to return north of 100% of 2024 earnings to common shareholders through dividends and buybacks. As Robin discussed earlier, 2023 was a foundational year for us. We took decisive actions to demonstrate some early evidence of our ability to deliver stronger financial performance, and importantly, we've developed a clear roadmap for our multi-year transformation."", ""Over the next couple of slides, we'll provide you our medium-term financial targets for the firm and some of the most impactful actions we're taking to keep delivering on our goals. Page 15 summarizes our consolidated targets. It is our goal to improve the firm's pre-tax margin to 33% and our ROTCE to 23% over the medium-term, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. I'll double-click on our business segments in a moment, but along our three strategic pillars, there are a number of teams that transcend our lines of business and segments. Robin mentioned several updates when he talks about our progress in 2023, so I'll highlight just a few with them. The first is our enhanced commercial model. We're driving a new culture of commerciality to deliver all of BNY Mellon in a unified front to facilitate deeper client relationships with solutions from across the firm."", ""With our clients at the center, our module is led by client coverage teams with clear accountability to retain business, expand revenue into new areas and drive client satisfaction. Our new sales operations and enablement organization, the client coverage practice, will make it easier for our clients to do more business with BNY Mellon and create consistent commercial roles, tools and support internally for an enhanced and more efficient sales experience. And what we call integrated solutions represents a new more focused approach to assembling components from multiple client platforms into a piece will go-to-market capabilities that span across our lines of business, driving better value for our clients and higher profitable growth. The second one I'd like to highlight is our transition to a platform's operating model."", ""By grouping similar activities together into logical platforms and uniting related capabilities, we are enabling the streamlining of internal processes to drive higher efficiency and further enhance resiliency and risk management. Our model is based on two types of platforms. Client platforms will own the delivery of a commercial solution to our external clients, while enterprise platforms will own the delivery of internal services. Over the past few months, we've developed a detailed implementation approach and our transition into this new model will be gradual and deliberate, starting with the first implementation wave this spring. And the third is our culture. People come to BNY Mellon to make an impact on global financial markets. While we focus on driving growth and running our company better, none of it can happen without our people."", ""That's why we're making meaningful investments, including in enhanced learning, development and feedback to foster exciting careers. Moving to our segments, starting with Securities Services on Page 16. Here, we are reiterating our existing 30% pre-tax margin target. Over the past 24 months, we've improved the margin from 21% in 2021 to 25% in 2023. We are pleased with the performance of the business over the past two years, but we appreciate that the path from 25% to 30% will be the harder yards. First of all, we are firmly focused on driving down the cost-to-serve. We have and we continue to make significant investments in uplifting several platforms that support core services, including fund accounting, tax services, corporate actions and loan administration."", ""Additionally, we continue going after inefficient processes. Over the past couple of years, we cataloged all of these processes and we've made some good progress in our digitization efforts, but there is more work to do. We're also taking a more strategic approach to deepening client relationships going forward. Using enhanced tools to better understand client behavior, quality of service, economics and revenue opportunities, we are expanding wallet share and improving client profitability. Last but not least, we're pursuing several opportunities to drive an acceleration of underlying growth. On the back of our investments over the years, we have become a premier provider of ETF servicing globally, and we expect to maintain our strong momentum through continued innovation."", ""Similarly, in private markets, another one of the fastest-growing market segments, we've established a strong market position with more room to expand our capability set. Moving on to Market and Wealth Services on Page 17. As you can see on the left side of the page, this segment has a good track record of solid growth and attractive margins. Our focus here is to accelerate growth through deliberate investments without compromising profitability. I'll start with Pershing, our company's second-largest line of business. As the number-one clearing firm for broker-dealers and a top three RIA custodian, Pershing benefits from a strong position in one of the fastest-growing segments in financial services, i.e., the US wealth market. Notwithstanding near-term headwinds from the events of 2023, we are confident that our investments in the core platforms and client experience will drive further market-share gains in the attractive market segments after growing $1 billion-plus RIAs and hybrid broker-dealers."", ""And our Wove platform continues to gain momentum. As we're capturing business from existing clients and new opportunities to deliver the platform, data and investment solutions, we're currently projecting $30 million to $40 million of incremental revenue from Wove in 2024. In Treasury Services, we're benefiting from a strong position with financial institutions and we're one of the top-five US dollar payment clearers in the world. Leveraging the strong position, we are selectively expanding our reach by targeting new client geographic and product segments. For example, we've been adding bankers to drive growth with e-commerce and NBFI clients and the completion of a multi-year uplift of our payments platform is expected to drive an increase to our swift market share through growth in several geographies."", ""Additionally, by joining forces with our markets business, which provides FX solutions in over 100 currencies, Treasury Services will enhance the FX capabilities that it can provide its clients. Rounding out the segment, Clearance and Collateral Management. As the primary provider assessment for all US government securities trades and the largest global collateral manager in the world, we have a special role in financial markets and we're taking this role very seriously. No doubt, this business grows as markets grow, but we're not resting on our position. Our Clearance and Collateral Management business is one of the most innovative in the company. And so we're confident that this business can maintain its healthy growth trajectory by continuously launching new flexible collateral management solutions that position our clients to meet their growing liquidity needs and by continuing to increase collateral mobility and optimization across global client venues."", ""Next, Investment and Wealth Management on Page 18. Investment and Wealth Management reported a pre-tax margin of 12% for the full year 2023, or 17% excluding notable items. Our plan is to improve the segment margin to 25% or higher over the medium term on the back of a combination of growth and efficiency initiatives. First, we're unlocking BNY Mellon's distribution power for the benefit of our investment firms and our clients. Most importantly, we're in the process of creating a firmwide distribution platform that combines enhanced products with offerings from select third-party managers to provide best-in-class solutions. Additionally, we're making enhancements to how we're offering Dreyfus Cash products across our enterprise-wide open architecture liquidity ecosystem to improve visibility and enhance platform share."", ""Second, we're expanding our products and solutions with a focus on scaling our investment capabilities across Investment Management, Wealth Management and Pershing. And heard, we're driving efficiency and scale by realizing the benefits as multi-year infrastructure investment programs are nearing completion, and by better leveraging the enterprise to transform fragmented and sub-scale support activities into scaled enterprise platforms. Moving onto our capital management philosophy on Page 19. BNY Mellon benefits from a capital-light business model that allows us to drive organic growth while typically returning nearly 100% of earnings to our common shareholders over time. Over the past 10 years, the firm grew dividends per share at an 11% CAGR and returned almost 100% of earnings to shareholders through a combination of dividends and buybacks."", ""Our philosophy for capital deployment and capital distribution remains unchanged. We've entered the year with strong capital ratios at or above our management target of approximately 5.5% to 6% Tier 1 leverage and approximately 11% CET1. And assuming interest rates follow marks implied forwards, we expect to generate additional excess capital from the unrealized loss related to AFS securities pulling to par over time. Wrapping up on Page 20. Over the past year, we conducted thorough strategic reviews, we developed detailed business and financial plans, and we've taken the first steps on what would be a multi-year transformation of our company. Our business plans drive as achieving what we laid out across our three strategic pillars, be more for our clients, run our company better and power our culture."", ""And our financial plans aim to improve the firm's pre-tax margin to 33% and our ROTCE to 23% over the medium-term, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. In publishing our medium-term financial targets together with our most important strategic priorities and the actions that will help us achieve them, we are providing transparency to allow you all to track our progress, and we are confident that we will deliver. We are excited about the work ahead of us and today is an important milestone for our team. Now for those of you who are still with us, we promise to let you start your long weekend soon. With that, operator, can you please open the line?"", 'See also Billionaire Steve Cohen Aggressively Bought These 12 Stocks Recently and 30 Cheapest Places Across America Where You Will Want to Retire.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Meaning, you will need to purchase Bank of New York Mellon's shares before the 19th of January to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 2nd of February."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.42 per share.

This represents a -0.2% change in EPS on a 1.04% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $5.69 per share on $18.23 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 12.97% and 3.08%, respectively.', 'Valuation Metrics', 'The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.', 'On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.', ""The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are C and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B."", ""In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 10.9X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 10.6X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 9.9X versus its peer group's average of 7.9X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.2. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective."", 'Zacks Rank', ""We also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts."", 'Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

As a result, it could detach from the tensioner backing plate, causing the oil pump drive belt material to degrade and lose teeth. If the pump stops spinning, there will be a loss of oil pressure in the engine, causing major damage. If the engine seizes, the car will lose its power-operated brakes.', 'The owners of the impacted vehicle will be notified by mail in February 2024.

In 2024, I expect AI to continue to be a top trend that gets investors excited. However, the so-called metaverse could return to glory as competition in the headset market kicks into high gear. That being said, 5G stocks are showing the potential to be savvy investments.', 'As new tech trends dominate the headlines, older ones stand to be overlooked by investors who just have to be in on the hottest trends. 5G may not have as much explosive growth potential as the latest AI-driven innovations. However, I do think it’s a mistake to dismiss the 5G opportunity. Remember, other technological trends pave the way for higher data consumption over the coming years.

Shares are at new all-time highs of $163 and change. I view the top performer as a top pick to play 5G in the new year.', 'Moving into 2024, I expect more outperformance for T-Mobile as it continues to capitalize on the long-term 5G opportunity.

It’s hard not to share Barden’s enthusiasm.

If you wish to skip our analysis of MLPs, you can click to skip ahead and jump to the 5 Best MLP and Pipeline Stocks To Buy.', 'The United States boasts an extensive network of over 2.6 million miles of pipelines, responsible for the secure transportation of trillions of cubic feet of natural gas to power plants, industrial facilities, residences, and businesses. Additionally, these pipelines facilitate the delivery of billions of gallons of liquid fuels to refineries, terminals, and refueling stations, playing a crucial role in sustaining the fuel supply for the economy. Oil and gas producers utilize pipelines to transport their production from wells to refineries and market centers, while utilities leverage pipelines to convey natural gas to power plants and distribute it to consumers.', 'Some companies in the pipeline sector have opted for a unique MLP (Master Limited Partnership) structure for tax purposes. These MLPs often distribute a significant portion of their cash flows to investors, making them particularly attractive to income-oriented investors. The MLP structure has its roots dating back to 1981 when oil and gas producer Apache Petroleum Corporation (APA) introduced investors to the tax advantages of a partnership combined with the liquidity of publicly traded securities such as stocks and bonds. The success of this model prompted numerous companies across various industries to adopt and replicate it. However, in response to the growing popularity of MLPs, Congress decided to impose limitations on these businesses through the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and the Revenue Act of 1987. These legislative measures stipulated that an MLP must derive at least 90% of its gross income from qualifying sources to be eligible for the tax benefits associated with a pass-through entity. While MLPs can potentially offer higher returns, they have historically exhibited greater volatility compared to stocks and bonds. Additionally, MLPs can be sensitive to changes in interest rates, adding an additional layer of risk for investors.', 'In 2023, Master Limited Partnerships and the broader midstream sector stood out positively within the energy landscape, posting total returns of 23.8% and 14.0%, respectively. This data is based on the Alerian MLP Infrastructure Index (AMZI) and the Alerian Midstream Energy Index (AMNA). While the overall energy sector benchmark ended the year slightly negative in terms of total returns, defensive business characteristics and generous shareholder returns contributed to the strong performance of MLPs and midstream.', 'Looking ahead to 2024, it remains challenging to pinpoint compelling factors that could drive significant upside for oil and gas prices. OPEC+, particularly Saudi Arabia and Russia, seems committed to maintaining a price floor for oil. However, challenges may arise from any demand weakness and additional supply from countries like the U.S. and Guyana. Potential boosts to oil prices could come from a resurgence in the global economy or supply disruptions due to geopolitical events, such as issues in Red Sea shipping. Nonetheless, from a fundamental perspective, the oil market appears to be adequately supplied. If oil and gas prices remain subdued, midstream and MLPs could once again emerge as the positive aspect within the energy sector in 2024, akin to their performance in 2023.

It joins a handful of other North American freighter operators that have recently changed direction on new aircraft investments or disposed of existing aircraft in response to weak market conditions.', '“Forecasts continue to indicate that the international air cargo market will remain soft in the short to medium term and deploying B-777s into the market would not be strategically prudent. We have decided to exit our commitments for the four remaining B-777 aircraft, while continuing to flex our B767 fleet to accommodate our organic growth strategy,” said Executive Chairman Ajay Virmani, in the announcement.', 'The move translates to a slight pullback in Cargojet’s international business, which consists of long-term contracts providing outsourced aircraft, crews and maintenance, as well as short-term charters, to focus on the domestic overnight network as large customers require less frequent transport with subdued trade.', 'Cargojet was the launch customer for aerospace startup Mammoth Freighters, which has a contract to provide four Boeing 777-200 aircraft and modify them to carry containers on the main deck.

DHL separately placed an order with Mammoth last spring for the conversion of nine 777-200s.', 'Cargojet last year exited commitments with Israel Aerospace Industries for the conversion of four 777-300 aircraft, which were aimed at international opportunities outside DHL. It subsequently sold three planes for $110 million and dropped plans for acquiring the fourth jetliner. Cargojet says it is retaining the rights to production slots for aircraft modifications at both companies in case market conditions improve enough to justify future investments.', 'In November, Cargojet said it planned to sell or lease four B757 cargo jets, after recently spending millions of dollars for passenger-to-freighter retrofits, because there wasn’t enough business to operate them economically in its domestic network.', 'Passenger-to-freighter conversions are complex engineering projects that include removing furnishings from the passenger cabin and installing a cargo door, rigid cargo barrier in front of the cockpit, reinforced floor and sidewalls, and a container handling system.', 'Cargojet in 2022 budgeted $1.2 billion for the 777 program.

The airline flew 8.8% fewer hours during the period versus last year.', 'Starting in April 2022, the airfreight market contracted for 16 consecutive months as global supply chains stabilized from the Covid crisis, resulting in much less need for urgent air shipments. Air volumes fell 8.2% year over year in 2022 and are expected to be down another 4% to 5% for 2023, once results are tabulated, after a late rally. The downturn in demand coincided with a sharp increase in capacity as passenger airlines resumed international flying to more destinations, sending yields down more than 30%.', 'A growing number of freighter operators have responded by cutting capital expenditures to bolster cash flow. Miami-based Amerijet, squeezed by debt and sharply lower revenues, last week announced it will return six new Boeing 757 converted freighters to lessors. Air Canada in September canceled an order with Boeing for two 777 production freighters.

The company said on Dec. 21 that global sales fell 1% through late November and were up just 1% in the past six months."", ""That lackluster result was driven by weakness in the core U.S. market, too, as footwear demand declined 5% in North America compared to a 2% drop in the prior quarter. Things will get worse before they get better, according to management, which is calling for a softer second half of the year. As a result, most Wall Street pros are looking for sales to rise by just 1% for the full fiscal 2024 year following last year's 10% increase."", ""The good news is that Nike is in a stellar financial position that's only due to get better as the year progresses. That's partly because company has been cutting inventory levels for more than a year, including a 14% drop this past quarter."", 'These cuts, plus a steady flow of innovative footwear releases, have helped push profit margins higher in fiscal 2024.

You can own shares for about 3 times annual sales, which is near the lowest valuation investors have seen in several years. Lululemon Athletica, which is admittedly growing much faster and generating higher profits, is valued at closer to 7 times sales."", ""Investors shouldn't expect Nike to close that valuation gap until the company can move toward Lululemon's 22% profit margin. Cost cuts will only help Nike a bit in that regard.

The overall lending scenario was weak in the quarter amid the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, while the demand for commercial and industrial loans (which constitute a large part of Zions’ loan portfolio) was decent in October and December, it declined in November.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for ZION’s average interest-earning assets for the fourth quarter of $80.3 billion indicates a decline of 2.1% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for the metric is $79.9 billion, indicating a year-over-year decline of 2.5%.Though the Federal Reserve did not raise rates in the quarter, the policy rate stands at a 22-year high of 5.25-5.5% at present. This is likely to have provided some support to ZION’s net interest income (NII) and net interest margin (NIM).However, because of the inversion of the yield curve in the December-ended quarter, a slowdown in deposit growth, rising funding costs and weak loan growth, NII and NIM are expected to have been negatively impacted.The consensus estimate for NII is pegged at $575 million, indicating a 20.1% year-over-year decline. Our estimate for the metric is $562.1 million, suggesting a decline of 21.9%.', 'Fee Revenues: The consensus estimate for commercial account fees of $43.9 million suggests a year-over-year rise of 7.1%. Our estimate for the metric is $45.5 million.The consensus estimate for dividends and other income of $12.2 million indicates a rise of 35.6% from the previous-year quarter. Our estimate for the metric is $12.9 million.The consensus estimate for retail and business banking fees is pegged at $17.3 million, suggesting an 8.4% year-over-year rise. We project the metric to be $17.6 million.Subdued volatility across markets and products is likely to have hurt Zions’ capital markets and foreign exchange fees. The consensus estimate for the same is $19.9 million, suggesting a fall of 9.7% from the prior-year quarter.

PayPal's rapidly growing payment processing brand, Braintree, represents one of those revenue growth opportunities, either by raising prices, as the Company had previously used a low-price strategy to establish a beachhead in this market, or by adding value-added services. PayPal's branded checkout remains the largest volume and profit driver for the business, and we expect this to continue to track in-line with e-commerce growth in the near term, and eventually take share as the Company rolls out new features to its over +400 million users and +30 million merchants.

Entire industries will reorient around it. Businesses will distinguish themselves by how well they use it.', 'And Gates is not a lone voice in the wilderness. For instance, futurist and inventor Ray Kurzweil respectfully dissented when asked to sign an open letter calling for a pause in high-powered AI research. ""There are tremendous benefits to advancing AI in critical fields such as medicine and health, education, pursuit of renewable energy sources to replace fossil fuels, and scores of other fields,"" Kurzweil wrote.', 'The renowned scientist, serving as Alphabet\'s director of engineering since 2012, saw this revolution coming decades ago. Kurzweil used to believe that affordable household-level computers would eclipse human brain power around the year 2020. That deadline has moved to 2045 or thereabouts, but ""humanity 2.0"" is still coming. You can\'t stop progress -- you can only hope to contain it.', 'The world is changing before our eyes, and the next generation of humans will co-exist with AI-powered computers in a whole new way. These sea changes are rare and extremely powerful. Experts like Gates and Kurzweil argue that AI is the next truly game-changing technology.', ""So it's high time to prepare for what's next. For investors like you and me, that means grabbing a diversified basket of promising AI stocks. Here's why SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) and IBM (NYSE: IBM) would be helpful components of that basket."", ""You may know SoundHound for its music identification app. You know the drill -- play a few seconds of any song into your smartphone's microphone, give SoundHound another couple of seconds to find sonic patterns in that sample, and get data such as the song title, artist, composer, and lyrics."", 'Rivals like Shazam (now a part of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)) and Deezer work by ""fingerprinting"" the audio and matching the result to a database of known signatures. SoundHound\'s AI-based system digs deeper into the characteristics of the track before matching a more sophisticated range of patterns. For example, SoundHound can isolate the melody line, allowing you to find tunes by singing or humming into your phone -- in the wrong key, at an unexpected tempo, or in a noisy environment. Shazam\'s simpler approach can\'t do that.', 'But song-ID services are not terribly lucrative, so SoundHound has expanded its focus around the core expertise of AI-powered audio analysis. So SoundHound built a powerful audio recognition engine known as Houndify around its years of song-focused research and oodles of data from those 10-second samples. The company quickly found clients in the automotive industry and consumer electronics. More recently, SoundHound launched voice-driven tools for restaurant management.', ""Now, SoundHound is a direct bet on AI technology delivering superior results to more traditional consumer-facing systems. You'll run across automated Houndify interactions at drive-through windows and in call center phone menus. If you've gotten used to telling your car what radio station to play or what temperature you want in the air conditioning, you may very well use SoundHound's Houndify every day without knowing it."", ""And this little company is going places. SoundHound's trailing revenues stood at $19.6 million in the summer of 2022, just after its initial public offering (IPO). It has nearly doubled since then to $38.2 million. The company is unprofitable so far but getting closer to the breakeven point in every quarter. Furthermore, the stock isn't exactly setting the world on fire. SoundHound's shares have traded sideways since November 2022, despite the AI boom of 2023."", 'I expect big things from SoundHound AI as it continues to expand into new target markets while refining its pricing and profits. In a worst-case scenario, the company could be a buyout target for some tech giant without a credible audio analysis platform.

This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for United?', ""For United, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.47%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.', 'So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that United will beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that United would post earnings of $3.40 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.65, delivering a surprise of +7.35%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", ""United doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

Industry heavyweights like Delta Air Lines DAL, United Airlines UAL, American Airlines AAL and Southwest Airlines LUV declined 9%,10.6%, 9.5% and 4.3%, respectively, from Thursday’s closing price. With major constituents moving south, the NYSE ARCA Airline index fell consequently, ending Friday’s session at $62.29, down 4.4%.', 'Of the abovementioned stocks, American Airlines presently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) while the rest currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see\xa0the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.', 'Delta kickstarted the fourth-quarter 2023 earnings season for airlines on Jan 12. The Atlanta-based airline behemoth reported better-than-expected revenues and earnings per share in the December quarter. Strong holiday air travel demand aided results. However, high labor costs resulted in the bottom line shrinking 13.5%.Salaries and related costs rose 23% to $3,769 million. The increase was due to higher wages arising from the contract with pilots that was ratified in March 2023. Another disappointing aspect of the quarterly earnings report was the 24% year-over-year decline in cargo revenue.', 'More than the above disappointments, it was the trimming of the 2024 earnings guidance due to supply-chain woes and economic uncertainty, which spooked investors. Management now expects 2024 adjusted earnings in the range of $6-$7 (projected to be above $7 previously). Supply chain disruptions are leading to high maintenance costs, which increased 13% and 23% in fourth-quarter 2023 and full-year 2023, respectively. Since DAL’s results generally serve as a harbinger of what to expect across the industry, its disappointing guidance and the resultant stock price depreciation caused other airlines to shed value on Friday.', 'DAL’s earnings guidance apart, the northward movement in oil price on Friday was a headwind for airline stocks, leading to their price depreciation. Oil price climbed nearly 1% on Friday to settle at $72.68 a barrel. The airstrikes carried out by the United States and the UK against Houthi targets in Yemen, in response to recent ship attacks in the Red Sea, resulted in an uptick in oil prices.', 'The northward movement in oil prices is not a welcome development for airline stocks. This is because expenses on fuel represent a significant input cost for airlines. Therefore, an increase in fuel costs hurts bottom-line growth.', 'For example, oil price increased in third-quarter 2023, primarily due to the extension of production cut by Saudi Arabia and Russia through 2023-end. At UAL, average fuel price increased 10.3% sequentially in the September quarter. UAL expects the metric to be $3.28 in fourth-quarter 2023. UAL will release its fourth-quarter results on Jan 22.', 'At American Airlines, average fuel price increased 11% sequentially in third-quarter 2023 to $2.91 per gallon. The metric is expected to be in the $3.01-$3.11 band in fourth-quarter 2023. AAL will release its fourth-quarter results on Jan 25.', 'At the Dallas-based Southwest Airlines, economic fuel price per gallon in third-quarter 2023 was $2.78, up 6.9% from second-quarter 2023 levels. LUV forecasts fourth-quarter economic fuel cost per gallon in the $3 to $3.1 band. Like AAL, LUV too will release its fourth-quarter results on Jan 25.', 'Like Delta, labor costs are likely to have been high for other airlines too, in turn hurting bottom-line growth. With U.S. airlines grappling with labor shortage in the post-COVID-19 high-demand scenario, the bargaining power of various labor groups has naturally increased. As a result, we have seen pay-hike deals being inked in the space. This is resulting in a spike in labor costs.', 'For example, in August 2023, American Airlines pilots, represented by Allied Pilots Association, approved a four-year deal pertaining to wage increases. The approval makes AAL’s pilots eligible for an immediate pay raise in excess of 21% on average. Also, the deal includes provisions aimed at improving pilots’ quality of life. In September 2023, United Airlines’ pilot union ratified a $10 billion contract to increase their pay up to 40.2% over the four-year duration of the contract.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

These companies take on the financial risk of lending capital via an unsecured product."", 'On the other hand, Visa really just provides the technological infrastructure that allows all parties involved in a card transaction to communicate with each other, collecting a tiny, high-margin fee in doing so. It seems like an unimportant task, but Visa is essential to the smooth functioning of our economy.', ""Imagine for a moment if Visa's network were to experience a disruption and stop working. Consumers wouldn't be able to shop. And businesses wouldn't be able to pay vendors. It would be a nightmare."", ""This reality underscores how critical Visa is to all stakeholders. And it helps exemplify how the company's competitive position is almost entirely protected from disruption."", ""Some astute readers might point to the threat of fintech businesses, like PayPal and Block, that might derail Visa. But these two payments-focused enterprises actually help accelerate adoption of digital payment methods by improving upon the user experience. PayPal's wallet supports Visa-branded cards. And Block's Cash Card is a debit card that uses the Visa network."", 'This puts Visa in a very advantageous position to continue reaping the rewards of a global economy that is only becoming more and more digitized. As cashless transactions proliferate, this company is set to continue posting healthy growth rates.', ""Visa currently sports a price-to-earnings ratio of 31.9. This seems expensive at first glance, but the multiple represents a slight discount to the stock's trailing-10-year average of 33.7. That's an encouraging sign."", ""Assuming this valuation ratio stays the same and the outstanding share count doesn't change, the company would need to generate diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $15.60 in 2030 for the business to reach a $1 trillion market cap. This translates to a compound annual growth rate of under 10% over the next seven fiscal years (2023 to 2030)."", ""How likely is this to happen? Well, based on the factors noted, Visa's competitive position remains strong, and the business is in no immediate danger of disruption. Plus, it possesses a robust financial profile and benefits from the broad secular shift to cashless transactions. These are enough reasons to be optimistic. "", ""But to hammer home the argument that this will in fact be a trillion-dollar company by 2030, consider that in the last decade, Visa's diluted EPS increased at an annualized clip of 15.9%. In other words, investors can expect the bottom-line gains to slow down meaningfully going forward, which is a conservative assumption, and the business would still reach the trillion-dollar mark."", 'Therefore, it looks like a high-probability bet that Visa will make it into this exclusive valuation club at the end of the current decade.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Visa, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Visa wasn't one of them.

That\'s because their collective valuation of $12 trillion makes up 28% of the index, so they have a huge influence over the direction of the broader market.', 'These are the Magnificent Seven stocks, and how they performed in 2023:', ""The Equal Weight S&P 500 index -- which assigns an identical weighting to all 500 stocks -- finished 2023 with a gain of just 11.5%. It highlights just how impactful the surging Magnificent Seven returns were on the actual S&P 500. If you didn't own that group of stocks last year, your portfolio probably lagged the market."", ""But it's not all about blockbuster gains, because some of the Magnificent Seven stocks also pay dividends. I'm going to show you how much you could earn with a $350,000 investment split equally across the seven stocks."", 'The Magnificent Seven companies operate across every major segment of the technology sector. Artificial intelligence (AI) was the largest driver of value in 2023, which is why Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) led the group higher. Its H100 and upcoming H200 data center chips are designed to process AI workloads, and demand continues to surge as more businesses seek to develop AI applications.', ""Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) are some of the world's largest data center operators, and therefore some of Nvidia's biggest customers. They use those centralized data centers to deliver cloud services -- and the computing power necessary to develop AI -- to millions of businesses around the world. Plus, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet offer cloud customers a growing number of large language models (LLMs), which are the building blocks of many AI applications."", 'Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is using AI to show more relevant content to each of its 3.1 billion monthly users. The company also created an LLM of its own called Llama, which is open source, so any developer can use it to build advanced AI applications.', ""Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) created its own LLM in-house, which it's using to develop an AI chatbot similar to ChatGPT. It will pair nicely with the company's latest iPhone 15, because it's fitted with the Apple-designed A17 Pro chip, which is capable of processing AI workloads on-device. This will place AI at the fingertips of billions of people around the world."", ""Finally, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) was the world's leading electric vehicle company by sales up until the end of 2023, when it was edged out by China-based BYD. However, Tesla's future will likely be determined by the success of its AI-powered autonomous self-driving vehicle technology. It's yet to be publicly released, but it has the potential to transform the company's economics."", ""Some companies generate so much profit they can't possibly reinvest it all into their operations to fuel more growth, so they pay some of it to shareholders instead. Dividends are the most common form of distribution, and they usually come as quarterly cash payments."", 'Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia are the only three Magnificent Seven stocks that pay dividends. Each of them less than a 1% yield, which are the payouts investors can expect to receive annually, calculated based on the value of their holdings.', ""Yields often change. If a stock doubles, its yield will halve organically unless the company raises its dividend. It doesn't mean the payout shrinks in dollar terms, but it falls as a percentage of the value of your investment."", 'Microsoft offers the highest yield, and while it seems small at face value, it translates to around $20 billion in dividend payments each year based on its current market capitalization of $2.8 trillion.', ""If you'd invested $350,000 in the Magnificent Seven (split equally with $50,000 invested into each stock) you would earn a dividend yield of 0.37% on $150,000, and no yield on the other $200,000. That translates to an effective yield of 0.18% on the $350,000, or an annual payment of $659.56."", ""It's a paltry sum given the yield investors can earn on cash in a savings account right now, but it's a nice bonus on top of the spectacular capital growth these stocks have delivered over the past year."", ""A dividend isn't the only way companies return money to shareholders. They can also execute stock buyback programs, where they purchase their own shares on the open market. Those shrink the number of available shares in circulation, which leads to a higher price per share."", ""Stock buybacks are preferable to dividends for many companies, because they give them the flexibility to distribute the money at a time of their choosing -- they aren't locked into paying out a specified sum each quarter."", 'Five of the Magnificent Seven companies have active share repurchase programs, worth a combined $186.6 billion over the last 12 months. Tesla and Amazon are the two without active programs.', ""As I touched on at the top, investors who didn't own the Magnificent Seven stocks in 2023 likely underperformed the S&P 500 index. The law of large numbers makes it somewhat counterintuitive to expect these enormous companies to continue delivering the best returns in the entire market, because it gets harder for them to grow their revenue and earnings each year."", ""However, it so happens that the Magnificent Seven companies operate at the forefront of the fastest growing industries in the world. For any investor seeking exposure to technologies like AI, cloud computing, e-commerce, digital advertising, or electric vehicles, it's nearly impossible to look past these stocks."", 'Depending on which Wall Street forecast you rely on, AI alone could add between $7 trillion and $200 trillion to the global economy in the coming decade. Each of the Magnificent Seven already has a foothold in the industry, and they will likely deploy their considerable financial resources to ensure they capture a large slice of the opportunity.', 'Therefore, the Magnificent Seven will likely be a great place for investors to park their money for the long term, and any dividends earned are an added bonus.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

Many companies across various industries are also building customized AI applications. The increasing adoption of AI by enterprises is driving up demand for Nvidia's accelerated computing solutions. Not surprisingly, Citi analyst Christopher Danely expects the company to account for at least a 90% share of the AI chip market in future years."", 'Besides AI hardware, Nvidia is also making major strides in its software business. The company expects to end fiscal 2024 (ending Jan. 31, 2024) with an annualized revenue run rate of $1 billion for recurring software, support, and services offerings.

DGX Cloud service is also integrated with Nvidia's AI enterprise software (enterprise-grade software suite optimized for AI workloads and closely integrated with Nvidia hardware)."", ""All these initiatives have translated into solid financial success for Nvidia. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the company reported a 206% year-over-year revenue increase, while adjusted earnings per share (EPS) were 6 times more on a year-over-year basis. Analysts are also expecting the company's revenue to grow 232% year over year to $20.1 billion and earnings per share to grow by 411% year over year in the fourth quarter."", ""According to Fortune Business Insights, the global AI market is estimated to grow from $515.3 billion in 2023 to just over $2 trillion in 2030. Considering Nvidia's dominance in the rapidly growing AI market and its annual run rate of just $44.9 billion, there is still much scope for growth in the coming years."", ""After a difficult 2022, social media giant Meta Platforms' share prices rose nearly 185% in 2023. However, the stock's upward trajectory may not be yet over and there are still many reasons to like this company."", ""First, Meta Platforms owns and operates multiple social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, which together command nearly 3.96 billion monthly active users. With the company's user base accounting for more than 40% of the global population, Meta's platforms have become indispensable for the majority of advertisers."", 'Second, Meta is witnessing an acceleration in advertising revenue across multiple geographic segments.\xa0Increasing spending from Chinese advertisers targeting international markets and rising advertising demand in South Asian markets emerged as major growth drivers.', ""Third, Meta has introduced new generative AI-powered advertising features such as text variations, image expansion, and background generation.

Happy employees reach or exceed their potential, compared to unhappy ones, who languish and breed toxicity. They also act as ambassadors for the company, effectively recruiting future employees by telling people that their company is a great place to work."", 'Satisfied employees also lead to lower turnover, which saves companies money on recruiting and training and helps maintain the culture, creating a shared corporate memory. Similarly, teams that work well together come up with better ideas, do better work, and finish projects faster, and the building blocks of any company are ultimately a group of people and their ideas.', ""Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been the belle of the artificial intelligence (AI) ball thus far. Its revenue and profits skyrocketed over the last year as its AI components have been in high demand. Competitors, meanwhile, have yet to introduce a product that can match Nvidia's AI accelerators and run the massive models used to train AI programs like ChatGPT."", ""For followers of the company, it might not come as a surprise then that Nvidia's culture is just as strong as its business."", 'The AI stock was just named the No. 2 place to work by Glassdoor, the employment review website, with a rating of 4.7 out of 5 stars.

Nvidia isn't a stranger to the list of top places to work -- this is the fourth year that the company has been ranked in the top five."", ""Some of those high ratings might reflect the company's recent success as Nvidia employees are among the biggest beneficiaries of the stock's meteoric surge and a number of them mentioned restricted stock units in their posts, but there's more to the culture than just success and high compensation."", ""Many of Nvidia's employees comment on its flat hierarchical structure and its team-oriented business structure."", 'The company itself says on its website:', ""There's only one team at Nvidia. That means no politics, no hierarchy. Reporting lines exist, but teams form around projects based on the skills that are required."", ""According to reviewers on sites like Blind, Nvidia's approach is a significant contrast with rival Intel, the legacy chipmaker that is expected to challenge Nvidia in AI."", 'One commenter confirmed Nvidia\'s cultural objective above, saying there was ""less hierarchy and way less politics"" at Nvidia compared to Intel.

Morale also seems to be significantly at higher at Nvidia, though it\'s worth noting that Intel\'s ratings on Glassdoor were still generally high, at 4.1 stars.', 'Internally, the biggest risk at a company like Nvidia that has had so much success is that employees can get complacent. Microsoft, for example, developed a reputation for having something of a country club culture in the early 2000s.', 'However, Nvidia seems unlikely to fall into that trap as the company just announced a slew of new chips and partnerships at the CES trade show last week, delighting Wall Street and sending the stock soaring on the news.', ""While competition should eventually narrow the performance gap and fill the shortages we've seen for AI components, the AI crown is Nvidia's to lose, and it's unlikely to loosen its grip soon."", 'Its winning culture is a big reason why.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

The technology wouldn't be possible without advanced semiconductors, which is why Nvidia stock soared 239% in 2023, making it the top performer in the S&P 500."", ""Nvidia's industry-leading data center chips remain in hot demand, but 2024 might be the year several other semiconductor stocks benefit from the AI revolution. The data center will remain critical to developing AI, but the technology is quickly progressing to edge devices, like computers and smartphones, creating an entirely new opportunity."", ""Here's why investors might want to buy shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Micron (NASDAQ: MU) this year."", ""AMD is one of the most important chip companies in the world. Its hardware is prevalent in some of the most popular consumer electronics, including the Microsoft Xbox and Sony PlayStation 5, and AMD chips power the infotainment systems in Tesla's electric vehicles."", ""AMD also has a data center segment where it sells chips to cloud providers, but last year, it took an enormous leap forward by announcing its new MI300 lineup. Its MI300X is a stand-alone graphics processing unit (GPU) designed to compete with Nvidia's leading H100. In contrast, its MI300A combines GPU and central processing unit (CPU) hardware to create the world's first accelerated processing unit (APU) for data centers."", ""The MI300A is already shipping to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where it will power the upcoming El Capitan supercomputer expected to be one of the most powerful in the world. AMD will begin shipping the MI300 lineup more broadly in 2024, and the company says it could generate $2 billion in revenue for the year -- it will be the fastest product to reach $1 billion in revenue in AMD's history."", 'But AMD is also focusing on edge computing. Its new Ryzen 7000 series of chips brings AI to personal computers. Most AI applications are processed in the data center (in the cloud), but advancements in chip design will soon make computers powerful enough to handle AI workloads within a device. Instead of the user deliberately accessing AI, it will soon be automatically embedded across all personal computing facets.', 'Ryzen AI chips already power 50 notebook computer designs, with more to come thanks to a collaboration with Microsoft, which will make the Windows operating system more AI-friendly going forward.', ""AMD will report its 2023 full-year results in February. The company's revenue is expected to shrink by 4% year over year to $22.6 billion, mainly driven by sluggish results in its consumer-focused Client segment. Tough economic conditions led to weak sales of computers and devices, but that trend reversed in the most recent quarter, a good sign for 2024."", ""AMD's hot new lineup of AI hardware should drive the company back to revenue growth this year in what could be one of its best annual results ever."", ""Micron is a chipmaker like AMD, but it makes very different hardware. Micron is a world leader in memory (DRAM) and storage (NAND) chips, which aren't as glamorous as the GPUs sold by AMD and Nvidia but are equally important to edge devices and the data center."", 'In mid-2023, Micron launched a new high-bandwidth memory chip, called HBM3E, for data centers. Nvidia chose the chip to power its brand-new H200 GPU set to extend its advantage over the competition. With respect to multimodal generative AI models -- those capable of creating text, images, videos, and computer code -- HBM3E can reduce training time by 30% because it can process over 50% more queries each day than competing hardware.', ""HBM3E also consumes 30% less power, so it's not only faster but also far cheaper for data center operators to run."", 'But Micron is preparing for a world where AI is everywhere. The company says AI-enabled industrial computers, for example, require 3 to 5 times more memory than their standard counterparts. Therefore, they demand more advanced DRAM chips, which sell at a higher price and drive more revenue for providers like Micron.', ""Micron's revenue collapsed by 50% in fiscal 2023 (ended Aug. 31). Much like AMD, it suffered sluggish consumer segments, like personal computing, which caused an inventory glut and plunging prices. But the fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended Nov. 30) was a different story. Micron's revenue jumped 16% year over year, which included a 45% sequential increase in its compute and networking segment. The latter result was driven specifically by AI-related data center chip demand."", ""Micron expects the sluggish consumer segments from fiscal 2023 to rebound this year, and Wall Street's early estimates point to an impressive 45% increase in the company's total revenue in fiscal 2024. Moreover, the Street thinks Micron's revenue will grow by another 41% in fiscal 2025, reaching an all-time high of $32 billion."", 'AI is a long-term opportunity and could drive significant demand for chips well into the future.

Over the past four years, the major stock indexes have oscillated between bear and bull markets on a couple of occasions.', ""When volatility rules the roost on Wall Street, investors have a tendency to pile into time-tested outperformers. While the FAANG stocks have certainly fit the bill for the past decade, it's companies enacting stock splits that have been investors' preference over the past couple of years."", ""A stock split\xa0is an event that allows a publicly traded company to cosmetically alter its share price and outstanding share count by the same magnitude, without having any impact on its market cap or operating performance. Stock splits can be used to make shares of a company more nominally affordable for everyday investors (a forward-stock split), or can increase a company's share price to ensure continued listing on a major stock exchange (a reverse-stock split)."", 'Since the midpoint of 2021, nine high-flying companies have conducted forward-stock splits, including semiconductor stock Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), internet search behemoth Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), and e-commerce kingpin Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), which effected respective splits of 4-for-1, 20-for-1, and 20-for-1.', 'Although the act of splitting their respective shares is a very short-term catalyst driven by investor emotions, forward-stock splits more importantly act as a beacon for businesses that are out-executing and out-innovating their competition.', ""For example, Nvidia has gone on to become the infrastructure backbone of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution since conducting its split in July 2021. The company's A100 and H100 AI-inspired graphics processing units (GPUs) may account for a greater than 90% share of GPUs in use by high-compute data centers this year. While Nvidia's stock would probably be soaring with or without its stock split in July 2021, its previous split has made shares more affordable for investors without access to fractional-share purchases."", ""Stock splits have also served as a reminder of just how impressive Alphabet's and Amazon's respective moats are. Alphabet's Google tallied a nearly 92% share of global internet search in December, which is 88 percentage points higher than its next-closest competitor. Google Cloud has also gobbled up a 10% share of worldwide cloud infrastructure services spending."", ""Meanwhile, Amazon brought in approximately 40% of U.S. online retail sales in 2022, per Insider Intelligence, and it's the leading provider of global cloud infrastructure services via Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS sports an annual sales run rate of $92 billion and is currently responsible for the lion's share of Amazon's operating income."", ""Long story short, it's very easy to see why investors have flocked to high-profile stock-split stocks in recent years. Just keep in mind that not all stock-split stocks are worth investing in."", 'Whereas forward-stock splits are almost always conducted by top-notch companies, reverse-stock splits are, more often than not, a sign of trouble. Though there have been a few instances throughout history of reverse-stock splits working out nicely for long-term investors, such as tech-based travel company Booking Holdings, reverse splits are usually situations to avoid.', ""For once-high-flying marijuana stock Canopy Growth (NASDAQ: CGC), its recent split is all the more reason to keep your distance in 2024. Effective Dec. 20, 2023, the company completed a 1-for-10 reverse split. Had this split not taken place, Canopy's common stock would be trading for about $0.45 per share, which is more than 99% below its all-time high."", 'At one time, the Canadian pot industry appeared primed for success. When our neighbors to the north gave recreational weed the green light to be legally sold in October 2018, it was widely expected that vertically integrated licensed producers would thrive. In particular, Canopy Growth was expected to benefit from international exports and a domestic surge in demand for higher-margin cannabis derivatives (e.g., edibles, beverages, and vapes).', ""Unfortunately, reality never came close to matching these expectations. Part of the blame does lie with Canadian regulators. Federal regulators were incredibly slow to approve cultivation licenses prior to October 2018, while provincial regulators in Ontario (Canada's largest province by population) initially relied on a lottery system to award dispensary licenses. This lottery system resulted in far too few retail locations opening in a key province."", ""Consumer behavior didn't quite align with projections for Canadian cannabis companies, either. Cannabis users have gravitated toward value-based products and dried cannabis flower. In other words, margins for Canadian licensed producers are far below what was expected."", ""But let's not beat around the cannabis bush -- Canopy Growth deserves more than its fair share of the blame, too. Management grossly overestimated domestic and global production needs, which is one reason the company took a goodwill impairment charge of more than $1.4 billion in fiscal 2023 (the company's fiscal year ended March 31, 2023)."", ""Furthermore, during the early stages of the marijuana craze, Canopy Growth's stock-based compensation was exorbitantly high. Even after hiring David Klein in 2020 from Constellation Brands to tighten Canopy Growth's proverbial belt, the company still hasn't been able to back its way into the profit column."", ""A history of poor acquisitions, coupled with grossly overexpanding production capacity without understanding consumer demand trends, has decimated the company's once-robust cash pile. Since closing a roughly $4 billion equity investment from Constellation Brands in November 2018, Canopy Growth's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments have shrunk to around $201 million, as of Sept. 30, 2023."", ""Although Canopy Growth has raised some cash by issuing stock and conducting private placements, the company's auditors have included a going concern warning in its operating results. This means Canopy may not have the capital to cover its expected operating liabilities over the next 12 months."", ""The final nail in the coffin for Canopy Growth is that there's no guarantee the U.S. federal government will change marijuana's scheduling anytime soon. President Joe Biden has signaled no willingness to legalize cannabis for recreational purposes, and multiple attempts to enact banking reform measures have been stymied in the U.S. Senate. Without the ability to enter the most lucrative cannabis market in the world, Canopy Growth stock likely has further to fall."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Canopy Growth right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Canopy Growth, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Canopy Growth wasn't one of them.

And the good part is that the index could keep heading higher in 2024.', 'Historical data collected by fintech brokerage firm Capex.com suggests that a year in which the Nasdaq-100 clocks a gain of more than 40% is followed by another year of gains -- barring 1999, when the dot-com bubble was about to burst. These trends indicate that the Nasdaq-100 could jump 24% this year from 2023 levels.', ""Wall Street is also positive about the Nasdaq-100's prospects, predicting that the index could land between 17,000 and 18,500 this year. Using the higher end of the estimate, that would be a 10% jump from current levels. While past performance is definitely not an indicator of how the market could perform in the future, tailwinds such as a potential cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve could send the Nasdaq-100 even higher."", ""That's why now would be a good time to take a look at Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), a chipmaker that saw major growth thanks to the booming demand for its AI chips. The stock has had a terrific start in 2024 with gains of more than 10% already, and it probably won't be long before this semiconductor stock hits a $2 trillion market cap. Let's see why."", ""The stock's AI-fueled surge in the past year has brought the company's market cap to $1.35 trillion, making it the world's sixth-largest company. This means Nvidia needs to jump another 48% from current levels to enter the $2 trillion club. There is a strong chance it could achieve that mark sooner rather than later given how fast its earnings are growing."", 'Nvidia is expected to finish its fiscal 2024 (which will end this month) with $12.25 in earnings per share (EPS), a big jump from the $3.34 in fiscal 2023. And as the following chart suggests, EPS could jump another 63% in the new fiscal year, beginning next month.', ""Nvidia currently has a forward earnings multiple of 55, higher than its five-year average of 42. Assuming it trades at a discounted 42 times after a year, in line with the five-year average, and hits Wall Street's estimated earnings target, its stock price could jump to $835. That would be a 52% jump from current levels."", 'So, the possibility of Nvidia hitting $2 trillion in market cap over the next year or so cannot be ruled out thanks to a collection of tailwinds.', ""Shares are up an impressive 223% in the past year as the company's data center business has taken off with the robust demand for its AI chips. The good news is that Nvidia is set to benefit from more growth drivers in the coming year, along with AI, which could supercharge the company's earnings."", ""For example, the gaming market seems all set to move the needle in a bigger way for Nvidia thanks to the growth in the personal computer (PC) market, as well as the adoption of AI-enabled PCs. The company's gaming revenue was up 81% year over year in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ended on Oct. 29) to $2.86 billion."", 'The trend is likely to continue as PC sales are expected to rebound 8% in 2024 from a decline of 12.4% last year, according to technology market analyst Canalys.', ""Another catalyst for Nvidia's PC business is that a big chunk of gamers are expected to upgrade their systems this year. According to a survey of 1,000 PC builders conducted by DFC Intelligence, 53% of respondents who built their PCs in 2020 plan to upgrade or build a new PC within the next year, while 84% are likely to upgrade within the next couple of years."", ""These tailwinds should ideally lead to higher demand for Nvidia's gaming GPUs (graphics processing units). Jon Peddie Research says that the shipments of discrete GPUs, which are used for gaming, increased 37% sequentially in the third quarter of 2023, indicating that this market is already in turnaround mode. Considering Nvidia's 80% share of the discrete GPU market, the company is in a position to capitalize on this turnaround."", ""Meanwhile, the growing adoption of digital twins (virtual models of real-life objects) could turn out to be another catalyst for Nvidia in 2024. This market is expected to clock annual growth of 30% through 2027 as more and more manufacturers are forecast to adopt this technology to improve their operations. The company is already benefiting from this trend as major organizations have started deploying its digital-twin solutions. Given that this market could hit an estimated $92 billion in 2029, it could have a huge impact on Nvidia's business in the long run."", 'Considering that Nvidia enjoys terrific pricing power and market share in the fast-growing market for AI chips, there are several reasons why the company is on track for outstanding growth over the next year, and beyond.', ""All this indicates that investors would do well to buy Nvidia before the Nasdaq-100 heads higher in 2024, especially since this AI stock isn't as expensive when compared to the other chipmakers looking to capitalize on this market."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

Countries around the world remain committed to reaching net zero, which will require a combination of energy-saving measures, a push for renewable energy development, and the development and deployment of low-carbon solutions like hydrogen energy. It’s important to understand that not all hydrogen is clean hydrogen. Green hydrogen is the cleanest form, but there are an array of others that come with a smaller carbon footprint than traditional sources and therefore will likely see an uptick in usage.', 'It’s worth noting, that green hydrogen technology is still relatively new and as such comes with plenty of risks. Over the near term, investors can expect the market for green hydrogen to grow steadily as it’s applied to small, niche projects. During this period, we can expect to see plenty of innovation and change when it comes to green hydrogen technology. However come 2030 and beyond, the growth trajectory for the green hydrogen market is steep as it becomes a more reliable part of the global energy mix.', 'With that in mind, investors need to consider how they position their portfolio when it comes to hydrogen stocks. There are several different ways to play this trend, from specialist companies closely linked to hydrogen energy development to larger companies with a vested interest in the technology. The more specialist the company, the more of a pure play it will be. That means the gains have the potential to be larger, but the risks are headier as well. With that in mind, it makes sense for long-term investors to choose big names that stand to benefit from a boom in hydrogen, but will be less impacted by the near-term ups and downs as the technology gains traction.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: Audio und werbung / Shutterstock', 'Linde (NASDAQ:LIN) is a well-established industrial gas company, and its experience within the sector means it’s a great long-term pick among hydrogen stocks. Linde’s strong position in the industry means it’s become a recognized name within the hydrogen and fuel cell market. The group’s working to up its hydrogen production to meet growing demand for the stuff. Importantly, the group is working on ways to lower the carbon emissions of non-green hydrogen with carbon capture and storage technology.', 'This side of the business comes with tremendous growth potential as energy companies look for ways to clean up their act without completely switching lanes. Carbon capture and storage is one way to do this, and Linde’s capabilities will be in high demand. The group’s already inked a deal with Exxon Mobil to move and store carbon dioxide, which could be the first of many big-time energy contracts as the technology develops. ', 'Air Products (NYSE:APD) is another industrial gas company, but it makes the list of hydrogen stocks for a slightly different reason than Linde. APD’s hydrogen arm is only a drop in the bucket right now, with its sprawling legacy portfolio bringing in most of its income. This translates into reliable income that, thanks to long-term contracts, is relatively predictable. The group’s putting that money to good use though— with some of that cash being funneled into building out a green hydrogen business poised to capitalize on the growth momentum ahead.', 'The group already has over 100 hydrogen plants under its umbrella, a number that should continue to grow alongside government support as more projects come online. For investors, APD offers an inroad to the push for green hydrogen without compromising stability and reliable cash flow. The core business will continue to hum along in the background, underpinning a reliable dividend and steady earnings growth.', 'Source: FotograFFF / Shutterstock.com', 'BP (LON:BP) may not be the first port of call when it comes to hydrogen stocks, but the group’s diversified energy business comes complete with exposure to hydrogen. BP probably isn’t the right choice for impact investors looking to fund clean energy with their investment— the group’s primary business is drilling for oil, a fact that probably won’t change anytime soon. However, BP is also set on diversifying to ensure the business is relevant in a low-carbon future. A big part of that is developing hydrogen energy.', 'BP is planning to control roughly 10% of the hydrogen market within its key geographies. In the UK the group says its plants could be responsible for 15% of the region’s 2030 hydrogen target. This is, of course, a long way off and a lot can change in that timespan.

Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So when we looked at Under Armour (NYSE:UAA) and its trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.', ""If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Under Armour is:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.086 = US$299m ÷ (US$4.7b - US$1.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""Thus, Under Armour has an ROCE of 8.6%.  Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Luxury industry average of 12%."", ' View our latest analysis for Under Armour ', ""In the above chart we have measured Under Armour's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company."", ""Under Armour is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 76% in that same time. So our take on this is that the business has increased efficiencies to generate these higher returns, all the while not needing to make any additional investments. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking."", ""To bring it all together, Under Armour has done well to increase the returns it's generating from its capital employed. Given the stock has declined 61% in the last five years, this could be a good investment if the valuation and other metrics are also appealing. That being the case, research into the company's current valuation metrics and future prospects seems fitting."", ""Like most companies, Under Armour does come with some risks, and we've found 1 warning sign  that you should be aware of."", 'If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.', 'Have feedback on this article?

Let's get right to NASDAQ President and CEO, Adena Friedman. Adena, nice to see you in Davos. We normally see you in New York. Good to see you here."", ""ADENA FRIEDMAN: Yeah. It's great to be here."", 'BRIAN SOZZI: Look, I was going through this report and I was shocked by some of the findings that your team put together here. What is the prevalence of financial fraud right now globally?', ""ADENA FRIEDMAN: Yeah. Well, if you look at the problem that we're dealing with, we're dealing with money laundering and financial fraud. And it is a $3 trillion problem in terms of money that's laundered through the system, and about a $500 billion issue with fraud. Those are just staggering statistics."", ""And then what we did was we broke it down into different types of money laundering activities, whether that's human trafficking or terrorism activity. And then in fraud, you look at things like romance scams versus elderly abuse. And so you see these different human tragedies kind of playing out in the data. And that's one of the things that we try to do is bring the data and the analytics as to how big this problem was."", 'What are the banks doing to try to fix it? How are they managing to work on this problem together and with the public sector? But also what is the human toll that these crimes take? So we do have some stories of people who were victims of these crimes. And so to understand the impact it had on their lives as well.', 'JULIE HYMAN: So when the problem is that big, how do you get your arms around it?', ""ADENA FRIEDMAN: That, I think is the biggest issue, right? It's such an enormous problem, and it's a completely global problem. And when you think about criminals, they don't just bank in one bank. They bank across the entire system. So a single bank, a single institution cannot solve this problem. And law enforcement alone can't solve it either. So it has to be a public-private partnership."", ""It has to be that the banks work together, they share they share information so that they can actually tackle the problem together and that they also work very closely with law enforcement. Some of those things are happening today, but a lot could be strengthened to make the problem not necessarily-- it's going to be hard to make it go away, but to contain the problem a lot better than we can today requires really collective action."", 'BRIAN SOZZI: Is technology a main driver of it?', 'ADENA FRIEDMAN: Yeah. I think technology is the great unlock when you think about it. So one of the things we really focus on is, what is the pattern of behavior that criminals tend to act on. So what do they actually do in the financial system? How do they use different account openings, closings, passing money through. How do they behave? So if you can really start to look-- we call it that kind of the typologies of criminal behavior.', ""And then you use automation automation, AI in order to be able to root out that behavior across the system. The first thing you have to do is bring all the data together. So all the data across millions and millions of transactions. NASDAQ today with our VeraFin platform, we see $6 trillion of assets. That's how large the banks-- we have 2,500 banks. They represent about $6 trillion. And so we see all their transaction data."", ""You then apply those AI algorithms against these very specific typologies of behavior. It allows you to solve the problem much more effectively. But the United States allows for data sharing, but other countries don't. And so that is where I really feel like the regulators are really tying the banks hands behind their back in trying to solve this problem because they can't actually share data with each other to help find the criminals."", ""JULIE HYMAN: What role does crypto play in the financial fraud that you're seeing?"", ""ADENA FRIEDMAN: I would say it this way, payments or payments. And I think the faster the payment, the faster the systems have to be in order to be able to protect the system. And also the fact that cryptocurrencies are-- like once you make a transaction a cryptocurrency, it's immutable, so meaning it's done. You can't retract it."", ""Banks with wire fraud or with ACH fraud, they can manage with them themselves to almost back out of if they think that a bad wire has gone through, they can try to retract the wire. That is not the case with crypto. But generally speaking, payments are payments. So we have to look at regulation. We have to look at solving this problem of financial crime in the same way, same technology, same capabilities, but at a faster speed and with more precision because of the fact that it's an immutable outcome."", 'BRIAN SOZZI: Does the speed around this fraud just pick up now in light of what we saw with Bitcoin spot ETFs? Does it become more just ever present in our system?', ""ADENA FRIEDMAN: I don't think spot ETFs for Bitcoin necessarily is going to create any sort of new challenges. I think what that's saying is really more that the evolution of the crypto market and particularly the Bitcoin market is such that the underlying price formation is to the level that the SEC is willing to allow retail investors to invest in a security that's a layer on top of Bitcoin, right?"", ""They don't actually have to invest in Bitcoin itself. They can invest in a security that's in a regulated market that allows them to express their views on the future of Bitcoin prices. But they don't actually have to buy the Bitcoin themselves. There's still a lot of friction I think in the system around the actual buying and selling of Bitcoin. But I also would say that it does make that asset class more accessible to retail."", ""So the need for investor protection is as strong as it always has been. And I think here in terms of anti-fin crime, this is more the broader banking system using cryptocurrencies for payment, using government fiat for payment. The criminals use whatever's available to them. So the banks need to be able to leverage the same amount of technology to be able to protect the system as well."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Now, Adena, if an investor hadn't been paying attention in the past few years, they might tune in and say, why is the CEO of the NASDAQ talking about financial fraud? Well, it's because you've changed the company in a lot of ways, including with a huge acquisition last year, Adenza for $10.5 billion, which it closed on November 1, if I'm not mistaken. What is NASDAQ now? How should investors be thinking about the company?"", ""ADENA FRIEDMAN: Yeah. We really have transformed to be a global technology company that serves the financial system. And of course, our markets are our foundation. And they're extremely technologically-driven. They're a very advanced technology in itself. In fact, we have our first SEC-approved AI order type that we're launching this quarter."", 'JULIE HYMAN: What does that mean?', ""ADENA FRIEDMAN: It means that it's an order type that factors in about 150 different factors every second to determine the price at which-- or the timer, sorry-- the speed at which certain orders should be executed to maximize the fill rate. It's a very esoteric rule. I mean an order type. But it shows that innovation is very, very alive inside the markets."", ""But at the same time, we've been able to develop really strong relationships across corporates, investors, banks and brokers, and other exchanges. So we now have become a technology provider to all of our clients, helping them navigate the markets with transparency tools, helping them be markets with our capital markets technology, and helping them manage risk in their regulatory obligations with the Adenza suite, which is Calypso and Axiom as well as with our anti-financial crime capabilities."", 'BRIAN SOZZI: Is this the year where we get a lot of AI companies that are private now come to market and come to market via the NASDAQ?', ""ADENA FRIEDMAN: I think that-- well, we hope they come to market via NASDAQ. I do think that AI-driven companies, AI-enabled companies, and AI companies themselves, those companies that can really help transform business, I think that those are the types of companies you'll see more and more of coming out into the public markets."", 'Very exciting time, I have to say, because every company can benefit from this next generation of technology. I think you can look at every industry and gen AI has applicability. So companies that help unlock that potential are going to be, I think, companies that a lot of investors are looking for.', ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. It definitely. Seems like there's demand I wanted to turn to a couple of ESG topics, because this is something the NASDAQ has been out front on. You have a board reporting requirements or at least explain reporting requirements where boards by the end of the year have to have at least one diverse candidate, a woman or someone who identifies as female or explain why they don't. You defeated a court challenge to that rule. There's been a backlash against some of this type of accountability, if you will. What do you think? Why did you guys decide to fight it through here?"", 'ADENA FRIEDMAN: Yeah. I think we have to look at the Genesis of the rule. The Genesis really was that it was really an investor-driven request from investors. They had been for years talking to us about disclosures around board composition as being one of the factors that they use in helping them understand the company.', 'And for certain investors, they have certain-- whether certain investment themes or just an understanding of the composition of the board is helpful. We as NASDAQ, we are one of several gatekeepers to the public markets. So we look at governance as part of our listing review.', ""But the fact of the matter is what we're really trying to do is provide investors with a very simple tool that enables them very quickly and easily to understand the composition of a board. And then to the extent that companies are looking to diversify their boards, they have at least one female-- person who self represents themselves as female, one person who self represents themselves as a minority, or the board can explain the company can explain why they don't."", ""And they could have lots of reasons for that. They could have chosen that they wanted other areas of expertise or other things to fill in the needs of their board. But this gives investors the opportunity to understand the company better and do it in a way that's comparable across companies. And I think that that's really what it was meant to do."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Yeah.', ""BRIAN SOZZI: Is it a diverse board, diverse thinking the way to go? Doesn't that make for a better company? And are you surprised that these discussions or this backlash against DEI is even happening?"", ""ADENA FRIEDMAN: Well, I think diversity comes in all forms. So our view is that boards should represent a diversity of expertise, a diversity of background. You should look at your own clients and say, does our board represent the people we serve? Then at the same time, it should also-- different experiences. And I'm always looking for really exciting people to serve on our board and people with the right experience, the right background."", ""And someone who also is representative of the people that we serve as clients and the people we serve internally as employees. And I can tell you, it makes for a better board discussions. It makes it so that I do feel like NASDAQ because of all of the efforts we've had around really general inclusion across the company and including our board has made us a better company."", ""BRIAN SOZZI: Fascinating discussion. Good to see you here on the ground at the World Economic Forum. NASDAQ CEO Adena Friedman, we'll see you back in New York City."", 'ADENA FRIEDMAN: Great. Thank you, guys. Thanks very much.']"

But outperforming years make stocks more expensive, so folks looking for opportunities in 2024 may find themselves having to pay a premium for top companies, especially growth stocks.', ""However, there were pockets of the market that didn't have such a great 2023. After surging in 2021 and 2022, energy stocks cooled off last year. As a result, many energy companies with rock-solid earnings are also trading at bargain prices."", ""Here's why Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN), Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ: FANG), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) are three overlooked dividend stocks worth scooping up this year."", ""Scott Levine (Devon Energy): Everyone loves a bargain. But to find an ultra-high-yielding dividend stock sitting in the bargain bin? That's an opportunity that doesn't come around often. Fortunately for income investors, though, this is exactly the situation with Devon Energy. Shares of the energy exploration and production company are available on sale, and at its current share price, its dividend yields 6.3%."", 'Unlike oil supermajors that operate throughout the energy value chain, Devon Energy is singularly focused on oil and natural gas production from its assets located in the United States including (but not limited to) the Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford Shale, and the Anadarko Basin.', ""Cautious investors might balk at the company's ultra-high-yielding dividend, but after drilling down into the company's financials, they'll find that the distribution doesn't represent as much risk as they might have initially feared. Devon Energy's dividend is split between a fixed payout and a variable payout that's based on the company's free cash flow generation. It's clear, therefore, that the dividend is quite sustainable and isn't jeopardizing the company's financial well-being."", ""This trend is expected to continue in 2024. In Devon Energy's third-quarter 2023 earnings presentation, management projected that the company will allocate 30% of its 2024 free cash flow to retiring debt and strengthening its balance sheet. It plans to return about 70% of free cash flow to shareholders."", ""Investors can gas up their portfolio with Devon Energy's stock on the cheap. Shares are valued at 4.4 times operating cash flow, a discount to their 5-year average of 5.1."", 'Lee Samaha (Diamondback Energy): The revenue, earnings, cash flow, and, ultimately, dividend prospects for oil and natural gas exploration and production companies are led by energy prices. While that statement rings true for Diamondback Energy, it would be a mistake to conclude that the stock is simply a leveraged play on the price of oil.', ""Diamondback Energy, similar to its peer Devon Energy, is trying to create more certainty around its dividend outcomes by dividing its payouts into a fixed base component and a variable component. In Diamondback's case, the current base dividend (protected down to the price of oil of $40 a barrel using hedging instruments) stands at $0.84 a quarter. Annualized, that quarterly base dividend comes to $3.36, offering a base dividend yield of 2.2% at the stock's current price. Based on management's projections, that's the least you can expect down to $40 a barrel."", 'However, Diamondback isn\'t a hedge fund. Its downside hedges start at $55 a barrel, meaning it has upside exposure to a price of oil above $55 a barrel. According to management\'s last letter to stockholders: ""We still expect to realize at least 95% of WTI when WTI is at least $65 per barrel, with most quarters above that number.""', ""Management's capital allocation policy involves returning its free cash flow to investors after the base dividend is paid and stock repurchases are made, up to a limit of 75% of overall free cash flow. For a taste of the results of this strategy, Diamondback paid a variable dividend of $2.53 in the third quarter, making a total dividend payout of $3.37. Annualizing that figure would give the stock a dividend yield of 8.6%."", ""While it's unrealistic to expect that payout on an ongoing basis, it's reasonable to assume a yield (based on the current stock price) in the range of 2.2% to 8.6% based on the price of oil ranging from $40 to $80 per barrel, making the stock attractive if you are comfortable with those ranges."", 'Daniel Foelber (ConocoPhillips): Over the last year, there has been a ton of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity in the oil patch. Enbridge bought three natural gas utilities from Dominion Energy. ExxonMobil is buying Pioneer Natural Resources, Chevron is buying Hess, and Occidental Petroleum is buying CrownRock. Within the last two weeks, APA announced it is buying Callon Petroleum. And on Thursday, Chesapeake Energy announced it is merging with Southwestern Energy.', 'Given all the M&A action, it may seem strange that ConocoPhillips, one of the largest U.S.-based exploration and production companies, has been relatively quiet. Part of the reason is that ConocoPhillips completed its acquisition of Concho Resources in January 2021. That was a massive deal for ConocoPhillips, and in many ways, it set the stage for the flurry of M&A activity that followed. But another reason is that ConocoPhillips tends to be fairly conservative.', 'The company operates an efficient business centered around low production costs and high cash-flow generation. Like its peers, ConocoPhillips was stress-tested in 2020. Impressively, it generated positive free cash flow even though WTI oil prices averaged below $40 that year. Since then, ConocoPhillips has been raking it in, including a record year for free cash flow in 2022.', 'On its Q3 earnings call, the company said it expects close to $22 billion in operating cash flow for 2023 and plans to return half of that to shareholders. ConocoPhillips\' dividend payouts consist of a set quarterly ""ordinary"" dividend, plus a variable dividend that depends on the performance of the business.', 'In 2023, ConocoPhillips paid $2.11 per share in ordinary dividends and $2.50 per share in variable dividends, good for $4.61 per share total and a yield of more than 4% based on the current price of the stock.', ""The system is effective because ConocoPhillips has a relatively low ordinary dividend obligation, so it won't have to cut its base dividend even during weak periods in the energy sector's cycle. But investors also directly benefit when the company generates outsized profits."", 'At a price-to-earnings ratio of merely 12.2 and price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of 13.1, ConocoPhillips is simply too cheap to ignore.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Devon Energy right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Devon Energy, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Devon Energy wasn't one of them.

Shale drilling and Canadian crude have provided them with cheaper, advantaged feedstocks compared with the days when the U.S. was importing close to 10 million barrels per day. Also, there hasn't been a lot of investment in new refineries in several years, so those that are operational have been running at high utilization rates. There are a lot of fixed costs to operate a refinery, but not that much in variable costs. So if a refiner can run at a high rate, it can be immensely profitable."", 'HF Sinclair is one of the U.S. midsize independent refiners. For all it lacks in size, it makes up for it with efficient operations and good capital allocation. For more than 30 years, the company has averaged a return on capital of 15.3%.', '2022 and 2023 were inordinately good years for HF Sinclair. The company was able to run its facilities at extremely high utilization rates and generated loads of cash as a result. Much of that went to paying down debt and buying back about 10% of total shares outstanding in the past year.', ""This may be the salad days for HF Sinclair, but even if earnings were to decline a bit, this stock looks incredibly cheap. Shares currently trade for 3.8 times free cash flow and 4.9 times earnings. Refining doesn't get the investor attention it deserves, and those looking to dig will find gems like HF Sinclair trading for dirt-cheap valuations."", ""Matt DiLallo (Enbridge): Canadian oil pipeline and natural gas infrastructure giant Enbridge is a proven wealth creator. Since 2000, the company has delivered a 12.4% average annualized total return. That has crushed the S&P 500's nearly 7% average annualized total return during that period. Enbridge has grown a $10,000 investment made in 2000 into more than $134,000. That compares with $68,000 for a similar investment in an S&P 500 index fund. "", ""One of the main factors fueling Enbridge's market-crushing total returns is its dividend. The company has delivered superior dividend growth. This year will mark its 29th straight year of increasing its payout. "", 'Enbridge should continue enriching investors in the future. It currently pays a monster 7.4% dividend, providing investors an excellent base return. The company supports that payout with very stable cash flow, as 98% comes from regulated rate structures or long-term contracts that insulate its earnings from the volatility of oil and gas prices. Enbridge pays 60% to 70% of its steady cash flow in dividends, retaining the rest to help fund its continued expansion. ', 'The company currently has a massive backlog of growth projects under construction. Those projects give it lots of visibility into future earnings growth. Enbridge estimates it can grow its earnings and cash flow by around a 5% compound annual rate over the medium term. That should fuel dividend growth at around a similar pace. Add its growing earnings to its high-yielding dividend, and Enbridge could have the power to produce an average annual total return in the double digits. That makes it a great way to grow your wealth from the oil patch. ', 'Jason Hall (Devon Energy): Oil prices have come down a lot in the past 18 months, falling from $120 per barrel in the summer of 2022 to the mid-$70s recently. Shares of Devon Energy have fallen along with crude; Brent futures are down about 42% from the 2022 peak, while Devon shares are down 44%.', ""Yes, lower oil prices have made Devon less profitable. Also yes, it's a dangerous bet that oil prices are just going to go higher. The nice thing about Devon at these oil prices, and the stock at these levels, is investors don't have to count on higher prices to still do pretty well. The company has generated almost $2.9 billion in free cash flow over the past year, proving its ability to make money with lower crude prices."", 'The board and management have also continued to stick to their plans to return excess cash back to shareholders, too, via a modest base dividend, share buybacks, and a variable dividend that moves up and down with cash flows. With a base dividend yield of around 2%, a history of generating the cash to juice the total payout substantially, and a price that works out to less than 10 times trailing free cash flow, I think Devon looks compelling now.', ""You'll want to keep it on a shorter leash than the stocks my colleagues offer up, but it's a money-maker at recent oil prices, and potentially a multibagger stock if oil prices move higher."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Devon Energy right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Devon Energy, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Devon Energy wasn't one of them.

Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement."", ""With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision."", 'Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR', 'Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.', 'The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', 'Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.', 'On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.', 'Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.', 'There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.', 'Is DVN a Good Investment?', 'Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Devon Energy, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 9.4% over the past month to $5.73.', ""Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for Devon Energy.

Neither are any economic reports scheduled to come out today. Nevertheless, we here at Zacks continue to keep you updated — if not for events happening in real time, then for what we can expect in this holiday-shortened week to come.First, let’s take a quick look back on the first two weeks of the new year. While we have already seen a couple sessions reminiscent of the robust positivity we saw in the final two weeks of trading in 2023, overall we’re down across all major indices: the S&P 500 is -0.16%, the Nasdaq -0.30%, the Dow -0.63% and the Russell 2000 well off its late-’23 pace, -4.57%. The +400 points the small-cap index made from late October through the end of the year has had some of its exuberance systematically removed since the dawn of the new year.Even though we’re only just half way through the month, the lion’s share of economic reports — non-earnings-season-related — have already happened for January: Jobs Week and the latest CPI/PPI numbers have spelled out both that the labor market in the U.S. remains strong and that inflation on both retail and wholesale levels are down year over year, to figures not seen since the run-up of the Great Reopening in the months following the pandemic.Not that Covid is done with us yet, but now with vaccinations and anti-viral treatments at our disposal, the very dismal prospects we saw four years ago of carrying on with a deadly virus have largely been abated. Common-sense solutions like not showing up in the office if you’re feeling under the weather, wearing a mask in public if you think you might be contagious or prone to catching a virus, etc. have now become integrated in most of our discourse. This means we can continue to grow and build, even if the coronavirus knocks some of us backwards now and again.Although this is a shorter trading week, we’ve got plenty on the docket. In scheduled economic prints alone, we expect Empire State Manufacturing Tuesday; Import Prices, Retail Sales and a new Fed Beige Book on Wednesday; Jobless Claims, the Philly Fed survey and Housing Starts/Building Permits on Thursday, plus enough reps from the Fed to shake a stick at. The next FOMC meeting starts two weeks from tomorrow; by this time next week they will be in a “blackout period” ahead of their Fed meeting.Also, earnings reports from Goldman Sachs GS and Morgan Stanley MS are out Tuesday; Prologis PLD and U.S. Bancorp USB and Wednesday; Thursday brings us J.B. Hunt JBHT and Fastenal FAST; and Friday shows us oilfield services giant SLB SLB and Dow component Travelers Insurance TRV.

These areas are renowned for their rich biodiversity, hosting a multitude of unique plant and animal species that have adapted to the lush and humid environments.

Despite a 3% annual growth rate between 2010 and 2019, exceeding regional economic growth, the sector lags behind the global average of 4.2%. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a 53.2% GDP drop and a 25.8% employment decline in 2020, with the Caribbean experiencing the second-fastest recovery in 2021, contributing 36.6% to GDP growth and creating 311,000 jobs.', ""The region's recovery is ongoing, with WTTC projecting 27.2% year-on-year Travel & Tourism GDP growth in the current year, although still below the global average of 43.7%.

There's potential for higher growth, reaching an annual rate of 6.7%, resulting in a US$ 96.6 billion Travel & Tourism GDP in 2032 and creating 1.34 million new jobs, up from US$ 50.5 billion in 2022."", 'Expedia Group, Inc.

This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction)."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate.

So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that FMC Technologies would post earnings of $0.20 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.21, delivering a surprise of +5%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success.

However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release."", 'Expected Results of an Industry Player', 'Another stock from the Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, Schlumberger (SLB), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.84 per share for the quarter ended December 2023.

That wouldn't have been such a bad decline if the S&P 500 hadn't been up 24.3% for the year. "", ""The main factor weighing on the oil stock was crude prices. Last year would have likely been much better for Occidental's investors if it hadn't been for lower oil prices. "", ""Crude prices took a breather last year, slumping more than 10%. That marked oil's first decline since 2020. "", ""Lower oil prices weighed on Occidental's cash flow. The company's operational cash flow totaled $9 billion through the third quarter, about $3.8 billion less than in the year-ago period. Meanwhile, Occidental's capital spending was more during the first nine months of last year ($4.7 billion) than all of 2022 ($4.5 billion). As a result, it only generated $4.4 billion in free cash flow through the third quarter, less than half its tally in the year-ago period. "", ""However, despite its slumping free cash flow, Occidental was still able to return cash to shareholders and make two notable acquisitions. It repurchased $1.8 billion of stock through the third quarter (60% of its 2023 target) and increased its dividend by 38.5%. That level of cash returns triggered the redemption of $1.5 billion of preferred equity owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. "", ""Speaking of Berkshire, it took advantage of Occidental's oil-fueled sell-off to buy more shares last year. The holding company has steadily increased its stake in the oil producer, growing it to 27.7% by the end of last year. It's Berkshire's sixth-largest holding at over $14.1 billion, or 3.9% of its portfolio. "", ""Meanwhile, Occidental took advantage of last year's more challenging market conditions to make a couple of acquisitions. It agreed to buy CrownRock for $12 billion in December to boost its position in the Permian Basin. Occidental estimates that the deal will increase its free cash flow by around $1 billion in the coming year, assuming oil prices average around $70 a barrel (right around the recent price). That helps support its plan of increasing its dividend by another 22%. "", ""Occidental Petroleum also bolstered its carbon capture platform. It acquired partner Carbon Engineering for $1.1 billion. The companies have been working on deploying direct air capture (DAC) technology since 2019. Meanwhile, Occidental brought in a new partner, signing a joint venture with BlackRock to invest $550 million into its STRATOS development, which will be the world's largest DAC facility when it comes online in 2025. "", ""While oil prices weighed on Occidental's cash flow last year, it still had a strong year. It generated lots of cash, giving it money to return to investors and invest in its future. Its free cash flow should grow in 2024, fueled by its CrownRock deal, with more growth potential ahead in 2025 when STRATOS comes online. "", ""Those factors make Occidental a compelling oil stock to buy for the long haul, which certainly seems to be Berkshire's view, given that Buffett's company continues to scoop up shares.

CEO of Berkshire Hathaway and titan of the investing industry for decades, Buffett is a role model for many investors with his value-oriented philosophies. Putting up market-beating returns since the 1950s -- yes, that\'s right, the 1950s -- he has earned the moniker, ""Oracle of Omaha.""', ""It can pay to track what Buffett is buying for his investment portfolio at Berkshire Hathaway. He recently made a big bet on U.S. energy stocks, with Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) becoming one of his largest positions. If you want to invest alongside Buffett, it may be smart to buy some Occidental Petroleum stock for your own portfolio. Here's why."", ""We can't read his mind, but Buffett probably likes Occidental Petroleum for a few reasons. First, we know that he values investing in the United States over other countries due to its favorable laws for businesses and shareholder rights. It is also his home country, and therefore easier to understand compared to a faraway nation."", ""Contrary to popular belief, the United States is now the world's largest oil producer due to the fracking boom, and is now energy independent. The U.S. produces over 13 million barrels of oil (or natural gas equivalents) per day, up from just over 5 million after the 2008 financial crisis."", 'Occidental Petroleum happens to be one of the largest oil and natural gas producers in the United States, taking advantage of this boom. It also has minimal international exposure, with under 20% of its petroleum production coming from foreign soil. This makes it much less susceptible to hostile foreign governments, which have been a thorn in the side of oil companies for decades.', ""One of the tenets of Buffett's investing philosophy is to never overpay for an asset. If you buy a stock at an expensive multiple of 30 times earnings, it will be much harder for it to do well compared to buying the same company at 10x earnings. Occidental Petroleum checks this box. It currently has a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 12.5, which is around half the S&P 500 average."", 'Inverting this number, the stock has an earnings yield of 8%. What does this mean? Investors in Occidental Petroleum such as Berkshire Hathaway will get an 8% return in earnings each year by holding the stock at these prices, just as long as the company continues to earn its current annual net income. Buffett wants to bet on durable assets with high earnings yields, which describes Occidental stock.', ""With these earnings, Occidental management is actually buying up more energy assets in the United States to increase the cash flow coming in for shareholders like Buffett. It recently acquired natural gas producer CrownRock for $12 billion, which will add $1 billion in free cash flow generation assuming a $70 oil price (oil is currently trading at around $72). This should increase Occidental's earnings power over the long term."", ""Lastly, Buffett likes to bet on companies with management teams that return capital to shareholders. If you look at his largest investments, they all either have growing share repurchase programs or dividend payout programs (or both). This allows shareholders such as Berkshire Hathaway to take in some of the company's earnings each and every year."", 'Unsurprisingly, Occidental Petroleum checks this box off too. It has shrunk its share count by 6% in the last three years, and recently boosted its quarterly dividend payout to $0.22 per share. On an annualized basis that is a dividend yield of 1.5% based on its current share price of $57, a yield that has room to consistently grow in the coming years.', ""All this sounds great. But don't expect this stock to immediately rocket higher in 2024. An energy producer such as Occidental Petroleum is beholden to oil prices, which can be volatile depending on how the world economy is doing. If oil prices sink in 2024, the stock will likely do poorly."", 'However, for those with a long-term time horizon, Occidental looks like a promising asset in a country with a safe business environment, and it boasts rational management and a stock trading at cheap levels. No wonder Berkshire Hathaway now owns close to 25% of the company.', 'As his long-standing partner Charlie Munger used to say, it is not in the buying but the holding that makes an investor money. If you want to bet on U.S. energy independence alongside Buffett, now could be a great time to buy Occidental Petroleum and hold for many years.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Occidental Petroleum right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Occidental Petroleum, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Occidental Petroleum wasn't one of them.

Companies such as Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) are multi-billion dollar enterprises that are capable of selling millions of coffee cups a day. Coffee powers up officer workers during their lunch and break times, making sure that the monotonous working environment of the modern day office does not lead to any productivity drops.', ""Apart from being crucial for productivity, coffee's history also makes it quite important when we talk about social gatherings. Beverages such as coffee and tea are consumed by vast chunks of the global population, a fact that is evident when we consider that in 2021, China, the world's biggest tea producer, produced a whopping 3 million tons of beverage. Insider Monkey also took a look at global tea production in terms of unprocessed tea leaves. This also revealed that China was the world's biggest tea producer as it churned out a cool 13.76 million tons of tea leaves in 2021."", ""Coming back to coffee, there are a lot of coffee stocks that are available for trading on the stock market apart from Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX). Just like they do with high growth sectors such as technology, hedge funds also invest in coffee stocks. Some broader factors that can influence coffee stocks are quite similar to what one would expect from energy stocks. For instance, for commodities such as coffee, weather plays an important role in ensuring global supply chain stability. A destroyed coffee crop creates imbalances in the supply chain and prevents processors' ability to meet the requirements of their customers. Negative weather disruptions drive prices higher, and other factors include political turmoil in major coffee producing countries. Insider Monkey took a look at the forecasted coffee production of countries for the marketing year 2023/2024 as part of our coverage of the Top 20 Coffee Producing Countries in the World to discover that the three top coffee producing countries in the world are Brazil, Vietnam, and Colombia."", ""Shifting to coffee stocks, when it comes to the number of hedge funds out of the 910 that were part of Insider Monkey's database for the third quarter of last year, seven companies saw more than twenty hedge fund investors.

(NYSE:KR), Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), and McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), with 41, 60, and 70 hedge fund investors, respectively. Looking at the recent news surrounding the more coffee focused companies in this list such as Restaurant Brands International Inc. (NYSE:QSR), The J.M. Smucker Company (NYSE:SJM), and Starbucks, all three have exhibited a degree of financial stability during the highly inflationary environment that has characterized consumer spending patterns in 2023 and before. Among the trio, J.M. Smucker has beaten analyst EPS estimates in all of its four latest quarters, while the other two have missed estimates only for the fiscal results of Q4 2022."", ""\xa0These firms are responsible for delivering the processed coffee bean to the consumer and they lie downstream in the global coffee supply chain. A coffee bean goes through a long process from the seeds that are planted in countries such as Brazil before it can make it to a bottle of Nestlé S.A. (OTC:NSRGY)'s instant coffee. Coffee beans are roasted after being harvested, with this part in the production process responsible for different blends such as Arabica and Robusta. A coffee's flavor depends on the time that the coffee bean spends being roasted, after which it is ground up and then prepared into a ready made form for daily consumption."", ""As to the outlook of the global coffee industry, it's quite bright when we consider comments made by the management of Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) during a recent earnings call where they shared:"", 'The outstanding financial returns of new stores give us confidence we will reach our goal of 9,000 stores by 2025, opening nearly 1,000 net new stores every year. Finally, the September opening of the China Coffee Innovation Park, designed to be our most energy-efficient and sustainable coffee manufacturing and distribution center in the world, further signaled our commitment to the largest consumer market in the world and the growth of our business in China for China. We look forward to sharing more on the headroom we see in China later today. The momentum against the backdrop of headwinds in China this past year gives us optimism in our position and affirm our distinctive competitive advantages for our business.

Estimates show that as much as 30% of the total global coffee production comes from Brazil, making Brazilian coffee beans important for the stability of the global coffee industry.

Thousands of companies sell Brazilian coffee beans, and the industry for instant coffee is much less saturated.', ""Insider Monkey's Score: 9.25"", 'The Ethiopian Harrar is one of the most well known coffee beans in the world. It is a dry processed coffee bean, which is quite flavorful when compared to some other Ethiopian coffee beans. The Harrar is also one of the oldest coffee beans in the world, and the fact that it is dry roasted means that generations of coffee roasters pass down the right skill through time.', ""Insider Monkey's Score: 9 "", 'Panama is a Central American country that is also one of the smallest in the world when it comes to the area. The bulk of Panamanian coffee production is Arabica, and one of the best known Panamanian coffee beans is the Gesha bean.

Since then, the company has increased 43,000 times in value under his leadership, compounding twice as fast as the S&P 500. Today, Berkshire has a market capitalization of $800 billion, and its $360 billion stock portfolio factors heavily into that valuation.', 'Buffett reportedly manages about 90% of that portfolio, and the biggest positions are generally under his control. That includes Cola-Cola (NYSE: KO), a stock he started buying in 1988 at a split-adjusted price of $0.69 per share. Berkshire now has a $24 billion stake in the beverage company, meaning it accounts for 6.6% of its entire portfolio.', ""To add context, Berkshire only has three bigger positions: Apple at 47.1%, Bank of America at 9.5%, and American Express at 7.8%. Given that asset allocation, it's fair to assume Buffett has a great deal of conviction in Coca-Cola, so investors (especially income investors) would be wise to consider the stock."", 'Coca-Cola is part of an elite group of stocks known as Dividend Kings. These are companies that have increased their dividends annually for at least 50 consecutive years. Coca-Cola more than meets those criteria. Its payout has increased for 61 consecutive years, making it one of the safest dividend stocks on the planet.', ""In 2023, the company paid a dividend of $0.46 per share quarterly, or $1.84 per share for the year. History says the payout will increase in 2024, but the extent of that increase is impossible to guess. So I'll assume $1.84 per share to keep things simple. At that level, $10,000 invested in Coca-Cola (about 167 shares) would generate $307.28 in annual dividend income."", ""The stock has a dividend yield of 3.08%, more than double the S&P 500's dividend yield of 1.47%. Of course, an above-average yield means nothing if the stock declines substantially. But Coca-Cola is on solid financial footing, and it has reasonable growth prospects for a century-old company."", 'Buffett believes Coca-Cola benefits from a durable economic moat built on brand authority and pricing power, qualities he sees as essential to long-term capital appreciation. He once highlighted the resilience of that moat by saying, ""If you gave me $100 billion and said take away the soft-drink leadership of Coca-Cola in the world, I\'d give it back to you and say it can\'t be done.""', 'Effective marketing and a broad network of bottling and distribution partners -- Coca-Cola has assembled the largest beverage distribution system in the world -- have positioned the company as the leader in carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) across most geographies. For instance, in the United States, Coca-Cola accounts for about 46% of CSD sales by volume, giving the company nearly twice as much market share as PepsiCo.', 'The upshot is that Coca-Cola has an iconic brand, unparalleled distribution capabilities, and a leadership position in the market. Those qualities create pricing power and cost advantages that allow the company to consistently earn a higher profit margin than its peers, as shown in the chart below.', 'Greater profitability allows Coca-Cola to reinvest more heavily in strategic growth areas. For instance, management sees considerable growth opportunities with its core carbonated beverage portfolio in emerging markets across Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region.', 'The company is also pursuing opportunities in non-carbonated beverage categories like coffee (Costa) and sports drinks (Powerade, BodyArmor). Additionally, Coca-Cola recently started experimenting with alcoholic beverages.', 'Coca-Cola reported reasonably good financial results in the September quarter. Revenue increased 8% to $12 billion, driven by modest growth in unit case volume and more substantial price increases, and GAAP net income climbed 9% to $0.71 per share. During the quarter, Coca-Cola reinforced its leadership position in non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages by gaining market share in EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa), North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.', 'Going forward, Wall Street expects Coca-Cola to increase earnings per share at 6% annually over the long term. That forecast makes its valuation of 24.1 times earnings look a bit expensive. From that price, Coca-Cola may not beat the market over the next five years -- indeed, it underperformed the S&P 500 last year -- but the stock still looks attractive for income investors.', 'Coca-Cola is a highly profitable company with a durable moat and reasonable growth prospects. Those qualities should support annual dividend increases for the foreseeable future. Investors willing to exchange some price appreciation for a safe, above-average dividend check should buy a position in Coca-Cola stock today. As mentioned earlier, every 167 shares (currently about $10,000) will generate about $307 in annual dividend income.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Coca-Cola wasn't one of them.

You can probably see where I’m going with this.', 'As a major supplier of lumber – obviously a key material for building new homes – Weyerhaeuser may benefit as the home building industry moves to address the housing shortage. Further, broader economic trends might come into play. With the Federal Reserve possibly set to lower interest rates this year, the move may improve affordability. Thus, greater demand would call for increased materials for home building needs.', 'Right now, the company offers a forward dividend yield of 2.23%. Granted, that’s noticeably lower than other companies structured as real estate investment trusts (REITs). At the same time, the payout ratio comes in at 53.44%, which is much lower than your typical REIT. Combined with the forward relevancy, WY ranks among reliable dividend stocks.', 'Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com', 'A financial services firm that owns and operates Discover Bank, Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) may be best known for its credit card services. According to its corporate profile, Discover represents the third-largest credit card brand in the U.S. Now, to be blunt, I’ve been a bit hesitant about the business considering the record plastic debt load. Still, a monetary policy pivot could change things.', 'Last month, the Federal Reserve hinted at the possibility of interest rate cuts. Fundamentally, this represented a huge departure from the prior hawkish policy of raising borrowing costs. Suddenly, previously embattled sector – such as the solar energy space – rebounded conspicuously. And this dynamic could also lift the consumer economy. After all, people were spending amid elevated rates. Imagine what they might spend under a dovish environment?', 'If you’d like to speculate on this prospect, Discover offers a forward yield of 2.49%. That’s a bit underweight compared to the financial services space. However, Discover also enjoys a superior cash-to-debt ratio of 0.47X. As well, the payout ratio sits at a sustainable 18.52%, making DFS one of the reliable dividend stocks.', 'Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com', 'While Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) might be another boring entity among reliable dividend stocks, the beauty here is the relevance. As a multinational digital communications technology company, Cisco specializes in networking hardware, software and related equipment. Basically, it’s vital to the development and proper operation of the vast telecom infrastructure. In other words, it’s not going out of style anytime soon.', 'Further, within the communications space, Cisco offers a broad range of services. For example, the company invests heavily in cybersecurity, an area that should draw attention given the consequences of high-profile breaches. Just as well, Cisco enjoys a robust cash-to-debt ratio of 3.08X, better than the industry median metric of 1.3X. While it prints average revenue growth, it’s consistently profitable.', 'And that translates to greater confidence in the underlying forward yield of 3.09%. In contrast, the broader tech sector average yield is only 1.37%. Also, it’s worth pointing out that the payout ratio sits at a very sustainable 38.76%. Thus, CSCO makes a great case for reliable dividend stocks to buy.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

By radically driving sequencing costs down, Ultima has changed the economics of genomics so that other costs in the testing value chain become critically important. DGX’s capabilities in solid tumor and blood testing can further drive down the costs while increasing access, allowing more people to benefit from the clinically rich insights of whole genome sequencing.', 'According to Quest Diagnostics’ provided estimates, approximately 1,958,310 new cancer cases and 609,820 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States in 2023.

The Atlanta-based airline behemoth reported better-than-expected revenues and earnings per share in the December quarter. Strong holiday air travel demand aided results. However, high labor costs resulted in the bottom line shrinking 13.5%.Salaries and related costs rose 23% to $3,769 million. The increase was due to higher wages arising from the contract with pilots that was ratified in March 2023. Another disappointing aspect of the quarterly earnings report was the 24% year-over-year decline in cargo revenue.', 'More than the above disappointments, it was the trimming of the 2024 earnings guidance due to supply-chain woes and economic uncertainty, which spooked investors. Management now expects 2024 adjusted earnings in the range of $6-$7 (projected to be above $7 previously). Supply chain disruptions are leading to high maintenance costs, which increased 13% and 23% in fourth-quarter 2023 and full-year 2023, respectively. Since DAL’s results generally serve as a harbinger of what to expect across the industry, its disappointing guidance and the resultant stock price depreciation caused other airlines to shed value on Friday.', 'DAL’s earnings guidance apart, the northward movement in oil price on Friday was a headwind for airline stocks, leading to their price depreciation. Oil price climbed nearly 1% on Friday to settle at $72.68 a barrel. The airstrikes carried out by the United States and the UK against Houthi targets in Yemen, in response to recent ship attacks in the Red Sea, resulted in an uptick in oil prices.', 'The northward movement in oil prices is not a welcome development for airline stocks. This is because expenses on fuel represent a significant input cost for airlines. Therefore, an increase in fuel costs hurts bottom-line growth.', 'For example, oil price increased in third-quarter 2023, primarily due to the extension of production cut by Saudi Arabia and Russia through 2023-end. At UAL, average fuel price increased 10.3% sequentially in the September quarter. UAL expects the metric to be $3.28 in fourth-quarter 2023. UAL will release its fourth-quarter results on Jan 22.', 'At American Airlines, average fuel price increased 11% sequentially in third-quarter 2023 to $2.91 per gallon. The metric is expected to be in the $3.01-$3.11 band in fourth-quarter 2023. AAL will release its fourth-quarter results on Jan 25.', 'At the Dallas-based Southwest Airlines, economic fuel price per gallon in third-quarter 2023 was $2.78, up 6.9% from second-quarter 2023 levels. LUV forecasts fourth-quarter economic fuel cost per gallon in the $3 to $3.1 band. Like AAL, LUV too will release its fourth-quarter results on Jan 25.', 'Like Delta, labor costs are likely to have been high for other airlines too, in turn hurting bottom-line growth. With U.S. airlines grappling with labor shortage in the post-COVID-19 high-demand scenario, the bargaining power of various labor groups has naturally increased. As a result, we have seen pay-hike deals being inked in the space. This is resulting in a spike in labor costs.', 'For example, in August 2023, American Airlines pilots, represented by Allied Pilots Association, approved a four-year deal pertaining to wage increases. The approval makes AAL’s pilots eligible for an immediate pay raise in excess of 21% on average. Also, the deal includes provisions aimed at improving pilots’ quality of life.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad."", 'Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams ', ""The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Over the last three years, Sherwin-Williams has grown EPS by 11% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up."", ""Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. The music to the ears of Sherwin-Williams shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 13% to 16% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth."", 'In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.', ""While we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for Sherwin-Williams?"", ""Insider interest in a company always sparks a bit of intrigue and many investors are on the lookout for companies where insiders are putting their money where their mouth is. This view is based on the possibility that stock purchases signal bullishness on behalf of the buyer. However, insiders are sometimes wrong, and we don't know the exact thinking behind their acquisitions."", 'Insider selling of Sherwin-Williams shares was insignificant compared to the one buyer, over the last twelve months. Specifically the Executive Chairman, John Morikis, spent US$1.0m, paying about US$232 per share. That certainly piques our interest.', 'Along with the insider buying, another encouraging sign for Sherwin-Williams is that insiders, as a group, have a considerable shareholding. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$217m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.3% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.', 'While insiders already own a significant amount of shares, and they have been buying more, the good news for ordinary shareholders does not stop there. The cherry on top is that the CEO, Heidi Petz is paid comparatively modestly to CEOs at similar sized companies. For companies with market capitalisations over US$8.0b, like Sherwin-Williams, the median CEO pay is around US$12m.', ""The Sherwin-Williams CEO received total compensation of just US$3.5m in the year to December 2022. That's clearly well below average, so at a glance that arrangement seems generous to shareholders and points to a modest remuneration culture. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally."", ""One important encouraging feature of Sherwin-Williams is that it is growing profits. Better yet, insiders are significant shareholders, and have been buying more shares. These factors alone make the company an interesting prospect for your watchlist, as well as continuing research. You should always think about risks though. Case in point, we've spotted   1 warning sign for Sherwin-Williams  you should be aware of."", ""Keen growth investors love to see insider buying.

In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments."", ' See our latest analysis for American Water Works Company ', 'The formula for ROE is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for American Water Works Company is:', '9.3% = US$920m ÷ US$9.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.09 in profit."", ""Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification.

Our risks dashboardshould have the 4 risks we have identified for American Water Works Company."", ""Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same."", ""American Water Works Company does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.23. With a fairly low ROE, and significant use of debt, it's hard to get excited about this business at the moment. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it."", ""Return on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE."", ""Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock.

And yes, it is a top product here, I\'ve been drinking it all week.', ""RAMON LAGUARTA: Yeah, that's good. That's why you have so much energy."", ""BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, it's a good point. So talk to us about some of the priorities for you here on the ground at the World Economic Forum."", ""RAMON LAGUARTA: This is a very important week for us. It's an important week in terms of learning, especially, it's a unique opportunity for me to see people from different industries, get a cross-industry understanding of what's going on around the world, geopolitics, forecasting for economy."", ""But then, from the PepsiCo out, our focus is food systems transformation. We want to-- we've been working on food system transformation for a long time. As you know, we're a large food company. You mentioned Pepsi, but we have Lay's, we have Doritos, we have Quaker, we have many other brands. So food is a large part of our business."", ""We think that the food system needs to be transformed to make it sustainable, to make it profitable for the farmer. And that's something we've been working on for a long time. The transformation will happen one farmer at a time. And a lot of our efforts is convening an ecosystem of players that can help transforming that farmer-- one at a time, technical understanding, financial knowledge, cultural disruption for them in how they adopt new practices that will make them more sustainable long term will protect the soil and will make agriculture more sustainable. And that's our focus for this week."", 'BRIAN SOZZI: I think-- I think most sane people could agree, climate change is a thing. As that continues, and in some cases, get worse over the next 10, 20, 30, 40 years, is there a way to protect the PepsiCo business?', ""RAMON LAGUARTA: Well, that's why we're so intentional about the agriculture and the food system. At the end-- we will be successful 20 years from now if we have resilient agriculture everywhere we play. So that's one of the elements. Of course, then, we need to evolve our portfolio to make it sustainable for people and make sure that it's great tasting and nutritious and everything else."", ""There is, obviously, waste management and everything else, those are areas where we're very focused as well. And we want to create the right momentum politically and financially to build recycling infrastructure, which in many countries around the world isn't existing, including the US, where we have great opportunities to build a consumer understanding, but most importantly, the infrastructure to take waste back into companies like ours. That we're willing to recycle, we're willing to-- our bottles to be 100% rPET versus 30% or 20% that we have today in some parts of the portfolio."", 'BRIAN SOZZI: We were talking to the CEO of NASDAQ, Adena Friedman, on the ground here at the World Economic Forum. And she was talking about the remake of her company, a lot of focus on technology. And it made me think about what you have done under your leadership at PepsiCo, a series of big acquisitions. I think back to rock stars, the brand that I know, taking a stake in Celsius, another product that I consume around the clock virtually. Why are you making some of these deals? And what is triggering them, ultimately?', ""RAMON LAGUARTA: Well, in our strategy of transformation of the portfolio or new capabilities that we need to be, as we were saying, successful 20 years from now, there's a lot of things we can do ourselves. There's a lot of things that make more sense to go and acquire. For example, one that I'm very proud of-- and I think it's going to pay for us long term is SodaStream."", ""SodaStream is a platform that will allow us to transform our beverage business. And I believe that long term, we'll be able to empower consumers to create their own drinks and to combine it in ways that they like. And we will eliminate plastic. We'll eliminate a lot of unnecessary, logistic costs, and things that create pollution."", ""And those are-- it is very difficult for us to create a SodaStream, so we need to go and acquire a SodaStream. And there's more cases like that where if you buy in a scale business, then your business focuses on that platform. And it's much easier to develop."", ""A lot of our strategic choices, we make them from PepsiCo out. So we develop ourselves, we have great R&D capabilities, we have other capabilities that allow us to build businesses, new brands from zero. And so it's a combination of both platforms, how we think about the future of the company."", 'BRIAN SOZZI: How did the pandemic change how you think about making products. I really-- I think, you gave me the term in your last earnings call. You called it unstructured meals. I never heard that before.', ""RAMON LAGUARTA: Well, that is-- I don't think the pandemic changed that. I think this has been a global trend for many years. If you think about lifestyle evolutions and urbanization and dual-income families and all that."", 'Unstructured meals means that more and more calories are being eaten in informal sit-down meals with the full family. And I think we have a unique opportunity to build the right set of solutions for consumers as they think about nutrition, convenience, taste, that triangle that is very strategic. So we think that that is a big idea for us.', ""We think our brands belong in food meals. A lot of consumers think about our brands as snacks. And I think our brands belong in meals more and more. And that's where we're evolving some of our innovation, to provide consumers with more satiating solutions that-- basically, you're substituting a meal with some of our products."", ""BRIAN SOZZI: You've done a large part of your life's work here at PepsiCo. You've taken sugar out of products. You've reduced calories, salt content, and really pivoted to better for you products in the Frito-Lay business, for example. Does it bother you that a lot of these products are being called ultra processed? And what does that word even mean to you?"", ""RAMON LAGUARTA: Yeah, and I don't like the word ultra processed. And I don't believe in it. I think we are using kitchen logic to define our products. So what we're trying to do is things that consumers do at home, we're going to do it at scale in our large plant."", ""So we call our plants actually large kitchens. And the people that are working the lines, when you talk to them, they'll call themselves cooks. So we're using kitchen logic to say we can give consumers great tasting products, nutritious-- as you said, we've been at this for many, many years."", ""And this debate of vilifying anything that is packaged goods almost, and call it ultra processed, I think it's not going to help us move towards food safety and what is giving people food around the world. So it's a debate that is a little bit nuanced."", ""And we have to bring clarity in what is ultra processed. I don't think our products are at all ultra processed. Our products are follow kitchen logic, and are just good packaged solutions for consumers that need solutions throughout the day and around the world."", 'BRIAN SOZZI: Does that debate push you and your team to moving faster reinventing products?', ""RAMON LAGUARTA: Yes. And I think we've been at this for many years, but in the last few years, we've accelerated even more the transformation of our portfolio. So you will see in the US, Lay's already salted that are below WHO levels of sodium. And that's something that three years ago, we didn't even-- we were scared to do it. We thought the consumer would be very negative."", ""The consumer is actually embracing these solutions at scale. And including countries like the US, where the levels of sugar and salt are higher than other parts of the world. So we're very-- we feel very strong, and we feel very-- like I think we have the solutions to how we transform our portfolio into better options with the same great taste, which I think is the intersection the consumer is looking for."", ""BRIAN SOZZI: And no impact from weight loss drugs. I mean, these drugs, to me, seem confined to the East Coast, West Coast. There's the whole middle America is still consuming your products. Do you see any impact from that yet?"", 'RAMON LAGUARTA: Well, the-- I think the East Coast and the West Coast also consume our products. So--', 'BRIAN SOZZI: I can attest to that.', ""RAMON LAGUARTA: And I'm happy for that. But so the obesity drugs-- we've been studying this for a long time now. There's still a lot of unknowns on how big this could be, the level of adoption, and how fast it could go. Our current assumptions is that this will be a long-term, if anything, adoption in the US."", ""And that also, the consumers that we're seeing taking the drugs, they have a very balanced diet. And actually, they continue to eat our snacks and our drinks. And so our portfolio is almost naturally hedged against the consumer behavior changes that we're observing when people adopt the drugs."", ""And it's going to be a small burn. It's not going to happen overnight. So we'll have time to continue to double down on our R&D capabilities, evolve the portfolio, maybe even accelerate if needed. Or as you were saying, there could be M&A opportunities that we can use to complement some of the maybe protein spaces where we have some brands, or maybe not enough, or some other opportunities that we might see in the portfolio as we understand better what are the behavioral changes that consumers have when they take these sort of medications."", ""BRIAN SOZZI: I told you off camera, PepsiCo is one of the first companies I wrote about as a young reporter. I think I'm in 15 years in to covering this company. And I've always been amazed by the consistency and performance."", ""And one stat that I came across recently, you have beaten your earnings estimates by 55 straight quarters. That's not even normal. But I think to do that, it says a lot about leadership. And it says a lot about your leadership at the company. Talk to us about how you lead a company like PepsiCo, a global company like PepsiCo. Some of your, I guess, tips to success."", 'RAMON LAGUARTA: Some principles that I have-- the one principle, as you said in the talk, you mentioned the word global. I think we are actually a set of local companies. And the way I think about us in the marketplace is we need to win in 200 markets where we participate. And the equation for success in every market is different.', ""So I want to have very empowered general managers that think end-to-end about how to optimize the cost structure, the portfolio, the talent base that we have to win in that market. That is enabled by a global company in technology, data, values, culture, obviously financial capabilities. But that's the way I think about the company."", ""Now I think also about the company with the concept that I use in my life all the time, which is perform to potential. I think my role is to help the organization reach its potential all the time, which means every individual needs to be inspired to reach its potential, and the teams need to be inspired to reach its potential, which is not easy. But it's a good mental model on how you drive an organization."", 'Another principle of mine is big changes to big things. And, you know--', ""BRIAN SOZZI: Which you've done at PepsiCo."", ""RAMON LAGUARTA: And it's-- sometimes, it's not easy, because obviously, there is a risk aversion in the teams. But you can inspire people to make big changes to big things, take bigger risks, and reach the potential of the company. So that's how I'm thinking about the organization."", ""I like transparency. I like trust. I like empowerment. I think those are ways how you run an organization of our scale in today's world. Because the truth is that the last four years, five years have shown us that you cannot run a company from a central point."", ""This is a-- there's so much going on, and there's local events. You just mentioned some geopolitics. You know, devaluations-- everything happening. You cannot have a company run from a point of-- central point. You need to empower the organization to run it."", ""And we have great people. We have great talent. We've always been investing in people. I came from the bottom of the company. And I know the kind of people we have and how important they are to the success of the company."", ""And I believe that, for example, AI will help us become an even more empowered company. We'll be able to move more decision making, more information to the frontline. And they will really be the owners of a lot of decisions. They make many, many decisions every day. If we can help them make better decisions every day, the company will be better. So those are philosophies on how I run the business. And they are a bit my personality and I guess my experience as well."", ""BRIAN SOZZI: Well, it's a real treat to get some time with you here at the World Economic Forum. Ramon Laguarta, chairman and CEO of PepsiCo. We'll talk to you soon, and enjoy the rest of the week."", 'RAMON LAGUARTA: Thank you very much, Brian.', 'BRIAN SOZZI: Appreciate it.', 'RAMON LAGUARTA: Great, thanks.']"

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has updated the label for Dupixent® (dupilumab) in atopic dermatitis, adding efficacy and safety data for patients aged 12 years and older with atopic dermatitis with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe hand and/or foot involvement. These Phase 3 data are from the first and only trial evaluating a biologic specifically for this difficult-to-treat population and have also been added to the Dupixent label in the European Union, with regulatory submissions underway in additional countries.', '“We rely heavily on our hands and feet throughout the day, making atopic dermatitis particularly disruptive for patients who experience constant itch and painful cracking and bleeding skin lesions on these critical areas of the body,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., Board co-Chair, President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron, and a principal inventor of Dupixent. “Dupixent has been used to treat hundreds of thousands of patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis around the world since its initial U.S. approval in 2017, and we are pleased that Dupixent is now the first biologic with data in the label supporting its use in this particularly challenging subset of the disease.”', '“Living with atopic dermatitis on your most essential body areas like the hands and feet can make daily activities including walking and writing incredibly burdensome even in the case where disease symptoms are mild elsewhere. Unfortunately, treating atopic dermatitis on the hands and feet has historically been difficult and there have been no Phase 3 trials evaluating a biologic in this population of patients,” said Naimish Patel, M.D., Head of Global Development, Immunology and Inflammation at Sanofi. “Having these data added for this difficult-to-treat population is important for physicians looking for tools to treat these patients and reinforces the already well-established efficacy and safety of Dupixent in atopic dermatitis overall.”', 'The label update is based on data from the Phase 3 LIBERTY-AD-HAFT trial. In the trial, patients received Dupixent (n=67) every two weeks (adults 300 mg, adolescents 200 mg or 300 mg based on body weight) or placebo (n=66).

Patients with hand and foot disease predominantly driven by allergic or irritant contact dermatitis were excluded from the trial.', 'The primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients with clear or almost clear skin of hand and feet eczema at 16 weeks, as measured by a score of 0 or 1 on the Investigator Global Assessment Scale.
