But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. For example, the Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) share price has soared 136% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. In the last week the share price is up 2.0%."", ""So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns."", ' See our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific ', ""To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price."", ""During five years of share price growth, Thermo Fisher Scientific achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 19% per year. This EPS growth is remarkably close to the 19% average annual increase in the share price. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS."", 'You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).', ""Dive deeper into Thermo Fisher Scientific's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Thermo Fisher Scientific's earnings, revenue and cash flow."", ""As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Thermo Fisher Scientific, it has a TSR of 139% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!"", ""Thermo Fisher Scientific shareholders are down 1.9% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 26%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 19% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Thermo Fisher Scientific better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - Thermo Fisher Scientific has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of."", 'Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

At that rate, it would take 14.5 days of December production to break the record.

That won’t happen until March or April of next year. But at most it would shift the record date by a day or two.

The legislation would also take other steps to treat gold and silver as money instead of as commodities.', 'In Missouri, Rep Doug Richey filed HB1867 on Dec. 11. Rep. Bill Hardwick filed HB1955 on Dec. 15. The bills are companions to SB735 filed in the Senate by Sen. William Eigel earlier this month.', 'In Oklahoma, Sen. Shane Jett filed SB1507 and Sen. Nathan Dahm is running SB1508.', 'The enactment of any of these bills would eliminate state capital gains taxes on the sale and exchange of gold and silver bullion.', 'Both of these states are already among the 42 that do not levy sales taxes on gold and silver bullion.', 'Exempting the sale of gold and silver bullion from taxes lowers the investment cost of precious metals. It also takes a step toward treating gold and silver as money instead of commodities. Taxes on precious metal bullion erect barriers to using gold and silver as money by raising transaction costs.', 'Imagine if you asked a grocery clerk to break a $5 bill and he charged you a 35-cent tax. Silly, right? After all, you were only exchanging one form of money for another. But that’s essentially what a sales tax on gold and silver bullion does. By eliminating this tax on the exchange of gold and silver, Missouri and Oklahoma would treat specie as money instead of a commodity. This represents a small step toward reestablishing gold and silver as legal tender and breaking down the Fed’s monopoly on money.', '“We ought not to tax money – and that’s a good idea. It makes no sense to tax money,” former U.S. Rep. Ron Paul said during testimony in support of an Arizona bill that repealed capital gains taxes on gold and silver in that state. “Paper is not money, it’s fraud,” he continued.', 'The impact of enacting this legislation will go beyond mere tax policy. During an event after his Senate committee testimony, Paul pointed out that it’s really about the size and scope of government.', '“If you’re for less government, you want sound money. The people who want big government, they don’t want sound money. They want to deceive you and commit fraud. They want to print the money. They want a monopoly. They want to get you conditioned, as our schools have conditioned us, to the point where deficits don’t matter.”', 'Under provisions in the Missouri bill, gold and silver in physical or electronic form would be accepted as legal tender and would be receivable in payment of all debts contracted for in the state of Missouri. The state would be required to accept gold and silver for the payment of public debts. Private debts could be settled in gold and silver at the parties’ discretion.', 'Practically speaking, this would allow Missourians to use gold or silver coins as money rather than just as mere investment vehicles. In effect, it would put gold and silver on the same footing as Federal Reserve notes.', 'Oklahoma took a similar step in 2014. Utah and Arkansas also consider gold and silver legal tender.', 'The proposed Missouri law also includes provisions authorizing the state to invest in gold or silver “greater than or equal to one percent of all state funds” and to expressly bar any state agency, department, or political subdivision from seizing gold or silver bullion.', 'The United States Constitution states in Article I, Section 10, “No State shall…make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts.” Currently, all debts and taxes in the US are either paid with Federal Reserve Notes (dollars) which were authorized as legal tender by Congress, or with coins issued by the US Treasury — very few of which have gold or silver in them.', 'The Federal Reserve destroys this constitutional monetary system by creating a monopoly based on its fiat currency. Without the backing of gold or silver, the central bank can easily create money out of thin air. This not only devalues your purchasing power over time; it also allows the federal government to borrow and spend far beyond what would be possible in a sound money system. Without the Fed, the US government wouldn’t be able to maintain all of its unconstitutional wars and programs. The Federal Reserve is the engine that drives the most powerful government in the history of the world.', 'Tax repeals knock down one of the tax barriers that hinder the use of gold and silver as money, and could also begin the process of abolishing the Federal Reserve’s fiat money system by attacking it from the bottom up – pulling the rug out from under it by working to make its functions irrelevant at the state and local levels, and setting the stage to undermine the Federal Reserve monopoly by introducing competition into the monetary system.', 'In a paper presented at the Mises Institute, Constitutional tender expert Professor William Greene said when people in multiple states actually start using gold and silver instead of Federal Reserve Notes, it would effectively nullify the Federal Reserve and end the federal government’s monopoly on money.', '“Over time, as residents of the state use both Federal Reserve notes and silver and gold coins, the fact that the coins hold their value more than Federal Reserve notes do will lead to a “reverse Gresham’s Law” effect, where good money (gold and silver coins) will drive out bad money (Federal Reserve notes). As this happens, a cascade of events can begin to occur, including the flow of real wealth toward the state’s treasury, an influx of banking business from outside of the state – as people in other states carry out their desire to bank with sound money – and an eventual outcry against the use of Federal Reserve notes for any transactions.”', 'Once things get to that point, Federal Reserve notes would become largely unwanted and irrelevant for ordinary people.', 'These bills make up part of a broader movement at the state level to support sound money.', 'By Zerohedge.com', 'More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:', ""AMLO's Oil-Heavy Energy Policies Face Scrutiny"", 'Is the ESG Investment Bubble Bursting?', 'Schottky Junction Electrode Revolutionizes Seawater Electrolysis', 'Read this article on OilPrice.com']"

Since NWSA is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock.

For the developer working with multi-trillion-parameter frontier models in the cloud, Gaudi and our suite of AI accelerators provides a powerful combination of performance, competitive MLPerf benchmarks, and a very cost-efficient TCO. However, as the world moves toward more AI-integrated application, there's a market shift toward local inferencing.\xa0 It's a nod to both the necessity of data privacy and an answer to cloud-based inference cost.

Each one fits in either of this category, and should be worth a closer look at today’s prices.', 'Source: sfam_photo / Shutterstock.com', 'Ensign Group (NASDAQ:ENSG) is a leading operator of skilled nursing facilities in the United States.

Chalk it up to two factors discussed in my last recommendation of ENSG, as one of the top stocks to capitalize on the aging of America. First, this trend itself stands to serve as a strong long-term growth catalyst.

Maybe, even “priced to perfection,” with its forward earnings multiple of 39.6.', 'Analysts like Jeffries’ Randal Konik have voiced concerns about near-term growth.

The number of years the average automobile stays on the road keeps climbing.

Ditto for HBO Max. The Walt Disney Company's (NYSE: DIS) Disney+ and Hulu platforms are high-profile platforms in the direct-to-consumer media business as well."", ""All of them, however, may want to pay closer attention to an increasingly tough contender in the streaming space. Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) Prime has always captured more total view-time in the United States than Disney+. Thanks to Prime's continued growth (and Hulu's lack thereof), though, Amazon's streaming service is now more popular than any of Disney's streaming brands."", ""And this position change has implications for both companies' stocks."", ""The data comes from TV ratings agency Nielsen, and is plotted on the graph below. After a couple years' worth of progress, in October Amazon Prime's total domestic watch-time finally eclipsed Hulu's time-share of domestic television sets. Both lost ground in November, but Hulu clearly lost a great deal more. In fact, Hulu's 2.7% of total U.S. television viewing time is the lowest the figure's been since early 2021. Meanwhile, Disney+ continues to tread water around the 2% mark."", ""Surprised? It would be surprising if you weren't. Walt Disney is one of the world's most powerful media and entertainment outfits, after all. If nothing else, it knows how to make and market video entertainment. Amazon is an e-commerce behemoth and a cloud computing monster. But it isn't exactly known for its on-demand streaming prowess."", ""And yet, there it is. Domestic viewers are finding more to watch on Prime than they are on Hulu or Disney+. It's not a perfect apples-to-apples comparison, of course. Domestic Prime subscribers are far greater in number than domestic Hulu and Disney+ subscribers."", 'While Amazon neither confirms nor denies the numbers, a handful of estimates suggest there are on the order of 160 million Prime customers in the U.S. alone. Conversely, Walt Disney reports that there are only 46.5 million Disney+ subscribers, and only 43.9 million Hulu customers. Prime should be the more watched service of the three in question, if for no other reason than its greater reach.', ""Prime's content library is also bigger. The Disney+ lineup only includes Disney-branded franchises. While Hulu offers more, its assortment is also largely limited to Disney's non-Disney studio content, select ABC content, and programming from Hulu's co-owner NBCUniversal. Amazon shops around for content from several different sources, and it's got the deep pockets to buy whatever content it needs."", ""Most people say they pay for Prime not for access to online video, but for the free shipping the program offers on purchases made at Amazon.com. Many of these people just happen to tune in because they've got access to a sizable digital video library. Hulu and Disney+ aren't a perk. They're the product in and of themselves."", ""Nevertheless, Amazon Prime is gaining view-time ground, while Hulu is losing it, and Disney+ still doesn't have much of it. These trends have implications for both companies' stocks."", ""Don't read too much into this dynamic for either organization. Cable television and theme parks remain Disney's top breadwinners. Amazon's top source of revenue is still e-commerce, while its big moneymaker is cloud computing."", ""Nielsen's measured shift in domestic viewing time for Prime and Hulu isn't exactly earth-shattering. But there is valuable information to be gleaned here about both companies."", 'For Amazon, the information is bullish. Simply put, the data suggests that most U.S. consumers are still big fans of (and users of) Prime. It matters just because Prime members are also more likely to shop at Amazon.com when free shipping is an option.', ""Market research firm Digital Commerce 360 reports that Prime's free shipping perk is the second biggest reason people shop with Amazon, in fact; the first reason is Amazon's enormous selection. Several estimates indicate that Prime subscribers spend two to three times as much at Amazon.com as non-Prime customers do."", ""Then there's the new, ancillary reason Nielsen's numbers are kind of a big deal.\xa0Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Amazon's e-commerce model was simple and straightforward. Now, its online shopping model is evolving and more nuanced. Turning a profit on the sale of goods is no longer its sole e-commerce goal. Rather, the company is building an advertising business that monetizes Amazon.com's web traffic in a different way. It did over $12 billion worth of ad business last quarter, up 25% year over year."", ""It's still the early days for this particular profit center, which likely boasts better profit margins than the simple sale of goods online does. More -- and better engaged -- Prime members could bolster this aspect of the company's business more than most investors might expect."", 'As for Walt Disney, the relative disinterest in Disney+ and the growing disinterest in Hulu is a red flag.', 'You may recall that the hype surrounding the late 2019 launch of Disney+ was palpable. Netflix had already proven streaming can be a viable business, but Disney was a natural when it came to content creation and marketing. The company even restructured itself in 2020 to prioritize the growth of its streaming services over all its other divisions.', ""But its streaming hasn't quite lived up to expectations. Although the media giant got to within sight of its initial streaming customer goals, its direct-to-consumer arm remains well in the red, losing over $400 million last quarter alone on over $5 billion in revenue."", ""To its credit, Disney is cutting costs in an effort to push its streaming business out of the red and into the black. Early this year, it vowed to cull $5.5 billion worth of annual expenses, and then upped that figure by another $2 billion in November. Decreased spending on content is a core component of this plan, and could be at least part of the reason why Disney's streaming losses are shrinking."", ""Spending less on programming is a double-edged sword, though. Disney+ and Hulu's U.S. customer headcount growth was already slowing down. In 2023, it's completely flatlined. The company is seeing a comparable slowdown with its international streaming brands as well -- not that it matters a great deal. Most of its direct-to-consumer revenue is driven domestically anyway."", ""It matters simply because streaming makes up over one-fifth of Disney's top line, yet streaming's profit margin rates are still miles away from those of its cable television business, its sports arm, and its theme park and hotel division. Even a direct-to-consumer business that's made profitable may never be as profitable as these other divisions, and that's assuming less spending on content doesn't continue to chip away at subscriber growth. Again, the number of paying streaming customers is essentially stagnant now."", ""Don't read too much into the message. Growing use of Prime's perks isn't a game-changing reason to own a stake in Amazon. Weak and falling view-time of Hulu and Disney+ doesn't put Walt Disney on its deathbed."", ""Nielsen's numbers aren't meaningless, however. If nothing else, they're reflective of far more important factors for both companies. They further bolster the argument against owning Disney shares, and they strengthen Amazon's overall bullish thesis. Take these hints at face value."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

To skip the detailed overview of the market and defensive stocks, go directly to the 5 Undervalued Defensive Stocks For 2024.', 'Defensive stocks are shares of companies that remain relatively stable during economic downturns as opposed to cyclical stocks. Defensive stocks usually outperform the market during recessionary times. Over the last 3 years, the global economy has performed in a way that baffled many investors and analysts. After the COVID-19 pandemic and in the aftermath of the Russia-Ukraine war, experts were pretty certain that the US economy would fall into a recession in 2023.', 'Exactly a year ago, Bloomberg reported that economists believed that there was a 70% chance that the US economy would go into a recession. So far in 2023, the S&P 500 has gained 24.33% at the time of the December 22 market close. The AI surge crushed the bear estimates for the year, and now many experts predict that the US economy will probably achieve a soft landing in 2024.', 'According to a Goldman Sachs report published in November, the US GDP will grow 2.1% on a full-year basis in 2024. The firm sees a historically average 15% probability of recession over the next 12 months. Goldman Sachs sees inflation cooling down in 2024 and dropping to around 2.4% by December 2024. The firm expects the Fed to deliver its first rate cut in the fourth quarter of the next year and then reduce it by 25 basis points per quarter until the second quarter of 2026. Comparatively, JPMorgan believes that inflation will go down to 2%, the unemployment rate will stay around 4%, and the firm does not forecast any recession.', 'While the expectations of economic growth are better than expected in 2024, a defensive stocks portfolio can still be helpful for investors who want to reduce volatility in their portfolio or maybe even have a passive stream of money through dividends. Moreover, defensive stocks are also perfect investments for beginners to help get a grip on the market.', 'Defensive stocks are mainly the shares of companies with low beta, stable dividends, and slow but steady growth. Stocks, mainly from utilities, consumer staples, healthcare, and real estate sectors, are considered defensive as they produce essentials for living and will never go out of favor. However, 2023 has not been the year for stocks in these sectors. Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU) is down 11.18% at the December 22 market close, Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP) is down 4.11%, and Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) is 0.32% lower. Although SPDR Dow Jones REIT ETF (RWR) has positive gains of 8.65%, it is lagging way behind the broader market. There are a few stocks in these sectors that outperformed the market, like the healthcare companies Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) and Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO). The companies have gained 56.28% and 50% YTD at the time of the December 22 market close. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) was one of the top performers of the S&P 500 in the first three quarters.', 'While the defensive stocks have underperformed the market, let’s not forget that most of the market’s gains are credited to a few technology companies. Moreover, with lower valuations, these stocks also provide entry points for long-term investments. Some of the best undervalued defensive stocks for 2024 include Enel Chile S.A.

Although the official monthly numbers from the EIA won’t be released for a couple of months, we can calculate that a new record has been set based on the following analysis.', 'For reference, the previous record was set in 2019, the year before the Covid-19 pandemic impacted the oil industry. Total U.S. crude oil production in 2019 was 4.49 billion barrels (source), or 12.3 million barrels per day (BPD). Then the pandemic hit, and oil production fell in 2020 and 2021, before rebounding in 2022.', 'The EIA reports oil production numbers in multiple places. The U.S. Field Production of Crude Oil shows monthly totals and averages, but they are always a couple of months behind. For example, as I write this on December 14, the most recent month posted is September, and U.S. oil production up until then stood at 3.50 billion total barrels.', 'However, we can also find weekly production numbers in the EIA’s Petroleum Status Report published every Wednesday. A table from that report called U.S. Petroleum Balance Sheet shows the status of U.S. oil production, inventories, imports, etc. for the previous week, as well as the four-week average.', 'If we look at the November 3 archive of that report, we can see that average weekly production in October was 13.2 million BPD. Thus, during October, the U.S. produced another ~409 million barrels. (Technically, it’s a four-week average that is reported, but that will be within a fraction of a decimal point of monthly production).', 'Jump forward a month to the December 6 archive, and the preceding four-week average ending December 1 — which will be very close to November monthly production — was 13.175 million BPD. Thus, the U.S. produced another ~395 million barrels in November, to bring the year-to-date total to 4.30 billion barrels.', 'That means that on December 1, U.S. producers were only 190 million barrels from breaking the previous record. The most recent weekly production number from the EIA — representing the first week of December — was 13.1 million BPD. At that rate, it would take 14.5 days of December production to break the record. If we make a more conservative assumption of 13.0 million BPD, then it only changes the timing to 14.6 days.', 'Thus, it is a safe assumption that around noon on December 15, the U.S. set a new production record for oil.', 'It is possible that the EIA could slightly adjust the production numbers once it publishes the final monthly numbers for 2023. That won’t happen until March or April of next year. But at most it would shift the record date by a day or two. It won’t change the fact that a new oil production record was set.', 'An open question is how high the record will be set. Again, if we assume a more conservative 13.0 million BPD of production for the rest of December — which would be the lowest monthly number since July — then the year would end up at 4.70 billion barrels. That would be nearly 5% above the previous record, or 210 million barrels above that 2019 level.', 'A new production record fulfills one of the 2023 energy predictions I made in January. For more information, I alluded to the record earlier this week in a TikTok video and discussed it in some detail on the year-end episode of In the Oil Patch Radio.', 'The U.S. is also on pace to set a new natural gas production record this year. Through September, we are running a little over 4% above last year’s record. However, to my knowledge the EIA does not report weekly natural gas production numbers. Therefore, this record can’t be estimated as precisely as the record for oil.', 'Assuming September production remains the same for the rest of the year, the natural gas production record would be set around December 20. But there is probably about five days of uncertainty in either direction due to the variability in monthly gas production. We won’t know the timing for certain until the EIA releases the monthly numbers for natural gas next year, but it is near certain that we will set a new record for natural gas as well.', 'By Robert Rapier for Oilprice.com', 'More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:', 'Schottky Junction Electrode Revolutionizes Seawater Electrolysis', 'U.S. States Make Bold Move to Reclassify Gold and Silver', 'Car Ownership is More Expensive Than Ever', 'Read this article on OilPrice.com']"

The legislation would also take other steps to treat gold and silver as money instead of as commodities.', 'In Missouri, Rep Doug Richey filed HB1867 on Dec. 11. Rep. Bill Hardwick filed HB1955 on Dec. 15. The bills are companions to SB735 filed in the Senate by Sen. William Eigel earlier this month.', 'In Oklahoma, Sen. Shane Jett filed SB1507 and Sen. Nathan Dahm is running SB1508.', 'The enactment of any of these bills would eliminate state capital gains taxes on the sale and exchange of gold and silver bullion.', 'Both of these states are already among the 42 that do not levy sales taxes on gold and silver bullion.', 'Exempting the sale of gold and silver bullion from taxes lowers the investment cost of precious metals. It also takes a step toward treating gold and silver as money instead of commodities. Taxes on precious metal bullion erect barriers to using gold and silver as money by raising transaction costs.', 'Imagine if you asked a grocery clerk to break a $5 bill and he charged you a 35-cent tax. Silly, right? After all, you were only exchanging one form of money for another. But that’s essentially what a sales tax on gold and silver bullion does. By eliminating this tax on the exchange of gold and silver, Missouri and Oklahoma would treat specie as money instead of a commodity. This represents a small step toward reestablishing gold and silver as legal tender and breaking down the Fed’s monopoly on money.', '“We ought not to tax money – and that’s a good idea. It makes no sense to tax money,” former U.S. Rep. Ron Paul said during testimony in support of an Arizona bill that repealed capital gains taxes on gold and silver in that state. “Paper is not money, it’s fraud,” he continued.', 'The impact of enacting this legislation will go beyond mere tax policy. During an event after his Senate committee testimony, Paul pointed out that it’s really about the size and scope of government.', '“If you’re for less government, you want sound money. The people who want big government, they don’t want sound money. They want to deceive you and commit fraud. They want to print the money. They want a monopoly. They want to get you conditioned, as our schools have conditioned us, to the point where deficits don’t matter.”', 'Under provisions in the Missouri bill, gold and silver in physical or electronic form would be accepted as legal tender and would be receivable in payment of all debts contracted for in the state of Missouri. The state would be required to accept gold and silver for the payment of public debts. Private debts could be settled in gold and silver at the parties’ discretion.', 'Practically speaking, this would allow Missourians to use gold or silver coins as money rather than just as mere investment vehicles. In effect, it would put gold and silver on the same footing as Federal Reserve notes.', 'Oklahoma took a similar step in 2014. Utah and Arkansas also consider gold and silver legal tender.', 'The proposed Missouri law also includes provisions authorizing the state to invest in gold or silver “greater than or equal to one percent of all state funds” and to expressly bar any state agency, department, or political subdivision from seizing gold or silver bullion.', 'The United States Constitution states in Article I, Section 10, “No State shall…make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts.” Currently, all debts and taxes in the US are either paid with Federal Reserve Notes (dollars) which were authorized as legal tender by Congress, or with coins issued by the US Treasury — very few of which have gold or silver in them.', 'The Federal Reserve destroys this constitutional monetary system by creating a monopoly based on its fiat currency. Without the backing of gold or silver, the central bank can easily create money out of thin air. This not only devalues your purchasing power over time; it also allows the federal government to borrow and spend far beyond what would be possible in a sound money system. Without the Fed, the US government wouldn’t be able to maintain all of its unconstitutional wars and programs. The Federal Reserve is the engine that drives the most powerful government in the history of the world.', 'Tax repeals knock down one of the tax barriers that hinder the use of gold and silver as money, and could also begin the process of abolishing the Federal Reserve’s fiat money system by attacking it from the bottom up – pulling the rug out from under it by working to make its functions irrelevant at the state and local levels, and setting the stage to undermine the Federal Reserve monopoly by introducing competition into the monetary system.', 'In a paper presented at the Mises Institute, Constitutional tender expert Professor William Greene said when people in multiple states actually start using gold and silver instead of Federal Reserve Notes, it would effectively nullify the Federal Reserve and end the federal government’s monopoly on money.', '“Over time, as residents of the state use both Federal Reserve notes and silver and gold coins, the fact that the coins hold their value more than Federal Reserve notes do will lead to a “reverse Gresham’s Law” effect, where good money (gold and silver coins) will drive out bad money (Federal Reserve notes). As this happens, a cascade of events can begin to occur, including the flow of real wealth toward the state’s treasury, an influx of banking business from outside of the state – as people in other states carry out their desire to bank with sound money – and an eventual outcry against the use of Federal Reserve notes for any transactions.”', 'Once things get to that point, Federal Reserve notes would become largely unwanted and irrelevant for ordinary people.', 'These bills make up part of a broader movement at the state level to support sound money.', 'By Zerohedge.com', 'More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:', ""AMLO's Oil-Heavy Energy Policies Face Scrutiny"", 'Is the ESG Investment Bubble Bursting?', 'Schottky Junction Electrode Revolutionizes Seawater Electrolysis', 'Read this article on OilPrice.com']"

Up until the 20th century, many coins were composed of basic metals like gold and silver, that is until gold was banned from coinage by way of executive order in 1933 and silver was watered out of production by the early 1970s.', 'However, just because the recipe and ingredients changed doesn’t mean that these coins are not still out there, adding up in value due to their rarity and backstory.', 'GOBankingRates dug into the history of some of these hard-to-find and now incredibly valuable coins that are sought by collectors around the globe. What makes these coins earn their current-day sales prices comes down to how many coins were originally produced throughout their mintage, as well as how many are currently still accounted for. The materials and composition of the coins also add to their value since many have become precious and hard to find themselves.', 'Take, for example, the 1792 Silver Center Cent J-1. It was originally worth 1 cent — the penny of its day — when it was initially minted and subsequently released to the American public.

36,83a1dd2f-a019-33a8-8397-3f9a22b9e1cb,MA,2023-12-25,U.S. Shatters Oil Production Records in 2023,Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-shatters-oil-production-records-000000110.html,1703462400,STORY,"['GC=F', 'NG=F', 'SI=F', 'CL=F']","['The U.S. set a new annual oil production record on December 15, based on data from the Energy Information Administration. Although the official monthly numbers from the EIA won’t be released for a couple of months, we can calculate that a new record has been set based on the following analysis.', 'For reference, the previous record was set in 2019, the year before the Covid-19 pandemic impacted the oil industry. Total U.S. crude oil production in 2019 was 4.49 billion barrels (source), or 12.3 million barrels per day (BPD). Then the pandemic hit, and oil production fell in 2020 and 2021, before rebounding in 2022.', 'The EIA reports oil production numbers in multiple places. The U.S. Field Production of Crude Oil shows monthly totals and averages, but they are always a couple of months behind. For example, as I write this on December 14, the most recent month posted is September, and U.S. oil production up until then stood at 3.50 billion total barrels.', 'However, we can also find weekly production numbers in the EIA’s Petroleum Status Report published every Wednesday. A table from that report called U.S. Petroleum Balance Sheet shows the status of U.S. oil production, inventories, imports, etc. for the previous week, as well as the four-week average.', 'If we look at the November 3 archive of that report, we can see that average weekly production in October was 13.2 million BPD. Thus, during October, the U.S. produced another ~409 million barrels. (Technically, it’s a four-week average that is reported, but that will be within a fraction of a decimal point of monthly production).', 'Jump forward a month to the December 6 archive, and the preceding four-week average ending December 1 — which will be very close to November monthly production — was 13.175 million BPD. Thus, the U.S. produced another ~395 million barrels in November, to bring the year-to-date total to 4.30 billion barrels.', 'That means that on December 1, U.S. producers were only 190 million barrels from breaking the previous record. The most recent weekly production number from the EIA — representing the first week of December — was 13.1 million BPD. At that rate, it would take 14.5 days of December production to break the record. If we make a more conservative assumption of 13.0 million BPD, then it only changes the timing to 14.6 days.', 'Thus, it is a safe assumption that around noon on December 15, the U.S. set a new production record for oil.', 'It is possible that the EIA could slightly adjust the production numbers once it publishes the final monthly numbers for 2023. That won’t happen until March or April of next year. But at most it would shift the record date by a day or two. It won’t change the fact that a new oil production record was set.', 'An open question is how high the record will be set. Again, if we assume a more conservative 13.0 million BPD of production for the rest of December — which would be the lowest monthly number since July — then the year would end up at 4.70 billion barrels. That would be nearly 5% above the previous record, or 210 million barrels above that 2019 level.', 'A new production record fulfills one of the 2023 energy predictions I made in January. For more information, I alluded to the record earlier this week in a TikTok video and discussed it in some detail on the year-end episode of In the Oil Patch Radio.', 'The U.S. is also on pace to set a new natural gas production record this year. Through September, we are running a little over 4% above last year’s record. However, to my knowledge the EIA does not report weekly natural gas production numbers. Therefore, this record can’t be estimated as precisely as the record for oil.', 'Assuming September production remains the same for the rest of the year, the natural gas production record would be set around December 20. But there is probably about five days of uncertainty in either direction due to the variability in monthly gas production. We won’t know the timing for certain until the EIA releases the monthly numbers for natural gas next year, but it is near certain that we will set a new record for natural gas as well.', 'By Robert Rapier for Oilprice.com', 'More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:', 'Schottky Junction Electrode Revolutionizes Seawater Electrolysis', 'U.S. States Make Bold Move to Reclassify Gold and Silver', 'Car Ownership is More Expensive Than Ever', 'Read this article on OilPrice.com']"

The legislation would also take other steps to treat gold and silver as money instead of as commodities.', 'In Missouri, Rep Doug Richey filed HB1867 on Dec. 11. Rep. Bill Hardwick filed HB1955 on Dec. 15. The bills are companions to SB735 filed in the Senate by Sen. William Eigel earlier this month.', 'In Oklahoma, Sen. Shane Jett filed SB1507 and Sen. Nathan Dahm is running SB1508.', 'The enactment of any of these bills would eliminate state capital gains taxes on the sale and exchange of gold and silver bullion.', 'Both of these states are already among the 42 that do not levy sales taxes on gold and silver bullion.', 'Exempting the sale of gold and silver bullion from taxes lowers the investment cost of precious metals. It also takes a step toward treating gold and silver as money instead of commodities. Taxes on precious metal bullion erect barriers to using gold and silver as money by raising transaction costs.', 'Imagine if you asked a grocery clerk to break a $5 bill and he charged you a 35-cent tax. Silly, right? After all, you were only exchanging one form of money for another. But that’s essentially what a sales tax on gold and silver bullion does. By eliminating this tax on the exchange of gold and silver, Missouri and Oklahoma would treat specie as money instead of a commodity. This represents a small step toward reestablishing gold and silver as legal tender and breaking down the Fed’s monopoly on money.', '“We ought not to tax money – and that’s a good idea. It makes no sense to tax money,” former U.S. Rep. Ron Paul said during testimony in support of an Arizona bill that repealed capital gains taxes on gold and silver in that state. “Paper is not money, it’s fraud,” he continued.', 'The impact of enacting this legislation will go beyond mere tax policy. During an event after his Senate committee testimony, Paul pointed out that it’s really about the size and scope of government.', '“If you’re for less government, you want sound money. The people who want big government, they don’t want sound money. They want to deceive you and commit fraud. They want to print the money. They want a monopoly. They want to get you conditioned, as our schools have conditioned us, to the point where deficits don’t matter.”', 'Under provisions in the Missouri bill, gold and silver in physical or electronic form would be accepted as legal tender and would be receivable in payment of all debts contracted for in the state of Missouri. The state would be required to accept gold and silver for the payment of public debts. Private debts could be settled in gold and silver at the parties’ discretion.', 'Practically speaking, this would allow Missourians to use gold or silver coins as money rather than just as mere investment vehicles. In effect, it would put gold and silver on the same footing as Federal Reserve notes.', 'Oklahoma took a similar step in 2014. Utah and Arkansas also consider gold and silver legal tender.', 'The proposed Missouri law also includes provisions authorizing the state to invest in gold or silver “greater than or equal to one percent of all state funds” and to expressly bar any state agency, department, or political subdivision from seizing gold or silver bullion.', 'The United States Constitution states in Article I, Section 10, “No State shall…make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts.” Currently, all debts and taxes in the US are either paid with Federal Reserve Notes (dollars) which were authorized as legal tender by Congress, or with coins issued by the US Treasury — very few of which have gold or silver in them.', 'The Federal Reserve destroys this constitutional monetary system by creating a monopoly based on its fiat currency. Without the backing of gold or silver, the central bank can easily create money out of thin air. This not only devalues your purchasing power over time; it also allows the federal government to borrow and spend far beyond what would be possible in a sound money system. Without the Fed, the US government wouldn’t be able to maintain all of its unconstitutional wars and programs. The Federal Reserve is the engine that drives the most powerful government in the history of the world.', 'Tax repeals knock down one of the tax barriers that hinder the use of gold and silver as money, and could also begin the process of abolishing the Federal Reserve’s fiat money system by attacking it from the bottom up – pulling the rug out from under it by working to make its functions irrelevant at the state and local levels, and setting the stage to undermine the Federal Reserve monopoly by introducing competition into the monetary system.', 'In a paper presented at the Mises Institute, Constitutional tender expert Professor William Greene said when people in multiple states actually start using gold and silver instead of Federal Reserve Notes, it would effectively nullify the Federal Reserve and end the federal government’s monopoly on money.', '“Over time, as residents of the state use both Federal Reserve notes and silver and gold coins, the fact that the coins hold their value more than Federal Reserve notes do will lead to a “reverse Gresham’s Law” effect, where good money (gold and silver coins) will drive out bad money (Federal Reserve notes). As this happens, a cascade of events can begin to occur, including the flow of real wealth toward the state’s treasury, an influx of banking business from outside of the state – as people in other states carry out their desire to bank with sound money – and an eventual outcry against the use of Federal Reserve notes for any transactions.”', 'Once things get to that point, Federal Reserve notes would become largely unwanted and irrelevant for ordinary people.', 'These bills make up part of a broader movement at the state level to support sound money.', 'By Zerohedge.com', 'More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:', ""AMLO's Oil-Heavy Energy Policies Face Scrutiny"", 'Is the ESG Investment Bubble Bursting?', 'Schottky Junction Electrode Revolutionizes Seawater Electrolysis', 'Read this article on OilPrice.com']"

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 5 Best Space Stocks to Buy According to Wall Street Analysts.\xa0', 'The space sector has been one of the fastest growing sectors in the world economy over the past few years. According to a report by consulting firm McKinsey, the space industry could be worth more than $1 trillion by the end of this decade, up from $280 billion at the end of 2010 and $447 billion at the end of 2022. One of the biggest growth drivers within the industry is the emergence of firms sending satellites up in space, for tasks as varied as tracking climate change to managing daily card transactions.\xa0', 'Commercial space assets have been acting as revenue drivers for many space companies and governments around the world are boosting their expenditures in the industry to take advantage of these growth trends. According to Colorado-based space advocacy group Space Foundation, businesses in the space industry grew revenue to more than $420 billion at the end of 2022, up from $396 billion in the previous year. One-third of this revenue came in the form of support for space activities, such as maintenance of ground stations.\xa0', 'The biggest sale numbers for the space firms were the proceeds from the sale of satellite data, per the advocacy group. These proceeds accounted for nearly 39% of all commercial revenue generated by space firms in 2022. The growth figures for space firms are all the more impressive since many companies in the sector are startups, and with inflation skyrocketing and venture capital interest muted due to high interest rates, space startups managed to attract only $20 billion from Wall Street last year, a step down from a record high $47 billion in 2021.\xa0', 'Lesley Conn, the director of research at Space Foundation, believes that the commercial space sector is a vital part of the overall space economy. She has predicted that within five years, the market will see a real acceleration and an expansion of space and space assets. Some of the biggest space firms to monitor in this context include The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX), and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), among others discussed in detail below.\xa0', 'Apart from these big space firms, certain smaller companies are leaving their mark on the industry. For example, Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ:RKLB), a California-based space firm, has been leading the way with rocket launches and returns. Peter Beck, the CEO of Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ:RKLB), recently highlighted, during the third quarter earnings call, some of the growth plans of his firm moving into 2024. He also shed light on the performance of his company during the 2023 fiscal year.\xa0', '“Starting with Electron, in July, we launched a mission with several satellites for NASA and others, which was the first of the two back-to-back reusability focused missions. After successfully deploying the first Mission 7 spacecraft, Electron’s first stage was bought back to Earth and recovered from the ocean. Then we followed that up with our 40th Electron launch and even more recovery milestones, including a return for stage and thea first launch, reflowing Rutherford engine previously flown on our 26 Mission, There and Back Again. The engine performed flawlessly like a new one, completely validating our pursuit of reusability for Electron and setting us up well to refly an entire engine set as our next major reusability goal. Next, I will provide a bit of an update for Electron. Following those two successful flights, as you know, we unfortunately experienced an anomaly on our 41st Mission. It’s important to remember that up until this launch, we have had 37 successful orbital missions to place 171 satellites in orbit. And the past two years have been flawless, with a record of 20 successful missions one after the other.""', 'Our Methodology', 'Space stocks that have positive analyst coverage were selected and ranked according to upside potential based on analyst price targets.

If you want to skip our discussion on the happiness measurement metrics, you can go directly to the 5 Happiest States In The US.', 'For the longest time, people have believed that happiness is not quantifiable; it is just a state of mind. While that may be true, recent research and studies have shown that individual happiness can be measured, if not completely accurately, through several metrics. These include personal well-being, financial stability, and a thriving community. These factors can be used to determine the happiness score for different regions, cities, states, and countries. It is important to note that happiness can often be directly linked to economics. This domain is called happiness economics, which studies the relationship between individual satisfaction and economic prosperity. It states that generally, people in wealthy nations are happier than those in poorer nations. This is because the quality of life and institutions in wealthy countries is often much better than others, which allows residents to live more comfortable lives.', 'According to the World Happiness Report, Finland is the happiest country in the world. This report considers elements such as social support, income, freedom, health, generosity, and the absence of corruption to determine individual and collective happiness within a country. Governments use this information to decide what policies to make to ensure their public’s happiness. European countries make up most of the top 10 happiest countries in the world. Meanwhile, the United States ranks at the 16th spot.\xa0\xa0This may be due to several reasons, such as the healthcare crisis in the US or the skyrocketing housing prices that have left the population bereft. This is not to say that Americans are collectively an unhappy population. Depending on which state or city they live in, Americans can have different happiness indices. As of 2023, Fremont, San Jose, and Madison have been labeled as the top three happiest cities in America. These cities are located in California and Wisconsin, both of which are in the top 20 happiest states in the US.', 'Hawaii, Minnesota, and Utah have remained in the top 5 happiest states in the US for a few years now. In this year’s ranking, too, Utah tops the list, with Hawaii and Minnesota following closely behind. While the majority of a citizen’s happiness score is dependent on policies made by governmental institutes, some big corporations are also contributing to the happiness and well-being of Americans. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a multinational company that is known for its commitment to healthcare and well-being. It produces high-tech medical devices, lifesaving drugs, pharmaceuticals, and consumer goods for improved life quality and better health. Another company contributing to a higher living standard is Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), a retail giant with employee-friendly policies, dedication to fair wages, and high-quality products. The provision of affordable groceries, electronics, and other everyday essentials allows people to lead better lives, eat healthier, and put the stress of inflation to rest.', 'Similarly, Adobe Inc.

Just look what happened with Costco (NASDAQ:COST) last week – the warehouse giant announced a special $15 cash dividend and shares soared to new all-time highs.', 'Some of the enthusiasm points to renewed confidence in the consumer staple stock based on the financial strength to offer the dividend. But there’s an equally large contingent investing solely to capture the dividend payout before moving on.', 'That’s because dividend investing is tailor-made for today’s unique economic conditions. They combine the best of both worlds – rising equities and income opportunities – to attempt a Fed-proof portfolio as Powell and his team keep markets guessing.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Of course, at $658 per share, Costco is on the pricier end of dividend stocks. But these seven companies are equally appealing, offering investors a chance to capture undervalued dividend stocks for their portfolio.', 'Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com', 'Walmart (NYSE:WMT), the world’s leading supermarket and general merchandise retailer, should top your list of undervalued dividend stocks, considering its popularity and recession-proof stability.', 'With its expansive network of over 11,500 stores in 27 countries, Walmart is strategically located within 10 miles of 90% of the U.S. population. This accessibility, of course, makes Walmart a go-to consumer pick when combined with the company’s budget-friendly pricing.', 'But Walmart’s dividend appeal lies in its impressive dividend track record. The company began issuing dividends in March 1974 at 5 cents per share and currently offers a 1.49% forward yield. This reflects an average annual growth rate of 8% over the last fifty years, a significant achievement in varying economic conditions.', 'Walmart’s success stems from its vast scale, allowing it to negotiate favorable prices from suppliers and pass on savings to consumers. While many retailers struggled against Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) dominance, Walmart effectively adapted, becoming a strong competitor in eCommerce. This also bodes well for post-holiday shopping season earnings reports.', 'Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is a leading manufacturer in the fields of construction, mining, and engineering equipment. But its investor appeal lies in its dividend yield and stability, at just under 2%, with an impressive history of increasing dividends for 31 consecutive years. This track record makes it a cornerstone for both long-term and income-focused investors.', 'Source: ARMMY PICCA/ShutterStock.com', 'The company’s performance this year is solid, with shares jumping nearly 20% and solid earnings to boot. Caterpillar’s revenues surged by 12%, reaching $16.8 billion, and its earnings per share were reported at $5.45, or $5.52 on an adjusted basis.', 'Caterpillar’s strength lies beyond its financials. As the world’s largest manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, it serves as a key barometer of the global economy’s health. Its future looks even brighter with its strong emphasis on artificial intelligence and automation. Currently, 13% of construction professionals use automation tools, and this number is expected to rise to 60% – creating a market hungry for Caterpillar products.', 'In line with these trends, Caterpillar is leading the industry with its range of automated construction equipment, including innovative technologies like self-digging solar ditch machines. This ability to adapt to and capitalize on emerging trends underscores Caterpillar’s potential for continued growth and market share expansion, further cementing its position as a top undervalued dividend stock.', 'Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com', 'Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR) is another undervalued dividend stock with a long track record of payouts. Its 2.3% yield won’t top the charts, but the company has consistently increased dividends for more than 60 years. This makes EMR a dividend stalwart to anchor a well-rounded portfolio.', 'Emerson’s recent earnings report points to some tight times ahead as, on an annual basis, revenue fell 10%, and earnings dropped 18%. But EMR shares dipped only slightly on the news, indicating markets priced the underperformance in. But this also makes for a moderate undervaluation if you’re bullish on the company’s long-term prospects.', 'Emerson faces a few additional short-term challenges, particularly as supply chains continue pressuring sales. But Emerson’s longevity is undisputed, and their commitment to shareholders places it near the top of the list of undervalued dividend stocks.', 'Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com', 'Recent telecom turbulence impacted the entire sector, including Verizon (NYSE:VZ), a much-loved dividend aristocrat. Despite this sector-wide decline, the widespread stock price dips offer a great chance to capture undervalued dividend stocks – with VZ topping the list.', 'You probably remember this summer’s lead shielding debacle that tumbled telecom stocks. But, thus far, initial fears of widespread litigation or remediation costs seem unwarranted. But VZ shares haven’t yet rebounded, and the undervalued dividend stock has lost nearly 7% of its total since January.', 'However, the company’s recent financials point to strength and reinforce the undervaluation thesis. A key highlight was its 0.2% adjusted EBITDA increase. While it seems modest, it’s big news in a cost-sensitive, highly competitive telecom sector. The moderate improvement points to VZ’s ability to navigate tricky economic times while keeping shareholder value at the fore.', 'Verizon’s current yield tops 7%. While some analysts may view the stock as a potential value trap, its recent price drop and promising growth prospects position Verizon as a highly attractive option for those seeking reliable dividend stocks. The company’s resilience and potential for growth make it a standout choice in the volatile telecom sector.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Talking about dividend stocks is tough without mentioning “The Monthly Dividend Company.” That’s especially true when balancing dividends with undervaluation, considering shares of Realty Income (NYSE:O) are down 10% this year.', 'But the company’s latest earnings report paints a largely positive picture hidden by per-share pricing. Despite a slight decline in occupancy, an impressive 98.8% of its properties are still generating cash flow for shareholders. Plus, Realty Income is improving margins from those properties, as funds from operations hit $1.04 per share compared to $0.97 in 2022. Likewise, the company’s current acquisition strategy points to continued growth potential.', 'With a current dividend yield of about 6%, Realty Income offers an attractive option for investors seeking regular monthly income, outperforming even the highest-yielding savings and money market accounts available today. Beyond that, though, shares seem materially undervalued for this dividend stock, creating a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to cheaply allocate substantial capital to Realty Income.', 'Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com', 'General Motors (NYSE:GM) seems to have threaded the needle between labor disputes and continued profitability. Though its planned deal will likely surpass $9 billion, GM just announced a $10 billion concurrent buyback and 33% dividend increase. That sets GM’s total yield at $5.34 – not bad considering shares dropped nearly 5% over the past six months, setting GM up as a decidedly undervalued dividend stock.', 'GM’s long-term prospects are bullish, too, considering its EV strength. The company has seen a 33% year-over-year increase in EV sales. With six EV models currently on the market and more in the pipeline, GM is solidifying its position as a major player in the EV space, although it still trails behind Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) by a considerable margin.', 'GM’s not out of the woods yet when it comes to continued volatility, especially considering consumer confidence hasn’t ticked back up fully. But this undervalued dividend stock is likely the best play within car manufacturers and by far the best among EV stock options.', 'Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com', 'The medical stock sector, which saw dramatic fluctuations during the pandemic, has left many investors wary. Companies saw significant stock surges followed by steep declines, casting a shadow over the entire industry. Medtronic (NYSE:MDT), a major player in the field, wasn’t immune to these trends, with its market capitalization reducing by more than a third from its peak during the pandemic. But recent signs point to a strong recovery, and its 3.54% dividend yield keeps investors happy while they wait for the rebound.', 'An aspect of Medtronic that stands out, especially in the current context, is its strong dividend program. The company has a history of consistently increasing its annual dividend for nearly 50 years, demonstrating a stable commitment to shareholder returns.', 'Medtronic’s role in the medical device industry extends beyond financials. Known for its innovation and development in medical technology, the company is now focusing on more collaborative and risk-based contracting with hospital networks. These agreements are designed to enhance patient outcomes and reduce costs, making Medtronic a valuable partner in an era where healthcare delivery costs are escalating. At the same time, ongoing partnerships with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) keep Medtronic at the forefront of emerging health tech trends, making it a dividend stock for the long haul.', 'On the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 5 Best Space Stocks to Buy According to Wall Street Analysts.\xa0', 'The space sector has been one of the fastest growing sectors in the world economy over the past few years. According to a report by consulting firm McKinsey, the space industry could be worth more than $1 trillion by the end of this decade, up from $280 billion at the end of 2010 and $447 billion at the end of 2022. One of the biggest growth drivers within the industry is the emergence of firms sending satellites up in space, for tasks as varied as tracking climate change to managing daily card transactions.\xa0', 'Commercial space assets have been acting as revenue drivers for many space companies and governments around the world are boosting their expenditures in the industry to take advantage of these growth trends. According to Colorado-based space advocacy group Space Foundation, businesses in the space industry grew revenue to more than $420 billion at the end of 2022, up from $396 billion in the previous year. One-third of this revenue came in the form of support for space activities, such as maintenance of ground stations.\xa0', 'The biggest sale numbers for the space firms were the proceeds from the sale of satellite data, per the advocacy group. These proceeds accounted for nearly 39% of all commercial revenue generated by space firms in 2022. The growth figures for space firms are all the more impressive since many companies in the sector are startups, and with inflation skyrocketing and venture capital interest muted due to high interest rates, space startups managed to attract only $20 billion from Wall Street last year, a step down from a record high $47 billion in 2021.\xa0', 'Lesley Conn, the director of research at Space Foundation, believes that the commercial space sector is a vital part of the overall space economy. She has predicted that within five years, the market will see a real acceleration and an expansion of space and space assets. Some of the biggest space firms to monitor in this context include The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX), and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), among others discussed in detail below.\xa0', 'Apart from these big space firms, certain smaller companies are leaving their mark on the industry. For example, Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ:RKLB), a California-based space firm, has been leading the way with rocket launches and returns. Peter Beck, the CEO of Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ:RKLB), recently highlighted, during the third quarter earnings call, some of the growth plans of his firm moving into 2024. He also shed light on the performance of his company during the 2023 fiscal year.\xa0', '“Starting with Electron, in July, we launched a mission with several satellites for NASA and others, which was the first of the two back-to-back reusability focused missions. After successfully deploying the first Mission 7 spacecraft, Electron’s first stage was bought back to Earth and recovered from the ocean. Then we followed that up with our 40th Electron launch and even more recovery milestones, including a return for stage and thea first launch, reflowing Rutherford engine previously flown on our 26 Mission, There and Back Again. The engine performed flawlessly like a new one, completely validating our pursuit of reusability for Electron and setting us up well to refly an entire engine set as our next major reusability goal. Next, I will provide a bit of an update for Electron. Following those two successful flights, as you know, we unfortunately experienced an anomaly on our 41st Mission. It’s important to remember that up until this launch, we have had 37 successful orbital missions to place 171 satellites in orbit.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 5 Best Space Stocks to Buy According to Wall Street Analysts.\xa0', 'The space sector has been one of the fastest growing sectors in the world economy over the past few years. According to a report by consulting firm McKinsey, the space industry could be worth more than $1 trillion by the end of this decade, up from $280 billion at the end of 2010 and $447 billion at the end of 2022. One of the biggest growth drivers within the industry is the emergence of firms sending satellites up in space, for tasks as varied as tracking climate change to managing daily card transactions.\xa0', 'Commercial space assets have been acting as revenue drivers for many space companies and governments around the world are boosting their expenditures in the industry to take advantage of these growth trends. According to Colorado-based space advocacy group Space Foundation, businesses in the space industry grew revenue to more than $420 billion at the end of 2022, up from $396 billion in the previous year. One-third of this revenue came in the form of support for space activities, such as maintenance of ground stations.\xa0', 'The biggest sale numbers for the space firms were the proceeds from the sale of satellite data, per the advocacy group. These proceeds accounted for nearly 39% of all commercial revenue generated by space firms in 2022. The growth figures for space firms are all the more impressive since many companies in the sector are startups, and with inflation skyrocketing and venture capital interest muted due to high interest rates, space startups managed to attract only $20 billion from Wall Street last year, a step down from a record high $47 billion in 2021.\xa0', 'Lesley Conn, the director of research at Space Foundation, believes that the commercial space sector is a vital part of the overall space economy. She has predicted that within five years, the market will see a real acceleration and an expansion of space and space assets. Some of the biggest space firms to monitor in this context include The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX), and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), among others discussed in detail below.\xa0', 'Apart from these big space firms, certain smaller companies are leaving their mark on the industry. For example, Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ:RKLB), a California-based space firm, has been leading the way with rocket launches and returns. Peter Beck, the CEO of Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ:RKLB), recently highlighted, during the third quarter earnings call, some of the growth plans of his firm moving into 2024. He also shed light on the performance of his company during the 2023 fiscal year.\xa0', '“Starting with Electron, in July, we launched a mission with several satellites for NASA and others, which was the first of the two back-to-back reusability focused missions. After successfully deploying the first Mission 7 spacecraft, Electron’s first stage was bought back to Earth and recovered from the ocean. Then we followed that up with our 40th Electron launch and even more recovery milestones, including a return for stage and thea first launch, reflowing Rutherford engine previously flown on our 26 Mission, There and Back Again. The engine performed flawlessly like a new one, completely validating our pursuit of reusability for Electron and setting us up well to refly an entire engine set as our next major reusability goal. Next, I will provide a bit of an update for Electron. Following those two successful flights, as you know, we unfortunately experienced an anomaly on our 41st Mission. It’s important to remember that up until this launch, we have had 37 successful orbital missions to place 171 satellites in orbit. And the past two years have been flawless, with a record of 20 successful missions one after the other.""', 'Our Methodology', 'Space stocks that have positive analyst coverage were selected and ranked according to upside potential based on analyst price targets.

And rightfully so. After all, it's the single biggest name in the business, having dominated the market since the 1980s."", ""For investors, though, everything is relative. While being big certainly has its advantages, sometimes it's the smaller, newer names in an industry offering up the better growth opportunities."", ""That's the crux of the bull case for high-end sports apparel name On Holding (NYSE: ONON) right now. It's only a fraction of the size of Nike (and may never be as big), and its relatively small size and tighter focus on one sliver of the athletic apparel market position the company for much faster growth."", ""Here's a look at the three reasons you might want to buy the stock sooner rathan than later."", ""Although Switzerland-based On Holding makes a range of apparel, footwear is by far its biggest business. On's competitive edge, however, is quality. Its customers pay a premium for its running, hiking, tennis, and lifestyle shoes, but they get a premium product for their money."", ""That's not to suggest Nike's products are of subpar quality. But again, the marketplace is changing. Millennials and Gen Z consumers in particular love On Holding's shoes for their utility as a status symbol and their amazing functionality and comfort."", ""This demand is apt to grow. Analysts with TD Cowen note that these two age groups already enjoy $165 billion in annual purchasing power in the United States alone. They're also set to inherit tens of trillions of dollars of wealth over the course of the next couple decades. Moreover, as soon as 2028, Gen Z and millennials will collectively make up 68% of the U.S. population, versus only 45% now. That's one heck of a tailwind brewing."", ""On Holding has plans ... big plans. In fact, they're so big they're almost unbelievable. The company expects to double this year's expected revenue of $2.1 billion by 2026 with a 26% compound annual growth rate. Meanwhile, it wants to push its gross margin above 60% and widen its EBITDA margin from around 17% now to more than 18%. Most young companies like this one need to spend heavily at this stage of their existence, which eats away at profitability."", 'Just bear in mind that On is already growing quickly enough and cost-effectively enough to achieve its targets. Sales through the first three quarters of 2023 were up more than 57% year over year, and EBITDA nearly doubled during that time.', ""And On Holding is generating this growth exactly where it needs to -- its direct-to-consumer business and its online efforts in particular. Direct-to-consumer market research outfit ESW reports one-fifth of millennials say they're going to make more online purchases of footwear and apparel this year than they did in 2022 (and they were already spending a lot online). When the category is switched to luxury goods, nearly one-third of millennials said they planned to make more online purchases in 2023."", 'These data nuggets offer just a glimpse into how the marketplace is evolving as the digitally native demographics grow up.', ""Last but not least, On Holding's employees and founders own roughly one-third of the company as well."", ""Bear in mind some of these shares are likely being offered in lieu of larger paychecks. Young up-and-coming companies often lack the cash to attract top candidates, whereas it's relatively easy to issue shares and pay these employees with stock."", ""Regardless, the high insider ownership aligns management's interests with those of other shareholders."", ""As for Wall Street, of the 19 research analysts covering the stock, 14 of them deem it a strong buy. The analysts' average price target of $36.09 points to a nearly 30% gain for the stock in the near term."", ""These aren't usually core elements of a bull case for owning a stock; past and projected results should be an investor's top criteria when investing. On Holding isn't your usual prospective investment though. It's a young company and an even younger stock. It's still developing its stride as a public company, but the strong analyst recommendations and significant insider ownership certainly boost the overall story."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in On Holding right now?', 'Before you buy stock in On Holding, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and On Holding wasn't one of them.

Should you buy this year's worst-performing S&P 500 stocks for 2024?"", ""It's been a great year for the S&P 500 overall. The index is on track to finish 2023 with a gain of well over 20%. However, more than one-third of the S&P 500 stocks are in negative territory as the year comes to a close. Five of them have delivered especially dismal performances."", 'Chemical manufacturer FMC (NYSE: FMC) is on pace to be the worst S&P 500 stock this year.

The biotech stock is down 50%. Like FMC, Moderna's share price was even lower just a few weeks ago."", ""Enphase Energy (NASDAQ: ENPH) stands out as another big S&P 500 loser in 2023. It's only slightly ahead of Moderna with a year-to-date decline of nearly 50%."", ""Then there's Dollar General (NYSE: DG). The discount retailer's shares are available at a much bigger discount after sinking 47% in 2023."", ""Moderna isn't the only COVID-19 vaccine stock that's been a dumpster fire this year. Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) has given up all of its pandemic gains and then some with its shares free-falling by nearly 46%."", 'FMC\'s steep sell-off this year was caused in part by what the company called ""abrupt and unprecedented reductions in inventory by growers"" in the second quarter. This channel destocking continued in the third quarter, with sales for FMC\'s agricultural chemicals especially hit hard in Latin America.', 'Enphase Energy blamed macroeconomic conditions -- especially higher interest rates -- for the declining sales of its microinverters used solar and battery systems. This caused the company to provide disappointing guidance for both Q3 and Q4, which sent investors headed for the hills.', ""The huge declines for Moderna and Pfizer reflect the deterioration in demand for the companies' COVID-19 vaccines. Pfizer's sales of its COVID-19 antiviral pill Paxlovid have also fallen significantly."", ""Like Enphase, Dollar General's management pointed to a challenging macroeconomic environment to explain its declining same-store sales in 2023. However, Dollar Tree and Walmart (two of its top rivals) saw their stocks perform much better. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Dollar General's board decided to replace the company's CEO with Jeff Owen with his predecessor, Todd Vasos, who oversaw a more prosperous period between 2015 and 2022."", ""Investors looking for a quick rebound in 2024 might be disappointed with most of these underperformers of 2023. I'm not confident that any of the companies will turn things around in the near term."", ""Of the five, though, I suspect that Moderna could be the most likely to change its narrative in the new year. The company's COVID-19 vaccine sales probably won't bounce back much, if any. However, Moderna hopes to win U.S. and European approvals for its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine mRNA-1345."", ""I also think that Pfizer and Dollar General remain solid picks for long-term investors. Pfizer's valuation is attractive with its forward earnings multiple below 9.8. Its dividend yield of over 6% should appeal to income investors. Meanwhile, Dollar General appears to be making the right moves to fix its problems. These two stocks might not be huge winners in 2024, but I don't expect either of them to make a repeat appearance among the S&P 500's biggest losers."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Dollar General right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Dollar General, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Dollar General wasn't one of them.

At first glance, a $15 per share special dividend seems like a lot. After all, that's more than the stock price of some companies."", 'But at the time of this writing, Costco is a $661 stock. And even if we assume Costco slightly raises its ordinary dividend next year, it is still likely to pay less than $20 or even $19 per share in dividends -- good for a forward yield under 3%.', ""Meanwhile, rival retailer Target (NYSE: TGT) has raised its dividend every year for over 50 years. It doesn't pay special dividends. But its ordinary dividend alone has a forward yield of 3.2% -- better than Costco without even relying on special dividends."", ""Here's why Target is a better all-around buy than Costco right now -- and a far better dividend stock for 2024."", ""Target is a traditional dividend-paying stock. It uses free cash flow (FCF) to support dividend growth. And even during downturns, when it doesn't have the FCF to support dividends, it can lean on cash reserves or the strength of its balance sheet to pay dividends and fulfill its promise to investors."", ""Like Target, Costco pays an ordinary dividend. But it's only $1.02 per share. Granted, Costco has raised its ordinary dividend substantially over the years (it has nearly doubled in the last five years). But even so, Costco's yield from its ordinary dividend alone is just 0.6%."", 'Once Costco\'s cash reaches an ""excessive"" level on its balance sheet, it tends to pay out a special dividend. This has happened four times over the past decade.', ""In the chart, you can see Costco's four special dividends over the last decade, which coincide with a high point in the cash position, except for the special dividend in 2017 (which was more a result of intended growth)."", 'On the surface, Costco\'s strategy makes a lot of sense. When there\'s room to pay a special dividend, it makes sense to reward your shareholders by directly putting money in their pockets. Special dividends have the ""plop factor"" that an ordinary divined simply can\'t compete with in the same way.', ""But I'd argue that special dividends are overrated. The value of a quality dividend-paying company isn't to hand out money to shareholders when times are good, but to continuously pay a growing quarterly payout no matter what the economy or the business is doing. That's what makes a Dividend King like Target so valuable. It consistently raises its dividend even if the business faces challenges, which has certainly been the case lately."", ""In the case of Costco, the business has been doing extremely well, and the stock has been a juggernaut. So returning $6.7 billion to shareholders in the form of a special dividend isn't really a good use of capital. A better use would be to reinvest in the business to support future growth."", ""Costco's stock price has outpaced the earnings and revenue growth."", ""As you can see in the chart, Costco stock is up 80% over the last three years, while Target is down nearly 20%. Costco, as a business, has performed much better than Target, so the stock deserves to have outperformed. But to the extent that it has leaves room for danger. In fact, Costco's price-to-earnings ratio is now 45.1 compared to just 17.5 for Target."", 'That\'s an expensive price for a wholesale retailer. In investing, you typically don\'t want to buy one stock over the other just because it is cheaper. Or as Warren Buffett famously said, ""It\'s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.""', 'But in the case of Costco and Target, we have two great businesses where one is far cheaper than the other. Granted, Costco will probably continue growing faster than Target. But not to the point where it should trade at that much of a premium.', ""The (very abridged) version of why Target has lagged the market in recent years has to do with its mismanagement of consumer demand, poor inventory forecasting, and poor supply chain management. As a retailer, the worst thing you can do is over-order, and then have to discount items to move products off the shelves. That's a recipe for margin compression, exactly what happened to Target."", 'The good news is the worst is over. Target has worked on a lot of its inventory headaches. It is now keeping a far leaner inventory, even during the holiday season. Target remains an excellent brand that has what it takes to grow over time, with its Target Circle rewards program, expansion of online ordering and curbside pickup, and engagement with its app.', ""The reliability of Target's dividend, paired with its upside potential and inexpensive valuation, makes it a stock worth owning for the long term."", ""Costco's special dividend is basically a 2.2% boost to the stock price -- which is what can happen any day in the market. Only it costs the company billions of dollars and isn't the result of the market bidding up the company's value."", ""I view dividends as an anchor of an investment thesis -- something you can count on no matter what is happening in the market. They also serve as a useful financial planning tool for building passive income and retirement savings. On the other hand, capital gains, or the growth in value of a company, should result from the company's improvements being recognized by the market."", 'A special dividend is like forced capital gains, if that makes sense. If I were a Costco shareholder, I would either want to see a higher ordinary dividend and the elimination of special dividends, or I would want to see Costco reinvest the money it would have spent on special dividends back into the business.', 'The stock is very expensive and will have to justify the valuation with earnings growth. That $6.7 billion could have gone a long way toward driving future growth. Instead, it will be distributed and taxed to investors as a one-time payment that means very little in the long run.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Costco Wholesale right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Costco Wholesale, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Costco Wholesale wasn't one of them.

Although the official monthly numbers from the EIA won’t be released for a couple of months, we can calculate that a new record has been set based on the following analysis.', 'For reference, the previous record was set in 2019, the year before the Covid-19 pandemic impacted the oil industry. Total U.S. crude oil production in 2019 was 4.49 billion barrels (source), or 12.3 million barrels per day (BPD). Then the pandemic hit, and oil production fell in 2020 and 2021, before rebounding in 2022.', 'The EIA reports oil production numbers in multiple places. The U.S. Field Production of Crude Oil shows monthly totals and averages, but they are always a couple of months behind. For example, as I write this on December 14, the most recent month posted is September, and U.S. oil production up until then stood at 3.50 billion total barrels.', 'However, we can also find weekly production numbers in the EIA’s Petroleum Status Report published every Wednesday. A table from that report called U.S. Petroleum Balance Sheet shows the status of U.S. oil production, inventories, imports, etc. for the previous week, as well as the four-week average.', 'If we look at the November 3 archive of that report, we can see that average weekly production in October was 13.2 million BPD. Thus, during October, the U.S. produced another ~409 million barrels. (Technically, it’s a four-week average that is reported, but that will be within a fraction of a decimal point of monthly production).', 'Jump forward a month to the December 6 archive, and the preceding four-week average ending December 1 — which will be very close to November monthly production — was 13.175 million BPD. Thus, the U.S. produced another ~395 million barrels in November, to bring the year-to-date total to 4.30 billion barrels.', 'That means that on December 1, U.S. producers were only 190 million barrels from breaking the previous record. The most recent weekly production number from the EIA — representing the first week of December — was 13.1 million BPD. At that rate, it would take 14.5 days of December production to break the record. If we make a more conservative assumption of 13.0 million BPD, then it only changes the timing to 14.6 days.', 'Thus, it is a safe assumption that around noon on December 15, the U.S. set a new production record for oil.', 'It is possible that the EIA could slightly adjust the production numbers once it publishes the final monthly numbers for 2023. That won’t happen until March or April of next year. But at most it would shift the record date by a day or two. It won’t change the fact that a new oil production record was set.', 'An open question is how high the record will be set. Again, if we assume a more conservative 13.0 million BPD of production for the rest of December — which would be the lowest monthly number since July — then the year would end up at 4.70 billion barrels. That would be nearly 5% above the previous record, or 210 million barrels above that 2019 level.', 'A new production record fulfills one of the 2023 energy predictions I made in January. For more information, I alluded to the record earlier this week in a TikTok video and discussed it in some detail on the year-end episode of In the Oil Patch Radio.', 'The U.S. is also on pace to set a new natural gas production record this year. Through September, we are running a little over 4% above last year’s record. However, to my knowledge the EIA does not report weekly natural gas production numbers. Therefore, this record can’t be estimated as precisely as the record for oil.', 'Assuming September production remains the same for the rest of the year, the natural gas production record would be set around December 20. But there is probably about five days of uncertainty in either direction due to the variability in monthly gas production. We won’t know the timing for certain until the EIA releases the monthly numbers for natural gas next year, but it is near certain that we will set a new record for natural gas as well.', 'By Robert Rapier for Oilprice.com', 'More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:', 'Schottky Junction Electrode Revolutionizes Seawater Electrolysis', 'U.S. States Make Bold Move to Reclassify Gold and Silver', 'Car Ownership is More Expensive Than Ever', 'Read this article on OilPrice.com']"

The legislation would also take other steps to treat gold and silver as money instead of as commodities.', 'In Missouri, Rep Doug Richey filed HB1867 on Dec. 11. Rep. Bill Hardwick filed HB1955 on Dec. 15. The bills are companions to SB735 filed in the Senate by Sen. William Eigel earlier this month.', 'In Oklahoma, Sen. Shane Jett filed SB1507 and Sen. Nathan Dahm is running SB1508.', 'The enactment of any of these bills would eliminate state capital gains taxes on the sale and exchange of gold and silver bullion.', 'Both of these states are already among the 42 that do not levy sales taxes on gold and silver bullion.', 'Exempting the sale of gold and silver bullion from taxes lowers the investment cost of precious metals. It also takes a step toward treating gold and silver as money instead of commodities. Taxes on precious metal bullion erect barriers to using gold and silver as money by raising transaction costs.', 'Imagine if you asked a grocery clerk to break a $5 bill and he charged you a 35-cent tax. Silly, right? After all, you were only exchanging one form of money for another. But that’s essentially what a sales tax on gold and silver bullion does. By eliminating this tax on the exchange of gold and silver, Missouri and Oklahoma would treat specie as money instead of a commodity. This represents a small step toward reestablishing gold and silver as legal tender and breaking down the Fed’s monopoly on money.', '“We ought not to tax money – and that’s a good idea. It makes no sense to tax money,” former U.S. Rep. Ron Paul said during testimony in support of an Arizona bill that repealed capital gains taxes on gold and silver in that state. “Paper is not money, it’s fraud,” he continued.', 'The impact of enacting this legislation will go beyond mere tax policy. During an event after his Senate committee testimony, Paul pointed out that it’s really about the size and scope of government.', '“If you’re for less government, you want sound money. The people who want big government, they don’t want sound money. They want to deceive you and commit fraud. They want to print the money. They want a monopoly. They want to get you conditioned, as our schools have conditioned us, to the point where deficits don’t matter.”', 'Under provisions in the Missouri bill, gold and silver in physical or electronic form would be accepted as legal tender and would be receivable in payment of all debts contracted for in the state of Missouri. The state would be required to accept gold and silver for the payment of public debts. Private debts could be settled in gold and silver at the parties’ discretion.', 'Practically speaking, this would allow Missourians to use gold or silver coins as money rather than just as mere investment vehicles. In effect, it would put gold and silver on the same footing as Federal Reserve notes.', 'Oklahoma took a similar step in 2014. Utah and Arkansas also consider gold and silver legal tender.', 'The proposed Missouri law also includes provisions authorizing the state to invest in gold or silver “greater than or equal to one percent of all state funds” and to expressly bar any state agency, department, or political subdivision from seizing gold or silver bullion.', 'The United States Constitution states in Article I, Section 10, “No State shall…make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts.” Currently, all debts and taxes in the US are either paid with Federal Reserve Notes (dollars) which were authorized as legal tender by Congress, or with coins issued by the US Treasury — very few of which have gold or silver in them.', 'The Federal Reserve destroys this constitutional monetary system by creating a monopoly based on its fiat currency. Without the backing of gold or silver, the central bank can easily create money out of thin air. This not only devalues your purchasing power over time; it also allows the federal government to borrow and spend far beyond what would be possible in a sound money system. Without the Fed, the US government wouldn’t be able to maintain all of its unconstitutional wars and programs.

As this happens, a cascade of events can begin to occur, including the flow of real wealth toward the state’s treasury, an influx of banking business from outside of the state – as people in other states carry out their desire to bank with sound money – and an eventual outcry against the use of Federal Reserve notes for any transactions.”', 'Once things get to that point, Federal Reserve notes would become largely unwanted and irrelevant for ordinary people.', 'These bills make up part of a broader movement at the state level to support sound money.', 'By Zerohedge.com', 'More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:', ""AMLO's Oil-Heavy Energy Policies Face Scrutiny"", 'Is the ESG Investment Bubble Bursting?', 'Schottky Junction Electrode Revolutionizes Seawater Electrolysis', 'Read this article on OilPrice.com']"

But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at News’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.', ' See our latest analysis for News ', 'Good news, investors! News is still a bargain right now. According to our valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $32.55, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. What’s more interesting is that, News’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.', 'Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price.

It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.', 'Are you a shareholder? Since NWSA is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on NWSA for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy NWSA.

The launch of ChatGPT in late 2022 opened the floodgates of interest in generative artificial intelligence (AI), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) was a big beneficiary of the trend -- with its share price more than doubling year to date. Going into 2024, the legendary chipmaker is on track to prove itself worthy of the recent bull run. Let's discuss three reasons why its shares are still a long-term buy. "", ""According to AMD's CEO, Lisa Su, the data center AI chip industry could surge from its current value of $45 billion to a jaw-dropping $400 billion by 2027. AMD's rival, Nvidia, currently dominates the opportunity with a market share of 80% because of its advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) like the h100 and a100, which trained ChatGPT. But AMD aims to capture a slice of this fast-growing pie. "", ""The company is positioning itself to compete through its new MI300 family of chips, which it claims can outperform Nvidia's flagship h100 in training and inference -- the process of running generative AI models. "", ""AMD has already secured big-name clients like Meta Platforms, OpenAI, and Microsoft, and these early adopters serve as a convincing vote of confidence in the MI300's quality. Investors should expect the new products to start lifting AMD sales significantly in 2024 and beyond. "", ""While Nvidia will likely reestablish its technical lead over AMD with new chip releases of its own, there is still plenty of room for both players in the market because of its rapid expansion and high prices. According to CNN, the AI chip market faces widespread shortages and bottlenecks. And AMD's MI300 can help solve this problem for consumers. "", ""While AMD's burgeoning AI business is taking the spotlight, investors shouldn't lose sight of the company's legacy operations related to consumer and enterprise processors and graphics. "", ""The company faced challenges in 2022 from the post-pandemic slowdown in PC sales, inflation, and rising interest rates, which crushed people's purchasing power. Like many U.S. tech companies, it also faced ongoing challenges in China, where government policy restricts the export of America's most advanced computer hardware. The good news is that many of these headwinds seem to be in the rearview mirror. "", ""While AMD's total revenue only grew by 4% year over year to $5.8 billion, it enjoyed a sharp recovery in the client segment, which refers to chips for PCs and laptop makers. "", ""Sales in this business rose 42% to $1.5 billion because of the popularity of AMD's new Ryzen 7000 processors for PCs. The company has also stabilized its bottom line. Third-quarter operating income surged from a loss of $64 million to a gain of $224 million through cost-cutting and increasing sales of its higher-margin hardware. And while China remains an overhang, the company is considering making specific, less advanced chips for the country to comply with U.S. export controls. "", ""When it comes to AI chips, Nvidia remains the elephant in the room. With its advantages in market share and development speed, the GPU specialist will likely remain the biggest winner in the long-term opportunity. But that doesn't mean investors should ignore other options. With its price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 9.9 compared to Nvidia's 26.7, AMD is cheaper than its rival based on backward-looking metrics. "", 'To be fair, both companies\' ""true"" valuations may have to do more with how they are expected to perform in the future. And with a much faster growth rate, Nvidia still has the edge. But as the upstart, AMD boasts the potential to exceed analysts\' expectations with its new AI chips, making it an under-the-radar way to bet on this fast-growing market in 2024 and beyond.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Advanced Micro Devices wasn't one of them.

Nvidia has carved out a lucrative role in the industry thanks to its years of dominance in graphics processing units (GPUs). While competition in the software side of AI has grown intense, Nvidia is cashing in by supplying its hardware to the many companies joining the sector.', ""Despite the run-up in the company's share price this year, Nvidia likely still has more growth to offer new investors. The AI market is expanding rapidly, with chip demand soaring right along with it."", ""Here's why Nvidia is a screaming buy right now."", ""According to Grand View Research, the AI market was valued at $137 billion in 2022 and is expected to expand at a compound annual rate of 37% until at least 2030. Those projections would see the sector exceed $1 trillion before the end of the decade, suggesting there's plenty of room for Nvidia to remain atop the AI chip market and grow even as new players join."", ""Chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel have products in the works that will challenge Nvidia's near-total dominance in AI chips in 2024. However, taking a significant chunk out of Nvidia's estimated 90% market share in AI GPUs will likely be an uphill battle. While its competitors have been scrambling to catch up, the company has become the gold standard in AI hardware."", ""Moreover, Nvidia's head start in AI has given it the funds to continue investing in R&D that can help it keep its lead and retain its dominance. Nvidia's free cash flow has more than tripled this year, from $5 billion to more than $17 billion, while AMD's has sunk from $3 billion to $1 billion. And Intel's free cash flow has plunged by 150% since 2020, from $20 billion to a negative $10 billion."", ""In its fiscal 2024 third quarter (which ended Oct. 29), Nvidia's revenue soared 206% year over year to $18 billion, with operating income up more than 1,600% to $10 billion. The company profited from a massive spike in AI GPU sales, as reflected in its 279% rise in data center revenue of $14 billion. AI chip demand is only likely to continue rising for the foreseeable future, and Nvidia is well-positioned to see significant gains for years."", ""There's been much speculation on whether Nvidia can keep up its current growth trajectory. The 235% rise in its stock price this year will be challenging to replicate in 2024. However, a company doesn't have to deliver the same percentage of share price growth year after year to be a stellar buy. And projections suggest Nvidia shares still have plenty of room left to run."", ""As the table above shows, estimates are that Nvidia's earnings could hit nearly $24 per share by its fiscal 2026. When that figure is multiplied by the tech giant's current forward price-to-earnings ratio of 45, it gives a stock price of $1,080, suggesting that if it continues to trade at today's ratio, it could gain roughly 120% over the next two years."", ""As such, new investors could more than double their money over the next two years by investing in Nvidia today. That makes it a no-brainer buy, and one you won't want to miss out on."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

Ditto for HBO Max. The Walt Disney Company's (NYSE: DIS) Disney+ and Hulu platforms are high-profile platforms in the direct-to-consumer media business as well."", ""All of them, however, may want to pay closer attention to an increasingly tough contender in the streaming space. Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) Prime has always captured more total view-time in the United States than Disney+. Thanks to Prime's continued growth (and Hulu's lack thereof), though, Amazon's streaming service is now more popular than any of Disney's streaming brands."", ""And this position change has implications for both companies' stocks."", ""The data comes from TV ratings agency Nielsen, and is plotted on the graph below. After a couple years' worth of progress, in October Amazon Prime's total domestic watch-time finally eclipsed Hulu's time-share of domestic television sets. Both lost ground in November, but Hulu clearly lost a great deal more. In fact, Hulu's 2.7% of total U.S. television viewing time is the lowest the figure's been since early 2021. Meanwhile, Disney+ continues to tread water around the 2% mark."", ""Surprised? It would be surprising if you weren't. Walt Disney is one of the world's most powerful media and entertainment outfits, after all. If nothing else, it knows how to make and market video entertainment. Amazon is an e-commerce behemoth and a cloud computing monster. But it isn't exactly known for its on-demand streaming prowess."", ""And yet, there it is. Domestic viewers are finding more to watch on Prime than they are on Hulu or Disney+. It's not a perfect apples-to-apples comparison, of course. Domestic Prime subscribers are far greater in number than domestic Hulu and Disney+ subscribers."", 'While Amazon neither confirms nor denies the numbers, a handful of estimates suggest there are on the order of 160 million Prime customers in the U.S. alone. Conversely, Walt Disney reports that there are only 46.5 million Disney+ subscribers, and only 43.9 million Hulu customers. Prime should be the more watched service of the three in question, if for no other reason than its greater reach.', ""Prime's content library is also bigger. The Disney+ lineup only includes Disney-branded franchises. While Hulu offers more, its assortment is also largely limited to Disney's non-Disney studio content, select ABC content, and programming from Hulu's co-owner NBCUniversal. Amazon shops around for content from several different sources, and it's got the deep pockets to buy whatever content it needs."", ""Most people say they pay for Prime not for access to online video, but for the free shipping the program offers on purchases made at Amazon.com. Many of these people just happen to tune in because they've got access to a sizable digital video library. Hulu and Disney+ aren't a perk. They're the product in and of themselves."", ""Nevertheless, Amazon Prime is gaining view-time ground, while Hulu is losing it, and Disney+ still doesn't have much of it. These trends have implications for both companies' stocks."", ""Don't read too much into this dynamic for either organization. Cable television and theme parks remain Disney's top breadwinners. Amazon's top source of revenue is still e-commerce, while its big moneymaker is cloud computing."", ""Nielsen's measured shift in domestic viewing time for Prime and Hulu isn't exactly earth-shattering. But there is valuable information to be gleaned here about both companies."", 'For Amazon, the information is bullish. Simply put, the data suggests that most U.S. consumers are still big fans of (and users of) Prime. It matters just because Prime members are also more likely to shop at Amazon.com when free shipping is an option.', ""Market research firm Digital Commerce 360 reports that Prime's free shipping perk is the second biggest reason people shop with Amazon, in fact; the first reason is Amazon's enormous selection. Several estimates indicate that Prime subscribers spend two to three times as much at Amazon.com as non-Prime customers do."", ""Then there's the new, ancillary reason Nielsen's numbers are kind of a big deal.\xa0Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Amazon's e-commerce model was simple and straightforward. Now, its online shopping model is evolving and more nuanced. Turning a profit on the sale of goods is no longer its sole e-commerce goal. Rather, the company is building an advertising business that monetizes Amazon.com's web traffic in a different way. It did over $12 billion worth of ad business last quarter, up 25% year over year."", ""It's still the early days for this particular profit center, which likely boasts better profit margins than the simple sale of goods online does. More -- and better engaged -- Prime members could bolster this aspect of the company's business more than most investors might expect."", 'As for Walt Disney, the relative disinterest in Disney+ and the growing disinterest in Hulu is a red flag.', 'You may recall that the hype surrounding the late 2019 launch of Disney+ was palpable. Netflix had already proven streaming can be a viable business, but Disney was a natural when it came to content creation and marketing. The company even restructured itself in 2020 to prioritize the growth of its streaming services over all its other divisions.', ""But its streaming hasn't quite lived up to expectations. Although the media giant got to within sight of its initial streaming customer goals, its direct-to-consumer arm remains well in the red, losing over $400 million last quarter alone on over $5 billion in revenue."", ""To its credit, Disney is cutting costs in an effort to push its streaming business out of the red and into the black. Early this year, it vowed to cull $5.5 billion worth of annual expenses, and then upped that figure by another $2 billion in November. Decreased spending on content is a core component of this plan, and could be at least part of the reason why Disney's streaming losses are shrinking."", ""Spending less on programming is a double-edged sword, though. Disney+ and Hulu's U.S. customer headcount growth was already slowing down. In 2023, it's completely flatlined. The company is seeing a comparable slowdown with its international streaming brands as well -- not that it matters a great deal. Most of its direct-to-consumer revenue is driven domestically anyway."", ""It matters simply because streaming makes up over one-fifth of Disney's top line, yet streaming's profit margin rates are still miles away from those of its cable television business, its sports arm, and its theme park and hotel division. Even a direct-to-consumer business that's made profitable may never be as profitable as these other divisions, and that's assuming less spending on content doesn't continue to chip away at subscriber growth.

On a more positive note, with anticipated rate cuts on the horizon post-Fed’s recent meeting, the focus shifts to inflation-resistant investments. Consumer staples stocks emerge as a smart choice, offering both stability and potential growth. These stocks are less susceptible to economic downturns, providing a buffer in these turbulent times. In this context, here are seven standout consumer staples stocks to buy, poised not just for strong downside protection but also for promising upside in the face of ongoing market volatility.', 'Procter & Gamble\xa0(NYSE:PG) stands out as one of the most reliable consumer staples stocks to buy and long-term investments in the current stock market landscape.

In the past three consecutive quarters, PG has beaten estimates across both lines by comfortable margins, showcasing its prowess.

Excelling in food, beverages, and snacks, the company’s strength lies in its powerful branding, which has effectively driven volume growth despite rising prices. In its third-quarter earnings call, the company reported impressive sales of $9.02 billion, marking a 16.2% year-over-year (YOY) increase and an adjusted EPS of 82 cents which beat estimates by four cents.', 'This success is a continuation of Mondelez’s trend of consistently beating estimates for seven consecutive quarters, demonstrating its robust positioning in the market. Additionally, its dividend profile is equally impressive, with a forward dividend yield of 2.35% and an annual payout of $1.70, complemented by a five-year growth rate of 11.42% and nine years of dividend growth.

This positive outlook comes despite the global decline in smoking prevalence over the past several years. However, it’s worth noting that in many countries, smoking rates remain stable or have been elevated. Additionally, Philip Morris is actively developing heat-not-burn products and other alternative devices to offset these losses.

The company’s stock has seen a commendable uptick of 12%, outpacing the sector’s median growth of 6.9%. This performance is indicative of PG&E’s resilience and adaptability in a challenging economic landscape.', 'Additionally, the company’s declaration of a cash dividend for the first time since 2017 signals a return to stability and reliability.

(NASDAQ:XRAY) is about to go ex-dividend in just three days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. This means that investors who purchase DENTSPLY SIRONA's shares on or after the 28th of December will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 12th of January."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.14 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$0.56 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that DENTSPLY SIRONA has a trailing yield of 1.6% on the current share price of $35.22. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing."", ' See our latest analysis for DENTSPLY SIRONA ', ""If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. DENTSPLY SIRONA lost money last year, so the fact that it's paying a dividend is certainly disconcerting. There might be a good reason for this, but we'd want to look into it further before getting comfortable. Considering the lack of profitability, we also need to check if the company generated enough cash flow to cover the dividend payment. If DENTSPLY SIRONA didn't generate enough cash to pay the dividend, then it must have either paid from cash in the bank or by borrowing money, neither of which is sustainable in the long term. Dividends consumed 51% of the company's free cash flow last year, which is within a normal range for most dividend-paying organisations."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", 'Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. DENTSPLY SIRONA reported a loss last year, but at least the general trend suggests its income has been improving over the past five years. Even so, an unprofitable company whose business does not quickly recover is usually not a good candidate for dividend investors.', ""Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the past 10 years, DENTSPLY SIRONA has increased its dividend at approximately 9.8% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders."", ""Get our latest analysis on DENTSPLY SIRONA's balance sheet health here."", ""From a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid DENTSPLY SIRONA? It's hard to get used to DENTSPLY SIRONA paying a dividend despite reporting a loss over the past year. At least the dividend was covered by free cash flow, however. Bottom line: DENTSPLY SIRONA has some unfortunate characteristics that we think could lead to sub-optimal outcomes for dividend investors."", ""With that being said, if you're still considering DENTSPLY SIRONA as an investment, you'll find it beneficial to know what risks this stock is facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for DENTSPLY SIRONA you should know about."", ""If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks."", 'Have feedback on this article?

Memory chip inventories skyrocketed in 2022 as PC and smartphone sales dropped and Micron's customers pared back spending to manage their cash during the downturn. However, as the generative AI hype has developed into a full-fledged industry with massive growth potential, demand for bleeding-edge memory has ratcheted back up. In anticipation of a multi-year run-up for Micron's sales, especially for AI applications, Micron stock has rallied an impressive 70% in 2023, and is homing back in on all-time highs."", ""There's just one problem: Micron is still rebuilding its way back to profitability after its massive slump in the last year. But there's another way to play the memory chip market, a stock that could be poised to soar in 2024 and beyond."", 'Lam Research (NASDAQ: LRCX) is part of what I call the ""fab five,"" the five companies that control the majority of equipment bought by semiconductor fabs (a facility that manufactures silicon wafers, which eventually get diced into chips). Besides Lam, the third-biggest of this group, there\'s ASML Holding, Applied Materials, Tokyo Electron, and KLA Corp.', ""Historically, Lam's equipment was heavily tilted toward memory chipmakers like Micron. At the peak of the last fab equipment spending boom (late in calendar year 2022 for Lam), memory chip customers totaled half of total revenue, and up to two-thirds early in 2022!"", ""But as customers like Micron got hit hard by the downturn and aggressively reduced equipment spending, Lam's memory business got hit too. As of the quarter ended in September 2023, Lam's memory chip fab revenue had fallen to just 38% of total sales."", ""However, Micron and its peers have been indicating a memory chip bottom is in the rearview mirror -- Micron revenue was $4.73 billion in the quarter ended in November 2023, up from just $4 billion the quarter prior, and it's expected to rise again to $5.3 billion for the quarter ended in February 2024. All-time record sales are in view by calendar year 2025, putting Lam in a position to recoup that lost memory equipment revenue."", ""Of course, Lam's own rally could be lumpy. After all, Micron did indicate that while it expects its fiscal 2024 expenditures on property and equipment to be up slightly from 2023, its wafer fab equipment spending specifically could remain muted."", ""One reason for that is Micron is undergoing a massive expansion of its operations, particularly in its home state of Idaho, but also including a new complex in New York. Once the construction of those facilities is complete, though, they'll eventually need to line up for Lam's machines to start cranking out more semiconductors."", 'That said, Micron and other memory chipmakers have been repurposing existing equipment for use in the highest-demand markets, like for AI. To move and set up this equipment, a company like Lam is often tapped for help. To wit, 40% of Lam\'s revenue in its last quarter (which ended in September 2023) wasn\'t equipment at all, but ""customer support-related revenue"" -- like moving and repurposing Micron\'s existing but underutilized fab equipment.', ""There's also more to Lam's story than just memory these days. The company has been working on new equipment to address its growing logic chip and third-party foundry customers as well, customers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. Logic and foundry revenue actually reached 62% of total sales in the latest quarter."", ""You're starting to get the idea. Whether it's memory chip or logic and foundry equipment, or the sale of new equipment or repurposing of existing machinery, chipmakers of all sorts will go through Lam (and the other fab five) for the next semiconductor boom."", 'Granted, the market has already gotten wind of the goldmine (silicon mine?) of opportunity Lam is sitting on for the next few years. The stock already rallied nearly 90% in 2023 off of its multi-year lows, and is actually making new all-time highs.', ""However, unlike memory chipmakers like Micron, Lam remained highly profitable throughout this last industry downturn. Management has a track record of steadily increasing profit margins over time, and though it's planning some strategic investments in 2024 that could keep a lid on margins this coming year, its long-term goal remains unchanged."", ""As of this writing, Lam stock trades for about 22 times Wall Street analysts' estimates for next year's (fiscal 2025 for Lam) earnings per share, or about 24 times expected forward free cash flow. It's a reasonable price for a company starting to heat up again with lots of demand for chip equipment needed in the years to come. Lam stock looks like a great long-term buy to me in 2024."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Lam Research right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Lam Research, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Lam Research wasn't one of them.

When we see a declining return on capital employed (ROCE) in conjunction with a declining base of capital employed, that's often how a mature business shows signs of aging. Basically the company is earning less on its investments and it is also reducing its total assets. So after glancing at the trends within Tripadvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP), we weren't too hopeful."", ""For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business.

If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Tripadvisor."", ""We are a bit worried about the trend of returns on capital at Tripadvisor. About five years ago, returns on capital were 9.7%, however they're now substantially lower than that as we saw above. Meanwhile, capital employed in the business has stayed roughly the flat over the period. Since returns are falling and the business has the same amount of assets employed, this can suggest it's a mature business that hasn't had much growth in the last five years. If these trends continue, we wouldn't expect Tripadvisor to turn into a multi-bagger."", ""All in all, the lower returns from the same amount of capital employed aren't exactly signs of a compounding machine. Investors haven't taken kindly to these developments, since the stock has declined 56% from where it was five years ago. That being the case, unless the underlying trends revert to a more positive trajectory, we'd consider looking elsewhere."", ""While Tripadvisor doesn't shine too bright in this respect, it's still worth seeing if the company is trading at attractive prices.

Yes, it’s an extremely high-risk move, with Mullen being a prominent meme stock prone to short squeezes. However, the company’s dilution-dependent path ahead seems to guarantee further declines over time. With no leverage and modest position sizing, shorting could pay off since gravity will ultimately catch up to the price. Remember, Mullen has plans to reverse split shares again on Dec. 18 to meet Nasdaq’s minimum requirement. That will spur another wave of dilution as more shares are created.', 'Source: Hyliion media', 'Hyliion (NYSE:HYLN) doesn’t look much better than Mullen in my eyes. Its strategy to electrify commercial vehicles and reduce transportation emissions is noble. But I fail to see how Hyliion can deliver shareholder returns on this vision anytime soon — or possibly ever. Most analysts expect the company to remain unprofitable for the foreseeable future. Management recently pivoted away from its core hybrid powertrain business, signaling the strategy itself likely needs retooling.', 'On the one hand, Hyliion has an ample cash position above $182 million, which offers some breathing room. Revenue growth projections also look strong as the firm lands more fleet deals. However, with losses ballooning — $153 million last year — and potentially $120 million more in 2023, something needs to change fast. Otherwise, further dilution appears inevitable to keep operations funded if profits remain elusive. For this reason, cutting ties with Hyliion seems prudent before the cash drain worsens.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Shifting to the bullish side, FTAI Aviation (NASDAQ:FTAI) has been one of 2023’s biggest stock winners, with its shares up nearly 150% year-to-date. Yet even after this tremendous run, I believe FTAI still has ample runway ahead in 2024. Consensus analyst forecasts call for EPS to more than double over the next two years, rising from $1.44 to $3.28 per share. That puts the stock’s forward 2027 P/E ratio at just 13.5x — quite reasonable for a high-growth story.', 'Admittedly, FTAI’s projected revenue growth rate looks less exciting beyond this year’s 64% estimated jump. But it’s the company’s expanding profitability that should keep driving shares higher. When you find a growth stock that is actually enhancing margins and bottom-line returns amid expansion, it signals a sustainable winning strategy to me. For these reasons, I think FTAI can deliver strong returns next year as well.', 'Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com', 'On the flip side from FTAI, Newell (NASDAQ:NWL) is no high-flying momentum story.

But early signs now hint a comeback may be stirring.', 'Stabilizing margins and balance sheet health indicate management has executed necessary restructuring initiatives. Once macro volatility subsides, I expect Newell’s revenues to bounce back. Near its 2008 lows, NWL stock just seems far too cheap at current levels if you have a long-term mindset. Consensus forecasts call for sizable near-term earnings growth as well, with EPS potentially soaring from $0.75 this year to $1.38 by 2027. That equates to only a 6.4x forward P/E multiple three years out. With top-line growth projected to become positive in 2025, too, this paints the picture of a business poised to normalize again.

Shares of the technology giant have soared nearly 60% higher thanks in large part to a generative AI boom.', ""I think that Alphabet can keep this momentum going in the new year. It seems likely that the U.S. economy will avoid a recession. Inflation is moderating. The Federal Reserve expects that interest rate cuts will be on the way. That's good news for Alphabet because it should mean that advertising revenue will remain strong."", 'Look for Gemini Ultra to make a big splash in 2024.

The stock has more room to run next year, in my view."", 'Those potential interest rate cuts I mentioned earlier could provide a nice tailwind for D.R. Horton.

Horton to build their home than any other builder in the United States.""', ""Even without rate cuts, D.R. Horton's business should continue to boom. There's a significant housing shortage in the U.S. The only way to alleviate the problem is for new houses to be built."", ""What I especially like about D.R.

The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$2.21b', 'US$2.53b', 'US$2.81b', 'US$3.28b', 'US$3.60b', 'US$3.87b', 'US$4.09b', 'US$4.29b', 'US$4.46b', 'US$4.62b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x10', 'Analyst x5', 'Analyst x2', 'Analyst x1', 'Est @ 9.71%', 'Est @ 7.46%', 'Est @ 5.89%', 'Est @ 4.79%', 'Est @ 4.02%', 'Est @ 3.48%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.9% ', 'US$2.0k', 'US$2.2k', 'US$2.2k', 'US$2.4k', 'US$2.5k', 'US$2.5k', 'US$2.4k', 'US$2.3k', 'US$2.3k', 'US$2.2k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$23b', ""After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage.

In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth.

If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Norfolk Southern as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.135. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

Given its impressive performance, we decided to study the company's key financial indicators as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to LKQ's  ROE today."", ""Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity."", ' Check out our latest analysis for LKQ ', 'The formula for ROE is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for LKQ is:', '16% = US$953m ÷ US$6.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.16 in profit."", 'So far, we\'ve learned that ROE is a measure of a company\'s profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.', ""To begin with, LKQ seems to have a respectable ROE. Yet, the fact that the company's ROE is lower than the industry average of 22% does temper our expectations. Still, we can see that LKQ has seen a remarkable net income growth of 21% over the past five years. Therefore, there could be other causes behind this growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio. Bear in mind, the company does have a respectable ROE. It is just that the industry ROE is higher. So this certainly also provides some context to the high earnings growth seen by the company."", ""We then performed a comparison between LKQ's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 23% in the same 5-year period."", ""Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is LKQ fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know."", ""LKQ's ' three-year median payout ratio is on the lower side at 24% implying that it is retaining a higher percentage (76%) of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business as evidenced by the growth seen by the company."", ""While LKQ has been growing its earnings, it only recently started to pay dividends which likely means that the company decided to impress new and existing shareholders with a dividend. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 29%. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 16%."", ""On the whole, we feel that LKQ's performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business at a moderate rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

If you want to skip our discussion on the global perception of Americans, you can go directly to the 5 Countries That Welcome Americans With Open Arms.', 'With a considerable number of Americans eager to travel abroad, whether for extended stays or short vacations, it is important to consider the reception they might receive from the locals in these countries. The friendliness of the people in these destinations can play an important role in shaping the overall experience of Americans during their vacations. This year has seen a surge in American international travel, with Americans arriving in record numbers in Europe and the Pacific. There has also been an increased demand for passports since the pandemic and lockdowns ended, with 22 million passports issued in 2022. Meanwhile, 2023 saw an even larger number of passport applications, with the US State Department receiving 500,000 applications weekly.', ""The global population's attitude towards Americans has differed over time and is influenced by numerous factors, such as political events, economic conditions, and cultural exchanges. According to the Pew Research Center, the percentage of the global public that has a favorable view of the United States is on the decline. Globally, a median of 59% holds a favorable view of the United States. This is slightly lower than the 61% during 2022. It should be noted that favorability for Americans went up in Biden’s first year of presidency. However, with the onset of the second year, the global public started losing confidence in the 81-year-old US president. This is signified by the 2% drop in global favorable views between 2022 and 2023."", 'European countries represent a major chunk of American-friendly countries. Poland and Sweden are among the top 25 countries that welcome Americans with open arms in Europe. You can also check out the 30 Friendliest Countries in the World here. This coalition between the US and Europe is further strengthened by the exposure of American multinational companies in Europe, where they generate a substantial portion of their sales. Notable examples include Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), a leading American online travel agency that derives 78% of its sales from Europe. Additionally, Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), a prominent American cosmetics company, reports that 43% of its revenue comes from Europe. Cooper Companies (NASDAQ:COO), a global medical device company based in the US, also obtains 41% of its sales from Europe.

Three companies positively contributed over 0.5% (in Australian dollars) to the Fund’s returns for the quarter (Booking Holdings Inc.

No companies detracted from the Portfolio’s returns by 0.5% or more.', 'As part of our travels during the quarter (see page 6) we had the opportunity to meet with management of both Booking Holdings and Intuit. We continue to view both companies as exceptionally well managed.', 'Booking Holdings, the world’s leading online travel agency, continues to benefit from a strong global travel environment with particular strength in Europe, Booking Holdings’ core market. Fears of peak ‘revenge travel’ following COVID-19 lockdowns have been misplaced in our view. We assess current travel volumes to be only slightly elevated compared to pre-COVID-19 trends, with some regions, particularly outbound travel from China, still relatively depressed. Anyone who has travelled anywhere recently will be nodding when we say hotel rates have increased meaningfully in recent times. Accommodation providers are generally doing quite well, but the increased hotel rates have been necessary to offset inflation in costs such as employee salaries and additional cleaning services. As Booking Holdings ‘clips the ticket’ of accommodation spend, the company has benefitted from increased average daily hotel rates. Importantly, Booking Holdings continues to invest in its business, improving the reach, quality and range of services it provides, resulting in gains in market share and an extension of its industry leadership position. Booking Holdings is now more fairly valued by the market, but still provides attractive base case risk-adjusted returns and remains one of the larger investments in the Fund.”', '20 Countries With the Most American Expats', 'Our Methodology', 'To shortlist the 25 countries that welcome Americans with open arms, consulted various credible sources such as the \xa0Pew Research Centre, Forbes, and Global Citizen Solutions.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. Although, when we looked at Alliant Energy (NASDAQ:LNT), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes."", ""For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business.

Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 4.7% and the business has deployed 38% more capital into its operations. This poor ROCE doesn't inspire confidence right now, and with the increase in capital employed, it's evident that the business isn't deploying the funds into high return investments."", ""Long story short, while Alliant Energy has been reinvesting its capital, the returns that it's generating haven't increased. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 41% over the last five years. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high."", ""One final note, you should learn about the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Alliant Energy (including 1 which is concerning) ."", 'If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.', 'Have feedback on this article?
