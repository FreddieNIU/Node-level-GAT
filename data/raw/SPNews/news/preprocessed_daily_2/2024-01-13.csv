Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA), The Boeing Co. (BA) and Sony Group Corp. (SONY). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>NVIDIA’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the past six months (+19.3% vs. +16.9%). The company’s computer & networking revenues are gaining from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing and accelerated computing.The data center end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of AI-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds.Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)Shares of Boeing have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+4% vs. -6.8%). The company remains the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States in terms of revenues, orders and deliveries. During the third quarter, the jet giant booked 398 net commercial airplane orders.A strengthening U.S. defense budget should also boost Boeing’s Defense, Space & Security segment growth. Boeing has ample liquidity to meet its debt obligations in the near term.However, Boeing expects supply-chain disruptions to continue to harm its operational results, at least in the near term. Its dispute with Embraer over termination of the earlier joint venture might cause it to incur some loss in the future. Rising jet fuel price also poses a threat to the stock’s future growth.(You can read the full research report on Boeing here >>>)Sony’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Audio Video Production industry over the past year (+13.7% vs. +12.7%). The company’s performance is benefiting from continued strength in the Games & Network (G&NS) segment. The company continues to expect to sell more than 25 million units of its PlayStation 5 in the current year.SONY sold 4.9 million units of PS5 in Q2, up 25% year over year. Strength in Music, and Pictures segments are other tailwinds. The Music segment benefits from higher recorded music and music publishing sales from paid subscription streaming services. Frequent product launches and strategic collaborations bode well.The company also raised overall guidance for fiscal 2023 revenues It now expects sales of ¥12,400 billion compared with the earlier guidance of ¥12,200 billion. However, SONY lowered guidance for Pictures and Financial Services segments.

It also manufactures a wide range of analog and embedded chips for the industrial, enterprise systems, communication equipment, and personal electronics markets.', ""Over the past 12 months, Mobileye's stock fell 6% as TI's stock dipped 7%. During the same period, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rallied 48%. Let's see why both chip stocks slumped -- and if either one is a worthwhile turnaround play."", ""Mobileye's revenue rose 43% in 2021 as the pandemic's height passed and automakers resumed their production of new vehicles. The company's revenue grew another 35% in 2022, even as STMicroelectronics\xa0-- which manufactures all of its EyeQ chips -- grappled with supply chain constraints throughout the first half of the year."", 'But for 2023, Mobileye only anticipates 11% revenue growth. It expects that slowdown to intensify with a 6% to 12% revenue decline in 2024. That abrupt deceleration was caused by a combination of macro headwinds and supply imbalances.', ""Inflation, rising interest rates, and union strikes all throttled Mobileye's growth by driving major automakers to rein in their spending over the past year. Its sales in China also slowed down as the country's electric vehicle (EV) market cooled off."", 'To make matters worse, many automakers had accumulated Mobileye\'s EyeQ chips throughout 2021 and 2022 to cope with supply chain constraints. As a result, Mobileye now estimates that its top customers are holding an excess inventory of about ""6 to 7 million"" EyeQ chips -- and it doesn\'t expect to resolve that supply glut anytime soon.', ""As Mobileye's revenue growth stalls out, it expects its adjusted operating margin to drop from 37% in 2022 to 33% in 2023 and a midpoint of 17% in 2024. Analysts expect its adjusted earnings to rise just 1% in 2023 and decline 34% in 2024. Those are dismal growth rates for a stock still trading about 78 times forward earnings."", ""Texas Instruments' revenue rose 27% in 2021 as the pandemic-related headwinds dissipated. However, its revenue\xa0rose 9% in 2022 -- and analysts expect a 12% decline in 2023, followed by just 1% growth in 2024."", ""That slowdown was mainly caused by macro headwinds. Over the past few quarters, the weakness of TI's industrial and communications equipment markets offset the growth of its automotive, personal electronics, and enterprise systems markets. It also continued to face challenges in China, where the country's industrial sector recovered at a slower-than-expected rate over the past year."", ""On the bright side, TI isn't dependent on the PC market, which suffered a severe post-pandemic slowdown, or the tech war between the U.S. and China -- since the company only produces lower-end analog and embedded chips instead of higher-end CPUs and GPUs. However, TI still generated about 40% of its revenue from the industrial sector in 2022, and many of those customers are still struggling in this tough macro environment."", 'But instead of cutting costs to deal with that slowdown, TI is ramping up its spending on upgrades for its plants and its transition from 200mm to 300mm wafers -- which could reduce the costs of its unpackaged parts by roughly 40%.', ""Analysts expect that mix of slowing revenue growth and higher expenses to reduce its operating margin from 51% in 2022 to 42% in 2023 and 39% in 2024. They expect its earnings to decline 25% in 2023 and drop another 7% in 2024. Those near-term growth rates look dismal, and its stock doesn't seem like a screaming bargain at 25 times forward earnings. Nevertheless, its forward dividend yield of 3.1% might limit its downside potential in this choppy market."", ""I'm not a fan of either of these chip stocks right now. But if I had to pick one over the other, I'd definitely stick with TI because it's better diversified, has a wider moat, and isn't suffering from a severe supply glut. TI stock also looks more reasonably valued relative to its near-term growth, and pays a reliable dividend. It's impossible for me to recommend buying Mobileye unless it makes meaningful progress toward resolving its inventory issues."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Mobileye Global right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Mobileye Global, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Mobileye Global wasn't one of them.

To help deal with this situation, however, companies like Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD) have taken to providing earnings guidance updates close to their actual earnings releases. In this way, it can avoid unexpected surprises. This time around, though, Wall Street's thinking was way off the mark. And that was good news."", 'When you compare Steel Dynamics to industry icons like United States Steel (NYSE: X), which has been around for over 100 years, it is a relative upstart. Even industry bellwether and Dividend King\xa0Nucor (NYSE: NUE), which has been operating in the steel sector for roughly 50 years, is a much more established competitor.', ""But don't think Steel Dynamics is a steel industry also-ran. It has grown materially since it opened shop. And while its 13-year streak of dividend increases can't hold a candle to Nucor's 51 years, it trounces its larger peer in an important way. Dividend growth over the past decade has come in at an annualized rate of 16%. Nucor's annualized dividend growth over that span was roughly 3%."", ""In Nucor's defense, it is much easier to grow a small company than it is to grow a large company. And Nucor is a much larger company. But that shouldn't diminish Steel Dynamics' accomplishment. The company is a dividend growth machine, with the annualized hikes over the trailing one-, three-, and five-year periods coming in at even higher rates. Investors looking for a dividend growth play in the steel sector would likely be happier with Steel Dynamics than they would be with Nucor."", ""But a company can't increase its dividend like Steel Dynamics has without also performing well as a business. And that's where a recent earning guidance update from the company comes in. Volume and prices have been a trouble spot in the steel sector, highlighted by Nucor's warning that its fourth-quarter 2023 earnings would be down sequentially, and materially, from its third-quarter showing."", 'Steel Dynamics made a similar announcement. The company provided ""fourth quarter 2023 earnings guidance in the range of $2.60 to $2.64 per diluted share. Comparatively, the company\'s third quarter 2023 earnings were $3.47 per diluted share and prior year fourth quarter earnings were $3.61 per diluted share."" The difference here is that Wall Street thought Steel Dynamics\' update would be worse, expecting around $2.46 per share. The stock price rose on the news.', 'Ultimately, while Nucor cited weak pricing and demand, Steel Dynamics presented a picture that was a bit more mixed across its vertically integrated business. And that rolled up to a guidance range that was better than analysts had been expecting. What it shows is that Steel Dynamics continues to execute well even in a tougher operating environment. Dividend growth investors should appreciate that.', ""Steel Dynamics' 1.5% dividend yield is near its lowest levels over the past decade. It is hard to suggest that it is a screaming buy here, even if you favor dividend growth over yield. That said, given the company's strong performance over time, dividend growth investors would be well advised to keep this stock on their wish list. When the next recession comes along, a time when steel stocks are likely to be indiscriminately punished on Wall Street, you'll probably want to be buying while everyone else is selling."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Steel Dynamics right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Steel Dynamics, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Steel Dynamics wasn't one of them.

This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for State Street Corporation?', 'For State Street Corporation, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.', 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.', 'So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that State Street Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that State Street Corporation would post earnings of $1.77 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.93, delivering a surprise of +9.04%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success.

The company issued a warning that its revenue for the quarter ended in December 2023 will be even worse than previously expected.', 'This news comes hot on the heels of a similar warning from self-driving car and driver-assist chip designer Mobileye (NASDAQ: MBLY), which said a glut of inventory at the start of the new year will sharply reduce its sales.', 'Microchip is a far more diversified company, though, with end-market spanning data centers to cars, healthcare devices to manufacturing. Did Microchip just signal tough times for the economy in 2024?', 'This new current downturn for automotive and industrial chip demand has now been well-broadcast since autumn 2023. Industry giants from Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) to Analog Devices (NASDAQ: ADI) have signaled the weakening environment as their customers deal with an excess of inventory.', 'To be clear, this is a normal cyclical process for semiconductor suppliers. Customers, many of which are hypersensitive to even small changes in economic growth, tend to overpurchase in good times and later cut spending at the first sign of trouble (whether trouble ultimately comes or not).', 'At any rate, the current downcycle for chip demand is deepening. Even Microchip, which has picked up ample market share of its targeted markets in recent years with its focus on chip design and accompanying software (software tends to be far less cyclical than hardware sales), is now feeling the pinch.', 'Previously, Microchip had forecasted its third-quarter fiscal 2024 (which just ended in December 2023) revenue to decline 17.5% from the previous quarter, and 14.5% year over year, to $1.86 billion at the midpoint of guidance.', 'In its most recent update, though, Microchip now expects revenue to be down 22% from the prior quarter, implying revenue will be roughly $1.76 billion -- about $100 million less than before. Ouch!', 'In a prepared statement, Microchip CEO Ganesh Moorthy attributed the revenue miss to the following effect: ""The weakening economic environment that our customers and distributors faced during the December 2023 quarter resulted in many of them wanting to receive a lower level of shipments as they took actions to further de-risk their inventory positions.""', 'That talk of ""a weakening economic environment"" certainly sounds like a bad omen. But bear in mind that this was already broadcast months ago. Industrial, manufacturing, and automotive companies began to feel the impact of higher interest rates in the second half of 2023. It takes time for the effects of hardware and component ordering -- a reduction of which is an action to conserve cash -- to trickle down to a supplier like Microchip.', 'In other words, a drop in quarterly sales is typically a lagging indicator of economic health, not necessarily an indicator of the future.', 'It will now be important to tune into the earnings calls of Microchip and its peers to see what kind of indication they give about a potential bottom of this semiconductor cycle. Previously, the indication was that excess inventories at industrial customers would be resolved by the middle of 2024.', 'This seems to be about a one-year lag behind the previous downturn in smartphone and PC sales, although that downturn ended up lasting a couple quarters longer than originally expected (excess consumer electronic inventories were cleared the second half of 2023, not by the first half).', 'However, counterintuitively, the time to buy semiconductor stocks is in the midst of a cyclical downturn for sales, not after sales have already returned to growth. Look no further than those chip stocks tied closely to PC and smartphone sales in 2023 -- like Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), and Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU). Long before they started indicating a healthier level of customer chip inventory and a return of growth, their stocks rallied in grand fashion.', ""Something similar is likely in store for Microchip -- which explains why the market has minimally penalized its share price despite management being very clear business is going to take a hit. All indications point to Microchip's cyclical downturn being temporary. It will eventually return to growth. And along the way, Microchip has demonstrated an exceptional ability to remain highly profitable."", 'Like I did with stocks like Qualcomm and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) during their downturns over a year ago, I believe the time to buy a stock like Microchip is now. I plan on adding to my position early this year, despite headlines indicating the economy is getting off to a rocky start in 2024.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Microchip Technology right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Microchip Technology, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Microchip Technology wasn't one of them.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index soared more than 40% and even the broader S&P 500 index returned over 25%. But there were still some sectors that missed out on the party.', 'The stocks of renewable energy company NextEra Energy Partners (NYSE: NEP) and its parent company, utility NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE), both got crushed, dropping 56.6% and 27.3%, respectively, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. It was also telling that retail real estate investment trust (REIT) Realty Income (NYSE: O) lost 9.5% in 2023. The reasons behind those drops, and why those stocks could reverse course in 2024, are what investors should be focusing on now.', ""Companies that use debt to help fund their operations have had a difficult economic environment the past two years. As benchmark interest rates quickly rose from around zero to over 5%, costs associated with this extra capital suddenly became a big variable. That's been challenging for these companies -- and unappealing to investors."", ""NextEra Energy Partners is a partnership that acquires and controls renewable energy projects for its parent company, NextEra Energy. Similar to a stock dividend, it pays out the earnings it collects from operations -- known as funds from operations or FFO -- as a distribution to shareholders. Both NextEra entities need to tap the debt and equity markets for investment capital to sustain growth. The terms on NextEra Partners' latest capital raise shows how expense debt is for the partnership in this environment. Just last month it issued debt to raise $750 million at a rate of 7.25%."", 'Those high interest terms are what helped drive investors out of these types of stocks last year. NextEra needs to maintain financial flexibility to purchase energy projects that include contracted solar and wind projects. That upfront capital allocation provides long-term cash flows. To keep that flexibility, in September, NextEra Partners lowered its expected distribution growth rate from a range of 12% to 15% to an annual growth rate of just 6% through at least 2026.', 'REITs like Realty Income have the same higher expense challenges. That company needs to fund acquisitions or investments in new properties to continue generating growth. In addition to its retail-focused portfolio, Realty Income invested $950 million in a Las Vegas casino and agreed to acquire fellow REIT Spirit Realty Capital for about $9.3 billion in 2023. Though the latter was an all-stock transaction, it highlights the continued investments management is making.', ""So there is a reasonable explanation for the drops in these stocks in 2023. But the business fundamentals were not at fault. Realty Income added property diversity last year and maintains a stable retail tenant base provides the cash flow it needs to distribute to shareholders. And NextEra's contracted energy generation provides long-term value and stable cash flows."", ""At its December meeting, the Federal Reserve's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee decided to keep interest rates steady. In the minutes from that meeting, investors saw that most Fed officials now believe that rates will in fact be cut at some point in 2024."", ""That's good news for companies like NextEra and Realty Income that will need to continue to borrow. It also means that the dividends and distributions from these names will be more competitive with savings account and bond yields. For example, Realty Income recently yielded about 5.1%. That's near what many treasury bills and certificates of deposit (CDs) are currently paying."", ""Interest rates beginning to drop should entice income seekers to buy these higher-yielding stocks. Those who own shares now could see capital appreciation on top of the dividend income. That's why it makes sense to take advantage of these stocks' lower prices today."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in NextEra Energy Partners right now?', 'Before you buy stock in NextEra Energy Partners, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and NextEra Energy Partners wasn't one of them.

In the case of real estate investment trusts (REITs), the side effect was a deep drawdown across most of the sector.', ""But Wall Street doesn't go in a straight line, it follows a path that more closely resembles a sine curve, and REITs began to rally toward the end of 2023 as interest rate worries began to ebb. There are still some interesting opportunities in the sector, including Prologis (NYSE: PLD) and Realty Income (NYSE: O)."", ""Here's why you might want to consider buying these two REIT stocks before they surge even higher."", ""Broadly speaking, interest rates can be problematic for REITs because REITs regularly have to tap the capital markets for growth capital. This isn't exactly different from any other company, but it is more acute because REITs pay out most of their cash flow as dividends. This means that any growth investment, be it buying a property or building one, necessitates either selling debt or issuing stock. It simply got more expensive to be a REIT as rates moved up."", ""There's another issue here as well since rising rates can lead to an economic slowdown. Or worse, tip an economy into a recession. For Prologis, which operates in the industrial space, and Realty Income, which has material exposure to retail assets, a recession could translate into weaker occupancy numbers and more difficult lease renewals. So that's a second thing to consider here."", ""But those concerns start to fade if interest rates flatline or, as some now hope, begin to fall. Since Wall Street tends to be forward-looking, it boosted the shares of both of these stocks at the end of 2023 as anticipation began to build for a reversal in the Federal Reserve's interest rate approach in 2024. Over the past three months, Prologis' shares are higher by around 20% while Realty Income is up about 15%."", 'Those are pretty big gains in a very short period of time, so investors need to step back and take a closer look at what they are buying. For starters, Prologis is still off nearly 25% from its 2022 high with Realty Income down 27% or so from its 2020 peak. In other words, neither of these two REITs have fully recovered all of the ground they lost. That suggests that there could still be more upside from here. And it could be fairly substantial.', ""But the real attraction of these two REITs is their positions within the respective niches they serve. Prologis, with a market cap of $120 billion, is one of the largest REITs in existence. Realty Income, with a market cap a touch over $40 billion, is more than twice as large as its next closest peer. Cost of capital is a key point of differentiation in the REIT world, and both of these REITs have the size to more easily access the capital markets than their competitors. Then there's the benefit conferred by being able to execute deals that are simply too large for smaller players to touch, which is another important differentiator."", 'On top of that, both Prologis and Realty Income have globally diversified portfolios. Prologis has a greater geographic reach, offering lessees a single source for warehouse space across North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. The company also happens to own development land in all of those areas as well, so it can grow along with demand (or just sit on the land, waiting for demand to develop as the global economy grows).', ""Realty Income's foreign exposure is largely in Europe, where the net lease approach (requiring tenants to pay most property-level operating costs) is still relatively new. So there's a notable growth opportunity in the region, particularly for a REIT large enough to do big deals and be a trusted partner."", 'All of that is to say that the fundamentals for Prologis and Realty Income remain strong. For added proof of that, Prologis was able to increase rents by an average of roughly 50% in the third quarter of 2023 on renewing leases. And Realty Income was able to recapture 106.9% of expiring lease rents as it signed new deals. These are not businesses that are struggling today, despite the still relatively dour view on Wall Street.', ""If you fear you have missed out on the REIT recovery, don't get too upset. There are still some industry-leading stocks that appear to offer additional recovery potential. That said, it might make sense to stick with the largest and best-positioned competitors, like Prologis and Realty Income, since both continue to execute well on the business front."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Realty Income wasn't one of them.

If it were as easy as stocks only going up, investing wouldn't be as rewarding as it is."", 'The trick is finding the great stocks that have stumbled and will get back up, avoiding those that have fallen and are down for the count. Realty Income (NYSE: O), down 26% from its high, is one to watch.', 'This magnificent monthly real estate dividend stock is poised for a rebound and is worth keeping in your portfolio indefinitely.', 'Here is why.', ""Realty Income was seemingly designed to shower investors with money. After all, it's a real estate investment trust (REIT), a business structure that requires it to pay out at least 90% of its taxable income to shareholders. REITs allow people to invest in real estate without being millionaires who can buy commercial property."", 'One of the cool things about investing in Realty Income is that the company pays a monthly dividend, giving shareholders a steady stream of income. Realty Income focuses on retail properties, renting to tenants like gyms, convenience stores, grocery stores, and other businesses that generally thrive in most economic conditions.', 'So, why is Realty Income down so much? REITs often rely on debt to fund growth since they pay most of their profits as dividends. Higher interest rates over the past couple of years have made funding expansion more expensive. Additionally, higher rates make dividend stocks like Realty Income less appealing to investors who can get competitive yields from other sources like Treasury bonds.', ""Buying Realty Income boils down to acquiring shares in a quality business at an attractive price. Realty Income is unlikely to outrun Amazon in growth in your lifetime. However, over time, it's proven effective at building significant wealth for those able to buy it and hold it long enough to let it work its compounding mojo."", ""The stock has returned roughly 5,000% over its lifetime had you bought and reinvested the dividends. It's outpaced the S&P 500 nearly three-to-one over that time. The company has only grown its funds from operations (FFO), which REITs report in place of earnings, by 5% (median) annually since 1996. Realty Income exemplifies the tortoise winning out, not the hare."", ""Using management's expected 2023 FFO per share of $4, the stock trades at an earnings multiple of 15. It has bounced off lows on the prospects of lower rates in the future, so it's not as eye-poppingly cheap today as it was at $45, its 52-week low. Still, considering the idea is to buy and hold shares, the valuation isn't yet high enough to prevent investors from holding shares and reinvesting those dividends."", 'Realty Income has followed its formula of steady expansion for decades, so investors can expect more of the same unless something drastic happens. Holding a stock like Realty Income long term is more about seeing how battle-tested the company is. Can the business endure adversity, continue growing and paying dividends, and let compounding continue to work?', 'This company has raised its dividend for 30 consecutive years (and counting). During that streak, Realty Income underwent multiple recessions, including the dot-com crash in 2000-2001 and the financial crisis in 2008-2009. It handled COVID-19, a pandemic event not seen in the modern era.', ""These events, often causing tenants to miss their rents, didn't crumble Realty Income. That's something investors can hang their hat on for confidence in how management runs a business like that. Of course, no stock should ever be held forever without earning it, and Realty Income must continue earning that trust. For now, Realty Income has faced multiple challenges and delivered every time."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Realty Income wasn't one of them.

A great way to leave a lasting financial legacy is to own assets that steadily increase in value over the decades while sending a rising income stream to the holder. Investing in high-quality dividend stocks can be a great way to build generational wealth. ', 'Realty Income (NYSE: O), Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEPC)(NYSE: BEP), and Waste Management (NYSE: WM) have a long history of growing value for their shareholders. These businesses should last the test of time and continue growing in the future. That makes them great stocks to buy for those seeking to create lasting generational wealth.', 'Realty Income has been helping its investors build durable wealth for over five decades. The real estate investment trust (REIT) owns a growing commercial real estate portfolio that produces durable and steadily-rising rental income. It pays out three-quarters of that predictable income to shareholders through dividends each month (its payout currently yields more than 5%). It retains the rest to help fund new property investments. ', 'The REIT focuses on owning properties leased to tenants whose businesses can endure a recession and the pressure from e-commerce. It has a diversified portfolio of retail, industrial, gaming, and other properties secured by net leases. That lease structure makes the tenant responsible for variable costs like maintenance, real estate taxes, and building insurance. As a result, the REIT collects stable rental income that steadily rises as contractual rate escalators kick in each year (increasing rents at a fixed rate or one linked to inflation).', 'Realty Income backs its durable real estate portfolio with a fortress-like balance sheet. That gives it the financial flexibility to continue acquiring income-producing real estate. The REIT estimates that rent growth and new acquisitions will increase its adjusted funds from operations (FFO) per share by 4% to 5% per year. Add in its high-yielding and steadily rising dividend, and Realty Income could produce an average total return of around 10% annually in the years ahead. ', 'Brookfield Renewable has done a fantastic job growing value for its shareholders over the years. The global renewable energy giant has expanded its FFO per share at a more than 10% compound annual rate over the past decade. That has given it the power to increase its dividend (which yields more than 4%) at a 6% compound annual rate during that period. ', 'The company has a trio of organic growth drivers that should help power rising earnings and dividends in the years to come. Inflation-linked rate increases, margin expansion, and internally funded expansion projects should grow its FFO per share by 7% to 12% annually through at least 2028. That easily supports its plan to increase its dividend by 5% to 9% per year. ', 'On top of that, Brookfield sees acquisitions potentially adding more than 9% to its FFO per share each year. The company has a very sustainable acquisition strategy. It recycles capital by selling mature assets and reinvesting the proceeds into higher-return new investments. Add its earnings growth to its rising dividend, and Brookfield Renewable could be a powerful wealth creator in the coming years. ', 'Waste Management (WM) is a leader in providing collection, recycling, and disposal services in North America. It also has a growing renewable energy business as it turns landfill gas into renewable natural gas to generate electricity and fuel its hauling trucks.', ""The company's businesses generate durable cash flow. WM returns a big chunk of that money to shareholders by paying a growing dividend and repurchasing shares. It reinvests the rest into expanding its business, including making acquisitions and investing in organic projects to grow its recycling and renewable energy businesses. "", ""The company believes its resilient cash flows and shareholder-friendly capital allocation strategy will empower it to continue growing shareholder value at an above-average rate. Over the last decade, WM has delivered a more than 17% average annual total return. That enabled it to create a lot more wealth for shareholders than the average stock (the S&P 500's total return has averaged more than 12% annually over the last 10 years). "", ""Realty Income, Brookfield Renewable, and Waste Management generate stable and growing cash flows backed by very resilient business models. That gives them money to pay a growing dividend while investing in expanding their businesses. Those factors have enabled them to grow value for their shareholders over the years, which should continue in the future.

""Clearly the natural gas price outlook is not very favorable due to the very slow start of winter coming on in late 2023 into 2024 and due to the very high amount of natural gas being produced mainly because of the enormous amount of oil being produced in conjunction with the natural gas.', '""Luckily the exporting of our natural gas through LNG tankers to Europe and Asia will be the driver on keeping prices from falling much further as those countries desperately need our LNG ahead,"" he said. ""But until we see gas storage figures get to much lower levels or near the five-year averages, we will be stuck in the $2-$3 per thousand cubic feet range this year.""', 'Edwards said oil will be volatile because American shale producers have efficiently brought in more wells with higher production each year, including 2023.', '""Storm clouds are on the horizon for oil as the Saudis will be willing to cut only so far before flooding the markets as they have done in the past to teach everyone a lesson,"" he said. ""I hope that does not happen again, but it has only been three years since they last decimated the oil price and our West Texas economy by doing just that before the pandemic hit.', '""The war in Ukraine and the Middle East war between Hamas and Israel will continue to add tension, too. So the price of oil can, and probably will, swing wildly this year depending upon how these scenarios play out.""', 'Perryman said oil and gas prices will fluctuate throughout the year with geopolitical tensions, the actions of OPEC-Plus, weather events and other disturbances in the market.', '""With the ongoing situation in Russia and Ukraine, the Israel-Hamas conflict, the dispute between Venezuela and Guyana and now the threats in the Red Sea shipping corridor, the prospects for temporary disruptions in either direction are high,"" he said.', '""The recent disruptions in the Red Sea affect about 12 percent of global shipments and they could well affect supply chains including oil and LNG. The effects should be most strongly felt in Europe and Asia, but the U.S. is certainly not immune.""', 'But Perryman said a relatively stable global economy supporting demand should prevent prolonged and major spikes or dips.', '""We expect global growth in gross domestic product at about 2.7 percent this year with China rebounding modestly,"" he said. ""Even as we confront significant climate problems, the long-term demand for fuels indicates that an all-of-the-above response will be needed with renewable sources supplemented by conventional fuels for the foreseeable future.', '""Given the lower-carbon profile of Permian Basin oil, I think the region is well positioned for decades. Clearly it will be increasingly important that oil and natural gas are produced in environmentally responsible ways to the greatest extent possible. I think we can anticipate calls for additional reductions in flaring, for example, in the years to come.""', 'Perryman said the war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war demonstrate the importance of energy security.', '""It is crucial that the U.S. and its allies develop and maintain the capacity to produce needed fuels even as global conflicts arise,"" he said. ""This need encompasses not only U.S. markets but also the expansion of the LNG capacity in Europe to decrease dependence on Russia.', '""The presidential election will doubtless increase uncertainty, but the most extreme scenarios of the good or bad associated with a win by either candidate will almost certainly be overstated as they always are. I don\'t see an immediate shift for the industry regardless of who wins, though clearly there would be differences down the road.', '""In the near term everyone seems to realize that domestic energy production is essential. The data suggests that, as a practical matter and irrespective of the rhetoric, the pattern will persist for decades.""']"

So today, we saw Brent Crude oil go higher. We also saw WTI go as high as 4% during the session after the US had announced that the US with its allies had done strikes on some sites, some Yemeni sites that are controlled by Houthi rebels in retaliation for Houthi rebels having attacked vessels in the Red Sea area. Of course, we've been hearing about this tension in the Red Sea for weeks now. And we have seen oil on a daily basis, it can go up 2% or 3%.

But Brent had gone up north of $80 per barrel during the session today. WTI had gone up above $75 per barrel. In fact, I'm going to pull up a two-month chart here, so you can see the tight range that we've been trading in throughout January as these escalations have taken place."", ""What's different now is that there was a shipping advisory that-- advisor that had noted that ships or cargo ships, vessels have now been advised to stay away from this area. We have seen shipping giants that voluntarily have stayed away or they are rerouting along the Cape of Africa. But today, we saw a giant oil tanker firm that said that they would be avoiding the area and they own about 80 vessels that carry refined products, refined energy products from the refineries to the customers. So tankers are definitely staying clear of the area now and that's creating concerns in the markets."", ""But the real concern is, when you talk to analysts is, is that this could escalate into something greater, into something greater between the US and Iran and interrupt Iran's oil supply because Iran produces almost 3 million barrels of oil per day. One analyst telling me if you took that off the market, you could see oil shooting up by about $30 per barrel. So right now we are seeing also freight costs that are going higher, of course, because this trip that they have to now take along the Cape of Africa takes about 7 to 14 days longer, guys."", 'JOSH LIPTON: Ines, a big important story.

Clearly it will be increasingly important that oil and natural gas are produced in environmentally responsible ways to the greatest extent possible.

""This need encompasses not only U.S. markets but also the expansion of the LNG capacity in Europe to decrease dependence on Russia.', '""The presidential election will doubtless increase uncertainty, but the most extreme scenarios of the good or bad associated with a win by either candidate will almost certainly be overstated as they always are.

We have seen shipping giants that voluntarily have stayed away or they are rerouting along the Cape of Africa.

So tankers are definitely staying clear of the area now and that's creating concerns in the markets."", ""But the real concern is, when you talk to analysts is, is that this could escalate into something greater, into something greater between the US and Iran and interrupt Iran's oil supply because Iran produces almost 3 million barrels of oil per day. One analyst telling me if you took that off the market, you could see oil shooting up by about $30 per barrel.

So that’s just kind of, I guess, the nature of how we kind of evolved, as one company.”', 'Friday’s leadership shake-up also comes after an apparent miscommunication in the C-suite, with Fortune reporting on a memo from Slack CTO Henderson’s chief of staff that a strict hiring freeze has been implemented.

These investments are not risk free, but they are stores of value that have the potential to enhance diversification and staying power in any market reversal. Moreover, we have marginally reduced portfolio concentration over the course of the year. Essentially, 2022 was a moment of extremely low reinvestment risk that allowed us to deemphasize China and other holdings, while concentrating around a handful of financially and strategically sound investments such as Nvidia, MercadoLibre, Airbnb and CrowdStrike.With these investments having largely reflated, we have sought to redistribute some of this capital while retaining significant residual positions.

However, the recent stock price rally was due to growing excitement around the company’s AI exposure. It will launch its new MI300 graphics processing unit (GPU) chip later this year to compete against the dominant market leader NVIDIA. Similar to its approach that won market share from Intel within the CPU market, AMD’s product will aim to provide similar performance at a more attractive price. AMD is already working with Microsoft and Meta, while Amazon publicly stated that it is evaluating AMD’s inferencing chips. Using assumptions around the total GPU market size, potential market share gains and price points, our research indicates this could be a $20 billion opportunity for AMD.

To skip our detailed analysis of the energy sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Hot Oil Stocks To Buy Now.', ""The energy market is one that can appear to be heavily fluctuating based on demand and supply dynamics in the market. However, energy stocks are typically considered to have high potential during periods of economic growth, so they can be potentially good investments as long as they are approached carefully. According to Fidelity Investments' 2024 Outlook for the energy sector, investors can expect limited supply, healthy demand, and rising investments in energy production to positively contribute to the sector. Oil prices are expected to remain high during 2024, propelling hot oil and energy stocks to more elevated heights this year. This would be in stark contrast to the sector's slow performance during 2023."", 'On January 4, Jeff Currie, Goldman Sachs Partner Alumnus, and Advisory Board Chair at the University of Chicago\'s Energy Policy Institute, joined CNBC\'s ""Squawk Box"" to give his take on the energy sector and oil markets entering into 2024. Here\'s what he had to say:', '""It is the most investable space out there in the economy right now. The return on capital employed exceeds 20% in many parts of the world.""', 'Like Currie, many other financial analysts today are persisting with their positive outlook for the energy and oil markets in 2024. However, global geopolitical tensions are resulting in some concern. For instance, indiscriminate attacks in the Red Sea against commercial vessels are leading to widespread concern over the impact of such attacks on the energy sector. However, according to US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, the impact of such attacks on the energy sector is considerably low at this point. Granholm joined CNBC\'s ""Squawk Box"" on January 5 to discuss this issue. Here\'s what she said:', '""With respect to how we\'re seeing it play out in the energy space is that, so far, the ongoing conflict and attacks, which are indiscriminate, they\'re really not on any commercial vessel that\'s coming through, whether it\'s touching or related to Israel or not, but this conflict, they have not really been successful in getting their targets. This conflict has really only had a limited impact on energy prices. For us, in the US, gas prices, for example, are at $3.09, today. More than $1.93 lower than the peak after Putin\'s war.""', 'Considering the above, many investors may benefit from beginning to look at oil and energy stocks as compelling investments heading into the new year. There seem to be many attractive options in the industry today, such as hot oil stocks with high demand, like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Kinder Morgan, Inc. (NYSE:KMI), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX). Apart from these oil companies though, there are many other options available to energy investors this year as well. On December 6, Rob Thummel, Tortoise Senior Portfolio Manager, joined CNBC\'s ""Closing Bell Overtime"" to discuss energy investment options for investors in 2024. Here\'s what he had to say:', '""If oil\'s lower for longer, that means demand\'s probably going to go up. You\'re gonna transport more energy. And so, energy infrastructure is a great place to be in the energy asset class, if you\'re looking for an energy play. Also with a lot of these energy infrastructure stocks, you get really high dividend yields. So as we look at 2024, interest rates are probably coming down, the 10-year is probably coming down, so if investors are looking for \'where can I get exposure to the equity market, but also significant cash income?\' energy infrastructure is a great place to be.""', ""Generally speaking, energy as a whole can thus be said to be a highly attractive investment space for investors this year. Whether you pick one of the hot oil stocks we've named below or energy infrastructure names for dividends, you're bound to be in good hands. The stocks we have listed below are among the top hot oil stocks to buy now, and they include some undervalued oil stocks as well."", 'An oil rig surrounded by the expanse of sea, the pumping operations in progress.', 'Our Methodology', ""To select the stocks for our list, we used a stock screener to identify oil stocks with an average three-month volume of over five million as of January 9.

According to the agency’s Short-Term Energy Outlook (“STEO”), the forecast predicts a substantial increase of 290,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2024, propelling production to 13.21 million bpd.This upward trajectory continues into 2025, with an estimated record-breaking output of 13.44 million bpd. The primary driver behind this growth is the enhanced efficiency of well operations, reinforcing the nation's standing as a dominant force in the global oil market.APA Corporation APA, Diamondback Energy FANG and Marathon Oil MRO are some of the crude finding firms that could stand to benefit from this production boom."", ""Despite the positive outlook, concerns loom on the global stage regarding rising oil supplies. Industry watchers believe that an uptick in oil output by OPEC members has contributed to uncertainties in the market. While leader Saudi Arabia saw its output shrink, as mandated by the production cut agreement, there was more oil coming from Iraq and Africa. Saudi Arabia's strategic move to lower the official selling price of Arab Light crude to Asia is seen as a response to the confluence of increased supply and weakened demand for lighter crudes, prompting investors to approach the market with caution."", ""The EIA's projection includes a predicted slowdown in global liquid fuels production growth in 2024, attributing it to OPEC's deliberate supply restraint. However, a rebound is anticipated in 2025, with a substantial projected increase of 1.6 million bpd. This delicate interplay between production and demand continues to shape the complex landscape of the global energy market."", ""Against this backdrop, the United States maintains its pivotal role in the global energy arena. The nation's resilience in oil production, amid a landscape of uncertainties, positions it as a significant contributor to fulfilling international energy needs. With the forecast surge in U.S. petroleum and liquid fuels consumption suggesting 20.4 million bpd in 2024, the nation stands poised to play a vital role in supporting the ever-growing global energy demands."", ""However, challenges persist on the path to U.S. oil independence. Despite achieving record oil production levels, becoming a net exporter remains a multifaceted challenge. Limitations in energy infrastructure, particularly the absence of crucial crude oil pipelines connecting major oilfields to east coast refineries, present substantial obstacles. Additionally, the emphasis on heavy crude oil grades, not within the U.S. shale sector's production portfolio, adds complexity to the pursuit of complete energy independence."", 'Looking ahead, as U.S. crude production gears up for unprecedented heights, the global oil market braces for potential impacts on prices. The EIA forecasts Brent crude prices to average $82 per barrel in 2024, with a marginal dip to $79 in 2025. While the United States secures its role as a leading oil producer, the intricate balance between production, global demand, and geopolitical factors will undoubtedly mold the future trajectory of oil markets.', ""With U.S. crude production setting new records, investors interested in the Oil/Energy space might hold on to some fundamentally strong upstream-focused stocks like APA Corporation, Diamondback Energy and Marathon Oil.

Investors earned significant gains in leading AI names like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Amazon. Those companies are generating most of their AI-related revenue from the data center and the cloud, which is where businesses are developing, training, and deploying their latest AI applications.', 'However, not all AI-related stocks caught the attention of investors early on. There was one cloud company that joined the AI party late in 2023, which means its stock could be set up for outsized gains this year. That company is DigitalOcean (NYSE: DOCN). Its shares are trading 71% below their all-time high, which was set during the tech frenzy of 2021, when investors assigned the stock an ambitious valuation.', ""Below, I'll explain the significance of DigitalOcean's entry into AI, and why now might be an opportune time for investors to buy the stock."", 'Cloud services can involve anything from simple data storage to website hosting to video-streaming technology. AI represents a new chapter in which cloud providers fill their data centers with advanced chips from the likes of Nvidia in order for their business customers to have the computing power to process mountains of data used to develop large language models -- the building blocks of an AI application.', ""DigitalOcean specializes in providing cloud services to small and mid-size businesses (SMBs), ranging from the start-up phase to those with 500 employees. Its product suite is relatively narrow for that reason, and the company is worth just $3.1 billion. It's a tiny player competing with giants like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud, which are backed by their trillion-dollar parent companies."", ""But DigitalOcean has an edge over these other tech giants because it tailored its entire offering to suit the needs of SMBs. Its pricing is cheap and transparent, its service is highly personalized, and it offers a digital library filled with educational materials to help customers maximize their cloud experience. The cloud leaders are focused on serving large organizations at scale, so it isn't economical for them to be so attentive to the needs of businesses at the smaller end of the spending scale."", ""Developing AI adds a whole new layer of complexity and cost. One Nvidia H100 GPU chip can cost $40,000, and many developers scale up to 20,000 of them! Therefore, most businesses can't build their own infrastructure, which is why they rely on centralized data centers managed by cloud providers."", ""Bringing that computing power to small businesses can help them unlock tremendous value through AI, and that's what DigitalOcean hopes to achieve with its $111 million acquisition of Paperspace last July."", ""DigitalOcean recently conducted a survey that found that 43% of developers and SMBs currently use AI and machine learning. Furthermore, it found that 78% of them plan to increase their use of those tools this year. Research by Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management estimates advancements in hardware and software will reduce the cost of training AI models by 70% per year between now and 2030, which could accelerate adoption."", ""Ark's projections suggest businesses will invest up to $41 trillion in AI by 2030 to boost their productivity, which could add a whopping $200 trillion to the global economy. That's an opportunity unlike anything cloud providers have seen before."", ""Paperspace has over 500,000 customers. It offers them a range of different GPUs designed to handle AI workloads, including Nvidia's industry-leading H100. Paperspace says its prices can be up to 70% cheaper than cloud leaders like Microsoft Azure because it offers per-second billing and no lock-in commitments, which ensures no expenditure is wasted. Plus, Paperspace is a specialist provider, so it doesn't have a bloated cost structure like its larger competitors, allowing it to pass on lower prices to customers."", ""DigitalOcean has a unique strategy. It acquires customers at the start-up phase and supports them with low prices, in the hope they scale their operations and eventually become a significant source of revenue. That's why the Paperspace deal is such a good fit -- it follows a similar philosophy."", 'DigitalOcean will report its official financial results for 2023 in February. Wall Street expects its revenue will come in at $690 million, representing an increase of almost 20% compared to the prior year. That would actually mark a deceleration from the 34% growth rate it delivered in 2022.', ""Weaker economic conditions are one reason. Many of DigitalOcean's customers in the start-up space are funded by investors, and it has been harder to raise fresh money over the past two years. With that said, macroeconomic headwinds like high inflation and rising interest rates are subsiding, which bodes well for the company going forward."", ""The other reason is DigitalOcean's focus on profitability. The company only grew its operating expenses by 9% year over year through the first three quarters of 2023, which resulted in net income (profit) of $3.4 million. It was a positive swing from the $17.4 million net loss it delivered in the year-ago period."", ""In short, DigitalOcean has found a path to profitability while at the same time it's on the cusp of a potential acceleration in growth thanks to AI. The Paperspace integration is still underway and it could take a few quarters before investors see results. However, DigitalOcean stock is trading near its cheapest price-to-sales multiple since it came public in 2021, so now might be a great time to buy."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in DigitalOcean right now?', 'Before you buy stock in DigitalOcean, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and DigitalOcean wasn't one of them.

How about you?', ""Deidre Woollard: Doing well. I'm in my feelings a little bit because it's CES week. This used to be the week I used to work for a sister blog to Engadget, when Engadget was the thing and this was the week. It feels a little more lively now that you've in the last few years, but do you think is CES back? Has AI made CES relevant again?"", 'Jason Moser: Well, I mean, definitely it feels like it\'s back from the last several years. It\'s just not really been front and center. I mean, there obviously been a lot going on over the last few years. But I think, also mean there hasn\'t been a ton in the tech world that has just been keeping us on the edge of our seats. ""Sorry, metaverse, it\'s not me, it\'s you. You just aren\'t quite as special maybe as we were hoping you would be. At least not yet. Now maybe we\'ll find some better use case for you down the road."" But I think AI has taken over that role as being that narrative, that headline, that one thing that everybody\'s really focused on.', ""That's neat, because the thing about AI is, because we're in such early stages with it, we're really just starting to learn about the implications, the ways that it can impact our lives. I think a lot of what AI is going to do is probably not going to be stuff that's front and center, and in our face, but it's going to be the stuff that's helping behind the scenes to make our lives better and easier and whatnot. But I certainly feels like CES is a little bit more back than it has been recently."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, thinking about AI and everybody trying to put AI in everything, Volkswagen announced that it's putting ChatGPT in cars. This is interesting because, I mean, right now I don't really want ChatGPT in my car, but it's a down the road thing. They talked about how they want it to be this ongoing conversation that you might be having with AI in your car. Who knows where this will go. It might start with directions. It might lead to things like breaking news updates or things like that or where should I go for lunch? I don't know. Do you want ChatGPT in your car?"", ""Jason Moser: It's really funny. I mean, I wonder what are people doing when they're driving that insists on having all of this stuff at your fingertips? I mean, I'm focused on the road, making sure I'm getting to where I want to go, and I either have a podcast or some music going, and that's usually about it. I mean, cars have done a really good job incorporating a lot of technology into them. I mean, we've said for a while, now they're really just becoming computers on wheels. That's no more true than today, I think."", ""But it clearly, as we move into this Internet of Things and everything becomes more connected, I mean, it's obvious real estate for these technology companies. I mean, finding the solutions that make the most sense for consumers. Entertainment, navigation, those are two really obvious opportunities. You see big chip makers that continue to make investments in the space. I mean, you get AE&D, Qualcomm, NVIDIA, and more continuing to really get their technology in these cars. You got smaller companies like Cerence, for example, which used to be a part of Nuance, then they split off from Nuance, Microsoft acquired Nuance. Cerence is on its own now, and Cerence is bringing their voice technology into the car. Again, focused on that intuitive AI assistant ChatGPT like, but again, focus really on entertainment, navigation, things like that. I think it's something that probably will develop a little bit more slowly than people might anticipate, but the first step really is getting the technology into the cars, and then learning where it can be most useful. I think we're in the middle of really discovering that, which is exciting."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, you mentioned the metaverse earlier. You made a little face. You can't see it through the hearing, but this is there. It was a face."", 'Jason Moser: I was having fun.', ""Deidre Woollard: We've got Division PRO coming out, and now we've got some dates here. January 19th, you can pre-order it. It's going to be released on the 2nd. We'll see if people are lining up outside the stores. Is this going to be big? Are you going to be lining up? What do you think?"", ""Jason Moser: Well, so I definitely, personally will not be lining up. I think we will absolutely see plenty of Apple fanatics creating a lot of buzz about it. I think that's exciting. I mean, this is really Apple's first step in this spatial computing paradigm, really, at least the first meaningful step, and it's very easy to get excited about it because it's Apple. Usually when Apple does something, they're going into it with plenty of research to really justify the opportunity. I mean, I don't think they would have gone into this willy willy. I mean, this is something they've probably seen a lot of the competition around them. I made a little joke about the metaverse earlier, and that really is something where I'm sure the metaverse is going to come up with more and more applications for consumers as time goes on. Again, something that probably just develops a little bit more slowly. But to that point, I think that is one of the important points to note with Apple and the Vision Pro. This is really just their first step. I think what this leads to is more discovery on their part into how they can improve this technology, but even more so what this technology ultimately can do."", 'I think that\'s what Apple and Meta and all of these headset companies are really trying to figure out, ""We\'ve got this technology out now, now what can it do?"" It has to be that way. I mean, you need to get the technology out there and start experimenting with it and trying it out in different areas in order to get an idea of really where it\'s most useful, and where it can be most helpful. That just is going to take some time to develop. I mean, I don\'t know that that\'s something we should expect something in the next couple of years where all of a sudden now the metaphors is just mainstream, because of this killer app that\'s been discovered. I mean, I think they\'re going to discover some ""Killer apps."" But I think it\'s something that\'s going to take some time. I think this is something where we\'re going to see Apple using this high end device to then help them build more compelling lower end devices that ultimately will be able to reach out to the consumer. I mean, I do continue to believe that the biggest hurdle for these headsets is the form factor. Just anybody\'s warm with these headsets. It\'s just not just the Vision Pro, it\'s any of them. I mean, these headsets are just cumbersome and heavy and uncomfortable, and you don\'t want to wear them for very long. But this is the step in getting to where they ultimately need to go, where they can go. That will take some time. I think that once they can really crack the code on that form factor, I think that\'ll open a lot of things up. But it\'s neat to see them making progress in the space, for sure.', ""Deidre Woollard: Well, it starts with a device and it ends with an ecosystem. We're just at that point and thinking about where the iPhone was when it launched. I wonder if this time Apple is going to have a little bit of a different strategy in terms of how quickly it lets other people play in its playground. it's a different Apple since when the iPhone first launched. Do you think that there are some companies that might benefit from this in the VR space or will there be some more that emerge?"", 'Jason Moser: Well, definitely. I think one of the things we talked about with his Vision Pro is, this is this initial iteration is going to be something I think more for professionals and developers in order to figure out those applications and those ""Killer app,"" so to speak. It\'s nice to see that Apple has allowed for that partnership ecosystem to begin. I mean, it\'s not something where they\'re just going it all alone. I mean, they\'ve got companies, like Adobe, for example, working with Apple to create experiences and exploit this technology for his best use case scenarios.', 'Jason Moser: I mean, Adobe stands out is one that certainly could benefit down the road, but I think there are going to be plenty of companies that ultimately Apple will saddle up with in order to try to make this the most useful, productive, and enjoyable experience as possible.', ""Deidre Woollard: With CES, we're not there walking the floor, but I've been watching the press releases come out. Some of it, I don't need an AI Cat door, but some of the things that I find her interesting is the transparent screens, so LG, it's a transparent LED screen, Samsung showed off this transparent micro LED screen, it's really beautiful. We don't have any details on pricing yet, but I wonder like, do we want these transparent screens? Is this one of those things do you think is a Gimmick or the future of something really beautiful?"", ""Jason Moser: Yeah, I don't know that's a really good one because I looked at these examples and the technology and you're right on the one hand, it's amazing technology, it produces these crisp images, just beautiful screens and it's almost like it's just a hologram. Which is neat, I mean, that really is a little bit of a look into ultimately what the future could look like, then the flip side is to that, what is the core use case for these? Is it just another model of a TV? Is it just something, I mean, are we looking to put this in our living room or is there another use case that could go with it? I mean, I think there are plenty of use cases where it could apply and maybe the use cases for technology like this are a bit more apparent in the enterprise side of things. I don't know, I think that that's something we'll have to wait and see, I mean, I think cost is going to be something that matters, like you said, there's not a lot of information in regard to cost there. But I think one thing I did find in regard to Samsung, these non transparent micro LED TVs that they have are running $150,000 for a 110 inch model and so it's not cheap. I mean, look at that Vision Pro and we talk about how cost prohibitive that could be, clearly this screen technology is going to be somewhat cost prohibitive for consumers, at least in the near term, but it's definitely a window into what could be. I guess the question is, is this the new form factor or is this the next 3D television? That I think is the question we just don't have an answer to yet, and for those not keeping score, the 3D television that turned out to be kind of a flop."", ""Deidre Woollard: 3D is one of my favorite things because it comes up every 20 years or so, we get all excited about it and then it goes away again, it's like movies, it's just something keeps coming up and keeps going away."", ""Jason Moser: Well, I mean that's similar to these headsets too, I mean, these headsets are bringing that more immersive technology and on the one hand it's amazing technology, but on the other hand, is it what people really want? I just don't know. I mean, obviously 3D television was not something that people want. These headsets have done well to the extent that they've sold a number of them, but an ongoing story is that they ultimately just turn into dust collectors, people get them, they use them for a few weeks. They don't really find them to be all that tremendously useful and so then they just sit in the corner and collect dust because we really haven't discovered the core use case for why we need them yet as opposed to maybe wanting them. Gaming always stands out as the core use case for a lot of this technology and so I could see technology like this making some waves in the gaming space for hardcore gamers looking for that, the best experience possible, that doesn't really extend itself to the mass consumer and so again, that's where Tom will tell."", ""Deidre Woollard: Star of the show so far in video, it's different because there's not like a TV you can look at, but they did come out with a whole bunch of announcements in video, tends to do this where they just blitz you with a bunch of press releases. But I think the thing that I thought was most interesting is the shot across the bow at AMD with newer cheaper GPUs and so I feel like this is an interesting battle, I don't know as much about it as probably I'd like to more than I do. But how should we be thinking about the competition here with Nvidia saying like we can make beautiful technologies just as cheaply as you do."", ""Jason Moser: Well, yeah, it sounds like what Nvidia is ultimately trying to do here, at least with this chip sweep that they've rolled out and a lot of it centers around AI, but it's ultimately trying to make that leap from AI going from behind the scenes and helping us in ways that we can't really see and helping businesses in ways we can't really see to bringing it front and center, going from server to local. We see Microsoft trying to do the same thing, bringing that Co-pilots key to the actual keyboard of a laptop in this case you've got Nvidia trying to bring this AI technology to the consumer in the laptop or the desktop form and making it more accessible for us as consumers. I think that really is exciting because with all of the talk about AI and we see the potential, I think it's a lot easier to see the potential and how it can help at the enterprise level because those are big, often inefficient organizations that could benefit from streamlining and doing things more efficiently. But that doesn't really, that's not so sexy for the consumer, the consumer is asking, well what about me? How does AI help me? This is a step in that direction, bringing AI more front and center directly in front of the consumer and so, being on PC, being on desktop, I mean, ultimately being on mobile, I mean, that's what these companies are ultimately looking to do. Yeah, I think it's exciting times, we're going to see, I think plenty develop here at CES and it's going to set the table I think for some exciting shows here in the future as well."", ""Deidre Woollard: Yeah, I totally agree. Well, I'm going to pull us away from CES for a second 'cause there's a little bit of news I wanted to hit, wanted your take on, you recently called out Jeff Lawson of Twilio as CEO on the hot seat. Well, the hot seat got really hot [laughs] because he's moving on, he's a co founder, he's leaving the board as well, you've got someone who's been at the company for a long time taking the reins. We know the activists aren't going to be happy about that, but how are you thinking about that move?"", ""Jason Moser: Well, to me it feels like it was something that was more or less inevitable, I mean, you're right the 2023 Motley Fool Money preview show, one of the questions like for the show was who's a CEO on the hot seat? I said Jeff Lawson to me was a CEO on the hot seat because he's in this position with Twilio where Twilio is a good business. It has developed this tremendous suite of offerings. But now it really got to the point where they need to focus on making some actual money and focusing on the core competencies of the business and it just felt to me along the way that Lawson is more of an entrepreneur and maybe the company had hit that stage where he needed to step aside and let an operator come in to maybe help take this business to the next level. We see it often I mean we see plenty of businesses from small getting established companies like Marqeta to larger companies with longer track records of success like Chipotle. I think in this case it probably makes the most sense, I mean, there's clearly some activism in there that might have prompted this or at least hastened it and it's not to say that Lawson won't have any say so in the matter, at least for now, I mean, he does still own a good portion of the company. It does have that dual share class structure, so we'll see how that ownership interest shakes out here over the coming quarters and years. But I think ultimately this is probably a good thing for the company is it's going to give them a chance really, to take that next step and become mainstream, established, profitable, and really become the type of business that investors in Wall Street are ultimately looking for."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, we'll have to wait and see, thanks for touring it yes with me today, Jason."", 'Jason Moser: Thank you.', ""Deidre Woollard: We talk about a lot of stocks on the show, but it's just a peek at the Motley Fools investing universe. This year we're rolling out a new offering. It's called Epic Bundle, the service includes seven stock recommendations every month, model portfolios and stock bankings, all based on your investor type.

For more information, head to www.fool.com/epic198, we'll also include a link in the show notes for you. We're staying on the tech theme, Ricky Mulvey caught up with Kevin Seimser, the Chief Operating Officer of Trend Micro, to talk about cybersecurity in the Cloud and the new threats facing electric cars."", ""Ricky Mulvey: I know the company, you have more than 3,000 engineers basically protecting enterprises and people against cyber threats, it's been around for more than three decades, it's less discussed, I would say, in the full universe. I'd say less discussed in general, in part because your company spends a little bit less on marketing than some of your competitors, your company has a big focus on Cloud security. You've been in that space for a while, big focus on endpoint security or the connection between, let's say, the device you're using right now and those big Cloud servers that are storing everything to the lay person. Can you go through what's the offer for customers from Trend Micro, especially as those Cloud providers, including Microsoft, have their own security options."", ""Kevin Seimser: Thanks Ricky, for the set up and perhaps we should be more well known because it really is an American success story, can you believe that it was founded, that we were founded over three decades ago in Los Angeles, California. Started as a start up in a garage, went on to become a multibillion dollar cybersecurity giant doing business across the globe and one of the things I'm really proud of in terms of the trend micro performance is actually our business is much more global than what many people think. Around 25% of our business comes from the Americas, 25% from Europe, 25% from the Middle East and Africa, Southeast Asia, and then 25% from Japan, where we're formerly headquartered. Much more resilient and global than many of the other cybersecurity providers, we have evolved substantially by building out a cybersecurity unified platform that we offer, we do in all things up to and including Cloud security like you pointed out, Cloud security is big globally."", ""Kevin Seimser: But in particular in the US where many people are adopting Cloud and we're there to protect them. IDC actually have us as the number one Cloud security company in the world."", ""Ricky Mulvey: What are the kinds of Cloud security threats that you're defending against? What do those look like compared to maybe ones that enterprise has experienced in the past?"", ""Kevin Seimser: It's interesting. In an enterprise, we all got pretty comfortable with an environment where we built these walls around our enterprises. Gradually those walls ended up with more and more holes through the walls because we needed to connect our supply chains and everything else up. In the Cloud world, in particular, our largest Cloud service provider, which is AWS, they've adopted something called a shared security responsibility model, where AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure but customers that adopt AWS need to think about the application itself, and that's where we come in. It takes both AWS and ourselves in order to keep the adversaries out. Adversaries are sitting there watching, looking, learning, and trying to work their way into those critical applications now that are running in the Cloud. It's a big deal for many of our customers."", ""Ricky Mulvey: One place I know you've been working on as well in a podcast last year you said it was an area of focus is electric vehicles. Can you talk about your work in this space and what electric vehicle companies customers would need to be mindful of in terms of cyber threats?"", ""Kevin Seimser: Actually the New York Times coin to cybersecurity giant. As a cybersecurity giant, you end up having your hands in lots of different things. We have our core business, like we talked about earlier, protecting everything from endpoints to email, Cloud network, OOT environments. That's our core business but because we're threat practitioners, we're cybersecurity practitioners we also have a view of what else is going on in the industry. A couple of things that really intrigued us, one was around all things, 5G, so security around 5G. Another one that interested us in a big way was security around the entire EV ecosystem. Not just the cars, but the charging stations and whatnot. What we did to address that is we actually spun off wholly owned subsidiary companies. We own them, but we felt like actually the go to market was going to be substantially different, some of the technology, the partners that we would need. Relative to EV, we created a subsidiary called Vic One, Vehicle One and that subsidiary is doing some really cool things. Working with automotive manufacturers, working with charging manufacturers in order to build out a set of security capabilities that can be incorporated directly into their platforms. We're taking the burden of protecting EV cars and protecting EV charging stations from adversaries, from denial of service attacks or whatever it happens to be. We build an offering and we make that available to the automotive industry. That's an exciting space for us. Gosh, we've got 100 people working on that now so it's a substantial investment that we have going into that. We all know that EV cars are the future and we're going to be there to stop the bad guys."", ""Ricky Mulvey: It's denial of service attack, basically, you can see that when a website just goes down, shuts down. It seems like that would be a different issue or it would be a terrible issue for a car and something to be expected. When you're talking to your team at Vic One with these kinds of threats, I imagine they're facing a ton. You have the denial of service attack. You also have these car manufacturers which I have personal opinion on, but they're doing a lot of subscription is a service offering. So BMW got famous or became a little infamous for charging people for heated seats. Then you have a lot of hackers trying to essentially jail break features within their car. I can't imagine that there's a lot of other issues that they're defending against. What do you think is issue number one for the Vic One team about questions for cybersecurity for the charging infrastructure and the cars. Is it a lot different from what you are traditionally doing?"", ""Kevin Seimser: Well, one of the things that people need to think about, and we had to think a lot about is all of those threats. We thought about it ourselves but we also are the owners and sponsors of something called pune to own. In Japan, early next year, we will be hosting the very first pune to own conference where we will be soliciting researchers. We have around 3,000 independent researchers around the globe whose job it is is to we pay them to find vulnerabilities in areas that we find could be interesting from a threat adversary standpoint. In this case we're paying them to look at the overall EV, automotive ecosystem. They'll be finding vulnerabilities and writing exploits in order to try. That gives us a lot of insight as to what the threat actors are going to be up to. That's actually quite helpful in terms of providing that level of insight. For us, we can incorporate all that technology into our offering and make that available to the automotive manufacturers. We see it as a really tight grouping of smart people coming together in order to try and keep the threat actors at bay. The number one thing that people should be aware of is with an EV car is the over the air software updates. That notion of updating software over the air, receiving updates over the air, it creates an inroad into the car and that's one of the number one areas that could potentially be exploited. You could imagine, if a software update were ever hijacked and modified and it could do catastrophic things so trying to make sure that that doesn't happen is what we're fiercely focused on."", 'Ricky Mulvey: As we wrap up, we can focus back in on the company of trend micro does it had fairly good quarter that the market seems to be celebrating anything is going on with the business that you would want investors listening to Motley Fool Money to be aware of.', ""Kevin Seimser: I think there is Ricky. We publicly announced in January of 2020, business transformation. We were going to move toward this consolidated platform and we were going to start investing heavily in it. What we saw over the last few years is we saw the success of that platform start to build and grow. We're now up to 9,000 plus customers running on it, $750,000,000 plus in annual recurring revenue. We're seeing phenomenal growth happen in it. It culminated in our Q3 results like you pointed out. Our Q3 results were very strong, up 13% year over year. We surprised on the positive side, up 13% year over year on the top line, up 58% on the bottom line, 30% increase in cash flow. Truly our investors celebrated the performance. What we did was we took that and we wrapped it in, well, we're sitting on $2.5 billion in cash. What could we do to reward shareholders even more? We introduced a special dividend and a large cash share buyback. We were really thinking that let's reward shareholders for some of our positive performance here. As we go into 2024 and 2027, we see the business scaling even more, we see the top-line growth continuing, and we see even more bottom line performance. We actually made the declaration that 100% of our net income we will be giving back to shareholders for the foreseeable future. We're really feeling like we're financially sound. The ideology of our chairman, I'll leave you with this of our chairman. He's the founder and chairman of the company and he really pushes sustainable, superior performance. We've been around for over three decades, we want to be around for another three decades. You need to build a sustainable, superior-performing business in order to do that."", ""Deidre Woollard: As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about, and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear.

The NLRB, in the case of seven pro-union baristas Starbucks fired in 2022 —\xa0dubbed the Memphis Seven —\xa0used a two-factor test. Starbucks argues a four-factor test\xa0should’ve been used.', 'Were the Supreme Court to institute a more stringent Section 10-(j)\xa0test as a result, the NLRB would have greater difficulty seeking injunctions against unfair labor practices, including in cases when workers were fired for organizing.', 'Four circuit courts use Starbucks’ preferred test, according to the company’s petition for a writ of cetiorari, while five use the test with a lower threshold. Starbucks argues the test is “outcome-determinative,”\xa0meaning there are significant differences between the tests. Namely, Starbucks claims the four-factor test limits Section 10-(j) injunctions to “an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.”', 'The company argued the standard used by lower courts, including the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, meant the NLRB needed to show that there was “‘reasonable cause to believe that an unfair labor practice has occurred” for an injunction to be the appropriate remedy. The lower courts found there was reasonable cause to believe Starbucks dismissed the Memphis Seven\xa0for organizing.', 'The NLRB, in its response to Starbucks’ petition\xa0seeking a writ of cert, noted that Starbucks in its initial appeal “did not contest the district court’s reasonable cause finding.”', 'The NLRB also argued that differences between the two standards at issue “are essentially terminological rather than substantive,” because the “reasonable cause”\xa0process is similar to the “likelihood of success”\xa0standard for which Starbucks is asking, and the test to determine whether injunctive relief is “just and proper” encompasses the other elements of the four-factor test.', 'The NLRB’s response also argued that Starbucks misstated the stringency of the two-factor test, the frequency with which the NLRB has recourse to Section 10-(j) injunctions and the overall frequency of litigation arising from alleged unfair labor practices.', 'By granting the writ of certiorari, the Supreme Court is indicating that there is a substantial enough difference between the two tests to merit argument before the highest court in the United States.', 'Starbucks Workers United, in a statement emailed to Restaurant Dive, said the company was seeking “a bailout for its illegal union busting” from the Supreme Court. “There’s no doubt that Starbucks broke federal law by firing workers in Memphis for joining together in a union” the union said.\xa0“The district court determined that, and the decision was affirmed by one of the most conservative [circuit] courts in the nation.” SBWU said the case represented an escalation and that Starbucks was waging legal warfare against all workers in the United States.', 'In an email to Restaurant Dive, Starbucks said it was happy the court decided to take up the case and framed it as a way to “reconcile an inconsistency in how NLRB 10(j) injunction requests are evaluated.” The company said the Supreme Court case was separate and distinct from its stated goal of reaching a contract with Starbucks Workers United by 2025.', 'This story was originally published on Restaurant Dive.

So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even slightly below the current price of US$59.05. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable.

Following her 2023 Oscar win for Best Actress in a Leading Role for “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” the veteran actress’ latest project is a Netflix TV series with plenty of action.', '“The Brothers Sun,” which premiered on Netflix on Jan. 4, tells the story of the head of a Taiwanese triad who is shot by an assassin, leading his eldest son, Charles, to go to Los Angeles to protect his mother, played by Yeoh, and younger brother, played by Sam Li. While the series offers action and fight scenes in every episode, it also has no shortage of fashion and style moments.', 'More from WWD', 'A Closer Look at Oscar-nominated ‘Everything Everywhere All at Once’\xa0Costumes', 'EXCLUSIVE: ‘Barbie,’ ‘Saltburn’ and ‘The Crown’ Among Costume Designers Guild Nominations\xa02024', ""Crowns and Gowns: Bonhams Auctions Costumes From 'The Crown'"", 'The person behind costuming the dark comedy action series is Vera Chow, who is known for her work on “Big Fan,” “Marco Polo” and the final two seasons of “The Walking Dead.”', 'One of Chow’s goals when costuming the show was to make sure it defied Asian stereotypes.', '“When I first got the script, I thought about how every time I see a Yakuza type film there’s this through line where they all dress the same,” Chow said. “I purposefully did not do any research into Western interpretations of Asian gangster films. I grew up in Asia, so it gave me a different understanding of how to approach this. I specifically researched movies from Taiwan, Hong Kong and China. Among Asian gangsters, there are differences in how they dress based on rank and nuances as to how they dressed based on what faction they belong to. Even the jewelry, where gangsters can tell you what faction they are from or what religion they belong to.”', 'The character Charles, played by Justin Chien, one of the leading male roles in the show, required much specificity in his wardrobe. As the son of a triad boss, he needed an elevated look that indicated a level of wealth and privilege. But given the numerous amount of action and fight scenes Charles has, the looks also needed stunt-level versatility.', '“I’ve spent a lot of my career in stunt-heavy shows, which was a good thing for me going into this project,” Chow said. “Looking at Charles as a character, he is supposed to come up as the kind of Asian person whose wealthy parents sent them to a prestigious private school abroad, and when you immediately look at him, you know he comes from a family with the means to do that. Charles wears more understated colors, and I put him in a lot of custom suits, and blazers that would have Asian embroidery. For some of his custom suits, I designed them with couch fabric. I took a bi-cultural approach to Charles’ clothes reflecting how he’s from Taiwan but now in Los Angeles.”', 'Chow said like many other costume designers, she approaches crafting a wardrobe for a show like she’s a psychologist: the clothing pieces reflect the emotional state and mindset of the character.', 'One of the ways this is reflected is within the title characters of the show, one being Charles, and the other being his brother Bruce, played by Sam Li. The further along the series got, the more Chow worked on blending their color palettes, with Charles’ clothes getting more casual and Bruce’s clothes becoming more elevated as the characters’ traits begin to influence each other. Chow said she chose to do this to signify unity and the brothers coming to work together.', 'Yeoh’s character, Mama Sun, goes through an evolution as well throughout the series, both style-wise and in terms of character development.', '“Every look Mama Sun had, from her nurse’s scrubs to her outfits when she’s with her family in Taiwan, reflected how being a mother was the most important thing to her,” Chow said. “She’s introduced in the nurse’s uniform, and the scrubs are meant to be ambiguous, indicating she could be many varieties of a working class person. However, you see even when she’s in her casual clothes she has the typical San Gabriel Valley auntie look with the cardigans and elastic waistband pants. Mama Sun wants to blend in, but she still always has an air of elegance about her. We did keep a baseline so as her look becomes more elevated, the transition isn’t too dramatic.”', 'For the overall cast, Chow focused heavily on including as many Asian, Asian American and Pacific Islander designers as possible. Some of the brands and labels she pulled from included Vivian Chan, Sundae School, Hungry Sloth, Yanyan Knits and Ren.', 'Symbolism came through with subtle choices like Mama Sun wearing an all-white ensemble before a mass shootout fight scene where there were casualties. White is traditionally a funeral color in Chinese culture, hinting at what’s to come. Jade jewelry was also an indicator of class and rank among the gangs and their different factions. Of all the costuming choices that went into the show, the Chinese opera masks for some of the gangsters were one of Chow’s biggest labors of love, as they were all made by hand.', '“The Brothers Sun” stars Michelle Yeoh, Justin Chien, Sam Li, Highdee Kuan, Alice Hewkin and Madison Hu.

GLP-1 drugs work by mimicking the hormone GLP-1, resulting in weight loss, lowering hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and reducing cardiovascular risks. GLP-1 drugs are approved for treating type II diabetes and obesity.', 'Some GLP-1 drugs that the FDA has approved recently are Eli Lilly’s LLY tirzepatide medicines, which include diabetes drug Mounjaro and newly launched weight loss medicine, Zepbound, and Novo Nordisk’s NVO semaglutide medicines, Ozempic and Rybelsus for type II diabetes and Wegovy for obesity.', 'The FDA has, over the past several months, been studying reports that claim that GLP-1 drugs cause suicidal thoughts or actions\xa0in patients taking them. However, the information in the reports was limited and did not establish any clear relationship between the use of GLP-1 drugs and suicidal thoughts, said the FDA. \xa0It also reviewed some clinical studies, which did not show any such association. The FDA is not ruling out that a small risk of suicidal thoughts may exist and will conduct further evaluations. The labels of obesity drugs, Zepbound and Wegovy, already have warnings about the risk of suicidal thoughts and actions.', 'The GLP-1 segment is particularly attracting a lot of interest for the obesity indication. Obesity has become a global health problem as it can cause other diseases like heart disease, diabetes and stroke. This resulted in an exponential increase in demand for obesity medicines. Also, social media has somewhat hyped the benefits of these medications.', 'According to a Morgan Stanley report, the market for obesity drugs could reach $77 billion by 2030. Though supply issues may affect the sales growth of these drugs in the near term, with the obesity market gaining popularity, analysts expect sales to increase. A huge demand for obesity drugs for cosmetic use may be causing a supply shortage. Nonetheless, drugmakers are rushing to enter the lucrative market.', 'Lilly’s Zepbound was approved in November 2023 and launched in December. Until Zepbound was approved, Wegovy was the only GLP-1 receptor agonist approved for treating obesity. Despite supply challenges, Wegovy is seeing strong prescription trends and is generating impressive revenues and profits for Novo Nordisk. However, Wegovy is expected to face significant competition from Zepbound in 2024 as the latter is priced lower than Wegovy.', 'In August, Lilly acquired private biotech Versanis, adding the latter’s lead mid-stage obesity candidate, bimagrumab, to its portfolio. Bimagrumab has the potential to show better quality weight loss by reducing fat mass while preserving muscle mass in people who are obese or have obesity-related complications.', 'Shares of Lilly and Novo Nordisk have risen 75.8% and 56.5%, respectively, in the past year, compared with an increase of 14.8% for the industry.', '\xa0', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', '\xa0', 'Amgen AMGN also has an interesting GLP-1 receptor candidate in its pipeline called maridebart cafraglutide, which is being developed in phase II for obesity.

MSCI\'s index tracking Latin American stocks was up 1.1% by 1526 GMT, while a basket of regional currencies climbed 0.6% against the dollar. For the week, the broader stocks index was set to slip 0.2% while the currencies index was on track to gain 0.5%. Heavyweight Brazilian assets led broader gains across the stocks and currencies indexes, with the benchmark Bovespa stock index and the real up 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively. Also boosting Brazilian markets, data showed China\'s iron ore imports hit a record high in 2023, up 6.6% from a year before, thanks to stronger demand. Brazil is a major iron ore producer. Despite a hotter-than-expected U.S. inflation report on Thursday, market participants did not shy away from betting on early interest rate cuts, with traders putting about an 81% chance on the likelihood that the Federal Reserve would cut its policy rate at a meeting in March, according to CME Group\'s FedWatch Tool. Markets\' focus remained on Argentina, after the country\'s annual inflation rate rose above 211% in December, data showed on Thursday, hitting the highest level since the early 1990s as new libertarian President Javier Milei seeks to head off hyperinflation with tough austerity measures. ""Looking ahead, we expect prices to continue adjusting to December\'s FX correction, despite the central bank\'s FX anchor,"" Bruno Gennari, an emerging markets strategist and Argentina expert at KNG Securities, said in a note. ""A gradual slowdown of inflation could be expected in February and March ... Over the rest of the year, inflation dynamics will depend to a large extent on the government\'s ability to sustain money demand,"" Gennari added. After the sky-rocketing inflation data, Argentina\'s central bank said on Thursday it would put into circulation 10,000- and 20,000-peso bills later this year, while presidential spokesman Manuel Adorni on Friday said the monthly inflation rate is likely to remain in double digits in the next few months. The official peso weakened to 816 against the dollar. However, Argentina\'s international dollar bonds extended gains a day after International Monetary Fund (IMF) staff and the government reached an agreement that should unlock some $4.7 billion from the country\'s loan program with the global lender. The 2029 note rose 1.27 cents to trade at 40.1250 cents on the dollar, according to MarketAccess data, while the Merval stock index shed earlier gains to slip 0.1%. Stronger commodity prices also boosted the currencies of resource-rich regional markets, while investors kept a watch on rising tensions in the Middle East. Oil prices climbed about 3% on Friday, as some oil tankers diverted course from the Red Sea following overnight air and sea strikes by the United States and Britain on Houthi targets in Yemen after attacks on shipping by the Iran-backed group. The Mexican peso and Colombian peso gained 0.2% and 0.4%, respectively. Mexico and Colombia are oil exporters. The Chilean peso and the Peruvian sol rose 0.6% and 0.8%, respectively, tracking the rise in copper prices. The countries are major copper producers.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Thus, you can purchase General Dynamics' shares before the 18th of January in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 9th of February."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.32 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$5.28 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, General Dynamics has a trailing yield of approximately 2.1% on its current stock price of $254.81. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing."", ' See our latest analysis for General Dynamics ', 'Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. General Dynamics paid out a comfortable 43% of its profit last year. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 46% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.', ""It's positive to see that General Dynamics's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. This is why it's a relief to see General Dynamics earnings per share are up 4.5% per annum over the last five years. Recent earnings growth has been limited. However, companies that see their growth slow can often choose to pay out a greater percentage of earnings to shareholders, which could see the dividend continue to rise."", ""Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, General Dynamics has lifted its dividend by approximately 9.0% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders."", ""Has General Dynamics got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Earnings per share growth has been growing somewhat, and General Dynamics is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow as dividends. This is interesting for a few reasons, as it suggests management may be reinvesting heavily in the business, but it also provides room to increase the dividend in time. We would prefer to see earnings growing faster, but the best dividend stocks over the long term typically combine significant earnings per share growth with a low payout ratio, and General Dynamics is halfway there. There's a lot to like about General Dynamics, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it."", 'Wondering what the future holds for General Dynamics?

The consumer price index increased 0.3% in December month over month and 3.4% on a year-over-year basis compared with broader expectations of a 0.2% and 3.2% rise, respectively, primarily driven by higher rents and food prices. This portrays that the Federal Reserve’s efforts to slow down inflation to its 2% target will likely remain bumpy in the year ahead.\xa0 \xa0Earlier, the Fed had pledged to cut interest rates several times in 2024 owing to a decelerating inflation trend in the later stages of 2023. However, given the recent data anomaly, the Fed might revert to its rate hike policy should inflation witness an uptrend in the near future. This, in turn, signifies that the markets need to brace for intense volatility owing to tempered expectations despite a relatively healthy U.S. economy and GDP data.The December non-farm payrolls report showed that the jobless rate held steady at 3.7%, while the economy added 216,000 jobs compared with 173,000 revised job additions in November, signifying economic strength. The latest GDP data projections also reveal that the economy is likely to grow at a healthy pace in the fourth quarter.\xa0Amid the uncertainty, investors often seek to employ time-tested winning strategies to fetch sustained profits. One of the most successful game plans to beat the blues is to bet on momentum stocks when value or growth investing fails to generate the desired profits.This approach primarily tends to follow the adage, “the trend is your friend.” At its core, momentum investing is “buying high and selling higher.” It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend, it is more likely to continue in that direction because of the momentum that is already behind it. But before we delve deep into it, let us try to fathom why does the momentum strategy at all work?There are several behavioral biases that most investors exhibit in their decision-making. And these emotional responses, or rather mistakes, make the momentum strategy work.For example, some investors are anxious about booking losses and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long, hopeful of a rebound in prices. On the other hand, a few investors sell their winners way too early. Momentum investing is one of the best strategies to avoid making such errors in judgment.Furthermore, investors initially tend to underreact to news, events or data releases. However, once things become clear, they have a habit of going with the flow and overreacting, causing dramatic price reactions. These behavioral problems extend trends, thus opening up huge opportunities for momentum players.To sum up, momentum investing is a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future. It is based on that gap in time before the mean reversion occurs, i.e., before prices become rational again.In this context, stocks like NRG Energy, Inc. NRG, SkyWest, Inc. SKYW and The Andersons, Inc. ANDE are worth betting on.Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha-generative over a long period and across market stages. So, this strategy is quite tricky to implement, as detecting these trends is no child’s play.Here, we have created a strategy to help investors get in on these fast movers and rake in handsome gains. Our screen will help you benefit from both long-term price momentum and a short-term pullback in price.', ""Percentage Change in Price (52 Weeks) = Top #50: This selects the top 50 stocks with the best percentage price change over the last 52 weeks.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index soared more than 40% and even the broader S&P 500 index returned over 25%. But there were still some sectors that missed out on the party.', 'The stocks of renewable energy company NextEra Energy Partners (NYSE: NEP) and its parent company, utility NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE), both got crushed, dropping 56.6% and 27.3%, respectively, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. It was also telling that retail real estate investment trust (REIT) Realty Income (NYSE: O) lost 9.5% in 2023. The reasons behind those drops, and why those stocks could reverse course in 2024, are what investors should be focusing on now.', ""Companies that use debt to help fund their operations have had a difficult economic environment the past two years. As benchmark interest rates quickly rose from around zero to over 5%, costs associated with this extra capital suddenly became a big variable. That's been challenging for these companies -- and unappealing to investors."", ""NextEra Energy Partners is a partnership that acquires and controls renewable energy projects for its parent company, NextEra Energy. Similar to a stock dividend, it pays out the earnings it collects from operations -- known as funds from operations or FFO -- as a distribution to shareholders. Both NextEra entities need to tap the debt and equity markets for investment capital to sustain growth. The terms on NextEra Partners' latest capital raise shows how expense debt is for the partnership in this environment. Just last month it issued debt to raise $750 million at a rate of 7.25%."", 'Those high interest terms are what helped drive investors out of these types of stocks last year. NextEra needs to maintain financial flexibility to purchase energy projects that include contracted solar and wind projects. That upfront capital allocation provides long-term cash flows. To keep that flexibility, in September, NextEra Partners lowered its expected distribution growth rate from a range of 12% to 15% to an annual growth rate of just 6% through at least 2026.', 'REITs like Realty Income have the same higher expense challenges. That company needs to fund acquisitions or investments in new properties to continue generating growth. In addition to its retail-focused portfolio, Realty Income invested $950 million in a Las Vegas casino and agreed to acquire fellow REIT Spirit Realty Capital for about $9.3 billion in 2023. Though the latter was an all-stock transaction, it highlights the continued investments management is making.', ""So there is a reasonable explanation for the drops in these stocks in 2023. But the business fundamentals were not at fault. Realty Income added property diversity last year and maintains a stable retail tenant base provides the cash flow it needs to distribute to shareholders. And NextEra's contracted energy generation provides long-term value and stable cash flows."", ""At its December meeting, the Federal Reserve's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee decided to keep interest rates steady. In the minutes from that meeting, investors saw that most Fed officials now believe that rates will in fact be cut at some point in 2024."", ""That's good news for companies like NextEra and Realty Income that will need to continue to borrow. It also means that the dividends and distributions from these names will be more competitive with savings account and bond yields. For example, Realty Income recently yielded about 5.1%.

114,2892f1db-75df-397f-a81f-4e30c378f960,NEE,2024-01-13,4 Remarkable Growth Stocks You'll Regret Not Buying in the Wake of the Nasdaq Bear Market Dip,Motley Fool,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/2892f1db-75df-397f-a81f-4e30c378f960/4-remarkable-growth-stocks.html,1705140360,STORY,"['COMP', 'NEE', 'SE', 'NIO', 'JAZZ']","[""It's truly incredible what a difference a year can make on Wall Street. In 2022, the growth-fueled Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) shed 33% of its value during a bear market. But in 2023, growth stocks came back with a vengeance and lifted the Nasdaq Composite to a gain of 43%."", 'Despite this monumental rally for the Nasdaq, it remains approximately 7% below its record high, which was set more than two years ago. While short-term traders are liable to view a nearly 7% drop over a 26-month stretch as a disappointment, long-term-minded investors are wisely seeing this decline as an opportunity to establish or add to positions in high-quality growth stocks at a perceived discount.', ""What follows are four remarkable growth stocks you'll regret not buying in the wake of the Nasdaq bear market dip."", ""The first extraordinary growth stock that you'll be kicking yourself for not purchasing while the Nasdaq Composite is still notably below its all-time high is China-based electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer Nio (NYSE: NIO). Although EV demand has weakened a bit in the U.S., Nio appears perfectly positioned to ramp its production and gobble up valuable share in the world's leading market for autos -- namely, China."", 'The biggest challenge Nio has dealt with is China\'s stringent approach to mitigating the spread of COVID-19. Until December 2022, the country\'s ""zero-COVID"" strategy led to unpredictable lockdowns that caused serious supply chain problems. With Chinese regulators abandoning this controversial policy a little over a year ago, Nio has been free to focus on innovation and worry a bit less about supply chain constraints. The result was a nearly 31% increase in EV production last year to north of 160,000 units.', 'Beyond just macro factors, Nio is benefiting from its introduction of the NT 2.0 platform. NT 2.0 provides improved advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), which have fueled demand for its second-generation SUVs. Trucks and SUVs almost always generate juicier automotive gross margin than sedans. The rebound in deliveries Nio has seen for its SUVs is the result of upgrading its ADAS technology via NT 2.0.', ""Thinking outside of the box hasn't hurt Nio's long-term growth prospects, either. Beginning in August 2020, Nio began offering a battery-as-a-service subscription (BaaS). BaaS provides a way for Nio to collect high-margin sustainable revenue, and -- most importantly -- keep early buyers loyal to the brand."", 'Even though Nio is a couple of years away from reaching recurring profits, it ended September with $6.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and various short- and long-term investments. The company also secured a $2.2 billion equity investment from CYVN Investments just prior to the end of 2023. It has more than enough capital to ramp production and continue innovating.', ""A second remarkable growth stock you'll regret not adding to your portfolio in the wake of the Nasdaq's bear market plunge in 2022 is electric utility company NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE). Though utilities are usually slow-growing, dividend-focused businesses, NextEra has delivered a compound adjusted earnings growth rate of just shy of 10% since 2012. This very much makes it a growth stock in a mature sector."", ""NextEra's biggest headwind has been rapidly rising Treasury yields. Income investors buy utilities for their yields and low volatility. But with short-term Treasury yields surpassing 5% in 2023, companies like NextEra Energy became chopped liver. With three interest rate cuts forecast by the nation's central bank in 2024, utilities appear poised for a rebound year."", ""The catalyst that's fueled NextEra's outsize growth rate for more than a decade is its renewable energy portfolio. Nearly half -- or 34 gigawatts (GW) -- of the company's 70 GW of capacity can be traced to renewables. Moreover, the 23 GW of wind capacity and 6 GW of solar capacity are both high-water marks for any electric utility in the world. Though investing in clean-energy projects has been expensive, the reward is substantially lower electricity-generation costs."", ""In spite of higher interest rates, NextEra Energy's management team has no intention of taking its foot off the accelerator. From the start of 2023 through 2026, the company anticipates bringing between 32.7 GW and 41.8 GW of renewable projects on line. This is the fuel that should sustain a superior growth rate in an industry typically known for low-single-digit adjusted earnings growth."", ""Something else for investors to remember about electric utilities is that they provide a basic need service. If you own or rent a home, chances are very good that you need electricity to power your appliances and/or heating/cooling system. This means demand for electricity isn't going to change much from one year to the next, which leads to predictable operating cash flow for NextEra."", ""The third sensational growth stock you'll regret not scooping up in the wake of the Nasdaq bear market decline is specialty drug developer Jazz Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: JAZZ). Although sales exclusivity concerns have weighed on Jazz's stock in recent years, the company's product portfolio and pipeline appear poised to thrive."", ""Before digging into the specifics of its portfolio, it's important to recognize that one of Jazz Pharmaceuticals' biggest competitive advantages is its focus on rare diseases. While targeting indications for a small group of patients can be risky, there's plenty of reward for success, too. Approved orphan drugs face little in the way of pushback on list prices from insurers, and there's rarely much in the way of competition."", ""Jazz's bread and butter continues to be its oxybate franchise (Xyrem and Xywav), which is focused on patients with sleep disorders like narcolepsy. The smart move Jazz made was to develop Xywav, a next-generation version of Xyrem that contains 92% less sodium. Not only does this make the company's top-selling therapy safer for patients with higher cardiovascular risk factors, but it'll help secure most of the company's cash flow for years to come as Xyrem users are moved over to Xywav."", ""Another reason growth stock investors can confidently buy shares of Jazz Pharmaceuticals is its rapidly growing oncology segment, which is led by acute lymphoblastic leukemia drug Rylaze. Cancer drug sales appear to be on target to reach $1 billion in 2023 (Jazz hasn't reported its 2023 full-year operating results as of yet), with a couple of key late-stage readouts expected this year."", ""Finally, Jazz Pharmaceuticals is especially cheap for a growth stock. Despite shoring up the cash flow for its oxybate franchise and delivering double-digit oncology sales growth, shares of Jazz can be purchased for just 6 times forward-year earnings. You'll have a hard time finding a cheaper publicly traded drug developer."", ""The fourth remarkable growth stock you'll regret not buying in the wake of the Nasdaq bear market dip is Singapore-based Sea Limited (NYSE: SE). While Sea's latest quarterly report left a lot to be desired, the company's three fast-paced operating segments offer plenty for long-term investors to be excited about."", 'The division that\'s been generating positive earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) the longest for Sea is its digital entertainment division (commonly known as ""Garena""). Even though the percentage of paying mobile users has declined following the worst of the pandemic, Garena recorded 40.5 million paying users in the third quarter, totaling 7.5% of its active user base. A 7.5% pay-to-play ratio is many multiples higher than the industry average for mobile gaming.', ""There's also plenty of excitement surrounding SeaMoney, the company's digital financial services segment. Since Sea focuses its efforts on underbanked emerging markets in Southeast Asia, offering loans and other digital financial solutions could be a serious cash-flow driver by the latter half of the decade."", ""But the segment that's (rightly) generating most of the buzz for Sea is its e-commerce division, known as Shopee. A burgeoning middle class in Southeast Asia should allow Shopee to sustain a double-digit growth rate for a long time to come. In the entirety of 2018, Shopee recorded $10 billion in gross merchandise value (GMV) on its platform. As of Sept. 30, 2023, it had a GMV annual run rate of just over $80 billion."", ""The final piece of the puzzle is that Sea is sitting on roughly $7.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash. This equates to more than a third of Sea Limited's market cap at the moment and provides a healthy floor for the company's shares."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nio right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nio, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nio wasn't one of them.

That said, every business, even ones as reliable as Black Hills, go through good periods and bad ones. In 2023, the electric and natural gas utility was focused on battening down the hatches. That should change in 2024.', ""When it comes to utility companies, most investors will probably think of industry giants such as NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE). Given its $125 billion-plus market cap, that makes complete sense. But Black Hills Corporation, with its relatively tiny $2.8 billion market cap, trounces NextEra Energy on one key streak, given that it has increased its dividend annually for two decades more than NextEra Energy has. You don't become a Dividend King by accident."", ""That said, Black Hills stock has not been a favorite among investors. It's down more than 20% over the past 12 months, and the dividend yield, at 4.4%, is up near 10-year highs. What's been going on?"", ""The first part of the story isn't specific to Black Hills. The entire utility sector has been dealing with the impact of rising interest rates, which make alternative income investments like a certificate of deposit (CD) more attractive. Conservative investors unwilling to take on the risk of an equity investment can get yields up to 5% from ultra-low-risk CDs, pulling cash away from traditional income stocks like utilities."", ""More specific to Black Hills, however, rising rates increased the utility's debt costs. In response, management shifted gears and focused on debt reduction in 2023. It was the right move."", ""The problem is that money doesn't come out of nowhere, so Black Hills had to cut back somewhere else to come up with the cash it used for debt reduction. That somewhere was its capital spending budget. This is a vital item for regulated utilities, because such spending is what allows them to convince regulators to approve rate increases. As such, capital spending is very important to monitor in the utility space."", 'In 2023 Black Hills capital spending dipped to around $600 million, as planned, creating an extra headwind for the stock. But as the company enters 2024, it expects to ramp back up on the capital investment front. This year, spending should be closer to $800 million, as Black Hills tries to make up for lost ground. In 2025 and beyond, spending will fall back to an around $700 million or so run rate. In other words, Black Hills will try to do the spending of two years in one in 2024.', ""There's good news there, given that the spending from 2023 simply got delayed. So lost time, perhaps, but its plans didn't completely unravel. That said, in 2024 there's going to be a lot more work to get done, which increases execution risk for what is a relatively small company. Investors should probably keep a close eye on the company's progress, even though the broader spending plan should be viewed through a positive lens."", ""If you're trying to live off the dividends your portfolio generates, Black Hills should be on your radar. It's a relative unknown in the utility sector and 2023 wasn't the best year for the company. However, given the consistency with which it has returned value to investors through dividends over time and the capital spending plans it has for 2024, there may not be a lot of time left to buy it while it has a historically high yield."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Black Hills right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Black Hills, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Black Hills wasn't one of them.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. The fourth quarter marked a solid close to a year in which we supported our clients in navigating through a challenging operating environment with geopolitical tensions, macroeconomic uncertainty and evolving monetary policy. We started to show some early evidence that we can deliver higher financial performance in the near and medium term. We clarified our strategic priorities, and we laid a foundation for a multiyear transformation of our company for the long term. With clearer focus on our direction of travel and having restored some confidence in our ability to deliver on our plans, today, we are publishing financial targets for each of our business segments and the firm overall. Dermot will review our fourth quarter financials, the outlook for 2024 and our medium-term financial targets in more detail. But let me first briefly address our performance in 2023. Referring to Page 2 of the financial highlights presentation. Our results for the year, not only highlight BNY Mellon's characteristic resilience, but they demonstrate the strength of our execution when we are appropriately organized and focused. On a reported basis, 2023 earnings per share increased by 38% year-over-year. On a core basis, excluding notable items, EPS of $5.05 increased by 10% year-over-year. Both pretax margin and return on tangible common equity improved on the back of significant operating leverage. Excluding notable items, we generated approximately 180 basis points of positive operating leverage. ROTCE improved 0.5 percentage point to 21.6%, and pretax margin improved roughly 80 basis points to 30%. Moving on to Page 3. At the beginning of last year, we communicated 3 financial goals for 2023. First, we expected to generate approximately 20% net interest revenue growth year-over-year. We delivered 24%. Second, we set out to halve our constant currency expense growth rate in 2022 to approximately 4% year-over-year expense growth, excluding notable items in 2023. We delivered 2.7%. And third, we sought to return north of 100% of 2023 earnings to common shareholders through dividends and buybacks. We delivered 123%. Over the course of 2023, we returned $3.9 billion of capital to common shareholders, all while having further strengthened our regulatory capital ratios to be well positioned for a wide range of macroeconomic and regulatory outcomes. Though we are still at the beginning of our transformation journey, our ability this past year, not just to deliver on our commitments but to exceed them, gives us confidence that we can affect meaningful change and consistently improve our financial performance over time. While mindful, there is a lot more work ahead of us. I'm proud of the effort that our people put in over the last 12 months as we embraced a focus on commerciality, accountability and efficiency, which drove these results. We are committed to improving the firm's financial performance in the near, medium and long term. And we have framed this work for our people with 3 strategic pillars, which we describe on Page 4. Last year, we introduced these 3 pillars to get at the heart of how we operate and who we are day-to-day for our clients, managing their money, moving it and keeping it safe. Pillar number one, be more for our clients; number two, run our company better; and number three, power our culture. They are deliberately simple, and our people are rallying around them. As I've said before, strategy is important but ultimately just a set of words. Actually doing it and how we do it matters a lot. I'm encouraged by the progress we made in 2023, some of which we highlight on Slide 5. Our global clients across governments, pension funds, mutual funds, unions, endowments, corporations, financial services firms and individuals both trust and want to do more business with us. And our analysis clearly shows there is more for them to do with us as we continue to partner alongside them to help achieve their ambitions. As the global finance system grows and becomes ever more complex, demand for a trusted, resilient partner with the scale to service clients across the entire financial life cycle such as BNY Mellon grows as well. In 2023, we launched several new solutions that allow us to deepen our relationships with existing clients and to open the door to new ones. Of course, that includes the launch of Wove, Pershing's wealth advisory platform as well as the rollout of our buy-side trading solutions offering. But it goes far beyond these more visible product launches. All of our businesses are bringing new client solutions to the market. Bankify, real-time payments on FedNow, white labeling LiquidityDirect, Bondwise, intraday repo settlement, BNY Mellon advisers are all examples. And in 2023, we filed more patent applications than ever before. At the same time, we have an opportunity to bring more of BNY Mellon to clients who currently use us for just a single service. Last year, we hired our first Chief Commercial Officer as we began to operationalize our 1BNY Mellon initiative across the organization. As part of enhancing the organizational setup and focus of our client coverage organization, we created an integrated team to facilitate multiline of business solutions at scale, and we also formed a coverage practice group to implement consistency in approach and tooling. Next, while 2023 was a foundational year in what will be a multiyear journey to transform to a more streamlined and effective operating model, we took important steps toward running our company better to improve efficiency, reduce bureaucracy and be more intentional with how we spend so our investments in the business go further. We generated nearly double the amount of efficiency savings versus the prior year, which allowed us to self-fund over $0.5 billion of incremental investments. And we laid the foundation needed to transition to our platform's operating model, including successful pilots in 2 areas of the organization, which were important proof points as we start to unlock the power of our platforms in several phases over the next couple of years. While we focus on being more for our clients and running our company better, we know none of it can happen without our people, which is why we are powering our culture to make BNY Mellon a place where people are proud to work and excited to grow their careers. We elevated recruitment and retention programs, including welcoming the largest class of campus analysts in BNY Mellon's history, a class double the size of the previous year, and we're going to double it again this year. We launched our BK Shares program to grant shares to the 45,000 employees who didn't previously receive stock as part of their compensation to cascade a sense of ownership and accountability across our company. And we rolled out enhanced employee benefits, recognizing value in fostering both a human and high-performing work environment. I'll wrap up where I began. We remain confident in the strength of our culture, our strategy and our ability to execute to help us unlock value for our clients, our shareholders and our people. 2023 was an important year in which we assembled more of the team that can deliver on what is needed, and we got ourselves pointed in the right direction for what we need to achieve. But it was also a year where being humble and resilient mattered. While we have a lot of work ahead of us, what has started as a theory and a belief now has early proof points, and we can see the possibility of what we can achieve. We have an ambitious agenda as we move forward, but I continue to be optimistic about the opportunity ahead. With that, I'll turn it over to Dermot."", 'Dermot William McDonogh', ""Thank you, Robin, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm picking up on Page 6 of the presentation with our consolidated financials for the fourth quarter. And as Robin noted, I'm also going to speak to our 2024 outlook and medium-term targets, including how we are going to execute on our goals. For the fourth quarter, our reported results reflect several notable items. Approximately $750 million of noninterest expense is related to the FDIC special assessment, severance and litigation reserves. And we had $150 million reduction in investment and other revenue primarily related to a fair value adjustment of a contingent consideration receivable. Total revenue of $4.3 billion was up 10% year-over-year or up 2%, excluding notable items. Total fee revenue was flat, reflecting 3% growth in investment services fees, which was offset by a 5% decline in Investment Management and performance fees and a 25% decline in foreign exchange revenue. Investment and other revenue was a negative $4 million in the quarter, reflecting the fair value adjustment that I mentioned before. Net interest revenue was up 4% year-over-year primarily reflecting higher interest rates, partially offset by changes in balance sheet size and mix. Expenses were up 20% year-over-year on a reported basis, primarily reflecting the FDIC special assessment. Excluding notable items, expenses were up 4%, reflecting higher investments and the impact of a weaker dollar as well as inflation, partially offset by efficiency savings. Provision for credit losses was $84 million primarily driven by reserve builds for commercial real estate exposure. Reported earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $0.33, pretax margin was 8%, and return on tangible common equity was 6%. Excluding notable items, earnings per share were $1.28, pretax margin was 28%, and return on tangible common equity was 21%. Turning to capital and liquidity on Page 7. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio of 6% remained largely unchanged, down 8 basis points to be precise compared to the prior quarter. Tier 1 capital remained essentially flat at $23.1 billion as the impacts of capital distributions to common shareholders and our redemption of $500 million preferred stock were offset by an improvement in AOCI and capital generation through earnings. Average assets increased by 1% sequentially, primarily reflecting deposit inflows in the fourth quarter. Our CET1 ratio was 11.6%, which represents a 20 basis point improvement compared with the prior quarter. CET1 capital was up 3% sequentially, primarily reflecting capital generation through earnings and the improvement in AOCI, partially offset by the impact of capital distributions to common shareholders. Risk-weighted assets increased by 1%. Consistent with the prior quarter, we returned $450 million of capital to our common shareholders through share repurchases, and we paid approximately $330 million of common stock dividends in the fourth quarter. The consolidated liquidity coverage ratio was 117%, a 4 percentage point sequential decrease, primarily reflecting deposit inflows in the quarter, which are considered nonoperational until they are seasoned under our operational deposit model. And our consolidated net stable funding ratio remained roughly unchanged at 135%. Next, on Page 8, net interest revenue and additional details on the underlying balance sheet trends. Net interest revenue was $1.1 billion, was up 4% year-over-year and up 8% quarter-over-quarter. The sequential increase was primarily driven by balance sheet growth and changes in balance sheet mix. Total deposits averaged $273 billion in the fourth quarter, up 4% sequentially, a strong finish to the year. Interest-bearing deposits were up 5%, and noninterest-bearing deposits remained flat. Interestingly, since August, we've seen 4 consecutive months of growth in average total deposit balances. Our team is highly engaged with our clients, and we're encouraged by the demand we've been seeing for our on-balance sheet liquidity solutions. While we are pleased with this stabilization, we remain vigilant preparing for a variety of different outcomes and financial conditions in 2024. On the asset side, average interest-earning assets increased by 2% quarter-over-quarter. This includes cash and reverse repo up 5% and loan balances up 3%. The size of our investment securities portfolio decreased by 3% sequentially. Moving to our business segments, starting with Securities Services on Page 9. Securities Services reported total revenue of $2.2 billion, flat year-over-year. Investment services fees were up 1% year-over-year. In Asset Servicing, investment services fees were flat as the positive impact of higher market levels, net new business and the weaker dollar was offset by lower client activity. We ended the year on a high note with our strongest sales quarter of 2023, including wins in the Middle East, new mandates from several midsized investment managers and expanded mandates from some of our largest existing clients. And we saw continued strength in our ETF servicing business, where another quarter of strong net inflows capped a year of above-market growth. Within Issuer Services, investment services fees were up 5%, reflecting healthy new business and higher client activity. Foreign exchange revenue was down 21% year-over-year on the back of lower volatility and lower volumes. And net interest revenue was down 3% year-over-year. Expenses of $1.7 billion were up 5% year-over-year, reflecting higher investments and higher revenue-related expenses as well as inflation, partially offset by efficiency savings. Pretax income was approximately $460 million, representing a 21% pretax margin. Next, Market and Wealth Services on Page 10. This segment reported total revenue of $1.5 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Total investment services fees were up 6% year-over-year. In Pershing, investment services fees were up 1%, reflecting higher equity market values and higher client activity, partially offset by the impact of expected lost business. Net new assets were negative $4 billion for the quarter, also reflecting this expected loss business. In Treasury Services, investment services fees increased by 5%, primarily reflecting higher client activity, partially offset by higher earnings credits for noninterest-bearing deposit balances. In Clearance and Collateral Management, investment services fees were up 16%, reflecting broad-based strength across Clearance and Collateral Management, both in the U.S. and internationally. Net interest revenue increased by 10% year-over-year. Expenses of approximately $840 million were up 7% year-over-year, reflecting higher investments and inflation, partially offset by efficiency savings. Pretax income was approximately $630 million, representing a 42% pretax margin. Turning to Investment and Wealth Management on Page 11. Investment and Wealth Management reported total revenue of $676 million, down 18% year-over-year. In Investment Management, revenue was down 26%, reflecting the fair value adjustment of the receivable and the impact of the prior year divestiture as well as the mix of AUM flows, partially offset by higher market values, seed capital gains and the weaker dollar. In our Wealth Management business, revenue decreased by 3% driven by changes in product mix, partially offset by higher market values. Expenses of approximately $680 million were down 2% year-over-year, primarily reflecting efficiency savings and the impact of the divestiture in 2022, partially offset by higher investments, inflation and the unfavorable impact of the weaker dollar. Pretax income was a loss of $5 million. Excluding the impact of notable items, pretax income of $151 million increased 1% year-over-year and represented an 18% pretax margin. Assets under management of $2 trillion increased by 8% year-over-year, reflecting higher market values and the weaker dollar, partially offset by cumulative net outflows. In the quarter, we saw $7 billion of net inflows into short-term strategies and $4 billion of net inflows into long-term active strategies, while we saw $10 billion of net outflows from index strategies. Wealth Management client assets of $312 billion increased by 16% year-over-year, reflecting higher equity market values and cumulative net inflows. Page 12 shows the results of the Other segment. Total revenue improved year-over-year, primarily reflecting the absence of a net loss from repositioning the securities portfolio recorded in fourth quarter of 2022 and expenses of $693 million included $505 million related to the FDIC special assessment. Having reviewed our results, I will now turn to Page 14 and our current outlook for 2024. We're entering the year on a strong footing, and we set ourselves up determined to at least break even from an operating leverage perspective. Considering our healthy pipeline across the businesses, we expect fee revenue growth to turn positive in 2024. With regards to net interest revenue, our expectation for an approximately 10% decrease year-over-year is based on the assumption of market-implied forward interest rates, and we assume ongoing quantitative tightening puts further downward pressure on deposit balances. We intend to keep expenses, excluding multiple items, roughly flat in 2024. And finally, with regard to capital management, we expect to return north of 100% of 2024 earnings to common shareholders through dividends and buybacks. As Robin discussed earlier, 2023 was a foundational year for us. We took decisive actions to demonstrate some early evidence of our ability to deliver stronger financial performance. And importantly, we've developed a clear road map for our multiyear transformation. Over the next couple of slides, we'll provide you our medium-term financial targets for the firm and some of the most impactful actions we're taking to keep delivering on our goals. Page 15 summarizes our consolidated targets. It is our goal to improve the firm's pretax margin to 33% and our ROTCE to 23% over the medium term while maintaining a strong balance sheet. I'll double-click on our business segments in a moment, but along our 3 strategic pillars, there are a number of teams that transcend our lines of business and segments. Robin mentioned several of these when he talked about our progress in '23, so I'll highlight just a few of them. The first is our enhanced commercial model. We're driving a new culture of commerciality to deliver all of BNY Mellon in a unified front to facilitate deeper client relationships with solutions from across the firm. With our clients at the center, our model is led by client coverage teams with clear accountability to retain business, expand revenue into new areas and drive client satisfaction. Our new sales operations and enablement organization, the client coverage practice, will make it easier for our clients to do more business with BNY Mellon and create consistent commercial roles, tools and support internally for an enhanced and more efficient sales experience. And what we call integrated solutions represent a new, more focused approach to assembling components from multiple client platforms into repeatable go-to-market capabilities that span across our lines of business, driving better value for our clients and higher profitable growth. The second one I'd like to highlight is our transition to our platform's operating model. By grouping similar activities together into logical platforms and uniting related capabilities, we are enabling the streamlining of internal processes to drive higher efficiency and further enhance resiliency and risk management. Our model is based on 2 types of platforms. Client platforms will own the delivery of a commercial solution to our external clients, while enterprise platforms will own the delivery of internal services.Over the past few months, we've developed a detailed implementation approach, and our transition into this new model will be gradual and deliberate, starting with the first implementation wave this spring. And the third is our culture. People come to BNY Mellon to make an impact on global financial markets. While we focus on driving growth and running our company better, none of it can happen without our people. That's why we're making meaningful investments, including an enhanced learning, development and feedback to foster exciting careers. Moving to our segments, starting with Securities Services on Page 16. Here, we are reiterating our existing 30% pretax margin target. Over the past 24 months, we've improved the margin from 21% in 2021 to 25% in 2023. We're pleased with the performance of the business over the past 2 years, but we appreciate that the path from 25% to 30% will be the harder yards. First of all, we're firmly focused on driving down the cost to serve. We have and we continue to make significant investments in uplifting several platforms that support core services, including fund accounting, tax services, corporate actions and loan administration. Additionally, we continue going after inefficient processes. Over the past couple of years, we cataloged all of these processes and we've made some good progress in our digitization efforts, but there's more work to do. We're also taking a more strategic approach to deepening client relationships going forward. Using enhanced tools to better understand client behavior, quality of service, economics and revenue opportunities, we are expanding wallet share and improving client profitability. Last but not least, we're pursuing several opportunities to drive an acceleration of underlying growth. On the back of our investments over the years, we have become a premier provider of ETF servicing globally, and we expect to maintain our strong momentum through continued innovation. Similarly, in private markets, another one of the fastest-growing market segments, we've established a strong market position with more room to expand our capability set. Moving on to Market and Wealth Services on Page 17. As you can see on the left side of the page, this segment has a good track record of solid growth and attractive margins. Our focus here is to accelerate growth through deliberate investments without compromising profitability. I'll start with Pershing, our company's second largest line of business. As the #1 clearing firm for broker-dealers and a top 3 RIA custodian, Pershing benefits from a strong position in one of the fastest-growing segments in financial services, i.e. the U.S. wealth market. Notwithstanding near-term headwinds from the events of 2023, we are confident that our investments in the core platforms and client experience will drive further market share gains in the attractive market segment of the growing $1 billion-plus RIAs and hybrid broker-dealers. And our Wove platform continues to gain momentum. As we're capturing business from existing clients and new opportunities to deliver the platform, data and investment solutions, we're currently projecting $30 million to $40 million of incremental revenue from Wove in 2024. In Treasury Services, we're benefiting from a strong position with financial institutions, and we're one of the top 5 U.S. dollar payments tiers in the world. Leveraging this strong position, we're selectively expanding our reach by targeting new clients, geographic and product segments. For example, we've been adding bankers to drive growth with e-commerce and NBFI clients, and the completion of multiyear uplift of our payments platform is expected to drive an increase to our SWIFT market share through growth in several geographies. Additionally, by joining forces with our markets business, which provides FX solutions in over 100 currencies, Treasury Services will enhance the FX capabilities that it can provide its clients. Rounding out the segment, Clearance and Collateral Management. As a primary provider of settlement for all U.S. government securities trades and the largest global collateral manager in the world, we have a special role in financial markets and we're taking this role very seriously. No doubt this business grows as markets grow, but we're not resting on our position. Our Clearance and Collateral Management business is one of the most innovative in the company. And so we're confident that this business can maintain its healthy growth trajectory by continuously launching new flexible collateral management solutions that position our clients to meet their growing liquidity needs and by continuing to increase collateral mobility and optimization across global client venues. Next, Investment and Wealth Management on Page 18. Investment and Wealth Management reported a pretax margin of 12% for the full year 2023 or 17%, excluding notable items. Our plan is to improve the segment margin to 25% or higher over the medium term on the back of a combination of growth and efficiency initiatives. First, we're unlocking BNY Mellon's distribution power for the benefit of our investment firms and our clients. Most importantly, we're in the process of creating a firm-wide distribution platform that combines in-house products with offerings from select third-party managers to provide best-in-class solutions. Additionally, we're making enhancements to how we're offering Dreyfus cash products across our enterprise-wide open architecture liquidity ecosystem to improve visibility, and hence, platform share. Second, we're expanding our products and solutions with a focus on scaling our investment capabilities across Investment Management, Wealth Management and Pershing. And third, we're driving efficiency and scale by realizing the benefits as multiyear infrastructure investment programs are nearing completion and by better leveraging the enterprise to transform fragmented and subscale support activities into scaled enterprise platforms. Moving on to our capital management philosophy on Page 19. BNY Mellon benefits from a capital-light business model that allows us to drive organic growth while typically returning nearly 100% of earnings to our common shareholders over time. Over the past 10 years, the firm grew dividends per share at an 11% CAGR and returned almost 100% of earnings to shareholders through a combination of dividends and buybacks. Our philosophy for capital deployment and capital distribution remains unchanged. We've entered the year with strong capital ratios at or above our management target of approximately 5.5% to 6% Tier 1 leverage and approximately 11% CET1. And assuming interest rates follow market-implied forwards, we expect to generate additional excess capital from the unrealized loss related to AFS securities pulling to par over time. Wrapping up on Page 20. Over the past year, we conducted thorough strategic reviews, we developed detailed business and financial plans, and we've taken the first steps on what will be a multiyear transformation of our company. Our business plans drive is achieving what we laid out across our 3 strategic pillars: being more for our clients, run our company better, and power our culture. And our financial plans aim to improve the firm's pretax margin to 33% and our ROTCE to 23% over the medium term while maintaining a strong balance sheet. In publishing our medium-term financial targets, together with our most important strategic priorities and the actions that will help us achieve them, we are providing transparency to allow you all to track our progress, and we are confident that we will deliver. We are excited about the work ahead of us, and today is an important milestone for our team. Now for those of you who are still with us, we promise to let you start your long weekend soon. With that, operator, can you please open the line?"", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.', 'Brennan Hawken', ""Thanks for all the detail that you provided in the deck on the targets. Really very, very helpful, very, very thoughtful. I'd love to start there. So it seems as though you guys see a really strong pretax margin enhancement opportunity. Where do you expect that you're going to see the results of that opportunity come through first? And while I appreciate that the targets are over a 3- to 5-year period, is the profile of the improvement that you expect likely to look straight line? Or is there going to be a more parabolic curve resulting in more of a back-end weighting?"", 'Dermot William McDonogh', ""Brennan, this is Dermot. I'll start off. So the way I think about it is if you take the comments that both Robin and I have prepared and we've just laid out over the last 30 to 35 minutes, you can see truly that 2023 was a foundational year. We did a lot of exploratory work, detailed planning. We've made a bunch of investments, both which will drive efficiency and which will drive growth. We've talked a lot over the last few quarters about Wove, which we launched last June. And in my prepared remarks, I talked about $30 million to $40 million of revenue this year. So I would say we're making investments in all of our segments, and you can also see it in Investment and Wealth Management, where we are beginning to see green shoots. And you can see we're making a lot of investments in our security and services businesses modernizing our platforms. So I would say you're going to see it quarter-by-quarter. And I think over time, as you get to know Robin and myself, you'll see us do it and then talk about it rather than preannounce it and then do it. So we're in execution mode, and we will deliver, but you're going to see this happen quarter-by-quarter."", 'Brennan Hawken', ""Okay. The environment is rather different from the last time we spoke. We've seen an indication of a Fed pivot. Everyone is now expecting a far more short order rate -- policy rates to be declining. And so we saw an uplift -- even though there was only a little bit of averaging in of policy rate a little higher this quarter, we did see an uptick in -- on the deposit cost side. So what drove that? And then how should we be thinking about the mechanics of the lower policy rate and how that might flow through on the deposit side and what's captured in your NII outlook for 2024? A few questions in there. Sorry, Dermot."", 'Dermot William McDonogh', 'Yes, I was going to say for a follow-on question, that was special, yes.', 'Brennan Hawken', ""Got my money's worth."", 'Dermot William McDonogh', ""Yes. So hopefully, others won't have to ask the same question again. So look, if you go back 12 months when we gave our 20% guidance for 2023, there was a disconnect between what the market thought was going to happen in '23 and what the Fed thought was going to happen in '23. The market was calling for rate cuts in June of '23, and the Fed wasn't. We guided 20%. The year played out very, very differently to what everybody thought was going to happen. And we ended up with a 24% year. To one of your questions where -- why did deposit costs go up, I think our NIM for Q4 was in the 1.26% range, and that really is balances rolling off and new balances coming on at market rates. And we ran strong to the tape in -- we ran strong to the tape at the year-end. And look, I have to say, how we did on deposits in Q4 was a little bit of a 1BNY Mellon effort between lines of business, our deposit team, our Treasurer and our CIO book. So we feel very good about how we finished the year, and we outperformed $1.1 billion of revenue. So all in all, we feel very good about that. This year, again, I think the Fed and the markets are a little bit at odds. We had a Fed commentator talk a couple of days ago about March being too early. Notwithstanding that, the market thinks there's an 80% probability of a rate cut happening in March. So we're neutrally positioned in the outlook for '24. On balance, if the rates happen, and 6 cuts happen this year, we might expect balances to go up. If it's higher for longer, we expect people to optimize and we say continued outflow of deposits. But we start the year strong with $273 billion of average deposits in Q4. We feel good about our NIM for 2024. So we feel we're set up nicely, but the balance of outcomes, we think, down 10% for '24."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.', 'Michael Lawrence Mayo', ""So let me see if I did okay in my math class in school. So in 2024, you're guiding for flat expenses, flat or higher operating leverage, NII down 10%. That implies fees up 3%. So did I do my math correctly? And if I did it correctly, why only up 3%?"", 'Robin Antony Vince', ""So Mike, it's Robin. We're not going to quibble with your math or with your English comprehension either from our commentary. You've gotten right what we said. We've intentionally not guided on fees because of the nature of the year, and we recognize that there are a lot of different inputs to that. So we recognize that the year can, in fact, turn out in various different ways. We feel committed to the flat to plus on the operating leverage that we've committed to. And we've guided to how we think the other things are going to play out. And so that was quite deliberate, and we're focusing you on the things that we've talked about. But obviously, from a math point of view, we understand how the math works."", 'Michael Lawrence Mayo', 'The more important question would just be your medium-term target to take your returns to 23%, up from 21% last year or, I guess, 21.5% or so this past year. How do you define the medium term? And for that 150 basis point increase from here, how would you segment that, like efficiency, revenue, buybacks or some other way just to give us like a simple waterfall chart in words?', 'Dermot William McDonogh', ""So the way I would think about it, Mike, is not to give you a weak answer, it really is all of the above. And if you think about fee revenue, we're very focused on higher organic growth. And we set about that and we've made a lot of mention about the Chief Commercial Officer, 1BNY Mellon and just generally de-siloing the organization. We really feel optimistic about being able to deliver over time higher organic growth.Also in 2023, FX volumes around the world and volatility was lower. And so we expect FX revenue that to normalize, which give us a boost. And look, we're optimistic about where equity markets are going to go. And so in our plans, we have mid-single-digit equity market appreciation to support that fee revenue growth.On expenses, look, I think 2023 was a year where we got 50-plus thousand employees on the same page as how Robin and I think about and the management team think about running our company better. We don't talk about cost cutting or head count layoffs. We talk about what are the things that we need to do to run this company better. And I think we have 50,000 people aligned with us now. And I feel very optimistic through all the projects that we have underway to digitize the firm, automate processes, deliver more for our clients. So everything will feed together, and we'll do a lot at the same time. And with all of that, we'll be able to buy back more stock, which will drive us to that higher ROTCE and pretax margin that you talked about."", 'Robin Antony Vince', ""And Mike, I'll just add one thing to that, which is we talked at the beginning of 2023, and you pressed us on this and rightly so in 2023, about the fact that we hadn't before managed to tell the improved expense story that we think we actually ended up telling on -- in 2023. And that was an important focus.We also recognized that we were likely to have a good NII year, and we took the opportunity of those 2 things to be able to invest for future fee growth. And we never thought 2023 was likely to be a very strong fee year because the fees take time to be able to generate the return from the investment that we're putting into it through the various different things that Dermot just detailed.And so we've set ourselves up, we think, to now be able to really leverage those investments. And that's a '24, '25, '26 story. Now of course, we'll stay focused on NII. We'll absolutely stay focused on efficiencies and expenses. We think AI will play a story in that over time, probably not a short-term story but more of a medium-term story. And that's how the whole thing comes together from an operating leverage point of view. So the way we got there in '23 is probably going to be different than the way we'll get there in '24. We're trying to point you to that through the disclosures."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.', 'Brian Bertram Bedell', 'Thanks for all the detail around the businesses and long-term outlook as well. If I can focus on Slide 16 in the securities servicing goals there. How do you think about -- in terms of automating the processes those first 2 boxes that drive the cost to serve down and then the second one on deepening client relationships, how do you think about the effect of digitizing and automating these processes and whether matching that against to what extent you can actually enhance the revenue profile as well? Are you favoring lowering the cost and not so much enhancing the revenue profile by digitizing the services? Or is there 2 parts of that where you can also improve the servicing quality?', 'Dermot William McDonogh', ""Okay. So here's how I would answer that, Brian. So we've -- and I said in my prepared remarks, we've made a lot of -- through last year and this year in the budget process, we have made a lot of investments in our foundational infrastructure that supports the Asset Servicing business. And so that's going to result in greater automation and a better client experience.We hired a new Head of Operations last year, and he's made a tremendous impact and spending a lot of time with our clients through understanding client behaviors where they're able to explain to us what they need, and we can then figure out how to change our processes to be more automated to deliver their solutions. So we've made a lot of good progress there.So through driving down the cost to serve, we're going to give better client experience, which will then ultimately lead to enhanced revenue and enhanced client experience because the clients will be happy with us.The other thing I would say is, for Asset Servicing specifically, we had our strongest sales quarter in 2023. We come into 2024 with a very healthy uninstalled book of business. And we feel very good about the mandates we won in Q4, and we feel very good about the pipeline coming into 2024. So I feel very, very good about all the leadership changes that we've made in Asset Servicing over the last 12 months, the hires we've made and the impact that they've made since they've joined.And then within the other part of Securities Services, Corporate Trust and Depository Receipts, we're making significant investments in Corporate Trust this year to do a lot more digitization and a lot more automation so we can scale the business and drive that margin higher."", 'Brian Bertram Bedell', ""That's great color. And then just a follow-on on the balance sheet deposit beta, the Fed cuts. And maybe if you can also comment on international cuts from the Bank of England and ECB. How are you viewing your deposit beta on the downside? Do you think within your guidance, are you able to move that down commensurately? Or is there a significant lag? And does that differ between the U.S. and Europe?"", 'Dermot William McDonogh', ""So just to give you a general framework, nothing really has much changed quarter-over-quarter. The dollar book, which is roughly 75% of the overall portfolio, has an 80% beta. As I've said many times, we have sophisticated clients. They're with us for not just deposits but for a variety of goods and services, which feeds the stickiness of our overall deposits being 2/3 operational. So that's a good story.We passed on the price as I've said. We -- it will grind a little bit higher from here, but I think I feel pretty good about the dollar book and where that's at. And then euros and sterling, which make up the balance, are in the 55 to 65 beta range. And so as the rate -- as the Fed ultimately will pivot and rates will come down, we do expect that to follow symmetrically and so go down the same way it came up. So that's how I would view that."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.', 'Ebrahim Huseini Poonawala', ""I had a [favoring] question just around looking at your medium-term targets. And I heard what you said in response to Mike's question on the fee revenue guide for this year. But when I looked at your strategic targets, I guess it's deliberate that we don't have a revenue growth number in there or a revenue growth target.And I'm just wondering, is that due to the macro or your view on the business, where you don't have a line of sight around being able to sustain a certain level of revenue growth? And I ask this because I think that's probably the toughest part of the BTA investment story is what's the sustainable level of revenue growth. You gave a lot of details around products and businesses, but would love to hear in terms of how you think one should think about baseline revenue growth in a more or less normal macro environment over the coming years."", 'Dermot William McDonogh', ""Okay. Thanks for the question, Ebrahim. So I've been here 14 months now. So I'll give you my perspective, right, in terms of my history and I've studied the firm and how -- what we've accomplished over the last 12 months and how I see the future.So over the past years, BNY Mellon has delivered organic growth north of 2%, but it hasn't done it in a consistent fashion. And so we want to be able to talk to you in a consistent manner, and we'll give you guidance -- we want you to know that when we give guidance, you believe that we're going to do it.So for '24, we think we're going to turn positive on fee growth. We feel set the firm up. But we don't want to give out guidance that has not got a track record of success. And so I've said this in an answer to some other questions. Asset Servicing, we feel like we have strong momentum. We feel we're making the right investments to power that business forward. And that will -- it's our biggest business. And so we feel like pretax margin is going to go up as a result of efficiency and fee growth.And then if you take Market and Wealth Services, our most profitable segment, Clearance and Collateral Management, Treasury Services and Pershing, all have mid-40s pretax margin and all have good opportunities for growth. But then again, fee growth is a little bit dependent on the market, and a big part of it is what happens to the market. And that guides us to be a little bit more cautious with giving you guidance overall on fee growth. But each of our businesses in terms of the underlying fundamentals, we feel very, very good about."", 'Robin Antony Vince', ""Ebrahim, I'll just add to that. And we debated this a lot about the fact that you don't have the dollar output guidance on fees. And so as a result, what we've been trying to do is really make sure that we're communicating to you on all of the inputs to that.But as Dermot said, there is both a market impact potential. We'll have to see how the markets evolve. And there's a bit of a portfolio effect, which is we've really invested in a lot of different places. We have good confidence around the fact that several of those are going to yield something in 2024 and then hopefully continue to yield more in 2025. But it's hard for us to be able to know exactly what's going to hit and exactly when it's going to hit.So we've got a confidence on a portfolio basis around those investments, but we don't have the absolute line of sight that makes us comfortable to tell you the exact number in the exact quarter that it's actually going to hit. And so all we can do is show you the inputs and now point to a year of track record in 2023 around the fact that we have, in fact, made progress on the things that we said we were committed to make progress on."", 'Ebrahim Huseini Poonawala', ""That's helpful. Good color. And just a separate question. I mean I'm sure most investors like the fact that you're going to be buying back stock. But when you think about -- given the run in the stock valuation-wise, is there any sensitivity to where you probably don't want to be leaning into buybacks? And secondly, are there other good uses of capital, one of them being inorganic M&A-driven growth? Or is that just off the table right now?"", 'Robin Antony Vince', ""So you're right that we have an implied waterfall of how we think about our capital. And the first is to be able to invest it profitably well in the business. And then towards the bottom of that waterfall is if we have surplus capital after we taking those things into account, we want to return it to our shareholders, and that's what we've been doing. And so that waterfall hasn't changed in how we think about it.Now in terms of M&A, right now, we're focused on what we have and how we think that we can improve it. That's really been the story. Dermot really made the point around running our company better. And we think that there's so much opportunity in the franchise to be able to run ourselves better and have the growth that we haven't wanted to distract ourselves with M&A.Now we have a high bar. We've had a high bar. We continue to have a high bar, but we are keeping our eyes open. And I think that's the right thing to do, particularly for things that would help us to accelerate our delivery. We're not looking at transformation, we're not looking at big pivots, but we are always interested in things that can, in their own way, speed us on the journey that we've laid out to you."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.', 'Kenneth Michael Usdin', ""So last year, you guys did a really good job setting a hittable bar on that NII point that you made earlier, and we ended up seeing a nice increase to NII to the end of the year up to $1.1 billion. So I'm just wondering, given that you're still setting a new bar to down 10%, which implies definitely like a settling down from the $1.1 billion, I'm wondering to the prior conversation on rates, just can you help us understand like the cadence of that, the direction of travel and then with regards to the rates forecast you're building in, like when that settles back down and starts to bottom?"", 'Dermot William McDonogh', ""New yearly guidance, I'm not too sure I really want to commit to quarterly guidance. Deposit levels, we finished the year strong. That was a variety of factors. As I said in my prepared remarks, we had 4 months of consecutive growth. I talked at Barclays in September, I talked at Goldman in December. We feel very good about the deposit franchise. We feel very good about what clients are doing with us.And so we bank it as it comes. But when I sit back and I look out at the macro, and this is what we said this time last year, we expected deposits to go down by mid- to high-single digits. And it'd ultimately be -- it was down 4% for us. That's the trajectory I expect to happen this year. And so I don't have a particular magic ball on what's going to happen quarter-by-quarter. So I would just take the down 10% and divide it by 4 for your model and just see where that gets you."", 'Kenneth Michael Usdin', ""Okay. Got it. And then as a corollary to that, your comments on the movement to a flattish expense base from a successful plus 3% last year is a meaningful move. And I know it fits to that point we just ended on, which it still incorporates a down 10% NII. Presuming we get past this point and NII does get stable and/or the fee income starts to grow, I presume you're not trying to point us to a flattish expense trajectory for the longer-term future. But guide -- maybe you can talk us to how you will manage that positive operating leverage gap and -- relative to needed investments and then the margin targets you just gave us, too, in terms of how you deal with volatility of the macro environment while getting to that point of seeing those margin target improvements."", 'Robin Antony Vince', ""So Ken, it's Robin. I'll start off. Dermot might want to add something. Look, I think about this at a fairly high level of us being focused on positive operating leverage, at least until the point that we get to the margin targets that we're talking about, and there's a little bit of work between here and there.And we also recognize that each year is going to have unique factors. And so the year in which we have a fairly significant NII jump of the 24% is going to create different conditions that allowed us to have a fee year which was fine but not growing in a meaningful way. And that allowed for some headroom on expenses, which was -- which is something that we've used in order to be able to make investments.Now 2024 is a different year. It's got a different composition. But every one of the years that we face has each of these inputs. It has fees, it has NII and it has expenses. And we're trying to be very purposeful around solving for operating leverage in the context of the year that we actually are faced with. And we think that that's the right thing to do, recognizing that markets move around. And each year brings -- serves us something different. We manage what's in our control."", 'Dermot William McDonogh', ""So Ken, I'll go a little bit off script here. It's a bit of a cultural moment for us on just expense management, financial discipline, running our company better. I talked with one of the executive committee yesterday and he said, Dermot, you have a very high bar for yourself on flat expenses for 2024. And I said, no, we have a high bar, we as a firm. And that's down to all of us. And we talked to our managing director population earlier today, and we're all in it together about running our company better. And I think that's an important culture pivot that we've managed to achieve over the last 12 months."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.', 'Glenn Paul Schorr', ""So just one big question, if I could. So I think you've been talking about getting clients to do more business with Bank of New York Mellon, which -- and you're executing on getting them better and you invested a lot. I did hear you today talk about improve the service and then clients will consolidate business.So my question is, high level, it feels -- it's natural and it feels like it's working, but you're putting a lot of effort and expense at improving and modernizing and digitizing your businesses that actually haven't been growing as much and/or need to modernize more and have lower margins to improve them. But is there any thought towards maybe you're supposed to put capital towards actually your highest profitable business and ones that grow? It's a question on, do you need the whole portfolio basically?"", 'Robin Antony Vince', ""So the short answer to your question, Glenn, is yes, we do. And as Dermot has laid out and we've laid out in the materials particularly, there is a subtly different flavor to the investments that we are making in each of our segments. And so in the Securities Services segment, our focus is on the efficiency and cost to serve as well as growth. We haven't ignored growth. But we recognize that making sure that our margin in that business continues to improve will allow us to be even more competitive. Because we're the world's largest custodian, we want the benefits of our scale to fully translate into our pricing with customers and the service that we can provide.So it's got a tilt towards efficiency in that business. And there's a lot of digitization that can be brought to bear there. We are excited about the medium-term potential of AI. We're excited about the shorter-term benefits of our new leadership team in operations, and the things that Emily and her team are working on are really targeted to that. But we haven't forgotten about growth in the space. And that's why Dermot mentioned, we actually had our best sales quarter at the end of last year in that business.Now you're right, in our Market and Wealth Services business, which has a margin that, frankly, we're quite happy with, and you haven't heard us talk about growing that margin. We really want to grow that business at that margin, and that's our focus there. So that's really where our drive, drive, drive around more revenues, a lot of our investments around our new business. That's where we built Wove, is in that business.Dermot talked about the Clearance and Collateral Management business, where we've had very significant growth over the course of this year. He talked about the investments that we're making in our Treasury Services business as well, where we've got -- so that's where we are really wanting to try to grow the overall revenue.And then in our Investment and Wealth Management business, where we've had higher margin before and now we've been subject, of course, to the more difficult market environment, that's driven it down. But that's a place where we'd like to return to our prior margins. A little bit of market would help on that but also some of the structural changes that we've been making, the new product launches that we've been doing, the opportunity to make Investment Management part of BNY Mellon as opposed to just a separate piece, not availing itself of the $2.5 trillion-plus of distribution we have, which at the end of the day, was completely orphaned previously from the $2 trillion worth of manufacturing. So the way in which we're solving the problem varies according to the segment."", 'Dermot William McDonogh', ""And what I would add there, Glenn, is -- it's in my remarks, but we invested $0.5 billion last year in things that we wanted to do that was going to grow the company while keeping our expense growth rate at 2.7%. So we're very disciplined about what we want to do, getting value for money, while at the same time, manage the expense base of the firm."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley.', 'Manan Gosalia', 'Can you talk about your assumptions around QT in your NII guide? And are you assuming it continues at the current rate? So if the Fed does slow and does end QT early, would that be a big benefit to your deposit growth and to NII?', 'Dermot William McDonogh', 'So our NII guidance is based on market-implied forward rates at the end of the year with QT continuing. And so with QT continuing, we expect deposits to roll off. If QT were to change, then obviously, we would revisit and see what the benefits of that would be and run our models again and then we will come and talk to you. But that is not our base case, QT ending anytime soon.', 'Manan Gosalia', 'But on a net basis, that should help the noninterest-bearing deposit balances?', 'Dermot William McDonogh', ""It should help, yes. But I couldn't give you a sensitivity to it here today, and it's not our base case."", 'Manan Gosalia', 'Got it. Okay. Great. And then if you could help us with how we should think about the securities book with 6 rate cuts? Is there still a large chunk of the securities book that still reprices higher even if we get 6 cuts?', 'Dermot William McDonogh', ""So Q4 -- I'll start with Q4. As you will see in the financial supplement, the securities book rolled down by about $4 billion, largely deployed into cash and some mortgages, et cetera. And we had a yield pickup there of about 300 basis points. In 2024, we expect the yield pickup from the roll-down to be about 150 to 200 basis points, so rolling off at about 3% into current market rates. It's very liquid, quite like shortened duration. So overall, we feel good about the outlook for the book in 2024."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.', 'Gerard Sean Cassidy', ""Dermot, I know you touched on this with the net interest revenue already in terms of your expectations for 2024 being down 10% following, I think, the forward curve, correct me if I'm wrong there. If the forward curve is incorrect currently 6 rate cuts and it comes in closer to 2 or 3 for the year, how does that affect that 10% guidance?"", 'Dermot William McDonogh', ""So I would say the theoretical answer to that is you're higher for longer. And so therefore, people will continue to optimize their deposits into higher-yielding assets. So you could see the base case, you could see balances run off more. But we've analyzed this top-down, bottom-up left to right. And so the best guidance we give you is 10%. But if it transpired to be a different number, obviously, the NII number would be different."", 'Gerard Sean Cassidy', ""Sure. No, understood. Okay. And maybe, Robin, and I apologize if you guys already talked about this or it's in the deck. Your new business wins this quarter, what was the dollar amount of that? And what's the installed base that you have for next year?"", 'Dermot William McDonogh', ""So we don't give specific guidance on the installed base or backlogs. But I would say, look, I said it in an answer to an earlier question and it's in my prepared remarks, we had -- Q4 sales was our strongest of '23. We won mandates in the Middle East, asset managers, largest clients giving us more business. So look, we feel very good about what we accomplished in Asset Servicing in '23, and the team feel very built up about '24 and what the opportunities are in front of them."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research.', 'Robert Henry Wildhack', ""A couple more on deposits. Dermot, you mentioned a couple of times that you've had 4 straight months of deposit growth to close '23. It seems that a lot of the things that would weigh on deposits in '24 were or already are headwinds in '23. And yet despite that, you've been able to grow deposits. So I'm curious if there's anything else that you think might change or become more of a headwind from the last 1/3 of '23 and into '24. And if there's a possibility or an environment where deposits actually do come in better than what's in the guide?"", 'Dermot William McDonogh', ""So look, overall, a big part of the deposit base -- our deposit base, too, is NIBs and where that goes. So look, the reality is Q4 was clients and hard work by our team. And it worked out and we outperformed by $100 million, and we take it. But hindsight is everything and it's behind us, so we bank it and we move on.When I sit here today and I sat here last January, '23 didn't turn out the way everybody thought it was going to turn out. And so who knows what's going to happen in 2024. And so there is a lot of uncertainty out there. So I feel very comfortable with the down 10%. And if that changes to the upside, we're going to be the first people to tell you because we would like it to be not that number. We'd like to be -- it to be a better number, but that's the number we give you today."", 'Robin Antony Vince', ""And Rob, I'll just add. It's easy to forget, we still got a lot of complexity in the world. As Dermot said earlier on, if QT continues, that's one thing. If QT ends, maybe that's to the plus. You've also had a massive run up in liquidity over the course of the -- in money market funds and other places, we have to see how that gets put to work or not, as the case may be. Stock market, therefore, becomes a little bit of a wildcard as we see the flow of funds.So we're still at the complexity of -- we talk about the fact that the Fed might cut in March. The Fed talks about the fact that they might not cut in March. So there's enough variation in the exact way that this is going to play out. And that's why Dermot answered one of the earlier questions in the way that he did around our 10% and the path of it because we just don't have that type of visibility. But we do have the sense that we can work the problem to our current guidance."", 'Robert Henry Wildhack', ""Okay. And then I think earlier you mentioned something about deposits that were not yet seasoned or not yet operational. I was just wondering if you could expand on that. What's the criteria for a deposit to be considered operational? And then how long does it take for something like that to play out?"", 'Dermot William McDonogh', ""So that's -- there's a very long answer to that, which we can take you through off-line. But the general sense of to be operational, you have to be doing stuff with us in another line of business and you have to be making payments and you have to be sticky to us as the firm. And over time, then we classify you as operational in nature. And that helps us on the liquidity ratio standpoint.So if you're a relatively new client and you haven't established that track record, then you're considered nonoperational until such time as you meet those criteria. But as I said earlier, 2/3 of our deposits overall are sticky, and that's a good fact."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Rajiv Bhatia with Morningstar.', 'Rajiv K. Bhatia', ""Can you comment on the pricing environment within your Securities Services segment? I guess ACA was up 9% against flat fee revenue. So is pricing pressure, would you say, is stable or would you say it's intensifying?"", 'Dermot William McDonogh', ""So I would say it's overall stable, and it's something that we gave a particular focus to last year. And we've gone through it client-by-client, analyzed client profitability, which clients are profitable, which clients aren't, what we can do in terms of cost to serve and how do we price on a marginal basis versus a fully loaded basis.So over the last 12 months, we've done a lot of foundational work on how we've become more sophisticated in terms of how we price our business and how we talk to clients vis-à-vis pricing. So I would say stable with a positive momentum to it."", 'Operator', 'And our final question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.', 'Michael Lawrence Mayo', ""At the Boston Bank Conference in November, Emily Portney, the head of your Asset Servicing business, seemed very excited about AI and the implications and the implementation of that in the Asset Servicing business. And I'm just wondering if that excitement is shared throughout BNY Mellon and what you see as potential use cases and the ability to go from pilot to production. Is it -- beyond the hype, where is the reality of AI? And any specific numbers of what it might be able to do?"", 'Robin Antony Vince', ""Yes, Mike. Look, the short answer is, yes, we are excited about AI. We're excited about it. Over the medium term, we stood up in 2023, what we call the AI Hub, where we gathered up a bunch of engineers under top talent leadership to really focus on building out a set of capabilities. They worked with every business and every function in the firm to canvas for use cases. We had hundreds of those. We developed a series of different themes for investment because there's a lot of duplication actually across the different use cases when you think about them on a fundamental functional basis. And then these themes for investment are things that we've actually been investing in.And so we do have things in production. We actually have a piece of software today that is creating predictions for clients in our treasuries business actually that looks at sales. We've talked about that before. That's a good example. And that was a very early AI implementation that we made, and it's actually a piece of software that we currently earn some revenue on as part of our CCM business. It also contributes more broadly to market stability, and it's a great client service.On the flip side of that, the question is going to be, well, for an organization which has as many processes as we have and people performing processes, there's going to be an opportunity there to create more efficiency. And so we've invested in and are investing in that space as well. We're also investing in the employee experience, the opportunity to have AI do tasks which are mundane or repetitive. In one particular case, it's helping our research team get a march on the day. So rather than getting up at 4:00 in the morning to write research, they get up at 6:00 in the morning to write research because the AI has given them a rough draft to start with and served up a bunch of data for them. So there are all sorts of different things.Now we haven't put it into numbers, and so it's not directly in our outlooks in terms of the way that we're thinking about it. But it would not surprise me if this is something that, over the course of the next decade, is going to be able to provide benefit on the top line and the bottom line. And so we're doing exactly what Dermot said before: we're not talking too much about things that we're still working on, that we can't give you line of sight into the exact input, but I'm answering the question because you asked it. But we are excited about this under the hood, for sure."", 'Operator', 'And with that, that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to hand the call back over to Robin with any additional or closing remarks.', 'Robin Antony Vince', ""Thank you, operator. I'd like to close by reiterating that 2023 was an important foundational year for us and that the multiyear transformation of our company is off to a good start. As we begin our company's 240th anniversary year, we're excited about the opportunity ahead of us. I'm immensely proud of everything that our people here at BNY Mellon got done over the past 12 months. I'm grateful to our clients who are leaning in to their relationships with BNY Mellon and allowing us the opportunity to serve them in even greater ways.

If you want to read about some more narrow moat stocks, go directly to 5 Narrow Moat Stocks Hedge Funds Are Buying.', 'Investors who are new to the stock market often get confused by the term moat. This is because moat is not easily defined and cannot be quantified based on numbers alone. Looking a little deeper into the origins of the word for better understanding, it seems that the term came into wider use in the finance world through Warren Buffett, the legendary value investor who is worth more than $118 billion. Buffett, famous for shrewd investments in the value space, used it to define companies that have sustainable competitive advantages over peers in the marketplace.\xa0', 'Although Buffett likes to invest in companies with wide moats, as he calls them, the term moat has been modified in recent years to also include companies with narrow moats. The distinction between wide and narrow moats is interesting. Companies with wide moats provide goods or services that are similar to those offered by competitors, but widely outperform their peers in terms of profits. Not only are these firms ahead in terms of profits, but they can also protect these and their market share in the long-term.\xa0', 'In contrast, the companies with narrow moats are somewhat similar to those with wide moats in that they outperform peers in terms of profits, but their outperformance is usually understood to be not long-term or is even time-limited in some cases. Some examples of companies with narrow moats that hedge funds are buying include DoorDash, Inc. (NYSE:DASH), Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE), and The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK), among others discussed in detail below.\xa0', 'It is important to clarify that companies with narrow moats often operate in economic sectors that have tight margins, license protection, and low barriers to entry. These factors make the competitive advantage they gain over peers all the more impressive given the constraints under which these firms usually operate. The business acumen of firms with narrow moats is better understood in context of the third quarter earnings call of DoorDash, Inc. (NYSE:DASH), a logistics platform that connects merchants with consumers.\xa0', 'Tony Xu, the CEO of DoorDash, Inc. (NYSE:DASH), in response to a question by Barclays analyst Ross Sandler during the third quarter earnings call, said that the company had a long-term strategy in place to grow internationally by working in partnership with businesses that had world-class retention and order frequency. The CEO underlined that the firm also looked to invest, in a concentrated manner, only in businesses that had excellent execution, allowing growth at multiple levels and geographies.\xa0', ""“I mean you're absolutely right. We are very excited about our execution on the international front. We continue to grow at multiples of what we see around the world, virtually across any geography. That doesn't mean that we are pleased yet with where our product is."", ""We still have a lot of room left to go. But I think it does stem from why our outperformance has occurred, which is I think the hallmarks at any great marketplace have the fundamental characteristics of great retention order frequency and unit economics. And I think when you look at our international business or our new categories business or a restaurant business, you see all of these characteristics present. And that's why we've been very interested in leaning in and making the investments that we have at size, at scale, because of what we see."", ""And the international business continues to see those points of execution. I think if we remind ourselves even a couple of years ago of the investment thesis behind our partnership with Wolt, it really centered on two big pieces. One of which was here is a business that has leading world-class retention and order frequency, and the question is, can we invest behind that in a concentrated way and hopefully add to the excellent execution that they've already seen. And so far, the answer has been yes to that.”"", 'Our Methodology', 'The companies that have short-term advantages over competitors were identified using manual research and Reddit threads. The top ones were then ranked according to hedge fund sentiment. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2023 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

Those holdings were previously attributed to Liberty SiriusXM and reattributed to a the newly created Liberty Live Group vehicle to reduce the complexity of the Liberty SiriusXM structure and make way for its potential combination with the underlying SiriusXM business. We believe the separation created some selling pressure on Liberty Live, creating an attractive discount of over 40% to the underlying value of its Live Nation holdings, and we took advantage of that discount to build a position. The Liberty Live Group is a small-cap vehicle through which we can own the underlying Live Nation business, which we have tracked and liked for years. Live Nation has significant competitive advantages in the live entertainment industry due to its unique combination of concert promotion, ticketing, venue management, and sponsorship businesses, which create a market share flywheel and margin structure that is difficult for competitors in any one of these underlying sub-segments to replicate independently. In addition to the upside we see in Live Nation, we think Liberty Live Group could eventually transition from a tracking stock to an asset-backed vehicle, which would pave the way for a structure consolidation with Live Nation and allow us to capture the current wide NAV discount.”', 'Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', 'Tapestry, Inc.

MSCI\'s index tracking Latin American stocks was up 1.1% by 1526 GMT, while a basket of regional currencies climbed 0.6% against the dollar. For the week, the broader stocks index was set to slip 0.2% while the currencies index was on track to gain 0.5%. Heavyweight Brazilian assets led broader gains across the stocks and currencies indexes, with the benchmark Bovespa stock index and the real up 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively. Also boosting Brazilian markets, data showed China\'s iron ore imports hit a record high in 2023, up 6.6% from a year before, thanks to stronger demand. Brazil is a major iron ore producer. Despite a hotter-than-expected U.S. inflation report on Thursday, market participants did not shy away from betting on early interest rate cuts, with traders putting about an 81% chance on the likelihood that the Federal Reserve would cut its policy rate at a meeting in March, according to CME Group\'s FedWatch Tool. Markets\' focus remained on Argentina, after the country\'s annual inflation rate rose above 211% in December, data showed on Thursday, hitting the highest level since the early 1990s as new libertarian President Javier Milei seeks to head off hyperinflation with tough austerity measures. ""Looking ahead, we expect prices to continue adjusting to December\'s FX correction, despite the central bank\'s FX anchor,"" Bruno Gennari, an emerging markets strategist and Argentina expert at KNG Securities, said in a note. ""A gradual slowdown of inflation could be expected in February and March ... Over the rest of the year, inflation dynamics will depend to a large extent on the government\'s ability to sustain money demand,"" Gennari added. After the sky-rocketing inflation data, Argentina\'s central bank said on Thursday it would put into circulation 10,000- and 20,000-peso bills later this year, while presidential spokesman Manuel Adorni on Friday said the monthly inflation rate is likely to remain in double digits in the next few months. The official peso weakened to 816 against the dollar. However, Argentina\'s international dollar bonds extended gains a day after International Monetary Fund (IMF) staff and the government reached an agreement that should unlock some $4.7 billion from the country\'s loan program with the global lender. The 2029 note rose 1.27 cents to trade at 40.1250 cents on the dollar, according to MarketAccess data, while the Merval stock index shed earlier gains to slip 0.1%. Stronger commodity prices also boosted the currencies of resource-rich regional markets, while investors kept a watch on rising tensions in the Middle East.

It was an impressive showing, especially considering that the smartphone market (still the bulk of Qualcomm's revenue) was in a deep slump last year."", ""But with the smartphone market bottoming out and 5G network expansion still ongoing, I'm optimistic Qualcomm stock can do well again in 2024. Here's why I added to my position to kick off the new year."", ""During the first wave of 5G network launches in the last few years, a slew of new 5G-enabled smartphone models came with it. In fact, some research estimates say that nearly 70% of smartphone shipments in 2023 are already 5G-ready. This big wave, and the resulting drop in consumer electronics purchasing after the pandemic, shows up in Qualcomm's epic revenue and earnings per share (EPS) boom and bust over the last three years."", ""5G growth isn't finished, though. The newest generation of wireless communications networks is about more than just phones. 5G network improvements are still needed, which means the sale of more chips both in network infrastructure and smartphones. Additionally, all sorts of devices are envisioned as being 5G-capable -- from PCs (some mobile providers, like Verizon Communications, are offering 5G as a new type of home internet service) to automobiles to smart factories (robotics that utilize a private 5G network to connect and coordinate operations)."", 'All of these developments around 5G bode well for Qualcomm. According to CFO Akash Palkhiwala, a transition to more 5G chips equates to about a 10% increase in semiconductor average selling price (ASP) versus previous-generation mobility chips. Paired with a decrease in smartphone sales that appears to have happened in the third quarter of 2023, Qualcomm could be entering a new phase of growth.', ""The company's fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 (the three months ended in September 2023) revenue was $8.6 billion. The outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, which ended in December 2023, is for revenue of $9.1 billion to $9.9 billion. That outlook leaves open the possibility for year-over-year growth since Q1 revenue the year prior was $9.46 billion."", ""During the brutal smartphone and consumer electronics downturn, Qualcomm held up quite well. It remained highly profitable by all measures. In fact, Qualcomm's free cash flow has already returned to all-time highs, an effect I explained early last year driven by its elevated inventory of chips starting to get sold and converted into cash."", ""With a business recovery still in the early innings, Qualcomm's profit margins could rebound in grandiose fashion in 2024 if sales even just modestly increase. Along the way, the company has ample cash flow to fund research and development of new products (like its upcoming Snapdragon X Elite attacking the laptop market), service debt, pay its dividend (currently yielding 2.3% a year), and repurchase stock ($2.97 billion's worth last year, or about 2% of the current market cap)."", ""Qualcomm stock trades for about 15 to 16 times Wall Street analysts' consensus estimate for 2024 free cash flow. With an uptick expected in Qualcomm's smartphone and 5G bread and butter, this looks like a reasonable value. This is why I recently added to my position, and I am happy to continue holding Qualcomm as a core semiconductor stock for 2024 and beyond."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Qualcomm right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Qualcomm, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Qualcomm wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years."", 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

The company issued a warning that its revenue for the quarter ended in December 2023 will be even worse than previously expected.', 'This news comes hot on the heels of a similar warning from self-driving car and driver-assist chip designer Mobileye (NASDAQ: MBLY), which said a glut of inventory at the start of the new year will sharply reduce its sales.', 'Microchip is a far more diversified company, though, with end-market spanning data centers to cars, healthcare devices to manufacturing. Did Microchip just signal tough times for the economy in 2024?', 'This new current downturn for automotive and industrial chip demand has now been well-broadcast since autumn 2023. Industry giants from Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) to Analog Devices (NASDAQ: ADI) have signaled the weakening environment as their customers deal with an excess of inventory.', 'To be clear, this is a normal cyclical process for semiconductor suppliers. Customers, many of which are hypersensitive to even small changes in economic growth, tend to overpurchase in good times and later cut spending at the first sign of trouble (whether trouble ultimately comes or not).', 'At any rate, the current downcycle for chip demand is deepening. Even Microchip, which has picked up ample market share of its targeted markets in recent years with its focus on chip design and accompanying software (software tends to be far less cyclical than hardware sales), is now feeling the pinch.', 'Previously, Microchip had forecasted its third-quarter fiscal 2024 (which just ended in December 2023) revenue to decline 17.5% from the previous quarter, and 14.5% year over year, to $1.86 billion at the midpoint of guidance.', 'In its most recent update, though, Microchip now expects revenue to be down 22% from the prior quarter, implying revenue will be roughly $1.76 billion -- about $100 million less than before. Ouch!', 'In a prepared statement, Microchip CEO Ganesh Moorthy attributed the revenue miss to the following effect: ""The weakening economic environment that our customers and distributors faced during the December 2023 quarter resulted in many of them wanting to receive a lower level of shipments as they took actions to further de-risk their inventory positions.""', 'That talk of ""a weakening economic environment"" certainly sounds like a bad omen. But bear in mind that this was already broadcast months ago. Industrial, manufacturing, and automotive companies began to feel the impact of higher interest rates in the second half of 2023. It takes time for the effects of hardware and component ordering -- a reduction of which is an action to conserve cash -- to trickle down to a supplier like Microchip.', 'In other words, a drop in quarterly sales is typically a lagging indicator of economic health, not necessarily an indicator of the future.', 'It will now be important to tune into the earnings calls of Microchip and its peers to see what kind of indication they give about a potential bottom of this semiconductor cycle. Previously, the indication was that excess inventories at industrial customers would be resolved by the middle of 2024.', 'This seems to be about a one-year lag behind the previous downturn in smartphone and PC sales, although that downturn ended up lasting a couple quarters longer than originally expected (excess consumer electronic inventories were cleared the second half of 2023, not by the first half).', 'However, counterintuitively, the time to buy semiconductor stocks is in the midst of a cyclical downturn for sales, not after sales have already returned to growth. Look no further than those chip stocks tied closely to PC and smartphone sales in 2023 -- like Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), and Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU). Long before they started indicating a healthier level of customer chip inventory and a return of growth, their stocks rallied in grand fashion.', ""Something similar is likely in store for Microchip -- which explains why the market has minimally penalized its share price despite management being very clear business is going to take a hit. All indications point to Microchip's cyclical downturn being temporary. It will eventually return to growth. And along the way, Microchip has demonstrated an exceptional ability to remain highly profitable."", 'Like I did with stocks like Qualcomm and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) during their downturns over a year ago, I believe the time to buy a stock like Microchip is now. I plan on adding to my position early this year, despite headlines indicating the economy is getting off to a rocky start in 2024.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Microchip Technology right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Microchip Technology, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Microchip Technology wasn't one of them.

If you want to read about some more narrow moat stocks, go directly to 5 Narrow Moat Stocks Hedge Funds Are Buying.', 'Investors who are new to the stock market often get confused by the term moat. This is because moat is not easily defined and cannot be quantified based on numbers alone. Looking a little deeper into the origins of the word for better understanding, it seems that the term came into wider use in the finance world through Warren Buffett, the legendary value investor who is worth more than $118 billion. Buffett, famous for shrewd investments in the value space, used it to define companies that have sustainable competitive advantages over peers in the marketplace.\xa0', 'Although Buffett likes to invest in companies with wide moats, as he calls them, the term moat has been modified in recent years to also include companies with narrow moats. The distinction between wide and narrow moats is interesting. Companies with wide moats provide goods or services that are similar to those offered by competitors, but widely outperform their peers in terms of profits. Not only are these firms ahead in terms of profits, but they can also protect these and their market share in the long-term.\xa0', 'In contrast, the companies with narrow moats are somewhat similar to those with wide moats in that they outperform peers in terms of profits, but their outperformance is usually understood to be not long-term or is even time-limited in some cases. Some examples of companies with narrow moats that hedge funds are buying include DoorDash, Inc. (NYSE:DASH), Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE), and The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK), among others discussed in detail below.\xa0', 'It is important to clarify that companies with narrow moats often operate in economic sectors that have tight margins, license protection, and low barriers to entry. These factors make the competitive advantage they gain over peers all the more impressive given the constraints under which these firms usually operate. The business acumen of firms with narrow moats is better understood in context of the third quarter earnings call of DoorDash, Inc. (NYSE:DASH), a logistics platform that connects merchants with consumers.\xa0', 'Tony Xu, the CEO of DoorDash, Inc. (NYSE:DASH), in response to a question by Barclays analyst Ross Sandler during the third quarter earnings call, said that the company had a long-term strategy in place to grow internationally by working in partnership with businesses that had world-class retention and order frequency. The CEO underlined that the firm also looked to invest, in a concentrated manner, only in businesses that had excellent execution, allowing growth at multiple levels and geographies.\xa0', ""“I mean you're absolutely right. We are very excited about our execution on the international front. We continue to grow at multiples of what we see around the world, virtually across any geography. That doesn't mean that we are pleased yet with where our product is."", ""We still have a lot of room left to go. But I think it does stem from why our outperformance has occurred, which is I think the hallmarks at any great marketplace have the fundamental characteristics of great retention order frequency and unit economics. And I think when you look at our international business or our new categories business or a restaurant business, you see all of these characteristics present. And that's why we've been very interested in leaning in and making the investments that we have at size, at scale, because of what we see."", ""And the international business continues to see those points of execution. I think if we remind ourselves even a couple of years ago of the investment thesis behind our partnership with Wolt, it really centered on two big pieces. One of which was here is a business that has leading world-class retention and order frequency, and the question is, can we invest behind that in a concentrated way and hopefully add to the excellent execution that they've already seen. And so far, the answer has been yes to that.”"", 'Our Methodology', 'The companies that have short-term advantages over competitors were identified using manual research and Reddit threads. The top ones were then ranked according to hedge fund sentiment. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2023 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

(NYSE:LYV) shares. Those holdings were previously attributed to Liberty SiriusXM and reattributed to a the newly created Liberty Live Group vehicle to reduce the complexity of the Liberty SiriusXM structure and make way for its potential combination with the underlying SiriusXM business. We believe the separation created some selling pressure on Liberty Live, creating an attractive discount of over 40% to the underlying value of its Live Nation holdings, and we took advantage of that discount to build a position. The Liberty Live Group is a small-cap vehicle through which we can own the underlying Live Nation business, which we have tracked and liked for years. Live Nation has significant competitive advantages in the live entertainment industry due to its unique combination of concert promotion, ticketing, venue management, and sponsorship businesses, which create a market share flywheel and margin structure that is difficult for competitors in any one of these underlying sub-segments to replicate independently. In addition to the upside we see in Live Nation, we think Liberty Live Group could eventually transition from a tracking stock to an asset-backed vehicle, which would pave the way for a structure consolidation with Live Nation and allow us to capture the current wide NAV discount.”', 'Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', 'Tapestry, Inc.

What is the Federal Reserve’s thinking on the timing of rate cuts? Is the consumer out of gas? ', 'You can add your own questions, but you get the idea. This is still a market that offers more questions than answers. ', 'With that said, you also can expect some surprises. At this time last year, nobody was talking about the growth of artificial intelligence (AI). Now, companies are referencing AI in their earnings reports as never before. ', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'And add to all of that, it’s an election year. ', 'Investors hate uncertainty and there’s enough to keep them out of the market. But objectively speaking, the market had a great year in 2023 despite all the headwinds it faced. The difference between now and other years is that you have to really focus your efforts on the stocks that are growing earnings. ', 'Fortunately, there are stocks to be found in many sectors. While dominate is a strong word, there are several\xa0reasons to believe these companies will be among the top stocks for 2024. ', 'Source: Sergio Photone / Shutterstock.com', 'You’ll forgive me for starting off this list of top stocks for 2024 with an obvious choice, but Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) still merits your consideration. The company saw explosive growth as demand for its AI chips outpaced the company’s ability to make them.', 'That’s not something to completely dismiss. Plus, as Luke Lango wrote recently, many companies are now looking for custom AI chips to support custom applications. That opens the door for other chip makers. Investors will be watching to see how soon those chips are available.', 'Nevertheless, Nvidia still projects earnings growth of more than 65% in the next 12 months. That easily covers a lofty price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 43.', 'That doesn’t mean I’m suggesting investors will get a 240% return on their investment as they did in 2023. But there is still more growth to be found in NVDA stock. This will be particularly true if the company experiences growth in its PC market. ', 'Source: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com', 'Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is the market share leader in dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) chips. These are the kind of chips that will be critical for AI applications which are memory hogs. This will be particularly true as companies create custom AI applications. ', 'To that end, Micron launched its HBM3E memory-chip module in late 2023. The company will begin producing the chips at scale early this year and is forecasting millions of dollars in revenue during this fiscal year. ', 'As one of the top stocks for 2024, Micron is not without its detractors. Whereas a company like Nvidia gets the benefit of the doubt despite expectations for slowing growth, some analysts are viewing those revenue projections a bit more skeptically. The company does face competition that is eating away at its market share. And macroeconomic uncertainty may affect the company’s growth prospects. ', 'Investors have to wait until the end of March for Micron’s earnings report. In the meantime, you can look at the analysts’ forecast for 15% growth in MU stock over the next 12 months.

Investors were treated to all-time highs in 2021 and 2022 spurred by demand for its COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutics. But 2023 was a different story. PFE stock is down more than 40% in the last 12 months and is trading at levels not seen since 2016. ', 'But before you dismiss Pfizer, you should at least understand the bullish case, which has nothing to do with its COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines. ', 'The company has 13 drug candidates in Phase 3 clinical trials. That will go a long way to replacing declining revenue and earnings as sales of its COVID-19 products normalize. In fact, the company expects to see $20 billion in growth from its own pipeline by 2030. ', 'The company’s full-year earnings forecast for 2024 came in at $2.24 on the high end. That’s lower than the $2.31 that analysts expected, but it still would be a 49% gain in the next 12 months. With a stock that’s trading at 19x earnings, that kind of growth is not priced into the stock. ', 'Analysts see high single-digit growth for PFE stock in 2024.

As it turns out, if you can stomach what may be a short-term correction, this is a stock that could be in for significant gains later in 2024. ', 'A lot of the interest in MTCH stock has to do with Tinder, it’s most recognizable name and a favorite among Gen-Z users. However, my thesis for Match Group hinges (pun intended) on Hinge – one of the dating app brands owned by Match. The company is leaning into AI in an effort to improve on its aim to be the app that was “designed to be deleted.” ', 'In the company’s most recent earnings report, the company projects 14% earnings growth in the next 12 months and analysts have a consensus upside of 14% for MTCH stock. It was reported that usage levels for Hinge were at an all-time high. It’s now the most downloaded dating app in the U.K and Australia and is in the top three within the United States. All of which supports the company’s goal to reach $400 million in annual revenue.

The company owns long-term acute care, inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, occupational health, and physical therapy clinics. ', 'SEM stock is known for being a dividend payer, but it may have some opportunity for explosive growth in 2024. This may be a case of the market overlooking the company’s solid earnings growth in 2023. In the first three quarters, earnings are up 61% year-over-year. And the company expects earnings growth of 18% in the next 12 months.', 'Still, as of this writing, the stock is basically flat for the last 12 months. But it’s up 9% in the last month and analysts see a 23% upside for SEM stock. Despite that surge, SEM stock still trades at an appealing 11x forward earnings. Investors looking for a momentum stock to buy should pay close attention as the company moves closer to earnings in February. ', 'Source: Cassiohabib / Shutterstock.com', 'Another way to find the top stocks for 2024 is to look at stocks that are trading at a historically low P/E ratio. That’s the case with the next two stocks. The first is Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) which continues to be a solid performer as demand for travel continues unabated.', 'You shouldn’t expect Delta to deliver 280% earnings growth as it has in the first three quarters of 2023. But the company is still forecasting over 9% growth in the next 12 months. Yet, despite that strong growth the stock is “only” up about 13.5% in the last 12 months. ', 'Some of that is due to expectations for higher jet fuel costs that never materialized. And that could become an issue if the Federal Reserve begins cutting rates earlier than expected. ', 'But that’s a problem for another day. Right now, investors should look at a forecast for growth that includes a reinstated dividend that has plenty of room to grow in the coming years. ', 'Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com', 'While we’re on the subject of a potential rise in oil prices, another one of the top stocks for 2024 is likely to be Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN). Like many oil and gas stocks, DVN stock is down 20% in the last year as crude oil prices fell below $70 a barrel. ', 'Those prices look to be stabilizing as does the price of natural gas. That should allow investors to focus on a company like Devon Energy that continues to increase its reserves. ', 'And if the Federal Reserve cuts rates as is widely expected at some point this year, oil prices are likely to go much higher. The thesis is simple. If the Fed cuts rates, it will because the economy is slowing dramatically, or they are expecting it to do so. Given the Fed’s track record, we’ll say they’ll be late rather than early. ', 'This will be bullish for DVN stock. Renewable energy is here to stay. But getting a trillion-dollar jump started will require a lot of King Oil. And we will continue to need oil for decades to come. So, with Devon Energy projecting nearly 10% earnings growth in the next 12 months, it’s a good time to consider adding DVN stock to your portfolio.

While the company isn’t likely to pull that kind of growth in 2024, there are still catalysts that are likely to make DKNG stock one of the top stocks for 2024.', 'Consider that 38 states currently allow sports betting in some fashion. And out of those 38 states, 26 allow sports betting via smartphone apps or websites. In 2024, there are at least two states, Maine and Vermont, that plan to launch sports betting at some point. ', 'It’s hard to predict when other states will legalize sports betting. But it’s safe to say that the company has done the heavy lifting. And with revenue clearly growing, the company is showing that there are good profit margins in sports betting. ', 'The company is not profitable yet on an EBITDA basis and it’s not expected to be for at least the next 12 months. But analysts don’t appear to be too concerned about that. The consensus price target for DKNG stock is $40.31 which is 22% higher than the closing price on January 4, 2023. ', 'Source: NYC Russ / Shutterstock.com', 'Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) is one of the world’s largest online travel agencies. And despite tough comparisons with 2022, the company has beaten revenue and earnings expectations in the first three quarters of the year. And there’s every expectation that trend will continue when the company reports earnings in early February. ', 'However, EXPE stock is up 59% in the last 12 months and at least two institutional investors sold a significant amount of the company’s stock in the third quarter. That may explain, in part, why the stock has started off the trading year down around 4%. ', 'That’s a nice pullback, and investors may even see the stock go lower. That’s okay because this is one stock you’ll want to play the long game with. Consumers are voting with their wallets. And the winners of their discretionary dollars are travel and experiences. That’s Expedia’s wheelhouse and why it’s fair to presume that the company’s projection for 34% earnings growth in the next 12 months is likely. ', 'If it is, analysts will quickly bid the stock higher. That’s why you can use any pullback as a reason to buy EXPE stock.', 'Source: Deutschlandreform / Shutterstock.com', 'Many investors have profited by investing in McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) stock. The company is a dividend aristocrat that continually delivers a solid total return. But at over $180 a share, investors may be looking for a less expensive, yet still profitable alternative. ', 'I offer up Wendy’s (NASDAQ:WEN) for your consideration. Like many companies on this list of top stocks for 2024, Wendy’s has been posting solid top and bottom line growth in the face of difficult comparisons to 2022. ', 'Despite that, WEN stock is down 16.8% in the last 12 months as investors have largely steered clear of what is seen as a discretionary stock. But it may be time to take a closer look. The company is projecting 12% earnings growth and pays a dividend with a yield of over 5%. Analysts have a consensus price target which gives the stock 15% growth in the next year.

But let's talk about Goodyear sight. This is something that you introduced a few years ago."", 'RICH KRAMER: Correct.', 'AKIKO FUJITA: Intelligent tires. How does it work?', ""RICH KRAMER: So-- excuse me. And by the way, thanks for having us. And it's great to be here. Great to have you at our booth here today. So, intelligent tires are really about taking all the information that we can get out of that tire, and bring it into the vehicle driving systems.

We're taking that same thing and creating a software-defined tire, if you will."", ""And what we do by getting the tire characteristics and the road characteristics, using some proprietary data we have around the tires, using sensors, and using sensors to take road conditions, we're able to amalgamate that information and measure both tire-- excuse me, the temperature and pressure of a tire, but also wear and load, and ultimately, friction, or in other words, what's happening at the base of the road and the tire, taking all that information and bringing it back to vehicle driving systems to improve the safety and performance of those vehicles. Essentially, make them safer and have them perform better on whatever use case they're in."", ""AKIKO FUJITA: So we're talking about communication between the tire itself, the system in there and the car."", 'RICH KRAMER: Exactly.', 'AKIKO FUJITA: When you talk about safety, specifically, what are we talking about? Is it about the tire pressure that you mentioned, is it about letting the vehicle know about the road conditions so they know to stop earlier?', ""RICH KRAMER: Well, exactly. And maybe one of the best demonstrations of that is one of the things we announced was work that we're doing with TNO into their ABS brake systems. And what we've demonstrated in there, by providing that tire intelligence into those ABS braking systems, we can actually show the vehicle stopping at around 6 feet more than it otherwise would. And that's, really, because as you said, bringing that information, that real-time information into those vehicle driving systems."", ""So for instance, if the tire is worn, if it's overloaded, if it's underinflated, and it's on a wet road, we can assess that real time, and then bring that into the vehicle driving systems to make that vehicle stop or perform more optimally than if those systems sought-- thought that the tire was actually brand new."", ""AKIKO FUJITA: So we've got you-- right behind you, this truck, yeah?

It's probably the best example that we have. Because when there is a driver, obviously, the driver can compensate for some of those conditions. But when there is no driver, as you mentioned in Gatik, we can actually take that-- we take that information and actually advise directly those driving systems. So it does everything I mentioned earlier."", ""But, what's even more important for a company like Gatik, as they expand their business, we can improve their cost per mile. We can improve their uptime as they do those deliveries. And what intelligence can do for them-- intelligent tire can do for them, is increase their use cases. So not only can they operate in a sunny environment with dry pavement, but they can also operate now where the roads may be wet, where the roads may be icy, where there's snow on the roads."", ""And again, with no driver in the vehicle, the most important element that they're getting is what's happening on the road to advise those driving systems. That's what we can do for them. So it's a win-win for them in terms of their business model, in terms of safety, and in terms of their expansion.""]"

Rather than sifting through tons of dirt and carefully cataloguing human artifacts, Eske Willerslev and his colleagues have used Illumina NovaSeq Systems to sequence 5000 ancient human genomes, revealing previously unseen historical nuance. This research tour de force, which is being published this month in four papers in the journal Nature, offers a rich view of early human migrations, mating habits, and disease variants, and their impact on modern Europeans.', '""We wanted to sequence this ancient DNA so we could better understand human history,"" says Willerslev, who is professor and director at the Centre of Excellence in GeoGenetics at the University of Copenhagen and the Prince Philip Professor of Ecology & Evolution at Cambridge University. ""These results describe where we came from and why there\'s so much variation in disease risk.""', ""The team brought together dozens of specialists, including molecular biologists, historians, archaeologists, and many others. This is the first time anyone has analyzed this many ancient DNA samples-it's a massive effort, especially when compared to sequencing modern genomes, since much of the DNA has degraded and what remains are extremely short fragments. In addition to the human genomes, the team also sequenced ancient pathogens, plants, and animals."", ""The group compared these results to those catalogued in the UK Biobank, which recently surpassed the milestone of having sequenced and analyzed 500,000 whole human genomes-an impressively large cohort, and a modern answer to Willerslev's ancient cohort. Comparing data helped them pinpoint where specific European populations originated and why those groups have higher susceptibility to some diseases."", 'Mass migrations The 5000 sequences represent three important groups: ancient hunter-gatherers; farmers, who emigrated from the Middle East around 10,000 years ago, and the Yamnaya, who originated in western Asia and moved toward northern Europe around 5000 years ago. These three groups are the ancestors of most modern Europeans.', 'Today, most eastern Europeans are descended from hunter-gatherers, while people in southern Europe mostly come from early farmers. The Yamnaya heavily influenced northern and northwestern Europe.', '""The data showed us there is a great genetic divide between eastern and western Europeans,"" says Willerslev. ""The divide started around 10,000 to 12,000 years ago and is reflected in our genetics even today.""', 'A bloody history These massive waves of immigration came at a cost. When the farmers came north, into what is now Germany and Denmark, they completely displaced the hunter-gatherers in two generations. According to the genetic record, there was little to no interbreeding-the hunter-gatherers were simply wiped out. The same pattern happened when the Yamnaya came about 5000 years later.', '""We have data on what must have been one of the last hunter-gatherers, who was living on an island,"" says Willerslev. ""You can imagine the forces that pushed him onto that island. He must have been quite scared.""', ""A stew of disease risk This genomic data also allowed researchers to model how these three migrations influenced Europeans' disease risks and other traits."", '""We paired UK Biobank data with the findings from these historical samples, and it told us a lot,"" Willerslev explains. ""Background for height is a Bronze Age [Yamnaya] trait, which makes a lot of sense, since northern Europeans are generally taller than other Europeans.""', 'The team also found that the farmers from southern Europe were genetically prone to mood-related disorders. Hunter-gatherers had gene variants linked to type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer disease. Yamnaya were more susceptible to multiple sclerosis.', '""Multiple sclerosis is a relatively new disease that we find in higher frequency in northern Europeans,"" says Willerslev. ""There\'s been a lot of discussion about this high frequency and where it came from, but we can see from the data that, clearly, it\'s a Yamnaya trait.""', 'The authors caution that this research does not prove the groups had these diseases, only that they had the genetic markers for them. However, those genes have been passed on to more modern Europeans, and their descendants around the world, potentially influencing global health.', '""This data has been of great interest to physicians and others interested in the evolutionary history of disease-causing variants,"" says Willerslev. ""Now we can better understand where these conditions came from, and when.""', 'View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Illumina on 3blmedia.com.', 'Contact Info:Spokesperson: IlluminaWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/illumina Email: info@3blmedia.com', 'SOURCE: Illumina', 'View the original press release on accesswire.com']"

But it's no surprise that many of the most popular stocks investors and Wall Street pros follow are those of successful companies that have a history of delivering superior returns for shareholders, and therefore, occasionally issue stock splits to keep their share prices affordable for individual investors."", 'While AI stocks are getting a lot of attention on Wall Street right now, investors need to be careful about overplaying their hand in one area of the market. There are plenty of analysts still making bullish calls on leading consumer brands that are reporting solid growth and have attractive upside potential in 2024 and beyond.', ""Wall Street pros see more gains in the year ahead for Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH), and Nike (NYSE: NKE) -- three amazing companies that have a history of splitting their shares. Three Motley Fool contributors will explain what is driving these companies' growth and why now is a good time to buy shares."", ""Jennifer Saibil (Amazon): Amazon split its stock in 2022, when the price tag was over $2,000. The move was the first in over 20 years, but the 20-for-1 split reflected the stock price's massive growth over that period. It's returned about 24% since its most recent split."", ""Amazon faced pressure across several segments over the past few years, but it looks like it's emerging in excellent shape. It has maintained a strong lead over competitors in e-commerce and cloud computing, and after a net loss in 2022, net income is rising again. It tripled year over year in the 2023 third quarter. E-commerce is back to strong growth, outpacing overall retail growth. Amazon has also focused on becoming more efficient, restructuring its distribution network and cutting jobs. As inflation eases and people go back to spending, Amazon is well positioned to benefit."", 'Similarly, Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud services division, has seen decelerating sales growth as some customers cut their budgets. Management said there are indications that the trend is reversing, and clients are starting to expand their usage again.', ""Artificial intelligence (AI) could play an outsize role in Amazon's ability to outperform in 2024 and beyond. It recently launched several powerful AI tools for AWS, and it's using AI in e-commerce and its advertising business. Advertising continues to be a strong growth generator, with sales increasing 26% over last year in the 2023 third quarter, as compared with 13% for the whole company."", ""Amazon shares gained 81% in 2023, but they're still 18% below their all-time highs. The consensus analyst estimate is for Amazon stock to rise 17% over the next 12 to 18 months, with a high of 50% and a low of a negative 9% return. If Amazon delivers a strong performance in 2024, there's every chance that it can meet and surpass even the highest estimate."", 'John Ballard (Celsius Holdings): Shares of this energy drink maker have returned over 4,500% over the last five years. The rapid ascent in its stock price caused the company to issue a 3-for-1 stock split in November. This business is just getting started on a long road of massive growth.', ""In Celsius' third-quarter business update, the company credited its 104% year-over-year growth in revenue to increasing availability of its products and brand awareness. This is the result of a long-term deal with PepsiCo to use the beverage giant's extensive distribution network to sell its products -- a major advantage for an up-and-coming consumer goods brand."", ""Analyst Vivien Azer from TD Cowen has set an $83 price target on the stock, representing 41% upside from Celsius' current share price. Azer sees the launch in Canada in the first quarter as another growth opportunity to keep the company's momentum going in the new year."", ""The share trade at a high forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 56, but as Celsius expands beyond the U.S., the added sales volume could significantly boost the company's profits and justify the stock's lofty P/E. Over the next five years, analysts expect Celsius to grow earnings by 55% per year."", ""Identifying top consumer brands while they're small can be a rewarding investment strategy. Celsius looks like an ideal candidate for investors interested in finding these opportunities."", ""Jeremy Bowman (Nike): Few stocks have a stronger track record than Nike. The sportswear giant has dominated its industry for more than a generation, and while it's struggled with the broader headwinds in the apparel sector and discretionary spending recently, the company still looks well positioned for long-term growth."", 'Nike also has a long history of splitting its stock, executing seven 2-for-1 stock splits since its initial public offering in 1980. In other words, if you owned 1 share of the stock back then, you would have 128 today.', ""Nike's last stock split came at the end of 2015, and since then, the shares are up 61%, so it may be premature to expect the company to split its stock again right now."", 'However, Wall Street is optimistic about the company. The average analyst expects Nike shares to gain 19% this year, which makes it the Dow Jones stock that analysts are most bullish on after Disney. Of the 30 analysts covering the stock, 20 rate it a buy, nine call it a hold, and one rates it a sell.', ""There's a good reason why Wall Street is so confident in the Swoosh. Nike stock is trading down 42% from its peak in 2021 due to slow growth and the broader demand headwinds it's facing. However, the company demonstrated its ability to squeeze more profits out of its business. In its most recent quarter, earnings per share jumped 21% to $1.03 even as revenue was up just 1%. It improved gross margin by 170 basis points as the company lowered its inventory by 14%, and it should benefit from that trend in the coming quarters."", ""That, combined with an expected economic recovery and the help of lower interest rates, should push the shares higher this year, even if another stock split doesn't appear imminent."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

I'll make some brief comments about our results and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review fourth-quarter results, as well as our net interest income and expense expectations for 2024, before we take your questions. Let me start with some 2023 financial highlights."", 'Although our improved 2023 results benefited from the strong economic environment and higher interest rates, our continued focus on efficiency and strong credit discipline were important contributors as well. We grew net income and diluted earnings per share with higher revenue and lower expenses. Revenue growth was driven by strong growth in net interest income as well as higher noninterest income. Our expenses were down from a year ago, benefiting from lower operating losses as well as the impact of efficiency initiatives.', 'As expected, net charge-offs increased from historical low levels, and our allowance for credit losses increased as well. We continue to closely monitor our portfolios, taking credit tightening actions as appropriate. We returned a significant amount of capital to our shareholders, including increasing our common stock dividend from $0.30 per share to $0.35 per share in the third quarter, and we repurchased $12 billion of common stock. Average loans increased modestly with growth in the first half of the year, offsetting declines later in the year, reflecting weaker loan demand as well as credit tightening actions.', 'Average deposits were down driven by consumer spending as well as customers migrating to higher-yielding alternatives. The financial health of our consumers remained strong. While average deposit balances per customer continue to decline from their peak, they remained above pre-pandemic levels as wage growth has more than offset increased spending. Having said that, there are cohorts of customers that are more stressed.', 'Consumer spending remained strong. Credit card spend was up 15% for the year and was remarkably stable throughout the year with growth rates strong across all categories, except fuel, which was impacted by lower gas prices. Debit card spending was up 1% for the year. Discretionary spend growth slowed from a year ago while non-discretionary spend was stable.', 'Our risk and control work remains our top priority, and I refer you to the comments I made last quarter regarding both our progress in completing the work as well as the risks that remain. We continue to execute on our strategic priorities. And while it is early and we have more to do, we are starting to see improved growth and increased market share in parts of the company which we believe will drive higher returns over time. Let me provide just a few examples.', ""Our new credit card products have driven an increase in consumer spend at a rate significantly better than the industry average. We've also been investing in the corporate investment bank. CIB revenue grew 26% from a year ago, and our investment banking and trading market shares increased. The positive results in both areas were accomplished while maintaining our existing risk appetite."", ""Additionally, continued execution of our more focused home lending strategy should also produce higher returns and earnings over the next several years. And while our consumer, small and business banking, commercial banking, and wealth and investment management business remains strong, opportunities to increase share are significant. Other accomplishments include we launched a new co-branded credit cards with Choice Hotels, building on the new products we've launched over the last couple of years. We continued to enhance our mobile app, which is driving mobile adoption momentum, adding 1.6 million mobile active customers in 2023 and increasing mobile logins 11% from a year ago."", 'Consumers interacted over 20 million times last year with Fargo, our AI-powered virtual assistant. We exceeded our $150 million commitment to help advance racial equity in home ownership. Our special purpose credit program lowered mortgage rates and reduced financing costs to help thousands of customers. For commercial clients, we continued to invest in order to have the right people and the right capabilities to better penetrate our customer base.', ""We continue to attract experienced bankers to our investment bank, helping us drive growth in priority products and sectors. Throughout 2023, we added new heads and co-heads of equity capital markets, global mergers and acquisitions, financial institutions, financial sponsors, healthcare, and technology, media, and telecom. We've also started to see the benefit of the targeted investments we are making in our trading capabilities, including adding talent and improved technology with a focus on supporting our core clients. Finally, we're launching a partnership with Centerbridge, which helps us provide our middle market clients with access to alternative sources of capital, another example of how we're providing solutions for our clients."", 'Investing in our business and introducing new products and services remains a priority in 2024, and Mike will highlight some of the opportunities later on the call. In 2023, we also continued to take a closer look at the businesses that were not in sync with our strategic priorities. As I mentioned, we simplified the home lending business, which included exiting the correspondent business. We are reducing the size of our servicing portfolio as well as optimizing our retail team to align with our narrower customer focus.', 'In the third quarter, we sold private equity investments in certain Norwest Equity Partners and Norwest Mezzanine Partners funds. We also continue to invest in the communities we serve throughout the year, and you can see many examples at the beginning of our slide presentation. As we look forward, our business performance remains sensitive to interest rates and the health of the U.S. economy but we are confident that the actions we are taking will drive stronger results over the cycle.', ""We are closely monitoring credit, and while we've seen modest deterioration, it remains consistent with our expectations. Our capital position remains strong, and returning excess capital to shareholders remains a priority. Mike will talk more about our expectations for 2024, but I'd like to make a couple of points. First, we have seen and have said that we expect net interest income to decline from the high levels we saw as rates were rising last year."", 'And given that we remain modestly asset-sensitive, the implied Fed rate path reflected in recent forward curves impacts our outlook for NII. Significant uncertainty exists regarding eventual timing and extent of Federal Reserve interest rate actions. Mike will give you our expectations for net interest income, but please recognize that it is based upon a series of market assumptions, which may be right or may be wrong. We hope the overview of our assumptions is helpful.', ""Second, we remain focused on tightly controlling our expenses, but there are several moving pieces, which Mike will walk you through. We will continue to invest what's necessary for our risk and control work. We continue to realize expense efficiencies. And at this point, we are planning to increase our investment spending to create better growth and higher returns in future."", 'Our expected efficiencies roughly offset our planned increase in additional spend at this point. Decisions on how much to invest are dynamic. We closely monitor the outcomes of our investments, and we will adjust our plans based on the success we see. We are focused on our shorter-term results but remain committed to building a well-managed, faster-growing, and higher return company over the medium and longer term.', ""I have said and I remain excited about the opportunities to increase our share and returns across all of our businesses. We believe the actions we have taken and continue to take, provide the path to 50% ROTCE. I want to conclude by thanking our employees for their dedication, talent, and all they do to move our company forward. I'm excited about Wells Fargo's future and all that we will accomplish in the year ahead."", 'Mike, over to you.', 'Mike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Thank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. The first couple of slides summarize how we helped our customers and communities last year, some of which Charlie highlighted, so I'm going to start with our fourth quarter financial results on Slide 4. Net income for the fourth quarter was 3.4 billion, or $0.86 per diluted common share. Our fourth quarter results included 1.9 billion or $0.40 per share for the FDIC special assessment, and 1.1 billion of severance expense, including 969 million or $0.20 per share for planned actions."", 'These expenses were partially offset by 621 million or $0.17 per share of discrete tax benefits related to the resolution of prior-period tax matters. Turning to capital and liquidity on Slide 5. Our CET1 ratio increased to 11.4% in the fourth quarter, 2.5 percentage points above our regulatory minimum plus buffers. This increase was driven by our earnings and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income, reflecting lower interest rates and tighter mortgage-backed security spreads.', 'During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.4 billion in common stock. We repurchased a total of 12 billion in common stock in 2023, and we currently expect to be able to repurchase more than this amount in 2024. We will continue to consider current market conditions, including interest rate movements, risk-weighted asset levels, stress test results, as well as any potential economic uncertainty with respect to the amount and timing of share repurchases over the coming quarters. Turning to credit quality on Slide 7.', 'As expected, net loan charge-offs increased, up 17 basis points from the third quarter to 53 basis points of average loans, driven by commercial real estate office and credit card loans. The increase in commercial net loan charge-offs reflected the higher losses in commercial real estate office, while losses in the rest of our commercial portfolio were stable from the third quarter. As expected, losses started to materialize in our commercial real estate office portfolio as market fundamentals remained weak. The losses were across a number of loans spread across various markets and were driven by borrower performance, lower appraisals where the result of properties or loans being sold at a loss.', ""We substantially built reserves for this portfolio throughout 2023 as criticized and nonperforming assets increased. And while we expect additional losses in the coming quarters given the market fundamentals and capital markets and liquidity challenges in this sector, the amounts will likely going to be uneven and episodic. Our commercial real estate team has a rigorous monitoring process and continues to derisk and reduce exposure, and we're using this information to evaluate our allowance, which I will discuss later. Consumer net loan charge-offs continued to increase and were up 118 million from the third quarter to 79 basis points of average loans."", 'The increase was driven by the credit card portfolio, which performed as expected with increased losses driven by recent vintages maturing. Nonperforming assets increased 3% from the third quarter as growth in commercial nonaccrual loans more than offset declines in consumer. The increase in commercial real estate non-accrual loans was driven by a 567 million increase in office non-accrual loans. Moving to Slide 8.', 'Our allowance for credit losses increased slightly in the fourth quarter, driven by an increase for credit card and commercial real estate loans, partially offset by a lower allowance for auto loans. The table on the page shows the allowance for credit losses coverage ratio for commercial real estate, including the breakdown of the office portfolio. While the charge offs we took in the fourth quarter were contemplated in our allowance, we are still early in the cycle and after going through our quarterly review process, the coverage ratio in our CIB commercial real estate office portfolio remained relatively stable at 11%. On Slide 9, we highlight loans and deposits.', ""Average loans were down from both the third quarter and a year ago. Credit card loans continued to grow, while most other categories declined. I'll highlight specific drivers when discussing our operating segment results. Average loan yields increased 122 basis points from a year ago and 12 basis points from the third quarter, reflecting the higher interest rate environment."", 'Average deposits declined 3% from a year ago as growth in corporate and investment banking was more than offset by declines in our other deposit gathering businesses, reflecting continued consumer spending and customers reallocating cash into higher yielding alternatives. Period-end deposits included in the chart on the bottom of the page were up 4.2 billion from the third quarter as declines in consumer banking and lending were offset by slightly higher deposits in wealth and investment management for the first time in over a year, as well as higher commercial deposits, which included our efforts to attract clients operational deposits. As expected, our average deposit costs continued to increase up 22 basis points from the third quarter to 158 basis points with higher deposit costs across all operating segments. The pace of the increase was similar to the third quarter.', ""Our mix of deposits continued to shift with our percentage of non-interest bearing deposits declining to 27%. Turning to net interest income on Slide 10. Fourth-quarter net interest income declined 662 million or 5% from a year ago due to lower deposit loan balances partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates. I'll provide details on our 2024 net interest income expectations later on the call."", 'Turning to expenses on Slide 11. While our fourth-quarter non-interest expense included the FDIC special assessment and 1.1 billion of severance expense, including 969 million for planned actions, expenses declined from a year ago driven by lower operating losses. While most of the planned actions should result in lower headcount, some of the actions are related to our workforce location strategy, which should lower occupancy costs and provide other benefits but may not always reduce headcount. Total expenses increased from the third quarter, driven by the FDIC special assessment and higher severance expense.', ""Personnel expense increased 554 million from the third quarter as higher severance expense was partially offset by lower benefits and incentive compensation expense, including certain year-end adjustments, as well as the impact of efficiency initiatives, including lower headcount. Turning to our operating segment, starting with consumer banking and lending on Slide 12. Consumer, small, and business banking revenue increased 1% from a year ago, driven by higher net interest income, reflecting higher interest rates partially offset by lower deposit balances. We've been focusing on controlling expenses and lowering the cost to serve our customers, which includes driving digital adoption, simplifying our product portfolio, and using technology to automate our operating environment."", ""As our customers continue to shift to lower cost channels resulting in fewer teller transactions and handled call volumes, we've reduced our total number of branches by over 280 or 6% from a year ago. At the same time, we have been refurbishing our branches as part of an accelerated multiyear effort to transform and refresh our full branch network. I'll highlight other ways we are investing to improve the customer experience later on the call. Home lending revenue increased 7% from a year ago."", 'Lower gain on sale margins and originations, as well as lower loan balances were more than offset by improved valuations on loans held for sale due to losses in the fourth quarter of 2022. We continued to reduce headcount home lending in the fourth quarter, down 36% from a year ago, reflecting market conditions as well as our new strategy. Credit card revenue declined 1% from a year ago, driven by the impact of introductory promotional rates and higher rewards expense, partially offset by higher loan balances and interchange revenue. Payment rates have been relatively stable over the past year and remained above pre-pandemic levels.', 'New account growth continued to be strong, up 17% from a year ago. Auto revenue declined 19% from a year ago, driven by lower loan balances and continued loan spread compression. And personal lending revenue was up 13% from a year ago due to higher loan balances. Turning to some key business drivers on Slide 13.', ""Mortgage originations declined 69% from a year ago and 30% from the third quarter, reflecting the progress we made on our strategic objectives for this business as well as the decline in the mortgage market. As we executed on our strategic objectives, we've also made significant progress on reducing the amount of third-party loans serviced, down 18% from a year ago. The size of our auto portfolio has declined for seven consecutive quarters, and balances were down 11% at the end of the fourth quarter compared to a year ago. Origination volume declined 34% year over year, reflecting credit tightening actions."", 'Debit card spend increased 2% from a year ago, with both discretionary and non-discretionary spend up 2%, with growth in most categories except for home improvement, fuel, and travel. Credit card spending continued to be strong was up 15% from a year ago. All categories grew with double-digit growth rates in every category except fuel, home improvement, and [Inaudible] apparel. Turning to commercial banking results on Slide 14.', 'Middle market banking revenue increased 6% from a year ago, driven by the impact of higher interest rates and higher deposit related fees, reflecting lower earnings credit rates. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue increased 9% year over year due to the impact of higher interest rates and improved results on equity investments. Average loan balances were up 2% from a year ago, driven by growth in asset-based lending and leasing. Turning to corporate and investment banking on Slide 15.', ""Banking revenue increased 15% from a year ago, driven by higher lending revenue, higher investment banking revenue due to increased activity across all products, and stronger treasury management results. As Charlie highlighted, we've successfully hired experienced bankers, which is helping us deliver for our clients and positioning us well for when markets improve. Commercial real estate revenue grew 2% from a year ago, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates, partially offset by lower loan and deposit balances. Markets revenue increased 33% from a year ago, driven by higher revenue and structured products, equities, credit products, and commodities."", 'Average loans were down 3% from a year ago with growth in markets more than offset by declines in banking and commercial real estate. On Slide 16, wealth and investment management revenue declined 1% compared to a year ago, reflecting lower net interest income, driven by lower deposit balances as customers continued to reallocate cash into higher yielding alternatives. The decline in net interest income from a year ago was partially offset by higher asset-based fees due to increased market valuations. As a reminder, the majority of WIM advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so fourth-quarter results reflected market valuations as of October 1st, which were higher from a year ago, asset-based fees in the first quarter will reflect valuations as of January 1st, which were also higher from a year ago.', 'Average loans were down 3% from a year ago, driven by decline in securities based lending. Slide 17 highlights our corporate results. Revenue declined 345 million from a year ago, reflecting higher deposit crediting rates paid to the operating segments. This decline was partially offset by improved results in our affiliated venture capital business on lower impairments.', 'Turning to our expectations for 2024 starting on Slide 18. Let me start by highlighting our expectations for net interest income. As we look forward, there are a number of factors that could impact our results, including the ultimate path of rates, the shape of the yield curve, quantitative tightening and fiscal deficits, consumer behavior, and competitive behavior to name just a few, all of which we have little to no control over. This makes it particularly difficult to estimate net interest income for 2024.', ""There is more uncertainty than usual given the market's strong view of rate cut timing in the quantum. Looking at our results, while we had strong growth in full-year net interest income in 2023 versus 2022, our net interest income came down modestly each quarter last year, driven by the higher deposit pricing and mixed changes. You can see this impact when you analyze our fourth-quarter net interest income, which was down approximately 3% from our full-year 2023 net interest income of 52.4 billion. Our current expectation is that full year 2024 net interest income could potentially be approximately 7% to 9% lower than our full year 2023."", ""This expectation is anchored on the forward rate curve and a series of business assumptions including: lower rates in the recent forward rate curve, which given our modestly asset sensitive position would be a headwind to net interest income; a slight decline in average loans for the full year, which includes modest growth in commercial and credit card loans in the second half of the year after a slow start to the year; reinvestment of lower yielding securities runoff into higher yielding assets, which would also modestly extend the duration of the investment portfolio; further attrition in consumer banking and lending deposits, as well as continued mix shift from lower yielding products to higher yielding; deposits in our other deposit gathering businesses are expected to be relatively stable, and market funding will replace the decline in consumer deposits as needed. We currently expect that net interest income will trough toward the end of this year. As we've done in prior years, we are also assuming the asset cap will remain in place throughout the year. Ultimately, the amount of net interest income we earn in 2024 will depend on a variety of factors, which many of which are uncertain, including the absolute level of rates, the shape of the yield curve, deposit balances, mix and pricing, and loan demand."", ""Turning to our 2024 expense expectations on Slide 19. We started our focus on efficiency initiatives three years ago, and we've successfully delivered on our commitment of approximately 10 billion of gross expense saves. Through our efficiency initiatives we have reduced headcount every quarter since third quarter of 2020, and headcount is down 16% since the end of 2020. Looking at our expectations for this year and following the waterfall on the slide from left to right, we reported 55.6 billion of non-interest expense in 2023, which included the 1.9 billion FDIC special assessment."", 'Excluding this item, expenses would have been 53.6 billion, which we believe is a good starting point for discussion of 2024 expenses. Looking at the next bar, we expect severance expense to be approximately 1.3 billion lower, driven by the 969 million expense we took in the fourth quarter for planned actions. We expect expenses to increase by at least 300 million due to higher revenue related expense, driven by wealth and investment management. Revenue related expenses will ultimately be a function of activity and market levels, and therefore could be higher or lower than this estimate.', 'At this point, we expect all other expenses to be flat, though there are significant efficiencies and increased investments included in this expectation. We expect approximately 2.7 billion of gross expense reductions in 2024 due to the efficiency initiatives. We highlight in the slide some of the areas where we anticipate additional savings and continue to believe we have more opportunities beyond 2024. Similar to prior years, the resources needed to address our risk and control work are separate from our efficiency initiatives, and we will continue to make significant investments in our risk and control infrastructure.', ""While we remain focused on executing on our efficiency initiatives, we're also continuing to invest and we expect approximately 1.1 billion of incremental technology and equipment expense, reflecting higher costs related to the amortization of investment in prior years, as well as new investments planned for 2024. We also expect merit increases of approximately 700 million, which are primarily awarded to employees with lower salaries. We highlight some of the other areas where we plan to invest on the next slide. Our 2024 expense outlook includes ongoing business related operating losses of approximately 1.3 billion, similar to the level we had in 2023."", ""As previously disclosed, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory, and customer remediation matters that could impact operating losses. So, putting this all together, we expect 2024 non-insurance expense to be approximately 52.6 billion. It's important to note that while we've made substantial progress executing on our efficiency initiatives, as Charlie highlighted, we still have a significant opportunity to get more efficient across the company. Given how critical it is to continue to invest in our business, on Slide 20, we provide some examples of our areas of focus for 2024."", ""Let me highlight a few. Building the right risk and control infrastructure remains our top priority, and we will continue to invest in this important work. Charlie discussed many of the technology investments we've already made to transform how we serve both our consumer and commercial customers, and we plan to continue investing these areas this year throughout our businesses. We are planning to hire more bankers and advisors to grow our Wells Fargo Premier Offering to our affluent clients."", 'We plan to launch a new travel oriented credit card as part of our Autograph suite of products, as well as a new small business credit card this year. To better serve our commercial clients, we plan to continue higher within investment banking and commercial banking to support priority sectors and products to help drive growth. Now, let me conclude with Slide 21, where we will discuss return on tangible common equity. When we first discussed our path to improving returns on the fourth-quarter 2020 earnings call, we had an 8% ROTCE.', ""Since then, we have taken multiple actions to improve our returns, including executing on our efficiency initiatives, investing in our businesses to help drive growth, and returning excess capital to shareholders, including increasing our common stock dividend $0.10 to $0.35 per share and repurchasing $32 billion of common stock. These actions help to improve our ROTCE. Our reported ROTCE in the fourth quarter was 9%, but as we highlight in the table, our ROTCE was impacted by a number of notable items. Our 2023 returns also reflected the benefit of rising rates, which helped to drive strong net interest income growth, and as I've already highlighted, we expect net interest income to decline this year."", 'We still believe, we have an achievable path to a sustainable 15% ROTCE over the medium term as we continue to make progress on transforming the company. There are several key factors that support our belief. Our ability to return excess capital, we currently have a significant amount of excess capital, 2.5 percentage points above our regulatory minimum buffers for CET1. And as I already highlighted, we expect to increase our share repurchases this year.', ""I highlighted the progress we've already made to reposition our home lending business, including reducing the amount of third-party mortgage loans serviced by 18% from a year ago. As we continue to streamline this business, we expect the profitability to improve. We've grown our credit card business with balances up 40% since the end of 2021 and new accounts 25% higher than the fourth quarter of 2021. However, the current profitability of this business has been impacted by acquisition costs and allowance build, and we expect profitability to improve as the portfolio matures."", ""Finally, we've made significant investments the last few years across our franchise to better serve our customers, and help drive growth. We expect the revenue growth that these investments should generate in businesses like corporate investment banking and wealth and investment management will help fund additional investments. So, we have many drivers to close the gap and improve returns. In summary, our results in 2023 demonstrated our commitment to improving our financial performance."", 'We grew revenue, reduced expenses, increased capital returns to shareholders, and maintained our strong capital position. We will now take your questions.', '', 'Operator', 'At this time, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] And our first question of the day will come from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Sir, your line is open.', 'Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst', ""Hi, good morning. Happy New Year. Mike, I was -- appreciate all the NII detail. Just given all the different puts and takes that you cited, I was hoping you could provide some context as to how you're thinking about the exit rate for NII in 2024 per the guidance, just given expectations per the street that NII should inflect positively in 2025, just want to get a sense as to how you're thinking about where NII could potentially trough or stabilize based on the forward curve?"", 'Mike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah, no, I appreciate the question. When you -- based on what we gave you, Steve, I think, we said on the page and in my remarks that we do expect it to start to inflect and trough as we get toward the end of the year. Exactly when that happens, I think we'll sort of see. We're not going to get too specific there, but we do expect that you would start to see a trough as we get to the end of the year and into 2025."", 'Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst', ""Very helpful. And then for my follow-up just on expenses, the core expense guidance shows another net reduction in 2024. You noted that you're making investments, but those will be offset by efficiency savings. Just want to get a sense as to how long you can sustain that flattish core expense trajectory, continue to fund investments with future efficiencies."", 'Mike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. I think when we think about the efficiency journey that we're on, I think Charlie and I have been both pretty clear consistently now that there's more to do and 2024 is just another year in the journey, right? And we've got more to do post that to continue to drive efficiency across the place, where we're going to net out on a year-to-year basis in terms of the net spend, I'm not going to try to predict. But as you look across the company, I think we're just continuing to methodically make progress to drive automation, efficiency, reduce third-party spend, reduce our real estate footprint across all of the different dimensions. And I think we think we've got more to do, and that'll continue into 2025 and beyond."", 'Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst', ""That's great. Thanks so much for taking my questions."", 'Operator', 'The next question will come from John McDonald of Autonomous Research. Your line is open, sir.', 'John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst', ""Hi, good morning. Mike, I wanted to ask about the fee income drivers for this year. Charlie mentioned obviously some examples of progress that you've gotten leverage on investments and then obviously you've got cyclical headwinds and tailwinds. So, maybe just could you walk through some of the bigger fee income drivers and give your sense of puts and takes and how you're feeling this year going into the fee revenue outlook?"", 'Mike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Yeah, sure. Thanks, John. When you look at the components there, I mean, the largest one is going to be our advisory fees in the wealth and investment management business. And market levels are higher than they were this time last year.', ""And so, if that holds or gets better as many people predicting, that should be constructive for that fee. When you start looking at the other line items like trading, the market's got to cooperate. We're happy with the progress we've been making across the different businesses there, but the market is going to have to cooperate as well for that to continue. We had a number of impairments across our venture capital portfolio this year."", ""At some point, that should start to peter out, and we'll see that inflect. And then the other fee lines should be pretty predictable for the most part as you sort of look forward."", 'John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst', 'OK. And just to follow up on the net interest income idea of bottoming toward the end of the year, theoretically, what would be the drivers of that kind of bottoming? Do you have fixed asset reprice that helps, or is it kind of assumed new asset generation? Maybe you could just wrap that into some thoughts about what would drive that inflection in the context of any update on rate sensitivity as well? Thanks.', 'Mike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes, sure. Maybe I'll start with the latter part first. And -- as you can see in the data we gave in the presentation, we're anchoring it to what was in the forward curve as of a day last week, which is not that dissimilar to what you have today. And I think when you look at sensitivity to that, our interest rate sensitivity disclosures in this case are a pretty good estimate for how to think about whether if rates are a little bit higher or a little bit lower than what's in that forward curve."", ""And if you look at where we were at the end of the third quarter, we were still modestly asset sensitive. That'll still be the case at the end of the fourth quarter. It will come down a little bit from where it was, but will still be asset sensitive. But its -- and if you look at the forward curve, I think on average, rates are coming down something like 50 basis points."", ""And so, it is pretty linear math when you look at the sensitivities that we included in the queue. When you look at the underlying assumptions as you go into the year, we've got loan growth being pretty muted in the beginning part of the year. That'll hopefully start to pick up as we get later in the year. So, that will be a driver of it as you get toward the end of the year."", ""You'll have some stabilization. We're expecting stabilization of pretty stable deposits across the commercial and wealth management businesses. At some point, the consumer deposits will also stabilize, and the mix will stabilize as well. You've got continued asset repricing that happens in there as well."", ""So, it's a little bit of all of it that brings you to the point at which it starts to trough and inflect. But again, exactly when that's going to happen, we'll sort of leave -- we'll leave till later in the year, but we do expect that'll happen as we get closer to the end of the year."", 'John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst', 'Understood. Thanks.', 'Operator', 'The next question will come from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is open.', 'Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst', ""Hi, thanks. I'm sorry if I'm going to stay on theme, but just as you start to the beginning of the year and deposit price continues to flow through and the mix continues to change and as far as the DDAs, I'm wondering if you could just help us understand how do you expect that trajectory. DDAs definitely still out flowing, which is expected, but in terms of mix and then just how you expect the deposit rate of change or the downside beta to act through the cycle. Can you help us understand that, Mike? Thanks."", 'Mike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Sure. When you look at what's happening just on deposits, the trend that we've been seeing now on the mix shift has been pretty consistent for the last two or three quarters at least. And so -- so, at some point that'll moderate more, but it's been pretty consistent. And so, that's probably a decent assumption as you sort of go into the first part of the year at least."", ""When you start looking at deposit pricing can later in the year, as rates start to move, on the commercial side, rates and betas have been competitive now and pretty high for a while, and they'll be just as rate sensitive on the way back down. That's part of the bargain on the commercial side is you get good competitive betas on the way up, and you also get them on the way down. On the consumer side, there's been less movement on standard pricing across many of the products, but you've had the introduction of CDs and promo rates, and all that stuff will start to move down pretty quickly as the expectation for rates do as well."", 'Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst', 'OK. So, if I think about that, then would you imply that the first-quarter starting point, we see a little bit more of an NII step down, and then as you get to that hopeful stabilization in the back half, like just because of how that moves?', 'Mike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Well, I think based on what we gave you, right, so we are expecting a full year NII to be down 7% to 9% hopefully. And if it starts to stabilize as you get to the end of the year, then that implies a step down in the beginning of the year. Exactly, we're not going to give you a number by quarter, but I -- you would -- you should expect to step down as you go in the beginning part of the year."", 'Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst', 'OK. I understand. OK. Thanks, Mike.', 'Operator', 'The next question will come from Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.', 'Scott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst', ""Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you might be able to spend just another moment on the longer-term cost opportunity. I guess I'm just curious if there's a point where some of the investment spending pressures ease and there might still be an opportunity for costs to decline more visibly on an underlying basis."", ""Or by contrast, is this level of investment spending, is that something that'll just be sort of pretty consistent year in and year out?"", 'Charlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes, Scott, it really is going to depend. I will highlight one thing though. In the slide that we have there, we -- I noted that part of what's driving the investment spend this year is the tech and equipment line moving up. And so, that won't continue to move up at that pace forever."", ""And so, that does start to moderate as you go out into the future. But as you look at the other investments we're making, we're going to try to be very thoughtful about looking at the opportunities that we have across each of the businesses, thinking about short-, medium-, long-term results and making sure that we're sort of calibrating all that, right? But I would expect us to continue to make investments in each of the businesses. And I think that ultimately, that's what's going to drive great returns and better performance over time."", 'Scott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst', 'Perfect. Thank you. And then maybe just a question on credit. You all have been very proactive in dealing with sort of the office CRE situation.', 'Just curious to hear how your -- what your thoughts are on how this cycle, that asset class sort of plays out from here. Does it just remain a long slog? Or is there perhaps a point where your conservatism has sort of gotten ahead of issues, and you might actually be able to relieve a bit of that really healthy double-digit reserve?', 'Charlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. Look, as we look at the reserve, and then I'll come back to the broader point there, at some point we'll start using the reserve more fully, and then that allowance coverage ratio will come down. No doubt. I mean, that's the way it should work when you think about CECL and the way the accounting should work."", ""I think, in terms of your broader point, it's a long movie. We're still -- we're not -- we're past the opening credits, but we're still in the beginning of the movie. And so, it's going to take some time for this to play out. And as I noted, it'll be somewhat of an uneven and episodic sort of nature to the charge offs and as you work through this because every property has a different timeline in terms of events that it needs to sort of work through."", ""So, I do think that we've got a while for this to play out through the system."", 'Scott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst', 'OK. Perfect. Thank you very much.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. The next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. Your line is open.', 'Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""Hey, good morning. I guess maybe just to the -- thanks for all the details on NII expenses and the ROTCE. I guess if you had to -- and it's not lost upon anyone with regards to the investments you've made in the franchise. But when you look at the slide, fourth-quarter '20 ROTCE 8%, three years fast forward, it's gone from 8% to 9%."", ""Assuming there's no real perfect world to operate a bank, from a shareholder perspective, quickly, do you think we can get from 9% to 15%? You've given us the moving pieces. But I'm just wondering maybe Charlie, Mike, how do you think about, is it a two-year slog? Is it longer than that? Love some perspective there."", 'Mike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. And I think maybe I'll start and Charlie can chime in. So I think when you look at that page, Ebrahim, I think you really have to look at the impact of the special assessment that in the results, right? And so, that's four percentage points of ROTCE, so think of the underlying operating performance from a returns perspective, more closer to that 13% range. And so, there has been quite a bit of progress since Q4 '20."", ""And then as you sort of look forward, we highlighted some of the key drivers on the right. And in my commentary, look, we've got a lot of excess capital despite whatever happens with Basel III. And so, we've got room to continue to return that to shareholders. We are in the middle of repositioning and the home lending business, which will drive, not only good, better returns in that business, but improvement across the franchise."", ""We've got the card business, which we're seeing very good performance in as we've launched our new products over the last couple years. And as that matures, we will be meaningful contributor. And then we've got continue to get the benefit of all the other investments that we're making. And so, we feel like we've made a lot of good progress since the 2020."", ""And then we've got really clear plans to continue to see better performance."", 'Charlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer', ""And I'll just add a little bit to it. And to be a little bit repetitive, when you look at that slide, again, those are reported numbers. And so, the way we think about it is the earnings power of the company today on an ROTCE basis, you got to make your own assumptions for what's in and out and what normalized net interest income is because we've been clear that we've been over earning. But when you look at and when you add back these expenses like FDIC, which relate to the past and this quarter and aren't going to go forward, our ROTCE is up 50% from where it was."", ""So, that is significant change. On top of that, when we look at the actions, as Mike said, that we've taken in the home lending business, when we see the trajectory of growth that we're seeing in the card business, just as those things mature, let alone being able to deploy the excess capital we have, those are things that are in process. We don't have to really do anything more other than let them mature and let them play out. That is continued movement toward the 15% ROTCE."", ""And then the last thing I'd say is just away from those things. When we got here, these businesses were not on trajectories to grow. The card business wasn't growing, the corporate investment bank wasn't growing. You can go through them one by one."", ""And so, as we've talked about making investments, offsetting some of these efficiencies that we've seen and making determinations on whether or not they're paying off, those things that we're seeing these increases in share, we're pretty confident that they are going to continue to drive improved results over time. And so, as I said in my remarks, we're clearly susceptible to market environment both for interest rates and the overall economic environment in the shorter term, but we feel both really good about the progress that we've made. We feel really good about what the path we see going forward is recognizing that there's still a lot more that we have to do."", 'Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Got it. That was thorough. Thank you. And just one quick follow-up.', ""Mike, on CRE. I'm assuming you had some assets moved through the -- off the balance sheet. I'm just wondering, do -- today, relative to a year ago, do you have better visibility on where the clearing prices for some of these non-performing CRE or challenge CRE loans? And are you seeing any pressure spreading beyond CRE offers to other parts of the portfolio in any meaningful way? Thank you."", 'Mike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. I mean, look, as time goes by, we've got -- we get better and better information around where things are going to play out. But it is still somewhat specific to the asset. And so, I wouldn't try to generalize yet until we see more transactions and more data points."", 'When you look at the broader CRE market at least in our portfolio, we are not seeing the stress spread to other parts of it.', 'Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Helpful. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'The next question will come from Erika Najarian of UBS. Your line is open.', 'Erika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst', ""Hi, good morning. My first question is a follow-up to Ebrahim's line of questioning on ROTCE. Charlie, Mike's right, obviously, you have plenty of excess capital. As we think about your outlook for not much loan growth in 2024, and obviously there's the asset cap still in place, how should we think about what you're looking for as guideposts to potentially accelerate that buyback from the $2.4 billion level? Is it as far out as the Basel III end game finalization, or would you wait for more clarity near term on the DFAST results in June?"", 'Mike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer', ""It's Mike. I'll take a shot at that Erika. And when you look at the -- when you look at our full-year numbers, we -- I tried to highlight in my comments that we do expect that our repurchases will be higher than what we did in 2023. The exact timing and pace, I'm not going to get into."", ""But then we'll look at all of as we do every quarter, we look at all of the different risks that could be out there including, thinking about where CCAR or the stress tests will come out. And from a Basel III perspective, we are in really good shape. As we said last quarter, we're already above where we need to be from a -- if it was fully implemented as is, and we're hopeful that that won't be the case. And so, and we're going to generate more capital as we go through the year."", ""And so, we've got, as I said, we've got plenty of excess capital. We plan to buy back more stock than we did in 2023, and we'll leave the exact timing and pace to future calls."", 'Erika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst', 'Thank you. And, Mike, my follow-up question is another one on NII. I did notice that your short-term borrowings went up a lot in 2023. And just looking at the asset side, it seemed like it was funding that increase in liquidity to 204 billion cash in cash at the Fed at period-end.', ""And I'm wondering, as we're thinking about your liability mix in 2024. And then I think your average balance sheet size was 1.91 trillion at the end of the year. I'm just wondering if we should expect the balance sheet to shrink because you don't -- you may not need all those short-term borrowings, or is there a reason why you feel like you want to hold that much liquidity at the Fed at this time?"", 'Mike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Well, it is certainly possible, the balance sheet will get smaller throughout the year. I think that'll just be a function of what we ultimately see on loan growth, how much we end up deploying into securities as we go through the year, and where it makes sense, we will let the balance sheet just ebb and flow back down. And I think that's the way we're sort of thinking about it now. And I think at this point, there's not a lot of cost to leaving at the Fed given where the -- where A-IRB is."", ""And so, that'll change as rates start to come down and we'll calibrate the overall size based on what we think the opportunity is."", 'Erika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'The next question will come from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Your line is open, sir.', 'John Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', ""Good morning. On the NII outlook of down 7% to 9%, can you maybe help us think about the expected net interest margin trajectory through the year? How we should think about that in the context of what you're expecting in terms of earning asset yields and dynamic on funding costs? Thanks."", 'Mike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Well, we don't -- we're not going to try to predict exactly where the NIM is going to go quarter by quarter. But I think as you would guess, right, assuming the balance sheets that are a relatively stable size as NII starts to come down, the NIM will compress, right? And there'll be tailwinds and headwinds related as the assets. As the securities portfolio reprices, that'll be a tailwind. As you start to see variable rate loans come down, as rates come down, that'll be a headwind."", ""And so, I think most of it should be relatively simple to kind of estimate as you sort of plug the assumptions into your model, but there's no sort of magic to it. But you would expect NIM to continue to come down as the balance sheet stays stable and NII comes down."", 'John Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', ""OK. All right, thanks. And then separately on commercial real estate, and can you maybe give us a little more color in terms of where you saw the stress, what types of office properties and what type of marks to the underlying assets are you seeing as you're reappraising the properties? And given the -- I guess, maybe just talk about the level of confidence you have in the updated 7.9% office reserve at this level."", 'Mike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. And really the allowance I would -- the allowance coverage ratio I would pay attention to on the slide is our CIB, CRE office portfolio, which is close to 11%. And that's really the institutional style office buildings where really the stress is coming through. When you look at the charge-offs, it was across a number of properties."", ""It wasn't one or two. It was pretty geographically dispersed across different cities and across different parts of the country. So, there wasn't an over concentration anywhere. Each of the properties have very specific situations, and so there was a pretty wide range in terms of where the price cleared or where the appraisal came in."", ""A good chunk of these properties are being marked because we've got new appraisals for various reasons. A small amount of it was actually realized because the note or the property was sold. And so, for a good amount of it, we'll see how it ultimately plays out. There could be recoveries as we go."", 'But it was a pretty -- as you would expect, it was a substantial decline in what people thought the value of the properties was just a year or two ago.', 'John Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', 'OK, got it. Thanks, Mike.', 'Operator', 'The next question will come from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.', 'Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst', ""Good morning, Mike. Good morning, Charlie. Mike, on the guide for the net interest income on the forward curve. If the forward curve is incorrect and we're sitting here a year from now, and rather than seeing a 415 or 416 Fed funds rate, if it's close to the 5% or 490, how much of a positive would that be for a higher net interest income for you guys? Have you guys -- I'm assuming you use different sensitivity analysis to kind of give yourself a sense of where net interest income could go under different rate scenarios."", 'Mike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. I would -- and just like I think John McDonald asked it earlier. I would look at our interest rate sensitivity, Gerard. And as I said, we're still modestly asset sensitive, a little bit less at the end of the fourth quarter than the third quarter."", ""And I think it is a pretty linear sort of equation there. And so, I would just look at the 100 basis point move that we have in there. It's around a couple of billion dollars of move when you look at that as of the end of the third quarter. Again, it'll come in slightly from that likely into -- at the end of the fourth quarter and just use whatever assumption you want, and it is a pretty linear."", ""Within reason, it's a pretty linear equation."", 'Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst', ""OK. And then you guys obviously have been very focused on the expense reduction and admirable job since you guys all got there, obviously. Is there any way that you could bring down the operating losses? I think they've been pretty consistent at 1.3 billion for a bit. Is there anything in there that down the road you could change where it would actually fall? Or is it just something that just the cost of doing business with fraud, theft, and etc.?"", 'Mike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Well, there's certainly some portion of that that will -- is just the cost of doing business. Now, even on the fraud and BAU operating losses, we, as most people I would think, are continuing to invest in capabilities to reduce those more and more. And we continue to do that as well. And then I think as we continue to put more of the issues, historical issues behind us, hopefully the overall number continues to trend downward."", 'Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst', 'Great. I appreciate it. Thank you.', 'Operator', ""The next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open."", ""Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst"", ""Hi. Any thoughts on where card charge-offs go in '24? I think you're about 4% this quarter. And I guess you've had really good growth. So, if we lag it like we used to do in the old days, maybe we get about 4.5%."", ""I don't know if that's a good starting point or just any way to frame losses from here. Thanks."", 'Mike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. I won't give you a specific number, but the way you're thinking about it is exactly right. I think as you look at the portfolio that we have, which might be a little different than others is we launched the new product set starting a little over two years ago, but you've sort of seen more meaningful new account growth starting about two years ago. And so, you're in that normal maturation curve and seasoning of sort of losses as they come on."", 'And so, we would expect that it would continue to trend a little bit higher from where it is.', ""Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst"", ""And then we're seeing this obviously not just with you guys but kind of across the board in terms of card losses go up, even though we're still in this really good environment in terms of employment and wealth and still a bit of excess savings. Just thoughts on what's driving losses. Again, not just for you, but just for everybody, there's life events that always happen, but it just feels like maybe card losses are getting a little higher than I would have thought with unemployment where it is, and again, like jobs available and all those dynamics. Thanks."", 'Mike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes. And maybe I'll start. And I think as Charlie kind of highlighted in his script, the averages all look fine when you look at liquidity or deposit balances. And certainly, even when you look at the cumulative wage growth that you've seen over the last few years, in aggregate, you go, it paints a pretty good picture."", ""But when you go below that, and we've tried to highlight this a few times over the last year or so. When you go below that, there are certainly cohorts of clients where people are stressed. And the further you go down in income levels or the further you go down in wealth levels, the cumulative impact of inflation has really taken a toll. And so, you're going to have some percentage of people that are feeling much more stressed than what the aggregate numbers would imply."", ""And in some cases, their liquidity is going to be lower than it was pre-COVID. In some cases, they've been having to build bigger credit card balances. And so, for us, it's not a big part of the overall portfolio, but you're going to continue to see that, which is something we should all have expected and expect to see as you go forward."", 'Charlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer', ""And the only thing I would add is that that's something that has always existed pre-COVID, right? There were always people that were doing better and there were people that were doing worse. And I think what's important, I speak for ourselves, when we look at our card losses, what we actually are looking at is how they're performing on a vintage basis versus pre-COVID levels. And the curves are right on top of what that is. And so, when we talk about getting back to normal in terms of what we're seeing, that's what we're actually seeing in card losses."", ""We're not seeing at this point anything that goes beyond that."", ""Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst"", ""OK, that's helpful. And then just lastly, if I can squeeze in. Remind me, like the targeted customer, I think it's like prime plus, but any way to frame that in terms of whether it's FICO or wealth metric or homeowner percent or any way just to frame it? It is becoming a bigger part of the company, obviously so -- thanks."", 'Mike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes. Look, we're not going to get that specific. But when you look at like, individual products, they're targeted toward different cohorts of clients. But what I would say overall, we feel really good about the credit quality of the new accounts we're putting on."", 'And in most cases, in most products, the credit profile is better than what we have from the historical backbook.', ""Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst"", 'OK, thanks for all the color.', 'Operator', 'The next question will come from Dave Rochester of Compass Point Research. Your line is open.', 'Dave Rochester -- Compass Point Research and Trading -- Analyst', ""Hey, good morning, guys. Sorry for one more question on the NII guide here but was just curious how much of that decline that you're expecting for this year is driven by that continued remix of deposits and the lower non-interest bearing deposits you talked about and where are you assuming that DDA mix settles out this year?"", 'Charlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. As you would guess, when you lose non-interest bearing deposits or they shift into higher yielding products, that's going to have a pretty substantial impact. And so, that is a big driver of what the decline is for the rest of the year. We haven't really talked about exactly where it bottoms, but it should stabilize at some point."", 'Dave Rochester -- Compass Point Research and Trading -- Analyst', ""OK. And then on capital, was curious what more buybacks means for capital ratios and that 2.5% buffer you talked about. By the end of '24, all else equal, is the thought that you'll take those ratios and that buffer lower this year?"", 'Charlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer', ""We'll see, but I think, I won't try to give you a buyback number. Lots of things go into figuring that out throughout the year. But as we said, we expect buybacks to be bigger than last year, and the level, assuming that nothing significant happens in the macro environment, the level that we're at is higher than we need to be."", 'Dave Rochester -- Compass Point Research and Trading -- Analyst', 'Great, thanks. Appreciate it.', 'Operator', 'And our last question will come from Manan Gosalia of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.', 'Manan Gosalia -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', ""Hey, good morning. Two quick ones for me. I know you said your guide includes stable deposits but a shift toward interest bearing deposits. Would an end to QT stop that share shift, or is it different given you're seeing that share shift from the consumer side?"", 'Charlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Yeah. What we said is we expect stable deposits on the wealth and the commercial side. We do expect some declines on the consumer side. And an end to QT would be a positive.', 'Manan Gosalia -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', 'And can you expand on that a little bit? Why would that be?', 'Charlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Well, QT is drains. Well, at some point, more meaningfully drain liquidity out of the banking system, right? So, once you get the RRP facility down to a smaller number, which is likely to happen, then any further QT starts to really remove liquidity more directly out of the banking system. And so, that stops. That's a positive for deposits."", 'Manan Gosalia -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', 'Got it. OK. And then just on credit, how do falling rates impact your outlook for CRE losses? At the margin, do you feel better about working with borrowers and mitigating losses and NPLs and how long this takes to work out, or have things not changed that meaningfully yet?', 'Charlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Hasn't changed that meaningful yet. Really. We're dealing with what is a structural change in sort of demand for real estate in some parts of the country.

As dealmaking dried up and demand from borrowers softened last year, banks laid off employees or stopped replacing those who left. JPMorgan Chase, the nation\'s largest lender, bucked the trend by bolstering its ranks for a third straight year. Challenging times for the industry could persist this year as weakness in commercial real estate and tougher proposed capital rules could prompt banks to pull back on lending. Wall Street businesses suffered last year as economic uncertainty weighed on dealmaking. While the S&P 500 banks index rose 7% in 2023, it underperformed indexes tracking industrial or consumer discretionary companies. CITI OVERHAULS, GOLDMAN STEADIES SHIP Citigroup\'s headcount fell by 1,000 to 239,000 employees in 2023, and the lender outlined plans to cut 20,000 jobs over the next two years including layoffs from a sweeping reorganization and other business changes. At Bank of America and Wells Fargo the workforce contracted by about 2% and 5%, respectively, last year. JPMorgan added more than 16,200 employees. The bank bought failed lender First Republic Bank in a rescue deal in May. It has added jobs every year since 2021. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are set to disclose their latest headcount next week. As of September end, they had cut over 4,300 jobs versus last year. Earlier in 2023, Goldman Sachs undertook its biggest round of layoffs since the global financial crisis of 2008. In October, the bank\'s CFO Denis Coleman said they were in a position to do ""selective investments"" in headcount.

Even CEO Albert Bourla says so. ""We missed our internal projections and also, we missed the expectations of The Street... And clearly, that was shown in our stock price performance, that was very, very bad,"" Bourla said at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference last week.', 'In October, the big pharma company slashed its forecasts for annual coronavirus vaccine and treatment sales due to lower-than-expected demand and announced a cost realignment plan. Meanwhile, the already suffering shares continued to drop, ending the year with a 43% loss. Though there are plenty of reasons to believe this pharmaceutical giant will recover and grow over the long term, this year may continue to present challenges. In fact, here are two red flags that could sink Pfizer in 2024.', 'As the leader in the coronavirus vaccine and treatment market, Pfizer reported a record $100 billion in revenue in 2022. But strength in this market hurt the pharma giant when trends in coronavirus product use turned around. Demand for vaccine Comirnaty and treatment Paxlovid soared in earlier pandemic days, but as we move toward a post-pandemic world, demand has plummeted.', 'Pfizer and rival Moderna initially suggested that COVID vaccination could follow the course of the flu vaccine, implying about half of the U.S. population may go for a yearly booster. But during the recent fall season, only 17% of Americans lined up for a shot, and as a result, Pfizer cut its estimates for 2023 vaccine sales. The company also lowered its Paxlovid forecasts.', ""Now, for 2024, Pfizer predicts that Comirnaty and Paxlovid, together, will bring in $8 billion in revenue. That's a far cry from the combined $55 billion in revenue those products delivered in 2022."", ""So, unless Pfizer is wrong, it doesn't look like this will be a very dynamic year for coronavirus product sales -- and since investors have focused on Pfizer as a coronavirus stock, this could continue to weigh on the shares."", ""It's important to keep in mind that Pfizer is still generating blockbuster revenue from its coronavirus products, and a potential combined coronavirus/flu vaccine candidate -- now involved in clinical trials -- could offer more growth down the road. But another potentially lackluster year for coronavirus products may equal another lackluster year for Pfizer shares."", ""New products are a big thing for Pfizer right now, and for one particularly good reason: The company's older blockbusters face losses of exclusivity representing $17 billion in lost revenue from 2025 through 2030. Pfizer has a solid plan to compensate, by launching its biggest wave of new products ever."", ""The company aims to release 19 new products or indications over an 18-month period and is a great deal of the way there, with 13 launches completed and nearly all products approved as of last fall. Pfizer expects these products to compensate for the lost revenue -- and go on to grow. But this won't happen overnight. The company predicts new products will deliver $20 billion in revenue in 2030."", ""Right now, these products could actually weigh on Pfizer's margins. Manufacturing costs are always higher in early days of production, and costs to launch are another thing to consider too. It also takes time for a commercial team to win over doctors and for a drug's sales to take off."", ""All this means Pfizer's new products may not serve as catalysts for earnings growth or share price performance right away. And that could result in another grim year for Pfizer shares."", ""Does this mean you should flee Pfizer stock? Not necessarily. If we look at Pfizer's long-term prospects, the picture looks much different. Yes, COVID products aren't likely to deliver the kind of revenue they did in the past, but they could still bring in a significant amount of recurrent revenue over time -- especially if Pfizer's combined vaccine candidate scores a regulatory win."", ""More importantly, though, Pfizer's new products -- as well as key acquisitions, such as the purchase of oncology specialist Seagen -- could spur a new era of growth for Pfizer in the coming years. Today, Pfizer trades for 12 times forward earnings estimates. This price already looks reasonable -- and it doesn't even reflect earnings further down the road, when new product sales should gain in momentum."", 'So, the two red flags I mentioned above could sink Pfizer this year -- but a decline may be a top buying opportunity for investors willing to invest now and hold.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Pfizer right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Pfizer, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Pfizer wasn't one of them.

The payments giant saw its share price plummet 13% last year, as market sentiment around the company remains weak amid slower growth and leadership changes.', ""Nonetheless, some investors might think the beaten-down shares present an opportunity. Is it time to buy this fintech stock? Let's take a closer look."", ""PayPal's business got a big boost early on in the coronavirus pandemic, which boosted many other internet companies as well. Total payment volume (TPV), revenue, and active accounts were soaring in 2020 and 2021, leading to a rising stock price. However, economic headwinds, namely inflationary pressures and higher interest rates, stunted growth throughout 2022 and into 2023. In the third quarter of 2023 (ended Sept. 30), PayPal posted an 8.4% year-over-year revenue gain, which fell far short of the 20%-plus growth it regularly saw in 2020."", 'Softer macroeconomic conditions negatively impact consumer discretionary spending, which is what PayPal specializes in. The good news, though, is that a stronger economic backdrop can be a huge boon for this business. And this is likely what shareholders are hoping for in 2024.', ""If the Federal Reserve cuts rates multiple times this year, consumer confidence and spending could improve. And PayPal's growth metrics could accelerate, which should help to boost the stock price."", ""That's not to say that the numbers have been terrible. PayPal's TPV of $388 billion in Q3 was up 15% year over year, a healthy rate of growth, no doubt. Moreover, transactions per active account increased 13% year over year. This shows that users are engaging even more with the payment service, a positive sign."", ""As of this writing, PayPal's stock price sits a whopping 80% below its all-time high from July 2021, a troubling development. Naturally, the shares are trading at a cheap valuation. They sell for a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 11. This represents about a 50% discount to where the S&P 500 trades."", ""That cheap price tag might have some investors thinking this stock is a value trap. However, I believe this is a wrong assumption to make. Let's see what that low P/E gets you."", ""For starters, PayPal is a competitively advantaged business. There's no denying this. The company has been at the forefront of the digital payments revolution for more than two decades, and it has developed massive scale, wide acceptance, and powerful network effects that help protect it from rivals. With 35 million merchants and 393 million consumers, PayPal's service becomes more valuable to all stakeholders the larger it gets."", 'Plus, the PayPal name is recognized globally as a trusted, secure, and seamless way to move money around. As commerce continues to transcend borders, this company is in a good position to benefit.', ""I'll also point to PayPal's data advantage. By serving both merchants and individuals, as opposed to just one of these customer groups, the business is able to collect valuable insights about spending behaviors and patterns that can help minimize fraud and improve authorization rates. In the digital age, this gives PayPal the upper hand compared to subscale payments networks."", ""Despite these positive attributes, it's accurate to say that PayPal shares are characterized by low expectations and even a pessimistic tone based on the current valuation. But this is still a good business with solid prospects, making it a smart portfolio addition right now."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in PayPal right now?', 'Before you buy stock in PayPal, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and PayPal wasn't one of them.

After doing that, I've spotted two companies investors can buy confidently, and one they should avoid."", ""Buffett is a huge fan of toll-booth-style companies.

This can lead to a bubble and cause serious losses when it bursts. While I don't think Apple is in a bubble quite yet, it's valued at 32 times trailing earnings and 29 times forward earnings estimates -- an expensive price tag for a shrinking company."", ""So, while Apple may be Berkshire's favorite stock, it's far from a buy right now.

MSCI\'s index tracking Latin American stocks was up 1.1% by 1526 GMT, while a basket of regional currencies climbed 0.6% against the dollar. For the week, the broader stocks index was set to slip 0.2% while the currencies index was on track to gain 0.5%. Heavyweight Brazilian assets led broader gains across the stocks and currencies indexes, with the benchmark Bovespa stock index and the real up 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively. Also boosting Brazilian markets, data showed China\'s iron ore imports hit a record high in 2023, up 6.6% from a year before, thanks to stronger demand. Brazil is a major iron ore producer. Despite a hotter-than-expected U.S. inflation report on Thursday, market participants did not shy away from betting on early interest rate cuts, with traders putting about an 81% chance on the likelihood that the Federal Reserve would cut its policy rate at a meeting in March, according to CME Group\'s FedWatch Tool. Markets\' focus remained on Argentina, after the country\'s annual inflation rate rose above 211% in December, data showed on Thursday, hitting the highest level since the early 1990s as new libertarian President Javier Milei seeks to head off hyperinflation with tough austerity measures. ""Looking ahead, we expect prices to continue adjusting to December\'s FX correction, despite the central bank\'s FX anchor,"" Bruno Gennari, an emerging markets strategist and Argentina expert at KNG Securities, said in a note. ""A gradual slowdown of inflation could be expected in February and March ... Over the rest of the year, inflation dynamics will depend to a large extent on the government\'s ability to sustain money demand,"" Gennari added. After the sky-rocketing inflation data, Argentina\'s central bank said on Thursday it would put into circulation 10,000- and 20,000-peso bills later this year, while presidential spokesman Manuel Adorni on Friday said the monthly inflation rate is likely to remain in double digits in the next few months. The official peso weakened to 816 against the dollar. However, Argentina\'s international dollar bonds extended gains a day after International Monetary Fund (IMF) staff and the government reached an agreement that should unlock some $4.7 billion from the country\'s loan program with the global lender. The 2029 note rose 1.27 cents to trade at 40.1250 cents on the dollar, according to MarketAccess data, while the Merval stock index shed earlier gains to slip 0.1%. Stronger commodity prices also boosted the currencies of resource-rich regional markets, while investors kept a watch on rising tensions in the Middle East. Oil prices climbed about 3% on Friday, as some oil tankers diverted course from the Red Sea following overnight air and sea strikes by the United States and Britain on Houthi targets in Yemen after attacks on shipping by the Iran-backed group. The Mexican peso and Colombian peso gained 0.2% and 0.4%, respectively. Mexico and Colombia are oil exporters. The Chilean peso and the Peruvian sol rose 0.6% and 0.8%, respectively, tracking the rise in copper prices. The countries are major copper producers.

If you want to read about some more narrow moat stocks, go directly to 5 Narrow Moat Stocks Hedge Funds Are Buying.', 'Investors who are new to the stock market often get confused by the term moat. This is because moat is not easily defined and cannot be quantified based on numbers alone. Looking a little deeper into the origins of the word for better understanding, it seems that the term came into wider use in the finance world through Warren Buffett, the legendary value investor who is worth more than $118 billion. Buffett, famous for shrewd investments in the value space, used it to define companies that have sustainable competitive advantages over peers in the marketplace.\xa0', 'Although Buffett likes to invest in companies with wide moats, as he calls them, the term moat has been modified in recent years to also include companies with narrow moats. The distinction between wide and narrow moats is interesting. Companies with wide moats provide goods or services that are similar to those offered by competitors, but widely outperform their peers in terms of profits. Not only are these firms ahead in terms of profits, but they can also protect these and their market share in the long-term.\xa0', 'In contrast, the companies with narrow moats are somewhat similar to those with wide moats in that they outperform peers in terms of profits, but their outperformance is usually understood to be not long-term or is even time-limited in some cases. Some examples of companies with narrow moats that hedge funds are buying include DoorDash, Inc. (NYSE:DASH), Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE), and The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK), among others discussed in detail below.\xa0', 'It is important to clarify that companies with narrow moats often operate in economic sectors that have tight margins, license protection, and low barriers to entry. These factors make the competitive advantage they gain over peers all the more impressive given the constraints under which these firms usually operate. The business acumen of firms with narrow moats is better understood in context of the third quarter earnings call of DoorDash, Inc. (NYSE:DASH), a logistics platform that connects merchants with consumers.\xa0', 'Tony Xu, the CEO of DoorDash, Inc. (NYSE:DASH), in response to a question by Barclays analyst Ross Sandler during the third quarter earnings call, said that the company had a long-term strategy in place to grow internationally by working in partnership with businesses that had world-class retention and order frequency. The CEO underlined that the firm also looked to invest, in a concentrated manner, only in businesses that had excellent execution, allowing growth at multiple levels and geographies.\xa0', ""“I mean you're absolutely right. We are very excited about our execution on the international front. We continue to grow at multiples of what we see around the world, virtually across any geography. That doesn't mean that we are pleased yet with where our product is."", ""We still have a lot of room left to go. But I think it does stem from why our outperformance has occurred, which is I think the hallmarks at any great marketplace have the fundamental characteristics of great retention order frequency and unit economics. And I think when you look at our international business or our new categories business or a restaurant business, you see all of these characteristics present. And that's why we've been very interested in leaning in and making the investments that we have at size, at scale, because of what we see."", ""And the international business continues to see those points of execution. I think if we remind ourselves even a couple of years ago of the investment thesis behind our partnership with Wolt, it really centered on two big pieces. One of which was here is a business that has leading world-class retention and order frequency, and the question is, can we invest behind that in a concentrated way and hopefully add to the excellent execution that they've already seen. And so far, the answer has been yes to that.”"", 'Our Methodology', 'The companies that have short-term advantages over competitors were identified using manual research and Reddit threads. The top ones were then ranked according to hedge fund sentiment. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2023 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.

(NYSE:LYV) shares. Those holdings were previously attributed to Liberty SiriusXM and reattributed to a the newly created Liberty Live Group vehicle to reduce the complexity of the Liberty SiriusXM structure and make way for its potential combination with the underlying SiriusXM business. We believe the separation created some selling pressure on Liberty Live, creating an attractive discount of over 40% to the underlying value of its Live Nation holdings, and we took advantage of that discount to build a position. The Liberty Live Group is a small-cap vehicle through which we can own the underlying Live Nation business, which we have tracked and liked for years. Live Nation has significant competitive advantages in the live entertainment industry due to its unique combination of concert promotion, ticketing, venue management, and sponsorship businesses, which create a market share flywheel and margin structure that is difficult for competitors in any one of these underlying sub-segments to replicate independently. In addition to the upside we see in Live Nation, we think Liberty Live Group could eventually transition from a tracking stock to an asset-backed vehicle, which would pave the way for a structure consolidation with Live Nation and allow us to capture the current wide NAV discount.”', 'Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', 'Tapestry, Inc.

Investors earned significant gains in leading AI names like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Amazon. Those companies are generating most of their AI-related revenue from the data center and the cloud, which is where businesses are developing, training, and deploying their latest AI applications.', 'However, not all AI-related stocks caught the attention of investors early on. There was one cloud company that joined the AI party late in 2023, which means its stock could be set up for outsized gains this year. That company is DigitalOcean (NYSE: DOCN). Its shares are trading 71% below their all-time high, which was set during the tech frenzy of 2021, when investors assigned the stock an ambitious valuation.', ""Below, I'll explain the significance of DigitalOcean's entry into AI, and why now might be an opportune time for investors to buy the stock."", 'Cloud services can involve anything from simple data storage to website hosting to video-streaming technology. AI represents a new chapter in which cloud providers fill their data centers with advanced chips from the likes of Nvidia in order for their business customers to have the computing power to process mountains of data used to develop large language models -- the building blocks of an AI application.', ""DigitalOcean specializes in providing cloud services to small and mid-size businesses (SMBs), ranging from the start-up phase to those with 500 employees. Its product suite is relatively narrow for that reason, and the company is worth just $3.1 billion. It's a tiny player competing with giants like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud, which are backed by their trillion-dollar parent companies."", ""But DigitalOcean has an edge over these other tech giants because it tailored its entire offering to suit the needs of SMBs. Its pricing is cheap and transparent, its service is highly personalized, and it offers a digital library filled with educational materials to help customers maximize their cloud experience. The cloud leaders are focused on serving large organizations at scale, so it isn't economical for them to be so attentive to the needs of businesses at the smaller end of the spending scale."", ""Developing AI adds a whole new layer of complexity and cost. One Nvidia H100 GPU chip can cost $40,000, and many developers scale up to 20,000 of them! Therefore, most businesses can't build their own infrastructure, which is why they rely on centralized data centers managed by cloud providers."", ""Bringing that computing power to small businesses can help them unlock tremendous value through AI, and that's what DigitalOcean hopes to achieve with its $111 million acquisition of Paperspace last July."", ""DigitalOcean recently conducted a survey that found that 43% of developers and SMBs currently use AI and machine learning. Furthermore, it found that 78% of them plan to increase their use of those tools this year. Research by Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management estimates advancements in hardware and software will reduce the cost of training AI models by 70% per year between now and 2030, which could accelerate adoption."", ""Ark's projections suggest businesses will invest up to $41 trillion in AI by 2030 to boost their productivity, which could add a whopping $200 trillion to the global economy. That's an opportunity unlike anything cloud providers have seen before."", ""Paperspace has over 500,000 customers. It offers them a range of different GPUs designed to handle AI workloads, including Nvidia's industry-leading H100. Paperspace says its prices can be up to 70% cheaper than cloud leaders like Microsoft Azure because it offers per-second billing and no lock-in commitments, which ensures no expenditure is wasted. Plus, Paperspace is a specialist provider, so it doesn't have a bloated cost structure like its larger competitors, allowing it to pass on lower prices to customers."", ""DigitalOcean has a unique strategy. It acquires customers at the start-up phase and supports them with low prices, in the hope they scale their operations and eventually become a significant source of revenue. That's why the Paperspace deal is such a good fit -- it follows a similar philosophy."", 'DigitalOcean will report its official financial results for 2023 in February. Wall Street expects its revenue will come in at $690 million, representing an increase of almost 20% compared to the prior year. That would actually mark a deceleration from the 34% growth rate it delivered in 2022.', ""Weaker economic conditions are one reason. Many of DigitalOcean's customers in the start-up space are funded by investors, and it has been harder to raise fresh money over the past two years. With that said, macroeconomic headwinds like high inflation and rising interest rates are subsiding, which bodes well for the company going forward."", ""The other reason is DigitalOcean's focus on profitability. The company only grew its operating expenses by 9% year over year through the first three quarters of 2023, which resulted in net income (profit) of $3.4 million. It was a positive swing from the $17.4 million net loss it delivered in the year-ago period."", ""In short, DigitalOcean has found a path to profitability while at the same time it's on the cusp of a potential acceleration in growth thanks to AI. The Paperspace integration is still underway and it could take a few quarters before investors see results. However, DigitalOcean stock is trading near its cheapest price-to-sales multiple since it came public in 2021, so now might be a great time to buy."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in DigitalOcean right now?', 'Before you buy stock in DigitalOcean, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and DigitalOcean wasn't one of them.

It won't be surprising to see both these semiconductor stocks sustaining their red-hot run in 2024, especially considering that the semiconductor industry is expected to accelerate nicely this year."", ""Market research firm Gartner estimates that global semiconductor revenue could increase 17% in 2024 to $624 billion. That would be a huge improvement over last year's decline of 11%, which was caused by the weakness in the smartphone and personal computer (PC) markets, as well as tepid spending in the enterprise data center market."", ""So, which of these two chipmakers is in a better position to capitalize on the semiconductor industry's growth in 2024? And, more importantly, is Nvidia or AMD is a better bet right now from a valuation perspective following their red-hot run last year? Let's find out."", 'While the semiconductor market was down last year, the demand for chips deployed in artificial intelligence (AI) servers for training large language models (LLMs) remained robust. Nvidia rode this gravy train and is on track to finish the ongoing fiscal 2024 with $59 billion in revenue, which will be more than double the $27 billion revenue it generated in the previous fiscal year.', ""The good news for Nvidia investors is that the demand for AI chips is set to keep growing rapidly in the coming years. According to investment bank UBS, the market for AI graphics cards and chips could grow at an annual rate of 60% through 2027, generating an annual revenue of $165 billion. Nvidia is predicted to maintain a dominant 85% share of this booming AI chip market in 2024, according to Raymond James, which should lead to impressive growth in the company's data center revenue."", ""Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri estimates that Nvidia's data center business could deliver $65 billion in revenue in fiscal 2025 (which begins next month). Nvidia has generated $29 billion in revenue from its data center business in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, which points toward an annual revenue of $39 billion based on the quarterly run rate."", ""According to Raymond James' forecast, Nvidia's data center revenue could increase 66% in the new fiscal year. That won't be surprising, considering the solid demand for AI chips and Nvidia's share of this market. This, however, isn't the only side of the semiconductor market from which Nvidia stands to gain this year. The demand for the company's graphics cards that are deployed in gaming PCs (personal computers) should increase as well, thanks to a turnaround in this market and the adoption of AI-enabled computers."", ""All this indicates why Nvidia's total revenue is expected to jump a healthy 56% in fiscal 2025 to $92 billion. Even better, its earnings are expected to jump 66% in the upcoming fiscal year to $20.44 per share, giving growth-oriented investors a solid reason to keep buying this semiconductor stock."", ""Unlike Nvidia, which gets 80% of its total revenue from selling data center chips, the majority of AMD's revenue comes from selling central processing units (CPUs), graphics cards, and semi-custom chips used in PCs and gaming consoles. For example, in the third quarter of 2023, the company got 51% of its total revenue from selling chips into these markets."", ""This is why the recovery in the PC market is going to be a key catalyst for AMD in 2024. Canalys is forecasting an 8% increase in PC shipments this year, a nice turnaround following last year's drop of 12%. Moreover, AMD has positioned itself to capitalize on the market for AI-enabled PCs with its CPUs that are powering such computers. This should unlock a solid long-term growth opportunity for AMD as sales of AI-powered PCs are expected to post annual growth of 50% through 2030, according to Counterpoint Research."", ""However, AMD's gaming segment could continue to weigh on the company's performance. Its revenue from this segment was down 8% in the third quarter of 2023 due to tepid sales of its semi-custom chips, which are used by Microsoft and Sony in their popular gaming consoles. Given that the sales of gaming consoles are expected to increase by just 1.6% globally in 2024, AMD's gaming business may not get a big lift in 2024."", ""Also, Nvidia is the dominant player in gaming graphics cards with an 80% share, which means AMD isn't the best bet to capitalize on this market's growth. On the other hand, AMD's AI-focused business has yet to take off like that of Nvidia's. AMD is forecasting $2 billion in revenue from AI-related sales in 2024, which pales in comparison to Nvidia's revenue from this market."", ""All this tells us why AMD's growth is expected to be slower than Nvidia's. Analysts forecast its revenue to increase by 16.6% in 2024 to $26.4 billion, while earnings are forecast to increase by 41%. This relatively slower growth, however, isn't the only reason why Nvidia is looking like the better semiconductor stock of the two."", 'The points cited above make it clear that Nvidia is set to clock faster growth. But what makes Nvidia an even better bet over AMD is the valuation. As the following chart indicates, Nvidia is significantly cheaper than AMD as far as the forward and trailing earnings multiples are concerned.', ""As such, investors looking to benefit from the semiconductor market's growth this year and capitalize on hot trends such as AI would likely be better off buying Nvidia over AMD."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. So, when we ran our eye over Cummins' (NYSE:CMI) trend of ROCE, we liked what we saw."", ""For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Cummins is:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.17 = US$3.6b ÷ (US$32b - US$11b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""Thus, Cummins has an ROCE of 17%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Machinery industry average of 12% it's much better."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Cummins ', ""In the above chart we have measured Cummins' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Cummins."", ""While the current returns on capital are decent, they haven't changed much. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 17% and the business has deployed 67% more capital into its operations. 17% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that Cummins has consistently earned this amount. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders."", 'To sum it up, Cummins has simply been reinvesting capital steadily, at those decent rates of return. And since the stock has risen strongly over the last five years, it appears the market might expect this trend to continue. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we still believe the stock deserves further research.', ""If you'd like to know about the risks facing Cummins, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should be aware of."", ""While Cummins isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets."", 'Have feedback on this article?

So as Freebairn tells Fortune, “anyone’s fair game.”', 'Plus, if Iger’s second act at Disney’s helm is anything to go by, it could indicate that it’s high time for a shake-up at the company.', '“Bob Iger is back because they wanted to capture the magic of what he did during his many years at Disney where the share price went up by like 400%,” Julio Bruno, the ex-CEO at Time Out who took the company public, tells Fortune.', '“But that didn’t happen because the realities of the world and the world of media have dramatically changed in the last 10 years.”', 'Despite a sudden surge in Disney’s share price in the immediate aftermath of Iger’s appointment, shares have since continued on a downward trajectory and the stock price hit a nine-year low when it fell below $80 last October.', 'It’s why, Bruno says, the company won’t be looking for a Bob Iger 2.0 to take it into the future.', '“They have a problem with their streaming channel, they had the problems with the NBC Fox acquisition, their theme parks are empty and then they had a number of flops like the Haunted Mansion and The Little Mermaid which lost millions,” said Bruno, who has held executive roles at Just Eat and TripAdvisor.', '“So how do they regain the magic at Disney? They need, in my opinion, a big change—and that change isn’t going to come from inside.”', 'If one thing is clear, it’s that whoever fills in Iger’s shoes will have to wear many hats.', ""“I can't even imagine managing a company like Disney that has so many different entities,” Bruno says. “You have to know about theme parks, retail, streaming, the subscription business, terrestrial TV, news... It's going to be very difficult to find somebody who can capture two-thirds of that spectrum.”"", 'In Freebairn’s eyes, multisite management experience won’t be “a serious consideration” for Disney.', '“Their challenges and their opportunities are going to come through content and emerging technologies that allow you to get eyeballs in the most cost-effective way which they can then sell advertising and subscriptions off the back of,” he says. “Therefore, content creation—and how AI will impact that—will be very significant.”', 'It’s why, Freebairn predicts that Disney may be eyeing up “someone from a competing content stream provider” for its next chief.', '""I have a feeling that it will be somebody much more looking at the future of streaming, purely digital,” Bruno agrees, adding that whoever runs Disney next will need to be much “younger” than their predecessor.', '“Media has changed so dramatically in the last 20 years, but particularly the last five—with artificial intelligence and what is happening with the strikes,” he adds. “You need somebody who understands this new world.”', 'Whilst Iger will be part of the decision-making process, it is unlikely that he will have a real say in who steps into his shoes, experts told Fortune—and for good reason too.', '“When it comes to selecting a new CEO, the power is rarely concentrated in one person’s hands but instead resides with a broad panel of decision-makers,” Wiles says. “The focus is on the needs of the company moving forward and the best direction to move in.”', 'It’s an important distinction to make because while the board will be looking at protecting Disney’s future, Iger who is at the end of his career might want to preserve his mark in Disney’s history book.', '“Like in politics, you want to name the person who you feel is loyal to you, the person who will respect your legacy, who when you leave won’t say ‘oh my god, he was so bad, we have to change all this because he was terrible,’” Bruno explains.', '“What do you have left when you are a consumed multimillionaire CEO like Iger with friends all over the world?

The cuts will affect Amazon MGM Studios, Prime Video, and the streaming service Twitch, an independent subsidiary that’s still unprofitable nine years on from its acquisition.', 'This is the second year in a row that the company is launching the new year with job cuts. Last year, Amazon had two rounds of layoffs that slashed a total of 27,000 jobs across the company, including in HR, its AWS cloud computing unit, and advertising business.', 'This batch of changes at Amazon come as companies across the streaming industry are reckoning with the difficulty of a business that has, so far, proven to have limited profits and high expenses. Amazon spent big money to bolster its content library, including an $8.5 billion deal to acquire the Hollywood studio MGM in 2022, and an 11-year, $11 billion broadcasting deal with the NFL that gives Amazon exclusive rights to broadcast Thursday Night Football.', 'Across the media landscape, companies are rethinking the strategy for their streaming services, which had previously prioritized gaining subscribers at all costs. Now, with borrowing costs high and inflation-strapped consumers being more choosy about entertainment, Amazon and its peers are looking to trim down costs and become more selective in the content they make and distribute, all while considering new sources of revenue. Some have introduced ads, emboldened by industry leader Netflix, which once swore it would never have advertising, but added it in 2022. Amazon itself will introduce ads to Prime video shows at the end of the month. Others, like Warner Bros. Discovery and NBCUniversal, have taken to licensing out content that had previously been exclusive to their own streaming services in exchange for some much-needed cash.', 'Amazon, like many of the legacy media companies who also operate streaming services—Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Paramount—is realizing it can’t continue to spend endlessly on streaming, a business which has proved difficult to scale profitably for all except Netflix.', 'In announcing the layoffs, Amazon signaled it is cutting headcount to spend on content. “We’ve identified opportunities to reduce or discontinue investments in certain areas while increasing our investment and focus on content and product initiatives that deliver the most impact,” senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios Mike Hopkins told employees in a message on Wednesday seen by Fortune.', 'Amazon spent $16.6 billion on content in 2022, behind only Netflix and Disney. The costs include Amazon’s NFL contract and a very pricey Lord of the Rings show, which reportedly cost $465 million for a single season. (Full-year figures for last year’s content spend aren’t available because Amazon hasn’t reported its 2023 earnings yet.)', 'Other media companies have opted to cut their content spending this year, with Disney slashing its content spending for fiscal 2024 by $2 billion. In recent public statements Disney CEO Bob Iger said the company made too many movies and shows for its streaming service, often at the expense of quality. “In our zeal to basically grow our content significantly to serve mostly our streaming offerings, we ended up taxing our people, in terms of their time and their focus, way beyond where they had been,” Iger told attendees at the Sun Valley Conference in November. Disney reported a $512 million loss on its streaming business in the third quarter of 2023.', 'Amazon CEO Andy Jassy in the past spoke optimistically of Prime Video, telling CNBC in June he was “very bullish” about the business. Jassy said it was both a strong business on its own and had a positive halo effect on the company’s core e-commerce business.', 'Prime Video was originally launched as a glorified marketing tool for the free shipping subscription Amazon Prime. “What we find is that customers who watch a movie that they love, they buy more Tide,” former CEO of Amazon’s worldwide consumer business Jeff Wilke told Vox in 2019. “They shop more, they’re more likely to renew their Prime subscription, they’re more likely to convert a free trial into a monthly or annual Prime subscription.”', 'But just a few weeks after Jassy sang Prime Video’s praises on CNBC, Bloomberg reported he was closely examining the finances of Amazon’s studio division. Despite its big budgets and buzzy programming, it can be difficult to truly gauge the success of Amazon’s entertainment business because it does not report separate financial results for the division. Secrecy aside, advertising executives are certain Amazon’s upcoming introduction of ads will be a “tornado” that upsets the streaming industry, as it is set to become the largest ad-supported streamer overnight.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

The oil producer launched that industry's first fixed-plus-variable dividend framework in 2021 following its merger with WPX Energy. It pays a base dividend it can sustain at lower oil prices and a variable payout that fluctuates with its oil-fueled cash flows. "", ""After paying a gusher of dividends in 2022 due to higher oil prices, Devon Energy's total dividend outlay fell last year as crude prices cooled off. Here's a look at what direction the oil stock's dividend might head in 2024. "", 'Devon Energy paid a total of $2.87 per share in dividends last year. That was down from $5.17 per share in 2022 due to much lower variable dividend payments:', 'As that chart shows, Devon paid a base quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share last year. That was an increase of 11% from the level of its fixed payment in 2022. On top of that, Devon paid a total of $2.07 per share in variable dividends last year. That was down from $4.49 per share in variable dividends the prior year. ', ""Two issues affected Devon Energy's ability to pay variable dividends last year: falling oil prices and rising capital expenses. Those factors weighed on Devon's free cash flow. Devon produced $1.8 billion in cumulative free cash flow through the third quarter of last year. That compared to $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022 and nearly $1.5 billion in the third quarter of that year. With its free cash flow retreating, Devon had less money to pay in variable dividends last year. "", ""Devon Energy provided an initial glimpse at its 2024 outlook when it reported its third-quarter results last year. The company expects its capital spending to decline by about 10% in 2024 as it focuses on its highest-return regions. That drives Devon Energy's view that it could produce $3.2 billion in free cash flow this year, a roughly 20% increase from 2023. That rising free cash flow suggests that Devon could pay a higher dividend this year. "", ""However, there are a couple of caveats. First, Devon's forecast assumes that oil will average about $80 a barrel this year. That price point seemed conservative a few months ago, as crude was above that level in early November. Unfortunately for Devon, crude oil has cooled off and was recently closer to $70 a barrel. If oil remains at its current level (or keeps falling), Devon's cash flow might not grow as expected this year. "", ""The other potential factor impacting Devon's dividend is a change in its capital allocation strategy. Devon had set a target of paying up to 50% of its post-base dividend excess free cash flow in variable dividends each quarter. That was part of its aim to return up to 70% of its total free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. However, Devon Energy expects to prioritize share repurchases in the near term, given the nearly 30% decline in its share price over the past year. Because of that, it might pay out a lower percentage of its free cash flow in variable dividends in 2024 if its share price stays low. "", 'On a more positive note, Devon does expect to continue increasing its fixed base payment in 2024. Still, with oil prices under pressure to start the year and Devon prioritizing repurchases over variable dividends, its total dividend outlay could decline again in 2024.', ""Devon Energy's declining cash flow caused its dividend to sputter last year. While the company had hoped that cash flow would improve in 2024, falling crude prices could continue to weigh on its cash flow this year. Because of that and a preference for repurchases, Devon Energy might not have enough gas in the tank to rev up its dividend in 2024 (even though it will continue to increase its base payment)."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Devon Energy right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Devon Energy, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Devon Energy wasn't one of them.

So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.', ""McDonald's already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at McDonald's' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters."", ""Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. McDonald's is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.4% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.0% and 4.6%, of the shares outstanding, respectively."", ""Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder."", ""While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future."", 'The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.', 'Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.', ""Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of McDonald's Corporation in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$238m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. "", ""The general public-- including retail investors -- own 30% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders."", ""It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand McDonald's better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks for example - McDonald's has   2 warning signs   we think you should be aware of."", 'But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do.

In the case of real estate investment trusts (REITs), the side effect was a deep drawdown across most of the sector.', ""But Wall Street doesn't go in a straight line, it follows a path that more closely resembles a sine curve, and REITs began to rally toward the end of 2023 as interest rate worries began to ebb. There are still some interesting opportunities in the sector, including Prologis (NYSE: PLD) and Realty Income (NYSE: O)."", ""Here's why you might want to consider buying these two REIT stocks before they surge even higher."", ""Broadly speaking, interest rates can be problematic for REITs because REITs regularly have to tap the capital markets for growth capital. This isn't exactly different from any other company, but it is more acute because REITs pay out most of their cash flow as dividends. This means that any growth investment, be it buying a property or building one, necessitates either selling debt or issuing stock. It simply got more expensive to be a REIT as rates moved up."", ""There's another issue here as well since rising rates can lead to an economic slowdown. Or worse, tip an economy into a recession. For Prologis, which operates in the industrial space, and Realty Income, which has material exposure to retail assets, a recession could translate into weaker occupancy numbers and more difficult lease renewals. So that's a second thing to consider here."", ""But those concerns start to fade if interest rates flatline or, as some now hope, begin to fall. Since Wall Street tends to be forward-looking, it boosted the shares of both of these stocks at the end of 2023 as anticipation began to build for a reversal in the Federal Reserve's interest rate approach in 2024. Over the past three months, Prologis' shares are higher by around 20% while Realty Income is up about 15%."", 'Those are pretty big gains in a very short period of time, so investors need to step back and take a closer look at what they are buying. For starters, Prologis is still off nearly 25% from its 2022 high with Realty Income down 27% or so from its 2020 peak. In other words, neither of these two REITs have fully recovered all of the ground they lost. That suggests that there could still be more upside from here. And it could be fairly substantial.', ""But the real attraction of these two REITs is their positions within the respective niches they serve. Prologis, with a market cap of $120 billion, is one of the largest REITs in existence. Realty Income, with a market cap a touch over $40 billion, is more than twice as large as its next closest peer. Cost of capital is a key point of differentiation in the REIT world, and both of these REITs have the size to more easily access the capital markets than their competitors. Then there's the benefit conferred by being able to execute deals that are simply too large for smaller players to touch, which is another important differentiator."", 'On top of that, both Prologis and Realty Income have globally diversified portfolios. Prologis has a greater geographic reach, offering lessees a single source for warehouse space across North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. The company also happens to own development land in all of those areas as well, so it can grow along with demand (or just sit on the land, waiting for demand to develop as the global economy grows).', ""Realty Income's foreign exposure is largely in Europe, where the net lease approach (requiring tenants to pay most property-level operating costs) is still relatively new. So there's a notable growth opportunity in the region, particularly for a REIT large enough to do big deals and be a trusted partner."", 'All of that is to say that the fundamentals for Prologis and Realty Income remain strong. For added proof of that, Prologis was able to increase rents by an average of roughly 50% in the third quarter of 2023 on renewing leases. And Realty Income was able to recapture 106.9% of expiring lease rents as it signed new deals. These are not businesses that are struggling today, despite the still relatively dour view on Wall Street.', ""If you fear you have missed out on the REIT recovery, don't get too upset. There are still some industry-leading stocks that appear to offer additional recovery potential. That said, it might make sense to stick with the largest and best-positioned competitors, like Prologis and Realty Income, since both continue to execute well on the business front."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Realty Income wasn't one of them.

And catch the latest in major events and hear from the top players on Truck Tech at 3 p.m. Wednesdays on the FreightWaves YouTube channel.', 'Global automakers like Hyundai and Tier 1 suppliers like Robert Bosch talked about how they plan to incorporate hydrogen to power fuel cells and directly into engines.', 'In Hyundai’s case, it envisions a logistics ecosystem using Xcient fuel cell-powered trucks to move parts into and haul finished electric vehicles out of its Metaplant in Ellabell, Georgia, near Savannah. That includes making hydrogen on-site through electrolysis using electricity and water. Hyundai also sees hydrogen as a fuel for its energy-intense heavy-duty equipment business.', 'When powered by green hydrogen made from renewable sources like solar and wind, an H2 ICE engine is practically carbon-neutral.', 'Bosch claims fuel cell orders from European, Chinese and U.S. truck makers. Outside the mobility- and transportation-themed West Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center, Nikola gave short demonstration rides in its fuel cell electric truck powered with Bosch’s fuel cell system.', 'The German supplier is also working on components for an ICE that converts hydrogen fuel directly into energy without first converting it into electricity as it does in a fuel cell. It plans to debut its H2 ICE this year.', 'Enthusiasm for hydrogen engines can be traced to Europe’s acceptance of H2 ICE as a zero-emissions technology because of the absence of carbon dioxide. Burning hydrogen creates small amounts of nitrogen oxides. European governments seem willing to look the other way. In the U.S. — and especially California — NOx emissions are a focus of coming regulations.', '“The indication from EPA is that it will qualify as a zero-emission CO2 technology. California does not allow H2 ICE currently under the ACT [Advanced Clean Trucks] rule. That’s something we have discussed with them,” said Carl Hergart, Paccar senior director of powertrain planning.', 'Cummins Inc. first promoted an H2 ICE engine as part of a fuel-agnostic makeover of its engine families.

Paccar has paid deposits from more than 550 customers between Kenworth and Peterbilt. Fuel cell trucks for both brands will be assembled at Kenworth’s Renton, Washington, plant.', 'Hergart talked about how the Bellevue, Washington, parent of Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF Trucks views hydrogen and a battery-making joint venture with rival Daimler and supplier/competitor Cummins, as well as what it is learning from SuperTruck 2 projects at Peterbilt and Kenworth. The following is edited for clarity and conciseness.', 'HERGART: All our trucks are connected so we know where the trucks are. We can provide data on where it makes sense to establish fueling stations. We’re not in the business of building fuel stations or producing hydrogen. But we can be active in this dialogue with the producers, the customers and people operating fuel stations.', 'HERGART: From a sustainability perspective, of course we want to see green hydrogen. But there’s a lot of misconceptions about green and gray and blue hydrogen. Most of the hydrogen produced today, even gray hydrogen [from natural gas] is 99.999% pure. So whether it’s gray hydrogen produced from steam methane reforming or green hydrogen produced through electrolysis, for the most part both are suitable to run a fuel cell or a hydrogen ICE.', 'HERGART: When you have nitrogen and oxygen reacting at high temperatures, you’re going to form NOx. But there are ways of addressing that. The [DAF Trucks HD] demonstrator in Europe shows that there’s potential to get down to very low levels of NOx. We don’t want the perfect to be the enemy of the good here.', 'HERGART: You have a much better cycle life from an LFP cell chemistry than nickel, manganese and cobalt. NMC may have a little bit better energy density. But you have a worse cycle life, so durability is one aspect. Thermal stability is important. And you get away from the challenging materials like nickel and cobalt. So that’s what really makes it the best fit for truck applications.', 'HERGART: The 48-volt mild-hybrid system is significant because you can power auxiliaries electrically rather than running them off of the front-wheel drive. You really have to take a holistic view of the power consumption on the truck. Ultimately the value of 48-volt is that you reduce the current. And when you reduce the current, you reduce the amount of copper. So you reduce cost and you make it more efficient as well. The question is, do you introduce a third [electronic] bus? It’s a matter of making the business case work, but it’s clear there’s an efficiency potential benefit by adding 48-volt.', 'Talk about a marriage of convenience.

In August, it announced a merger with U.K. electric truck maker Tevva. ElectraMeccanica got cold feet and claimed Tevva didn’t disclose everything it should. Tevva responded by filing a suit seeking $75 million.', '“Based on our diligence, which included discussions with key customers, we believe that Xos is well-positioned in the rapidly growing commercial electric vehicle market,” Dietmar Ostermann, ElectraMeccanica’s strategic committee chair, said in a news release.', '“By leveraging ElectraMeccanica’s balance sheet to accelerate Xos’ growth and leadership position, the proposed transaction provides ElectraMeccanica’s shareholders with the opportunity to participate in Xos’ exciting future prospects.”', 'Xos has delivered more than 600 electric vehicles to fleets since 2020.

However, the global snack provider has been capitalizing on all opportunities to drive long-term growth by focusing on operational improvements and thoughtfully expanding its product offerings.', ""Focus on core categories has been working well for MDLZ. As consumers prefer snacking over traditional meals, the company’s core categories — chocolates and biscuits — have historically depicted resilience to economic downturns and pricing actions. Consumers in developed countries consider chocolates and biscuits as affordable indulgences, and some of the most-valued snacking products.The company’s core chocolate and biscuit categories remain sustainable in both developed and emerging markets. Both these categories registered double-digit growth in the third quarter of 2023, up 12.4% and 14.9% in biscuit and chocolate, respectively. Management is focused on expanding these categories, as they have considerable scope for consumption growth. Apart from this, the company has benefited from past acquisitions like Ricolino, Clif Bar and Chipita, which have bolstered its portfolio.In its third-quarter 2023 earnings call, MDLZ highlighted the strong momentum in its business growth, which it expects to continue benefiting both the top and bottom lines moving forward. However, per management, pricing is likely to be a less significant contributor to financial performance going forward compared with fiscal 2022.Mondelez's diverse product portfolio continues to drive strong top-line momentum.

So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We can see that Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) does use debt in its business. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky."", ""Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum ', 'You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Occidental Petroleum had US$19.1b of debt in September 2023, down from US$20.1b, one year before. However, it does have US$611.0m in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$18.4b.', 'We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Occidental Petroleum had liabilities of US$8.94b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$33.6b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$611.0m and US$3.67b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities total US$38.2b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.', ""This deficit is considerable relative to its very significant market capitalization of US$51.0b, so it does suggest shareholders should keep an eye on Occidental Petroleum's use of debt. Should its lenders demand that it shore up the balance sheet, shareholders would likely face severe dilution."", 'We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).', ""With net debt sitting at just 1.3 times EBITDA, Occidental Petroleum is arguably pretty conservatively geared. And it boasts interest cover of 8.4 times, which is more than adequate. It is just as well that Occidental Petroleum's load is not too heavy, because its EBIT was down 48% over the last year. When a company sees its earnings tank, it can sometimes find its relationships with its lenders turn sour. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Occidental Petroleum's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting."", ""Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Happily for any shareholders, Occidental Petroleum actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT over the last three years. That sort of strong cash generation warms our hearts like a puppy in a bumblebee suit."", ""Occidental Petroleum's EBIT growth rate and level of total liabilities definitely weigh on it, in our esteem. But the good news is it seems to be able to convert EBIT to free cash flow with ease. Looking at all the angles mentioned above, it does seem to us that Occidental Petroleum is a somewhat risky investment as a result of its debt. Not all risk is bad, as it can boost share price returns if it pays off, but this debt risk is worth keeping in mind. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Occidental Petroleum , and understanding them should be part of your investment process."", ""Of course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today."", 'Have feedback on this article?

This would be in stark contrast to the sector's slow performance during 2023."", 'On January 4, Jeff Currie, Goldman Sachs Partner Alumnus, and Advisory Board Chair at the University of Chicago\'s Energy Policy Institute, joined CNBC\'s ""Squawk Box"" to give his take on the energy sector and oil markets entering into 2024. Here\'s what he had to say:', '""It is the most investable space out there in the economy right now. The return on capital employed exceeds 20% in many parts of the world.""', 'Like Currie, many other financial analysts today are persisting with their positive outlook for the energy and oil markets in 2024. However, global geopolitical tensions are resulting in some concern. For instance, indiscriminate attacks in the Red Sea against commercial vessels are leading to widespread concern over the impact of such attacks on the energy sector. However, according to US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, the impact of such attacks on the energy sector is considerably low at this point. Granholm joined CNBC\'s ""Squawk Box"" on January 5 to discuss this issue. Here\'s what she said:', '""With respect to how we\'re seeing it play out in the energy space is that, so far, the ongoing conflict and attacks, which are indiscriminate, they\'re really not on any commercial vessel that\'s coming through, whether it\'s touching or related to Israel or not, but this conflict, they have not really been successful in getting their targets. This conflict has really only had a limited impact on energy prices. For us, in the US, gas prices, for example, are at $3.09, today. More than $1.93 lower than the peak after Putin\'s war.""', 'Considering the above, many investors may benefit from beginning to look at oil and energy stocks as compelling investments heading into the new year. There seem to be many attractive options in the industry today, such as hot oil stocks with high demand, like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Kinder Morgan, Inc. (NYSE:KMI), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX). Apart from these oil companies though, there are many other options available to energy investors this year as well. On December 6, Rob Thummel, Tortoise Senior Portfolio Manager, joined CNBC\'s ""Closing Bell Overtime"" to discuss energy investment options for investors in 2024. Here\'s what he had to say:', '""If oil\'s lower for longer, that means demand\'s probably going to go up. You\'re gonna transport more energy. And so, energy infrastructure is a great place to be in the energy asset class, if you\'re looking for an energy play. Also with a lot of these energy infrastructure stocks, you get really high dividend yields. So as we look at 2024, interest rates are probably coming down, the 10-year is probably coming down, so if investors are looking for \'where can I get exposure to the equity market, but also significant cash income?\' energy infrastructure is a great place to be.""', ""Generally speaking, energy as a whole can thus be said to be a highly attractive investment space for investors this year. Whether you pick one of the hot oil stocks we've named below or energy infrastructure names for dividends, you're bound to be in good hands. The stocks we have listed below are among the top hot oil stocks to buy now, and they include some undervalued oil stocks as well."", 'An oil rig surrounded by the expanse of sea, the pumping operations in progress.', 'Our Methodology', ""To select the stocks for our list, we used a stock screener to identify oil stocks with an average three-month volume of over five million as of January 9.

However, three Motley Fool contributors think they've identified some that come close. Here's why they picked Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY), Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO), and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX)."", ""Keith Speights (Eli Lilly): Over the last 12 months, Eli Lilly's shares have skyrocketed close to 80% higher. Along the way, the company became the biggest drugmaker in the world based on market cap. I look for Lilly to keep its momentum going in 2024."", ""Lilly's lineup already included huge winners such as type 2 diabetes drugs Jardiance and Mounjaro, autoimmune disease drugs Olumiant and Taltz, and breast cancer drug Verzenio going into 2023. But in November, the company added what is likely to become its most successful product ever with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval of Zepbound for chronic weight management."", 'Actually, Zepbound just might be on track to become the biggest-selling drug of all time for any pharmaceutical company. Analysts project that it and its sibling, Mounjaro, could combine for peak annual sales of more than $50 billion. (Zepbound and Mounjaro share the same active ingredient --- tirzepatide.) Roughly two-thirds of that peak sales total is likely to come from the weight-loss indication for which Zepbound is approved.', ""But Lilly still has other potential growth drivers that could add icing to the cake. Sales for its newer cancer drugs Retevmo and Tyvyt continue to pick up momentum. The company also hopes to soon win U.S. approval for donanemab in treating early-stage Alzheimer's disease. Morningstar predicts that donanemab will rake in sales of nearly $4.9 billion by 2027, if approved."", ""The only major impediment I see for Lilly is investors' perception of its valuation. Shares currently trade at a forward-earnings multiple of over 51. I think, though, that Lilly's longer-term growth justifies its seemingly premium price tag."", ""David Jagielski (Novo Nordisk): After a strong year in 2023 with its shares up nearly 53%, Novo Nordisk looks poised for another stellar performance in 2024. The company still isn't running out of growth opportunities as it is still in the relatively early stages of rolling out its injectable weight-loss drug, Wegovy, around the world."", 'The company is spending $6 billion to boost its production capacity to help meet the growing demand for Wegovy, a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonist, which in trials has helped people lose an average of 15% of their body weight. Novo Nordisk is also working on a pill form which could be an even more popular option for patients.', ""Even amid all that growing demand, the company is still a global market leader, with Novo Nordisk estimating that its market share in the global GLP-1 segment is more than 54%. Patients have been using its diabetes drug Ozempic off-label as a treatment for weight loss, but with Wegovy potentially delivering even better results, there's plenty of runway for the stock to do even better this year as Wegovy becomes more widely available."", ""Novo Nordisk reported net sales of 166.4 billion Danish krone ($24.4 billion) over the first nine months of 2023, growing at a rate of 29% year over year, while the company's profit improved by 47%. With excellent margins and a lot more growth still on the way, 2024 could be another strong year for the stock."", ""Prosper Junior Bakiny (Vertex Pharmaceuticals): Unstoppable is an adjective that describes Vertex Pharmaceuticals well. Over the past decade, the drugmaker has substantially outperformed the broader market. In fact, pick any time frame of a year or more in the past 10 years, and there is an excellent chance Vertex's performance is above average in the period. There's no secret behind the company's success."", 'Vertex Pharmaceuticals is basically the only game in town for patients with a rare disease called cystic fibrosis (CF). It markets the only drugs in the world that address the underlying causes of CF. It has been the only therapeutic area in which Vertex sold medications in the last decade until recently, when, together with its partner, CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ: CRSP), it earned approval for Casgevy.', ""This innovative gene-editing treatment targets sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia, two rare blood disorders. Casgevy's potential is enormous, but Vertex Pharmaceuticals is still hard at work. In the next five years, it expects newer CF products, another that treats acute and neuropathic pain, and a potential repeat of its CF success in treating APOL1-mediated kidney disease, a condition for which there are no treatments that address the underlying causes."", ""That's not an exhaustive list of Vertex Pharmaceuticals' programs. Given the company's excellent track record, a lineup that can still drive solid top-line growth, and a pipeline that should lead to key approvals in the midterm, it's hard to imagine the company underperforming the market from here on out. Investors looking for an unstoppable stock need not look further: Vertex Pharmaceuticals is it."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Vertex Pharmaceuticals right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Vertex Pharmaceuticals, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Vertex Pharmaceuticals wasn't one of them.

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$6.55b', 'US$7.62b', 'US$9.51b', 'US$10.5b', 'US$11.2b', 'US$11.8b', 'US$12.3b', 'US$12.8b', 'US$13.2b', 'US$13.6b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x6', 'Analyst x5', 'Analyst x3', 'Analyst x2', 'Est @ 6.78%', 'Est @ 5.41%', 'Est @ 4.45%', 'Est @ 3.78%', 'Est @ 3.31%', 'Est @ 2.99%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.6% ', 'US$6.1k', 'US$6.6k', 'US$7.6k', 'US$7.8k', 'US$7.7k', 'US$7.6k', 'US$7.4k', 'US$7.1k', 'US$6.8k', 'US$6.5k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$71b', ""After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage.

In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth.

I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty."", 'Andrew Philip Witty', ""Thank you, and good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. As we conclude 2023 and embark on a new year, I'd like to express my gratitude to our more than 400,000 talented colleagues who really are UnitedHealth Group. It's directly due to their tireless efforts over the past year that we expanded our opportunities to serve more people more comprehensively. As I reflect on our 2023 performance, certainly, the shift in care activity among seniors was an important element for us to manage effectively. And the reduced Medicare Advantage funding outlook was a significant influence on how we prepared for 2024 and all the way through to 2026. Despite the shift in care patterns and the commensurate pressure felt during '23, we've been able to both deliver on our growth commitments and invest and prepare for a reduced MA funding cycle over the next 3 years. Even considering these factors, 2023 marked a year of balanced, sustainable growth for UnitedHealth Group. Importantly, we also strengthened the foundations from which we will continue to grow in 2024 and beyond. To illustrate briefly. During 2023, Optum Health approached growth of 900,000 more patients under value-based care. UnitedHealthcare added over 1.7 million new consumers in its Medicare and commercial offerings. Optum Rx managed an additional 100 million prescriptions for people. Optum Financial handled more than $500 billion in consumer, payer and care provider payments. And OptumInsight facilitated more than 23 billion electronic transactions. The increasingly impactful ways we can engage with patients, consumers, care providers and customers resulted in revenue growth of over $47 billion and adjusted earnings per share growth of over 13% in 2023. Looking to '24, '25 and beyond, we will continue to drive quality, simplicity, affordability and accessibility to help improve health care system-wide. And we remain confident in and committed to our long-term 13% to 16% adjusted earnings per share growth rate. Having held our investor conference just 6 weeks ago, I'll take only a few minutes this morning to recap what you should expect from us this year, starting with our work in value-based care. Value-based care for us is a proven way of overcoming many of the widely recognized shortcomings of a fee-for-service-based health system, such as fragmented consumer experience and incentives that can emphasize volume over quality. Our value-based offerings empower physicians to provide more connected, coordinated and comprehensive care, align incentives among consumers, care providers and health plans, deliver better health outcomes and improve costs. At the end of 2023, Optum Health served more than 4 million patients in fully accountable value-based arrangements in partnership with many dozens of health plans. By the end of this year, Optum Health will grow to serve at least another 750,000 patients under such arrangements for a total of more than twice the number of people we served just 2 years ago. Yet even with the strong growth and significant investments we've made, our market presence is still quite modest and the opportunity expansive: 4 million patients served, just a small fraction of the many more people whose health ultimately will benefit from these models of care; and a total Optum Health revenue base, which today represents only 2% of the $5 trillion U.S. health care system spend. We have a considerable distance to go to achieve the broad, positive system-wide impact for people's health we believe we can help drive. Turning to our consumer focus. We're working hard to help consumers more easily find experience and pay for health care, and that includes using their health benefits. One example of our progress can be seen in the results of UnitedHealthcare's commercial benefits business. Our most recently completed selling season was among our strongest in recent years. The majority of this growth will come from our relationships with large employers, among the most sophisticated buyers of health benefits. Our customers tell us we are focused on what their employees value most: Lower cost, simpler experiences and adaptable benefits that meet their unique needs and circumstances. And the consumer NPS for these new innovative products is some 20-plus points higher than traditional health plans. But we have more to do. Our goal is to become the trusted source for health care information and advice, a go-to marketplace for health services, payments and benefits, all through a few simple taps on a consumer's phone. One of our larger consumer offerings is Medicare Advantage, which I'd like to touch on briefly. We're proud of our long track record of growth and of delivering for the people who choose our offerings. During the recently completed annual enrollment period, we added about 100,000 more consumers, and we remain committed to our full year goal of 450,000 to 550,000. We believe our assumptions of ongoing care activity and approach to supplemental benefit management are entirely appropriate for the environment we are planning for and feel positive about our positioning for growth entering this 3-year period. One additional item as we close out the year. To achieve our enterprise-wide long-term goals, we must consistently ensure best use of our resources, both time and capital, to enable us to serve people more effectively and deliver value for our shareholders. As you likely saw, we recently agreed to the sale of our Brazil operations, where our dedicated colleagues serve people with care and compassion. We highly value the relationships we've developed over more than a decade in Brazil. After carefully evaluating our best course, we ultimately determined a sale was the right step for the people we serve and for us, to best focus our energies on the many compelling growth opportunities that we consistently discuss with you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dirk McMahon, UnitedHealth Group's President and Chief Operating Officer. Dirk?"", 'Dirk C. McMahon', ""Thanks, Andrew. Our growth is rooted in innovation and our intense desire always to do better. We're investing heavily in ways to accomplish that, increasing digital engagement and using AI to be more efficient, and then measuring our performance through Net Promoter Scores to be sure we're hitting the mark. The impact of our digital engagement efforts was evident in our 1/1 performance metrics. As Andrew noted, we brought on one of our biggest cohorts of new people served via our commercial offerings, and our technology played an important role in making the process work well. Since last month, the UHC mobile app consistently ranked #1 or #2 in the Apple App Store medical category and on Google Play. Through the first week of the year, mobile app installs were up over more than 100% year-over-year, and our chat volume was more than twice our historical average. At Optum Rx, digital investments enabled us to bring on a record number of new clients who brought with them more than 3 million new consumers, onboarded with improved customer service scores and at an overall cost 8% lower than last year. More consumers served, higher satisfaction and lower costs. Our investments in AI and other advanced technology play an important role in improving customer service and in productivity throughout the enterprise. For example, we are removing repetitive tasks from our workflows by using AI to help with tasks, such as responses to consumer inquiries, updating provider directories and summarizing interactions with customers and patients. This frees up our service staff and clinicians to focus on solving more complicated tasks for the people we serve. And recently, we launched a new capability where we use real-time admissions and discharge data to engage high-risk MA members immediately after an emergency department visit, enabling them to follow up care to ensure high-quality post-admit outcomes and avoid readmissions. This rapid response, driven by timely clinical, data has improved member engagement rates by over 300% and has an NPS of 83. NPS remains a vital way to measure how we're performing for our customers and consumers and how our digital initiatives and other efforts are impacting those measures and leading to improved retention. A couple of examples. Through digital optimization, we're providing consumers with on-demand access to care, highly personalized benefits information, real-time support and integrated pharmacy capabilities. This is translating into significant NPS improvements in many of our businesses. And we've removed friction from the system through expanded access to 24/7 virtual visits and UnitedHealthcare's efforts to eliminate nearly 20% of prior authorizations. Throughout '24, you should expect to see an even greater investment in our digital capabilities as we continue to identify opportunities to: Leverage technology to reduce administrative costs, improve productivity and further enhance the consumer experience at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. And now I'll turn it over to John Rex, UnitedHealth Group's Chief Financial Officer. John?"", 'John F. Rex', ""Thank you, Dirk. Our colleagues' ongoing focus on further expanding and strengthening the foundations which underpin our growth pillars is paving the way for consistent growth in 2024 and beyond. Revenue in '23 of $372 billion grew by over 14%, with double-digit growth at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $6.16 grew 15% and brought full year adjusted earnings per share to $25.12, growth of 13%. As Andrew noted earlier, at the end of December, we entered into an agreement to sell our Brazil operations and expect to close in the first half of this year. Upon closing, we expect to record a charge of approximately $7 billion, the majority of which is noncash and largely due to foreign currency translation losses accumulated over several years. The impact of this onetime charge will be excluded from our '24 adjusted earnings per share measure. For your modeling purposes, the full year '24 outlook incorporated about $6 billion of revenue for Brazil or about 1.5% of consolidated revenue. Before reviewing our business results, I'll offer some brief comments on care activity. Care patterns remain consistent with those we shared with you in the first half of '23. Activity levels continue to be led by outpatient care for seniors, with orthopedic and cardiac procedure categories among the more prominent. As we've noted, our benefit design approach assumed these activity levels persist throughout '24, and the care patterns we observed exiting '23 reconfirmed that decision. On the margin, we saw some modest late year seasonal activity, such as strong and welcome response from seniors to schedule physician visits to receive RSV vaccinations. In some cases, these were accompanied by additional necessary care being obtained, especially for people that had not seen a physician in some time, a positive outcome for people's health. In sum though, as we reflect on full year '23 results, overall care activity was broadly in line with the views we've shared earlier. And as we enter '24, we're confident in the response of pricing and benefit design actions we undertook, with care patterns continuing to be supportive of our care ratio outlook of 84%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Turning to the performance of our businesses in '23. Optum Health's revenues grew by 34% to over $95 billion as we increased the number of patients served under value-based care arrangements by about 900,000 to more than 4.1 million, expanded services in the home and broadened and deepened the levels and types of care we offer. OptumInsight's revenues grew 30% to $18.9 billion. We concluded the year with a revenue backlog of $32.1 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion over last year. This growth was driven by our diverse and expanding product portfolio which connects many of the key stakeholders across health care. Whether it's launching new decision support solutions for providers, claims-editing software for payers, or simplifying the payment process for all, our continued investments are fostering the next phase of OptumInsight growth. Optum Rx revenues grew 16% to over $116 billion, driven by the continued addition of new clients, expansion within existing relationships and organic growth of our pharmacy services businesses. In 2023, both customer retention and new wins were among the best Optum Rx has delivered. At UnitedHealthcare, full year revenues of over $281 billion grew nearly 13%. Adding to Andrew's earlier comments, within Medicare Advantage, we expect a majority of our full year growth outlook to be realized outside the annual enrollment period, with the growth patterns consistent with those we have experienced over more recent years. Our Medicaid enrollment outlook for 2024 balances 2 key elements. First is that state redetermination activities will be largely completed by midyear. And second, that growth within existing states, such as North Carolina and other new opportunities, will partially offset these impacts. Within our domestic commercial offerings, we expect to serve about 1.5 million additional people in '24, a strong result. And we are encouraged by the continued positive customer response we are experiencing as we look ahead. Our ample capital capacities continue to underpin our long-term growth objectives. Cash flow from operations in '23 was $29 billion or 1.3x net income. We returned nearly $15 billion to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends and deployed over $10 billion in growth capital to build for the future. To summarize. Our '23 performance and start to the new year further solidifies and reinforces our confidence in both the '24 and long-term growth objectives we shared with you at the end of November. Now I'll turn it back to Andrew."", 'Andrew Philip Witty', ""Thanks, John, and thank you, Dirk. Heading into 2024, I hope you all sense our confidence. We have talented people who are committed to our effort to help build a simpler, more consumer-friendly health system for the people we serve. And we're well positioned to continue to deliver on the well-established commitments we've made. Operator, let's open it up for questions."", 'Operator', ""(Operator Instructions) We'll go first to Justin Lake with Wolfe Research."", 'Justin Lake', ""I wanted to touch on the cost trend commentary. Specifically, between the Investor Day and the end of the year, it looks like the MLR was a little bit higher. Can you tell us what you saw there over that last month? Maybe give us some color. John, I know you guys did a great job in the second quarter of getting ahead of cost trend and utilizing some of those facility kind of insights that you have on scheduling, et cetera. We're trying to figure out whether this is just seasonality or a further pickup in utilization given the Q3 to Q4 that you saw. So maybe you could tell us what you're seeing into January. And just tell us where you think the Q1 comes in versus the full year."", 'Andrew Philip Witty', ""Justin, thanks so much for the question. Let me just make a couple of comments, and then I'll ask John Rex to give you a little bit more detail on the area you just talked about. So I think overall, as we look at '23, overall, it came in very much in the sort of zone we expected. Towards the top end of that zone, but very much within the zone of what we're expecting for the full year and we signaled back in the middle of the year. And the bulk of that story is driven by the outpatient shift in behavior around seniors that we talked about back in June. You're right, though. Post the investor conference, what we certainly saw was a click up in some seasonal activity, each of which individually are kind of pretty small, but added together, just made a bit of a difference in that last run out of the quarter. Around things like RSV vaccination, which has brought with it, dragged with it, if you will, some extra utilization of services from seniors who've come in for their vaccine. Listen. To be clear, all of that is good news for health care, right? So these are seniors, many of whom have not been to the office for a long time. They've come back in and now got vaccinated. The physicians have picked up other things while they've been there. So a little bit of that going on, combined with a little bit of heightened COVID activity just as we rolled out the year. None of which we really think is durably impacting our outlook for '24. So we feel very solid around our '24 guidance point of 84%, plus or minus 50 bps. Maybe I'll ask John just to give you a little bit more click-down kind of insight into all of that now. Go ahead, John."", 'John F. Rex', ""Justin, you're absolutely right. So the prime factor here when we think about the full year view and where we ended up being what we talked about, much earlier in the year in terms of the outpatient care activity among senior populations; and that continuing consistent with what we saw back much earlier in the year and very supportive of what we staked out in terms of the benefit design that we stepped into '24 with, in particular for senior populations and our Medicare Advantage product. So all those elements very much supportive of that view and the activities we undertook earlier in the year. As it relates to kind of where we landed the full year, so 10 basis points really above kind of what we indicated at the investor conference back in November of differential. And Andrew hit on those items, let me just kind of take it a little bit deep here. So definitely some typical seasonality involved in there. And the incremental elements were -- I'd point out a couple of items. Seniors did really respond strongly to RSV vaccinations and scheduled physician visits. Sometimes those physician visits, what we noted, were driving other care activity around that. So in some cases, seniors that hadn't perhaps been to a physician in a little while. And so they visited their PCP, got an RSV vaccine. And then in the meantime, their PCPs were able to close some additional care gaps as they were over there. It was a great thing because some of these seniors haven't been in for a while. So important activity to occur there in the fourth quarter. So that was one of the elements that we saw there. As it relates to kind of what we were seeing with the elevated care costs for COVID. What we saw in the fourth quarter and particularly in December, overall, what we've been noticing is COVID admits for our inpatient states are running a higher cost per case than we traditionally saw. That actually kind of makes some sense. There are more intense cases typically that are going into inpatient state. I will say we did notice in December that the total level of COVID admits were probably 50% to 60% above the October, November average that we had seen. So that was kind of the highest part of the year in terms of COVID inpatient admits. If I take those elements in sum together that more than accounts for the 10 basis points differential in our full year view, Justin. As that pertains to your second question, as we look out into the next year and what we see in terms of patterns, I would call it patterns commensurate kind of with what we saw this year in terms of just the movement with this kind of 84% view that we view for the full year. As I step back and reflected just kind of thinking about where -- broadly where the analyst consensus is, you picked particularly the 1Q, it's kind of in the right -- it looks like an appropriate zone in terms of staked out there for what one would expect. Thank you, Justin."", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Josh Raskin with Nephron Research."", 'Joshua Richard Raskin', ""Can you describe the competitive environment for Medicare Advantage? And I'm specifically thinking about how you've adjusted benefits in 2024 as part of a 3-year process. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it sounds like you're trying to adjust for the majority of the risk model changes in one fell swoop. And I'm curious how you think that plays out and positions you not just for '24, but then for '25 and '26 as well."", 'Andrew Philip Witty', ""Josh, thank you so much. Before I ask Tim Noel to give you more detail on your question, I mean, listen. I think the way we've looked at the shift in the rate notice is a 3-year set of adjustments, and that's why we've been very thoughtful about how we plan, not just, frankly, benefit design, but how we continue to accelerate our management of OpEx through the organization, how we've continued to focus on eliminating unnecessary care and waste within the system through our various medical management capabilities. So it's really a 3-pronged set of agendas which we're going to be focused on over the next 3 years. And we've been very, very thoughtful about making sure that we are setting those tables in a way which we can be sustainable on through this cycle so that we're not taking sharp left turns or right turns halfway through the period. With that kind of overall perspective, maybe ask Tim to give you a little bit more deep dive on the competitive environment and how he's very specifically planning for this."", 'Timothy John Noel', ""Yes. Thanks, Josh, for the question. So I agree with Andrew's comments, and couple of things to start with is there's been a number of changes to the Medicare Advantage and Part D programs over the last 18 months to 2 years that are really phasing in over multiple years. And as we plan for 2024, we once again took a very rational view to the environment and also a long-term view with always our overarching goal being benefit stability for our members. As we step into benefit planning in future years, we really feel like we have got a very thoughtful way to respond to all of those changes that will be encountered by the Medicare Advantage and Part D programs into 2025 and beyond. And certainly, as we look forward, we don't believe that we have any material pricing catch-up to do in future periods and feel like we've got a very thoughtful response to the changes that will be encountered by the program into 2025 and 2026. So we think the forward view of our competitive outlook is quite solid and quite strong as we think about growth over the long term."", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to A.J. Rice with UBS."", 'Albert J. William Rice', ""Just -- I apologize, it's sort of granular, but we're getting asked a lot of questions about it. The 2 metrics, days claims payable down a couple of days, year-to-year, sequentially, some from third quarter. And then the prior period development being down $100 million maybe accounts for some of the variants on MLR, I'm guessing. I don't know if that's what you were guiding for when you updated -- last updated your outlook. But any comment on that as well?"", 'Andrew Philip Witty', 'Let me ask John to address that, A.J. Thank you.', 'John F. Rex', ""So first, on the days claims payable, so 2.8-day sequential decline, 2 days year-over-year. So primarily, the single largest factor would be exactly what you pointed to, the change in prior period development. So that has a significant impact. If you look about a year ago, where we were in prior period development and where we were even in the 3Q. So the significant impact on that part, that would be the other -- the main factor. In terms of other contributing factors that we saw. We did see in the fourth quarter some modest acceleration in provider claims submission timing. So just speed up in terms of those submissions, how quickly we're receiving them from date of service in terms of receipt. We also saw -- noted that, as it related to the fourth quarter, some higher claims intensity in the first part of the quarter, particularly October. So that's a factor that impacts the denominator, MedEx per day, in the days claims payable metric, and that was a piece that was in that also. As it relates to the $100 million of unfavorable medical development in the quarter, put that mostly at the items that we were talking about in my response to Justin's question. So the respiratory-related activity that we saw in there, the modestly higher cost per case for inpatient COVID admits, really kind of those were the main factors that we had in there in terms of contributing to the unfavorable development."", 'Andrew Philip Witty', ""No, it's a good question, A.J. And as John just said, even back in the sort of second half of Q3, we saw -- we've seen subsequently that this RSV pickup and this phenomena of more services being delivered around the vaccination was already starting as we were rolling out through Q3, which is really what explains that. So in many ways, this kind of Q3 issue of negative development and then the slight pressure at the end of the year is kind of the same story. And it all -- which is why we don't feel it has any real direct relevance in terms of thinking through 2024. Thanks for the question, though. I appreciate that."", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan."", 'Lisa Christine Gill', ""I want to go to Optum Health and just maybe talk about the medical cost trend there. John, just going specifically to the comments that you made. Did you see something similar in Optum Health? Are we seeing anything different there? And then also, I just want to understand the claim lag there. We've heard from some others that there can be a pretty big claim lag when we think about the providers versus the payers."", 'Andrew Philip Witty', 'So let me ask John to start, and then maybe ask Heather to make a couple of comments on the claim dynamic. Go ahead, John.', 'John F. Rex', ""Yes, Lisa, so definitely could have seeing seniors obtaining RSV vaccinations and kind of some of the respiratory activity that was going on in the quarter. So broadly similar features. For Optum Health, one of the comments that we've made throughout the year though also has to do with the progression here of taking on a large block of new membership. So we took on about 900,000 new members as we started the year. And one of the comments we've made throughout the year is engaging with these members. Because the most important thing we need to do is have a clinical engagement with these members in terms of start improving their health outcomes, getting them in to see physicians, having our clinicians interacting -- having -- interacting with them. And it's a comment we've made throughout the year as we've seen the Optum Health margin progression. So one of the great things, we probably started the year kind of roughly a 20% engagement level with that new -- about 900,000 member block. We exit the year having engaged with about 80% of these members. Super important factor as we think about Optum Health, as we think about 2024 and how -- and that progression. And that's been a big focus of the team at Optum Health all year long, of getting that engagement in so we can have impact on their health. But far and away, that's -- especially given what this population is like, they typically have complex needs, that's important. Another really important marker. As it relates to the new membership of patients that we're bringing in to Optum Health for 2024, again, so I talked about that 20% engagement level we started '23 with. For 2024, we're going to start with a 50% engagement level with that new membership. So we're making advances in that, and that's exactly what you should expect from the team. Their efforts have been really, really strong."", 'Andrew Philip Witty', ""Great. Thanks, John. Maybe, Heather, you could comment on Lisa's question around claims. And then I'd like to ask Amar also to follow up on your perspective on engagement and what's driving that. Please go ahead, Heather."", 'Heather Rachelle Cianfrocco', ""Sure. So the only thing -- the thing I would add, too, so I appreciate on top of John's point. When you think about engaging the patient early, then it's really in the clinician's hands. And I think that the way we think about our clinicians is that importance to your point about visibility then to kind of action. And the way we think about our clinicians is, once we get that engagement, and as John said, early engagement is so important, then our clinicians having the tools. And I think we've been -- what's really essential for us is those 130,000 clinicians having visibility early, what to do next. And the first thing is that they've got the technology, they've got solutions around them, they've got referral management practices, that they can engage with high-quality specialists when they need to for outpatient procedures. And then that they've got the supports in behavioral health and the home and community-based -- home and community services that we've been investing heavily in over the last year. And then the last thing I would point to is the contract protections that we've been focused on with our payers to be sure that the structures are in place so that our clinicians can practice in a responsible way. They've got visibility into the dynamics that are happening with the patients, and then they've got the supports in place with the payers."", 'Andrew Philip Witty', 'Amar?', 'Amar A. Desai', ""Yes. Thanks for that question. Look, I think I'd reiterate the point around our highest-risk complex members, where we're engaging at a 2x higher rate than the same time last year. And within engagement and our clinical programs, I'd focus around referral management and high-value, evidence-based medicine programs, including our Optimal Care program, where a majority of our clinicians are engaged with these evidence-based programs, are able to get patients the care that they need; and importantly, get the support with the provision of wraparound services, including specifically home-based services, so that the highest-risk groups have their care connected from the primary care setting into the home."", 'Andrew Philip Witty', 'Amar, thanks. And John, maybe just to tie up the whole question.', 'John F. Rex', ""Yes. And Lisa, tying up just on the last part of your question here regarding visibility into care activity, claims lag. No, we don't -- that's not a factor. Just given the model of Amar's business and how those groups run, we -- frankly, it's one of the areas where we get probably early sensing mechanisms in terms of the care activity that's going on. It's one of the early sensing mechanisms from much earlier in the year when we were able to talk about what we were seeing in the senior populations, and their -- the care activity within orthopedic and other procedures. So that's not a factor. In fact, if anything, it's probably a strength of the organization."", 'Andrew Philip Witty', ""Yes. Thanks, John. Lisa, thanks so much for the question. And we obviously just spent a couple of minutes there talking about engagement, and I hope that gave you a strong sense of some of the progress we've made over the last 12 months in this area. I would say we're night and day in a different position today than we were a year ago. In terms of our ability to be engaged with these complex patients, making sure our physicians are ready to go. That's a really important aspect of what's building our confidence for 2024. And I make no apology for just spending a couple more minutes making sure you hear some of the great work that's gone on over the last year, to ensure that we've got these very high levels of engagement and real substance behind that engagement, so that these patients will be supported and managed really positively going through '24. That's what then underpins and unlocks the whole opportunity of value-based care for Optum Health. Lisa, thank you for your question."", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo."", 'Stephen C. Baxter', ""I was hoping you could talk a little bit out what you're seeing for cost performance in the group commercial, or exchange, or Medicaid businesses. When you step back, is it still appropriate to attribute all the pressure really you've seen in 2023 to seniors? Or should we be on the line for anything else there?"", 'Andrew Philip Witty', ""Stephen, thanks so much. Maybe I'll ask Brian, just to give you a kind of overarching summary of what UHC is seeing in its different books of business. Brian?"", 'Brian Robert Thompson', ""Yes, I appreciate that. Thanks, Stephen, for the question. And I think I'll just lead with, I feel really good, not only about how we finished the year in UnitedHealthcare 2023 growth at the top end of our ranges, performance, run-in positions across the board. But also as we step into the businesses for 2024, feel very good about the key assumptions that underpin our plan, and very optimistic. And you mentioned a couple of areas. You're right. As we've discussed some of these elements with respect to cost trend, they are centered in our senior community. And I think the message around those other businesses, nothing to see here, and really aligned with our expectations, some good stability and durability in the underlying elements, both utilization and unit cost of our trend outlook, and obviously feel very confident in how we're showing up competitively when you look at our growth outlook. So very optimistic about UnitedHealthcare, durability in those other lines that you're suggesting, and a lot to look forward to here in the year."", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Lance Wilkes with Bernstein."", 'Lance Arthur Wilkes', ""Can you talk a little bit about Optum Rx, the drivers of growth in the quarter, in particular top line? And then if you can comment a little on revenue per Rx? And do you have any programs that, either in the fourth quarter or in '24, that you've been rolling out that are capturing some of the increased demand on topics like GLP-1s that might be contributors to some of the strong performance?"", 'Andrew Philip Witty', ""Lance, thanks so much for the question. Before I ask Patrick to start the response on Optum Rx, first off, I just want to note a super strong selling year for us in Optum Rx, probably our best ever. Extraordinary and across a wide range of categories, plans, public service, states, as well as obviously commercial. And really, really pleased with the differentiated product offering really built on transparency, choice and of course cost. And so we feel we've built a strong momentum in '23 rolling into '24. Patrick, you may want to go a little deeper, maybe share a little detail on Weight Engage, specifically around the question that Lance raised around GLPs."", 'Patrick Hugh Conway', ""Yes. Thanks, Lance, for the question. So as Andrew said, really diverse growth, both new business and high retention rates. So one of our best selling years ever. I'd also call out the pharmacy services expansion, the organic growth there across the diverse set of pharmacy services, cost management. And then last, as you mentioned, new products and services. Just to call out one, Weight Engage. So comprehensive management, medication, provider support, client support, lifestyle modification, digital. So a comprehensive solution across Optum, not just Optum Rx, partnering with Optum Health and OptumInsight. Already live with clients and robust interest in the marketplace because patients, members, employers want comprehensive solutions that demonstrate better health outcomes at lower total cost of care."", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America."", 'Kevin Mark Fischbeck', ""I guess I'm still just struggling with the concept of 2023 coming in worse, but this having no impact on the 2024 outlook. Are you saying that the incremental pressure is really just like flu, RSV, and therefore unlikely to replicate at these levels next year? Because the negative development speaks to costs earlier in the year also coming in worse, which implies that the baseline has -- the core baseline is also higher. So can you just help me reconcile why this isn't raising the base for next year? And I guess, within that, you may feel comfortable with the guidance range for MLR. But is there a reason to be at the higher end of the range to start the year? Or is the midpoint still where you're orienting?"", 'Andrew Philip Witty', ""So I'll ask John to go a little deeper. Obviously, as you know, Kevin, we've set an MLR target next year, which is in fact higher than the actual closeout for this year in any case, which takes into consideration some of that kind of elevation which we've seen throughout the year. So I'm going to call it the core elevation associated with the outpatient senior behaviors that we've been talking about now for several quarters. And then as we've talked a little bit already, this end of Q4 type of a small seasonality variation, we don't think is really durable or relevant to the rest of the year. But John, maybe go a little deeper on that."", 'John F. Rex', ""Sure. So -- yes. So the elements that contributed to the unfavorable development being around respiratory activity that was going on, as the seniors came in to get vaccines, another care was being delivered and such. And that higher inpatient cost per case for the COVID admits that we were seeing. So those would largely be the contributors of the elements that we are seeing here in terms of that unfavorability. So you're absolutely correct in your assumption. That doesn't impact our run-in assumption as we think about our outlook for 2024, and which -- so keeps us right squarely in where we thought we'd be as we were at our investor conference, is taking out the 84% plus/minus 50 basis points. Really as we look across the scope of our businesses and we think, reflect on how we performed in 2023, the scope of it being very much with what we saw back in midyear of 2023, this is -- the run-in factors are about outpatient care activity among senior populations which we incorporated into our bids. The elements that you're appropriately referring to in 4Q, again, not factors impacting our view at all in terms of how we staked out '24 and how we expect to perform in '24. Really good question."", 'Andrew Philip Witty', ""Yes. And I'd also just add, I mean, as you would fully expect, Kevin, we're reviewing the leading indicators of care activity, frankly, daily, weekly, monthly, and have been all year. And we've also been investing significantly in increasing numbers of early warning signals, if I can put it that way, to strengthen our radar capability to see this. And I can tell you, we're really not seeing any deviation from what we've been telling you all year in terms of the core activities across the system. The seasonal bumps at the end of the year, obviously, a little different. But in terms of outpatient utilization, all of those lines of activity that we've been discussing at different times with you, the patterns there, very supportive of how we've stepped out for '24."", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Scott Fidel with Stephens."", 'Scott J. Fidel', ""I was hoping to just hop back over to Optum Health for a second. And just as it relates, one, to the margin targets that you gave us at Investor Day, for the 7.7% to 8%, just want to see if those are still the appropriate targets for 2024. And then maybe if we could walk through the sort of pacing exercise with OH margins, given the expected step-up from the exit rate in the fourth quarter, how you're thinking about those OH margins for 1Q and then sort of pacing over the course of the year."", 'Andrew Philip Witty', ""Scott, thanks so much for the question. I'm going to ask Dr. Desai to make a couple of comments, and then I'm going to loop back to John just to talk through some of the phasing of the year around margin on that. But bottom line, no change in our guidance for Optimum Health. We feel good about going to talk about where we've staked out for Optum Health next year. A ton of work done during 2023 to strengthen the business. You saw that beginning to show through as we roll through the second half. We continue to expect that to be a very strong driver of improvement as we go into 2024. A lot of that work we talked about already today around engagement, is a key element of our confidence in being able to build our profile of that business. And Amar, maybe you could go a little deeper, and then John can close out with discussing on the progression."", 'Amar A. Desai', ""Thanks for the question, Scott. We're confident in our 7.7% to 8.0% target for 2024. We've discussed engagement in detail. The second important piece is our medical management programs, which we've scaled effectively. I talked a little bit about OptumCare and evidence-based guidelines. What I would reiterate is the work we're doing across our network with payment integrity. Again, with the idea of being able to provide the right support services across our network. The last piece I would also hit on is our initiatives around OpEx, which have been progressing well and are on track, driving operating efficiencies and G&A discipline across the organization. And it really with focus on more consistency in our systems and unification of our operating platform. So we feel very good about the 7.7% to 8.0% as we go into '24."", 'Andrew Philip Witty', 'Great. Thanks so much, Amar. John?', 'John F. Rex', ""Yes, Scott. So as Amar said, feel very good about where we established our margin objectives for 2024. The element super important here is, again, how these new patient cohorts progress as they come into our business, and we're able to engage with them clinically and improve their health outcomes, make sure we're able to close care gaps. And the progress that Amar and team's accomplished during 2023 in terms of getting those engagement levels will assist a lot in terms of the health of the people that we're serving here, and then particularly this cohort from 2023, the 900,000 new patients, that we're able to serve and how that business performs over the course of the year. So that's a big step into it. Another big step into it is this group of 750,000 new patients that came on to the business. The fact that we were able to get engagement levels significantly higher than where we were at last year with the new cohort will help also. So it gives us a lot of confidence in where we're stepping out in terms of serving these people throughout the course of the coming year. In terms of your comment, you'd expect typical than seasonality factors to weigh in how the quarters perform. So much more think about that as seasonality factors, so they're probably having impact here. So typical in terms of seasonal factors that we would have experienced this year, starting with a stronger base that sets us up well to reach our targets."", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley."", 'Erin Elizabeth Wilson Wright', ""So a question on Optum Rx. Over the past year, there's been some evolving dynamics around -- and news flow around the regulatory changes for PBMs. Unbundling, there were some news flow there as well as pharmacy reimbursement model changes, such as cost-plus type of approach. I guess how are you thinking about potential implications of some of these dynamics, if any at all? And do these dynamics have a material impact on Optum Rx? Or how are you thinking about those profit drivers remaining intact kind of going forward for the PBM?"", 'Andrew Philip Witty', ""Erin, thanks so much for the question. Let me ask Heather to give you some comments there. As you know, Heather's been very, very involved with the various legislative processes, and it'd good to get her perspective on that."", 'Heather Rachelle Cianfrocco', ""Sure. Thanks. So maybe just quickly, I'll say, completely respectful of the evolving dynamic, and just make the headline that our business is incredibly dynamic. I'd be remiss if I don't say, again, at this juncture, that we continue to engage because it's incredibly important to note that, in a space where affordable drugs -- affordable prescription drugs to consumers is on everybody's mind, including ours, and that's what the PBM is built to do. We are really pressing to make sure that policymakers understand that it's important to preserve choice for clients. It's important to make sure that we preserve value-based structures because we know that value-based is the way to ensure that we deliver lower price -- the lower-cost drugs, and we can't break that alignment of incentives where PBMs work with payers to reduce costs. And that it is incredibly important that discounts remain because there's no indication that rebates drive list cost -- list prices up. The PBMs work as a counterweight against high drug cost. That being said, you've seen in our model how diverse the business is. And across Optum Rx, across the PBM, across the pharmacy services, it's a multitude of businesses. And we really listen to our clients. We exist on behalf of our clients, and we compete in a highly competitive market, and we win because our model translates. It translates in transparency, it translates in innovation and it translates in partnership to our clients. So we'll follow the client, we'll be incredibly respectful of the legislation, but I feel really good that we act quickly, we act responsibly, and we work towards value. And you see that in the results. You see that in the growth. But most importantly, you see that in the client validation of the model. So I feel good about where we're positioned. I feel good about the experience in 2023 as a guide to that, but feel really confident in the growth in '24."", 'Andrew Philip Witty', ""Heather, thanks so much. And Erin, thanks very much for the question. I'm sure there will continue to be debate around this area. High drug cost, of course, is a big issue for everybody. First and foremost, we need to see list prices come down. That's the most important thing that can make a big difference here. I would say that as you look at all the different ideas which float up from time to time around reform in this area, there really isn't anything that we don't offer in some form or fashion to our clients and our customers. And the reality is we think that's the right position. We think we should be offering a portfolio of different tools, different product designs, which allows people to choose what's right for them. Because what a state wants, what a union wants, what are corporation wants differs. And it's super important that their views are taken into account here. We believe we do that well in the diversity of our product offering, and that's what's underpinning our record growth and it underpins our confidence for '24. I appreciate that, Erin."", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs."", 'Nathan Allen Rich', ""Great. I wanted to ask on the Medicare AEP enrollment that you talked about, the 100,000 lives that you added. I guess were there any differences in terms of what consumers responded to this year or differences in the retention rate relative to what you're expecting? And just can you help us think about the drivers of membership growth over the year as you need it to get to the guidance that you gave for the full year?"", 'Andrew Philip Witty', 'Yes, Nathan, thanks so much for the question. Let me ask Tim Noel to give you that.', 'Timothy John Noel', ""Yes. Thanks for the question, Nathan. So once again, the Medicare environment, selling environment is highly competitive. And we probably saw one of the more aggressive years of pricing that we've ever seen in the 2024 session. We guided at investor conference to growth of 450,000 to 550,000 lives, which is a little bit more modest than we have grown in past years, but it's reflective of our response to the new risk model changes, what we saw in outpatient utilization patterns early in '23 and reflecting that into 2024 pricing. And as we close out AEP, I would say that we were a little bit light against what we were thinking kind of end of November. Most of that actually is in the group business, some of the very aggressive benefits, a little bit more switching, drove some of our term rates a bit higher in AEP than we were initially thinking. But we still feel like we're going to have a much heavier weighting of our growth outside of the annual enrollment period, from February to December. And this is really just a continuation of a trend that we have seen play out over the last 5 years really. And in fact, last year, we drove 430,000 lives of growth or about 60% of our total growth in the period from February to December. This is a portion of the selling season that we really do well in -- given our large dual footprint and also the fact that some of the selling in AEP tends to be focused on some of those headline benefits that have been really aggressively positioned. And throughout the remainder of the year, there tends to be some switching back as folks think more deeply about things like network, the fulfillment of supplemental benefits, overall service and delivery of product. So I guess the headline is it is a very aggressive marketplace this year. We feel like we're positioned really well for '25 and '26 on how we priced, and very pleased with what we've done so far and excited about our opportunity, once again, to have a really great growth in the selling period from February to December of '24."", 'Andrew Philip Witty', 'Last question, please, operator.', 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Gary Taylor with Cowen."", 'Gary Paul Taylor', ""Most of my questions have been asked. I'll throw this one out, too. We've been seeing more articles about health system just dropping their MA contracts. Some of those articles cite United. I know historically, most of these types of contracts that -- conflicts that make the press historically ultimately come to term. So I'm just wondering, is this just a media thread? Or do you think there's something more measurable happening here with your health system partners?"", 'Andrew Philip Witty', 'Gary, thanks so much. Let me ask Brian to respond to that.', 'Brian Robert Thompson', ""Gary, thanks for the question. I would say, overall, the disruptions that we see in the market this year are, I would say, at or even lower than historical comparisons on average, leaving 2023. I will say though that any disruption for our consumers is too much. They come to rely on an in-network provider relationship. They have a coverage expectation from their health plan. So we obviously want to avoid that type of network disruption, and we however do need to balance that ambition with affordability. Now as we speak specifically to the Medicare Advantage space, we did have some deals that came down to the wire. And I do think that had some impact on AEP. And again, going to Tim's commentary around our confidence February forward, where we have those deals intact, I think you'll see that response in our growth as well. But again, on average, really not much change overall compared to historical periods on disruptions."", 'Andrew Philip Witty', ""Yes. No, it's well said, Brian. And I think, obviously, Gary, we -- what you're seeing here is we're working on -- really hard on behalf of our clients, on behalf of patients, on behalf of government, to make sure that we're getting the very best cost associated for the care delivered. And it's important that, that negotiation is robust. And the good news is that the overwhelming majority get resolved. We really don't like to see disruption happen. Unfortunately, occasionally, it does. But rest assured, we're making good progress in this area. As Brian said, no real kind of difference in outcome to what we've seen in previous years. With all of that, let me say thank you for all of your questions. Very much appreciated. And as you've heard, we're confident in our mission, focused on our growth pillars, delivering innovation that matters and disciplined in our operations and in our approach to the market.

He really wanted to hammer that home. Investors, he says, should know the underlying asset here. He said it's volatile, it's speculative. It kind of just highlighted how it sort of-- it felt to me again like maybe the SEC got kind of dragged kicking and screaming-- kicking and screaming into this one."", ""JARED BLIKRE: I wish they would use some caution with respect to their Twitter account or X account in securing the two-factor authorization. You got to make that next step, guys. But in all seriousness, look, this I think overall, with respect to Gensler, this is not a break for him.

That's right."", 'JARED BLIKRE: Oh, this is going to be the crypto-friendly SEC chair. That did not happen at all. But if we go to the Wi-Fi interactive, just want to point out something with respect to all these Bitcoin ETFs. Now, this is all the ETFs with Bitcoin exposure I could find.', ""The one in the green up here, that's an inverse ETF. And so this did not launch yesterday. This has been in existence for a while.

Those are significantly underperforming the underlying. And that underlying would be Bitcoin, which is down about 7%. So already we're seeing a lot of fluctuation in the prices."", ""So let me just highlight that one more time. 11.45% down there. And then you take a look at HODL, that's down 4%. That's a big disparity."", 'JOSH LIPTON: Yep.', ""JARED BLIKRE: And we're only on day two here."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Yeah, it's going to be fast.

And that's just been a critical struggle for airlines for decades."", 'JOSH LIPTON: Yeah, it was interesting. So if you look at the outlook here, Jared, so adjusted earnings are going to be $6 to $7 a share this year.

It's after reporting higher than anticipated medical expenses. This comes even as overall results beat estimates."", ""So this one was interesting, down in today's trade. This, remember, was the largest US managed care company by market value. First in the group to report, that's why all eyes tend to be on it."", ""And the issue here does sound like that, that it was-- the company reported higher medical expenses than the Street had estimated. Bloomberg noting that the company's medical loss ratio, so how much premium revenue is paid for care, that was worse than expected. The medical loss ratio 85%. Analysts had figured it was 83%."", ""JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, I do have some other commentary from the Street just taking a look at Cowen, which rates the stock an outperform with a price target of $605, saying of United, the quarter was a relatively low-quality beat. And they're saying that they maintain the 2024 guidance, so that's for this year. But it appears to be reliant on some moderation of medical cost trends, so maybe that's not realistic."", 'JP Morgan also weighing in they rate the stock an overweight. They say the health cost print that you were talking about here missed consensus and, quote, ""will likely raise recent cost trend concerns for the rest of the managed care group."" And I think we\'re seeing that reflected on the Wi-Fi interactive. If I look at my pharmacy and pharmacy benefits manager heat map here, United that\'s a big one, the kahuna, that\'s down 3.64%. Humana is down 3%.', 'JOSH LIPTON: Yeah, look at that.', ""JARED BLIKRE: And some others, Walgreens, for instance, Walgreens, Boots has its own problem. That's down 3%. But health care has picked up over the last two months. But I want to point out, UnitedHealth has not benefited from that. So that's another warning right there."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Yeah, if you look at the stock, it has not done much over the last year. But the vast majority of analysts say-- and maybe in part because of that performance-- this one's a buy. 23 buys, 3 holds, 1 sell."", 'JARED BLIKRE: You can always buy on value.', ""JOSH LIPTON: That's right.

The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Therefore, if you purchase Procter & Gamble's shares on or after the 18th of January, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 15th of February."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.94 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$3.76 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Procter & Gamble stock has a trailing yield of around 2.5% on the current share price of $150.6. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! As a result, readers should always check whether Procter & Gamble has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut."", ' See our latest analysis for Procter & Gamble ', ""Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Procter & Gamble paid out 59% of its earnings to investors last year, a normal payout level for most businesses. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Dividends consumed 62% of the company's free cash flow last year, which is within a normal range for most dividend-paying organisations."", ""It's positive to see that Procter & Gamble's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. For this reason, we're glad to see Procter & Gamble's earnings per share have risen 11% per annum over the last five years. Procter & Gamble is paying out a bit over half its earnings, which suggests the company is striking a balance between reinvesting in growth, and paying dividends. This is a reasonable combination that could hint at some further dividend increases in the future."", ""Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the past 10 years, Procter & Gamble has increased its dividend at approximately 4.6% a year on average. Earnings per share have been growing much quicker than dividends, potentially because Procter & Gamble is keeping back more of its profits to grow the business."", ""From a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Procter & Gamble? It's good to see earnings are growing, since all of the best dividend stocks grow their earnings meaningfully over the long run. However, we'd also note that Procter & Gamble is paying out more than half of its earnings and cash flow as profits, which could limit the dividend growth if earnings growth slows. Overall we're not hugely bearish on the stock, but there are likely better dividend investments out there."", ""In light of that, while Procter & Gamble has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. For example - Procter & Gamble has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of."", ""If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks."", 'Have feedback on this article?

Fast forward to 2023, this figure has soared significantly, reaching an impressive $588 billion. The threefold surge in dividend payments over the years could be attributed to various factors. Companies might be enjoying healthier profits due to improved business strategies, expanded markets, or enhanced operational efficiency.
