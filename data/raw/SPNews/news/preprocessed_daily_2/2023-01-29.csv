One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Texas Instruments The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.57bUS$6.06bUS$6.73bUS$10.8bUS$11.0bUS$11.3bUS$11.5bUS$11.7bUS$12.0bUS$12.2bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x10Analyst x10Analyst x5Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 2.07%Est @ 2.04%Est @ 2.02%Est @ 2.01%Est @ 2.00% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.5% US$4.2kUS$5.1kUS$5.1kUS$7.5kUS$7.0kUS$6.5kUS$6.1kUS$5.7kUS$5.3kUS$4.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$57bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 9.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$12b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (9.5%– 2.0%) = US$165bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$165b÷ ( 1 + 9.5%)10= US$67bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$124b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$175, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Texas Instruments as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.252. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Texas InstrumentsStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Semiconductor industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityTXN's financial characteristics indicate limited near-term opportunities for shareholders.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a premium to intrinsic value? For Texas Instruments, there are three important elements you should further examine:Risks: Be aware that  Texas Instruments is showing  3 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 2 of those are significant...Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for TXN's future outlook?

If you want to skip our discussion and see the top stocks, go to 5 Cash-Rich Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. The persistent sell-off in equity markets last year is a powerful sign that the U.S. economy is heading for a hard landing amid the central bank’s fight to beat inflation. As investors brace for an expected recession in 2023, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index was down 18.2% in 2022 and had its biggest annual decline since 2008, as the Federal Reserve mounts its most aggressive monetary policy tightening cycle in decades to fight surging inflation. Whether or not a bona fide recession is in the cards for 2023, the period of “slow growth” outlined by the Fed could just as well foreshadow further economic stagnation and job losses that characterize periods of recessions.William Dickens, a University Distinguished Professor and the chair of the Department of Economics at Northeastern University, states that:""Normally we think of just having to deal with a supply shock, which we’ve had plenty of over the last few years between COVID-19, Russia’s [war in Ukraine], with the food and energy crisis, and so on. On the other hand, we’ve also seen overstimulated economies before—ones where the unemployment rate gets so low that employers are having a hard time finding workers so they start jacking up wages, which is another source of inflation.”In periods of high inflation, dividend stocks have recorded strong performance relative to the broader market. Cash-rich companies that hold long dividend growth track records are particularly popular in this regard. The best dividend stocks this year exhibited strong performance and hold decades-long dividend growth track records. These include cash-rich companies that consistently grow their dividends in order to significantly increase portfolio returns for the long term during turbulent market conditions. Some dividend stocks that remained famous the previous year include Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), among others discussed in detail below.Story continuesIt is important to note that the performance of individual dividend stocks can vary greatly during a recession, and there is no guarantee that a particular dividend stock will perform well. As with any investment, it is important to carefully research and evaluate the financial health and prospects of a company before making an investment decision.12 Cash-Rich Dividend Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by NeONBRAND on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article we used stock screeners to list down companies that pay dividends and have enterprise values less than their market caps. A higher EV to Market Capitalization ratio is generally not preferred as it shows that the company has high levels of debt. Such firms are deemed risky. A lower EV to Market Capitalization ratio, on the other hand, is more favorable as that would mean that the firm has low debt levels and is, in turn, considered a relatively safer investment.The stocks in this list are ranked in ascending order according to the difference between their enterprise value and market capitalization. Additionally, Insider Monkey makes use of its database of 920 elite funds to track hedge fund holdings as of the third quarter of the year to gauge the hedge fund sentiment around each stock. We have mentioned number of hedge funds having stakes in these companies with each stock.Cash-Rich Dividend Stocks To Buy Now12. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Number Of Hedge Fund Holders: 77Dividend Yield As Of January 20: 3.64%Market Capitalization: $253.22 billionEnterprise Value (EV): $253 billionPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is an American multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology corporation that Pfizer develops and produces medicines and vaccines for immunology, oncology, cardiology, endocrinology, and neurology. The company boasts several standout drugs and products that each generate more than $1 billion in annual revenues.Earlier this December, Goldman Sachs analyst Chris Shibutani upgraded Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $60, up from $47. According to the analyst, positive updates from the company's pipeline, and the potential for outperformance from the commercial new product launch portfolio over the course of the coming year, can drive ""meaningful upside"" to the value ascribed to Pfizer's base business. He also believes that there is a ""sufficiently lessened degree of uncertainty"" regarding dynamics that will impact Pfizer's COVID-19 franchise, and the ""trough sales"" scenarios for the portfolio do not present ""thesis-changing downside.""Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has been consistently growing its dividends for the past 12 years. The company offers a quarterly dividend of $0.41 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.64%, as of January 20.Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) was a part of 77 hedge fund portfolios in Q3 2022, up from 70 in the previous quarter, as per Insider Monkey’s database. The collective value of stakes owned by these hedge funds is over $2.4 billion. Among these hedge funds, AQR Capital Management was the company’s leading stakeholder in Q3.Similar to Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is a dividend stock that pays handsomely.Here’s what Diamond Hill Capital said about Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Labs, global pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG). Although Pfizer continues to report strong performance of its core drugs, sales of its COVID vaccine and treatment have likely peaked and sales are expected to decline going forward. We remain optimistic about the company long term as we believe management is taking the company in the right direction, focusing R&amp;D, and making strategic acquisitions with profits generated from COVID vaccine sales.”11. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number Of Hedge Fund Holders: 85Dividend Yield As Of January 20: 2.56%Market Capitalization: $440.07 billionEnterprise Value (EV): $439.12 billionJohnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is an American multinational corporation founded in 1886 that develops medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and consumer packaged goods. A premier dividend stock with over 60 consecutive years of dividend increases, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) paid a $1.13 per share quarterly dividend to shareholders with a yield of 2.56% on January 20.At the beginning of December, Morgan Stanley analyst Terence Flynn raised the price target on Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) to $178 from $170 and maintained an Equal Weight rating on the shares as he refreshed his sum-of-the-parts valuation ahead of the company separating its Consumer Health segment into an independent company, to be called ""Kenvue,"" in the second half of 2023.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 85 hedge funds were bullish on Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), compared to 83 funds in the last quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with nearly 6 million shares worth $967.2 million.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Mayar Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is currently our largest position and a long-standing holding. The majority of the group’s sales comes from its collection of pharmaceutical franchises, but a large majority (~45%) comes from its collection of medical device businesses and its consumer brands.Here’s how JNJ makes and spends a dollar of revenues: As of 2021, about 55 cents of that dollar comes from its pharmaceutical sales – sales of drugs to pharmacies and distributors – while 30 cents come from the sale of medical devices, such as surgery equipment and orthopedics. The rest of that dollar in sales comes from sales of JNJ’s consumer brands such as Listerine mouthwash, Nicorette nicotine tablets and Neutrogena cosmetics (…read more)10. Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN)Number Of Hedge Fund Holders: 59Dividend Yield As Of January 20: 2.87%Market Capitalization: $157 billionEnterprise Value (EV): $155.86 billionTexas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) is an American technology company headquartered in Dallas, Texas, that designs and manufactures semiconductors and various integrated circuits, which it sells to electronics designers and manufacturers globally.Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.24 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.87%, as recorded on January 20.Citi analyst Christopher Danely raised the firm's price target on Texas Instruments to $175 from $155 and maintained a Neutral rating on the shares on January 18. Although the analyst expects consensus estimates for the U.S. semiconductors group to further decline during earnings season driven by continued downside from the PC, wireless, consumer and auto end markets, he thinks the industrial end market appears to be holding up better than expected. Danely remains hopeful that semiconductor stocks will bottom in the first half ""after every company has aggressively cut estimates.""According to Insider Monkey’s database, 59 hedge funds owned stakes in the company at the end of the September quarter. First Eagle Investment Management held the biggest stake in Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) at the end of Q3 2022.9. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number Of Hedge Fund Holders: 69Dividend Yield As Of January 20: 0.79%Market Capitalization: $214.08 billionEnterprise Value (EV): $207.91 billionCostco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is an American multinational corporation that engages in the operation of membership warehouses, leading as one of the biggest retailers in the world across several selected categories.Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 17 years. The company pays a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share for a dividend yield of 0.79%, as of January 20.On December 9, Truist analyst Scot Ciccarelli lowered the price target on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) to $538 from $557 after its Q1 earnings miss but maintained a Buy rating on the shares. Despite some big-ticket softness, the analyst stated that Q1 sales remained extremely steady on a stacked basis, while sales of necessities like food and sundries also remain ""very strong"". Ciccarelli adds that he is positive on Costco given the potential for a membership fee increase, a special dividend/payout to shareholders, and the company's continual share gains.As of the close of Q3 2022, 69 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned stakes in Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), up from 64 in the previous quarter. These stakes have an aggregate value of over $4.42 billion. With stakes over $1.2 billion, Fisher Asset Management owned the largest position in the company in Q3.Cooper Investors shared its outlook on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“The US economy continues to run hot – the labour market is extremely tight and a number of executives we spoke to described their challenges in retaining staff and preventing competitors from poaching talent. Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever than can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”8. Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO)Number Of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Dividend Yield As Of January 20: 6.85%Market Capitalization: $192.18 billionEnterprise Value (EV): $181.27 billionCisco Systems, Inc.

(NASDAQ:CSCO) to their ""US 1 List,"" which represents a collection of the best investment ideas that are drawn from the universe of Buy-rated, U.S.-listed stocks covered by BofA Global Research fundamental equity research analysts.On January 17, Piper Sandler analyst James Fish raised his price target on Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) to $49 from $47 and kept a Neutral rating on the shares. The analyst adjusted estimates and valuations across the cloud automation software sector ahead of earnings.On December 7, Cisco Systems, Inc.

(NASDAQ:CSCO) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) traded lower as investors weighed how supply chain concerns would impact sales growth. The company has been upgrading its switching and routing offerings, which should lead to strong demand as on-site locations upgrade infrastructure.”7. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number Of Hedge Fund Holders: 89Dividend Yield As Of January 20: 0.09%Market Capitalization: $448.04 billionEnterprise Value (EV): $436.65 billionNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a California-based technology company known for designing and manufacturing graphics processing units (GPUs).

Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 12 million shares worth $1.5 billion.Ave Maria made the following comment about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corporation primarily designs and sells the accelerated computer hardware and software that is indispensable for autonomous vehicle, gaming, and artificial intelligence applications. Near term uncertainty from the crypto market correction and the semiconductor cycle have weighed on shares and offered an attractive entry point for long-term investors.”6. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)Number Of Hedge Fund Holders: 87Dividend Yield As Of January 20: 1.54%Market Capitalization: $442.49 billionEnterprise Value (EV): $421.18 billionTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is a Taiwanese multinational semiconductor contract manufacturing and design company that operates as one of the world's largest integrated circuit foundries that holds a significant edge over its competitors when it comes to the manufacture and production of advanced semiconductor chips.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.44 with a yield of 1.54% as of January 20.At the end of Q3 2022, 87 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database were long Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM). Berkshire Hathaway remained the leading stakeholder of the company at the end of Q3 2022.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) ranks among the likes of Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) as a decent cash-rich dividend stock.Here is what Baron Funds had to say about Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Semiconductor giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) detracted from performance due to the global macroeconomic slowdown and softening demand for consumer electronics. We retain conviction that Taiwan Semi’s technological leadership, pricing power, and exposure to secular growth markets, including high-performance computing, automotive, and IoT, will allow the company to deliver strong revenue growth over the next several years.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Cash-Rich Dividend Stocks to Buy Now. Suggested Articles:11 Best Mineral Stocks To Buy Now12 Best Momentum Stocks To Invest In11 Safe Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsDisclosure.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like CF Industries Holdings (NYSE:CF). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. Check out our latest analysis for CF Industries Holdings CF Industries Holdings' Improving ProfitsInvestors and investment funds chase profits, and that means share prices tend rise with positive earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So a growing EPS generally brings attention to a company in the eyes of prospective investors. It's an outstanding feat for CF Industries Holdings to have grown EPS from US$1.39 to US$16.26 in just one year. While it's difficult to sustain growth at that level, it bodes well for the company's outlook for the future. Could this be a sign that the business has reached an inflection point?It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. The music to the ears of CF Industries Holdings shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 24% to 50% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-historyYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for CF Industries Holdings' future profits.Are CF Industries Holdings Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since CF Industries Holdings has a market capitalisation of US$16b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares.

Multiple countries across the globe are limiting their reliance on Russia for their fertilizer needs while focusing on domestic production.Consequently, Moscow replied with its own restrictions on fertilizer exports. Therefore the domestic fertilizer sector is likely to grow rapidly, pushing fertilizer stock to new heights.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe global fertilizer market is expected to grow substantially, in line with population expansion. The market is expected to grow at a remarkable 3.5% to reach $251.6 billion by 2030. Having said that, let’s look at three of the top fertilizer stocks to bank on this year.MOSMosaic$48.27CFCF Industries$83.69NTRNutrien$79.74Mosaic (MOS)Smartphone with logo of American fertilizer producer The Mosaic Company (MOS) on screen in front of website.Source: T.

Its urea collection, international distribution networks, and robust reputation as the largest U.S. potash and phosphate producer make it one of the top fertilizer stocks to buy.Moreover, its expansive reach and impressive portfolio pave the way for sustainable food production.Its bull-case hinges on its solid fundamentals, healthy dividend payouts, and an attractive valuation. Its stock trades at roughly 4.2 times forward earnings, approximately 70% lower than its 5-year average. Moreover, it offers its investors a relatively strong dividend yield of 1.7%, with 11 consecutive years of payouts.Furthermore, the firm boasts eye-catching fundamentals marked by impressive top and bottom-line expansion. Its revenue and EBITDA have grown by 17.8% and 50.4%, respectively, over the past five years.With the strength in the fertilizer market, it has outperformed across both lines and is expected to keep up the momentum for the foreseeable future.Story continuesCF Industries (CF)A tractor spreading fertilizer over a farm field.Source: Fotokostic / Shutterstock.comCF Industries (NYSE:CF) remains one of the largest U.S.-based fertilizer manufacturers with an amazing track record of growing its sales and earnings.It’s coming under selling pressure of late due to declining fertilizer prices. However, its in a pole position to benefit from the supply/demand imbalance, making the most of the lack of capacity in Europe.CF’s third-quarter results were exceptional. Its net sales showed a 70.4% year-over-year increase, with net earnings and EPS rising 336.8% and 353.5%, respectively.

It has quickly become the top potash producer and the third-largest nitrogen fertilizer producer globally.This incredible success is supported by over 2,000 retail locations and an impressive 23,500 employees.Last year was a challenging one for Nutrien, given the compressed planting season that distorted the potash demand. Despite this, inventories still fell, and Nutrien anticipates the sector replenishing its inventories, particularly in North America and Brazil.Farmers were discouraged from buying Nutrien products during this period because fertilizer prices were not attractive enough. But with new price incentives, farmers are now ready to restock to prepare for the upcoming application season. Nutrien is looking forward to major gains for 2025 as it ramps production towards a target of 18 million tons.On the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing GuidelinesMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

The Feb. 1 meeting is also expected to end uneventfully, with a decision to likely roll over production targets agreed in December.Ask any OPEC+ delegate what the oil-producing alliance wishes to achieve and you’ll likely hear the word “balance” come up more than once.There are actually three published goals for the 13-member Saudi-led OPEC, or Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which embraced Russia and nine other oil producers in 2015 to form OPEC+.The three are to coordinate and unify the oil policies of the different producing countries to achieve “fair and stable prices”; maintain “efficient, economic and regular supply” to consuming countries; and work toward getting investors in the industry a fair return on capital.But in media interviews, OPEC spokespeople often mash those three ideals into one choice pursuit called “balance”. To them, the market is considered “balanced” when crude is trading at $100 a barrel or more, or at least above $90 (on Friday, U.S. crude settled at under $80 while Brent stalled at below $87). If oil gets to $200 someday, we can presume that it will be even “more balanced” in OPEC’s eyes.This is because, in the six decades of OPEC’s existence, oil producers have been razor-focused on one thing and one thing only: Higher prices. In practice, economic supply for consumers - one of the stated goals of OPEC - isn’t possible because what’s economical to consumers simply isn’t to producers.From OPEC’s viewpoint, consumers want the lowest price that would bankrupt oil companies and freeze investments in future production (those who argue against this should think of the minus $40 a barrel that U.S. crude got to, during the height of the pandemic). On the flip side, oil companies are now declaring record profits. But they’re still not investing in production, citing unfriendly government policies instead.Story continuesSo, here we are, stuck over the definition of what balanced prices for crude should be.With the just-ended week being a disappointing one for oil bulls wishing to put the market into a higher trajectory after a dismal start for the year, hopes will be rising again that OPEC+ can do something in the coming week to “balance” the market.In reality, OPEC+ is struggling to balance the market - not from external pressure but from within.Since early December, the Saudis have been beset with a new headache - the G7 price cap on Russian oil - that has been producing all sorts of undesirable reactions in its closest ally Moscow.The price cap has put a $60 ceiling on each barrel of Russia’s Urals’ oil. That is a discount of at least $27 a barrel to the latest settlement in global benchmark Brent. In the real marketplace, the Russians are selling Urals even cheaper, up to $30 a barrel or more under Brent, especially to Indian buyers, say trade sources.And because they’re getting less money for their oil, the Russians are also shipping out more barrels these days than the Saudis wish them to. And those barrels are primarily going to two destinations - India and China, which are the only two nations the United States allows to buy sanctioned Russian oil without questions. The increased exports from Russia are not only messing up OPEC+’s aim of keeping production tight but also hurting the Saudis as India and China were also the largest markets in Asia for Riyadh’s state oil company Saudi Aramco (TADAWUL:2222).India bought an average of 1.2 million barrels of Russian Urals a day in December, which was 33 times more than a year earlier and 29% more than in November. Discounts for Urals at Russia's western ports for sale to India under some deals widened to $32-$35 per barrel when freight wasn’t included, according to a Reuters report from Dec. 14.The Indians even exported fuel produced from Russian crude to New York via a high-seas transfer at one point, despite U.S. sanctions prohibiting the import of Russian-origin energy products, including refined fuels, distillates, crude oil, coal, and gas.Another Reuters report said China paid the deepest discounts in months for Russian ESPO crude oil in December, amid weak demand and poor refining margins. ESPO is a grade exported from the Russian Far East port of Kozmino and Chinese refiners are dominant clients for this.At least one ESPO cargo for early December arrival was sold to an independent Chinese refiner at a discount of $6 per barrel against the February Brent price on delivery-ex-ship (DES) basis, Reuters said, citing four traders with knowledge of the matter. That discount compared with a premium of about $1.80 fetched by an ESPO barrel in China three weeks prior to the deal. Brent’s plunge to a one-year low of just above $75 by Dec. 9 exacerbated the discount for Russian crude, though the U.K. crude’s rebound to $87 since has narrowed some of that difference.If that wasn’t enough, yet another Reuters report from Friday said Russia’s oil loadings from its Baltic ports were set to rise by 50% in January from December levels. Russia loaded 4.7 million tonnes of Urals and KEBCO from Baltic ports in December. The January surge comes as sellers try to meet strong demand in Asia and benefit from rising global energy prices, said the report, which became the single biggest reason for Friday’s slump in crude prices that basically turned oil into a losing bet for January.The Saudis, on their part, have slashed pricing on their own Arab Light crude to Asia to try and stay competitive amid the ruthless undercutting by the Russians — who are supposed to be their closest ally within OPEC+.Riyadh is also attempting to talk to Moscow, with Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud telling a Bloomberg interview recently that the kingdom was “engaging with Russia over keeping oil prices relatively stable”.“We have a very important partnership with Russia on OPEC+ … that has delivered stability [to] the oil market … we are gonna engage with Russia on that,” Al-Saud said.But on the same day that the Saudi minister spoke, some 1,600 miles away in Ashgabat, the capital of Turkmenistan, Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak was telling state news agency Tass that Moscow “is not discussing with OPEC+ possibility of its oil production cuts”.Novak was responding to a question on whether the Kremlin will reduce oil output to demand a higher price for its Urals crude as the G7’s $60-per-barrel cap allows buyers to lowball the Russian product versus rival crude benchmarks such as the U.K. Brent, U.S. West Texas Intermediate, the Arab Light and Dubai Light.""No, we are not discussing such issues,"" Novak said.It basically showed the two nations having different ideas on what they need to do at this point: The Russians need to sell as much oil as possible and at whatever price they can. The Saudis want to keep Arab Light competitive against Urals but not flood the market; hence their plan for a rollover in December production targets.The G7 will have two more price caps coming into force on Feb. 5 on refined oil products out of Russia. No one knows what effect those will have on the Kremlin.The powers-that-be in Riyadh are, however, aware that if workarounds aren’t found for these caps, they could be destructive to the fairytale-like harmony within OPEC+ that has masked the organization for what it really is — a bunch of states with contrasting finances and needs pressed into compliance by the Saudis and Russians on the mere promise of price stability.If that stability gets rocked for any reason, those within the alliance could see little reason for not returning to the days of old where each state looked out for itself - something the Russians are already making a marvelous example of.Oil: Market Settlements and Activity New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude for March did a final trade of $79.38 per barrel, after settling Friday’s trade down $1.33, or 1.6%, at $79.68.For the week, WTI fell 2.5% after a cumulative 11% rally in two previous weeks. Month-to-date, the U.S. crude benchmark fell 1%.London-traded Brent crude for March delivery did a final trade of $86.33 after completing Friday’s session down 81 cents, or almost 1%, at $86.66.Brent fell 1.1% on the week after rallying almost 12% over two previous weeks. January-to-date, the global crude benchmark rose less than 1%.Oil: Price OutlookIf WTI does not pop on the theater that OPEC+ pulls at its Feb. 1 meeting, then the U.S. crude benchmark could plummet to its recent low under $76 a barrel, technical chartist Sunil Kumar Dixit said.“In case of a strong break below $79.10 and $78.60, the next drop for WTI would be $77.76 and this may be followed by even lower levels at $76.78 and $75.65,” said Dixit, who is chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.Despite multiple attempts to make a sustainable break above $82.60, Dixit noted that WTI settled the week in a relatively bearish mood at $79.68.“Momentum appears trapped within a $4 range of $82.60-$78.60, which needs to break for further direction,” he added.Dixit said a decisive breakout above $82.60 will open the way for WTI’s next leg higher to $83.88. That could be followed by $84.70. which is a 61.8% Fibonacci retracement from the drop of $93.76 to $70.06Natural gas: Market Settlements and Activity The front-month March gas contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub did a final trade of $2.856 per mmBtu, or million metric British thermal units on Friday.It settled the day at $2.849 - down 10% from a week ago but virtually unchanged from Thursday’s close.Gas futures have lost 57% of their value over the past six weeks after an unusually warm start to the 2022/23 winter led to a collapse in demand for heating oil.Prior to this week’s plunge to $2 levels, gas hit 14-year highs of $10 per mmBtu in August, and even traded as high as $7 in December.Natural gas: Price OutlookDixit noted that untiring selloff efforts continued in natural gas for a seventh week in a row, pushing prices down to $2.747 per mmBtu, with hardly any signs of exhaustion yet to the plunge.“The stochastics and RSI on the weekly chart have reached oversold conditions that call for a rebound either from current lows or a bit lower, at $2.60 and $2.35,” Dixit said.On the flip side, oversold conditions call for a short-term rebound towards the resistance zone of $3.00 and $3.30, followed by peaks to the $3.50 and $3.70 supply zone, he added.Gold: Market Settlements and Activity Gold for February delivery on New York’s Comex did a final trade of $1,928 on Friday after settling the session at $1929.40, down just 60 cents.The spot price of gold, more closely followed than futures by some traders, settled at $1,928.15 - down 96 cents, or 1%, on the day. Spot gold peaked at $1,949.29 on Thursday before an intraday high of $1,935.40 on Friday.The $1,950 resistance is a key test for gold’s ability to scale towards record highs of above $2,000 an ounce, which it got to in April last year, almost reprising its all-time peak from August 2020. Since this year began, both futures and spot gold have gained more than 5% each.Gold: Price Outlook Spot gold's failure to settle the week above $1,932, with its drop to below $1,928, raises the possibility of a further descent, said Dixit.“We could revisit gold's recent low of $1,916 and extend the decline towards $1,912, followed by $1,900,” he said.If selling intensifies below $1,900, a further drop to $1,880 and $1,870 can be witnessed, Dixit said.But if spot gold’s bullish trend stays intact, buyers were likely to resurface on the support zone in anticipation of an upshot targeting $1,965 and $1,972, he said.Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related ArticlesU.S. lawmakers ask Kerry to urge UAE to replace oil boss as COP28 presidentEU must answer U.S. clean energy subsidies, commissioner says on Washington visit]"

If you want to see more top oil importing countries in 2023, go directly to Top 5 Oil Importing Countries in 2023.In this article, oil is defined as crude oil.Because not every country has enough crude oil and crude oil is essential for a modern economy, many countries import crude oil. Given refineries that process crude oil are sometimes located in a different country than where the crude oil is produced, countries also have to import oil for refineries.The Largest Importers of Crude OilIn terms of the largest importers of crude oil, many of the top importers of crude oil also have large economies.In terms of the largest crude oil importers for example, the United States, China, and India are among the top three in 2017. With regard to the world's largest countries by GDP, PPP, all three countries are in the top three. In terms of the world's largest countries by nominal GDP, all three countries are in the top five in 2021.With regard to the United States, the country has imported less crude oil over time.The EIA writes on U.S imports, ""After generally increasing every year from 1954 through 2005, U.S. gross and net total petroleum imports peaked in 2005. Since 2005, increases in domestic petroleum production and increases in petroleum exports have helped to reduce annual total petroleum net imports.""The EIA adds, ""The United States remained a net crude oil importer in 2021, importing about 6.11 million b/d of crude oil and exporting about 2.96 million b/d. However, some of the crude oil that the U.S. imports is refined by U.S. refineries into petroleum products—such as gasoline, heating oil, diesel fuel, and jet fuel—that the U.S. exports. Also, some of imported petroleum may be stored and subsequently exported.""If U.S. crude oil production continues to increase, the country could be a net exporter.While the United States has imported less crude oil over time, countries like China and India have generally imported more oil in terms of the last decade up until recently.Story continuesUp until to 2021, China's crude oil imports rose for two decades given the nation's growing economy. In 2021 and 2022, the country's crude oil imports were down with 2022 imports 0.9% lower than in 2021 with the pandemic lockdowns accounting for some of the decline.In the near term, many countries need crude oil imports to power their economies although by how much will depend on economic conditions and on the price of crude oil. If crude oil prices are high, many countries might not import as much crude oil as demand will decrease. If crude oil prices are low, countries may import more crude oil as demand could rise.The price of crude oil will depend on economic conditions and on whether economic data meets estimates. The price of crude oil also depends on supply, demand, and many other factors. In the long term, crude oil demand will depend on how quickly electric vehicles adoption increases and how much crude oil emerging countries need to continue to develop their economies.Pixabay/Public DomainMethodologyFor our list of Top 20 Oil Importing Countries in 2023, we used data from the CIA.gov's The World Factbook (2021 Archive) crude oil imports list.The CIA.gov's crude oil import data does not account for crude oil exports. As a result, it is not net oil imports.Although much of the data is estimates from 2017, the CIA.gov is the only official data source that lists countries. Given oil consumption doesn't change very much from year to year unless there is a big economic change, the relative ordering of the countries is generally the same. Changes such as increases in domestic oil production or decreases in oil demand will change the absolute data however.For those of you interested, also check out Top 20 Oil Exporting Countries in 2023.Top 20 Oil Importing Countries in 2023This list is crude oil imports and not net crude oil imports.20.

If you want to see more top oil exporting countries in 2023, go directly to Top 5 Oil Exporting Countries in 2023.There are different types of oils. When it comes to energy, oil is often used to mean crude oil. In this article, oil means crude oil.Crude oil is essential for a modern economy as it helps power internal combustion vehicles and helps produce plastics that consumers use every day.Given they have larger reserves of crude oil, some countries produce more crude oil than other countries do. For those of you interested, check out Top 20 Oil Producing Countries in 2022.It can take a lot of capital investment and multiple years for a country to develop their crude oil reserves to bring to the market. In order to export oil to overseas locations, a country will need to develop an oil field, build a pipeline or railway to export oil to a seaport, and build the seaport. Each of those steps can cost many millions or even billions of dollars depending on the scale of the project.For exporting oil over land, a country will still need to develop an oil field and build pipelines or railways to their destinations.In order to prevent oversupply, some oil producing countries in OPEC+ also limit their production. OPEC+ is OPEC countries in addition to countries like Russia which is a major oil producer. According to OPEC in 2021, the country's members had over 80% of the world's proven crude oil reserves.OPEC describes itself, ""OPEC's objective is to co-ordinate and unify petroleum policies among Member Countries, in order to secure fair and stable prices for petroleum producers; an efficient, economic and regular supply of petroleum to consuming nations; and a fair return on capital to those investing in the industry.""Net oil exports can help a country that exports oil develop economically. With the money raised from oil exports, countries can develop their infrastructure more or increase spending on education which could further increase economic growth in the future.Story continuesGiven the price of oil has changed substantially over the past decade, the value of total oil exports has also changed substantially over the past decades.If oil prices go substantially higher, the value of total oil exports can go higher if it is sold on the spot market. If oil prices go significantly lower, the value of total oil exports can also go lower if it is sold on the spot market. Some countries use financial derivatives to hedge production, however, so the values of exports might be different at different times depending on the derivatives and the value of oil prices.In terms of the price of crude oil, it depends on many different factors including supply, demand, economic conditions, and on whether economic data meets estimates. In the longer term, the price of oil will also depend on how quickly electric vehicle adoption increases and how much oil emerging markets will need to power their economies.Photo by David Thielen on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of Top 20 Oil Exporting Countries in 2023, we used the CIA World Factbook (2021 Archive) for crude oil exports.It is important to note that the data does not take into account crude oil imports. As a result, the data is not net crude oil exports.Some countries like Canada both import and export crude oil given some of the country's oil fields produce crude oil that its refineries isn't best suited for.Much of the data from the CIA is from 2015 so there could be some changes in terms of absolute production. We assume that the top exporting countries in 2023 will be similar but not the same on an absolute scale. Some countries like Russia might not export as much oil given the Russian Ukraine war.Top 20 Oil Exporting Countries in 2023The following is for exports and not net exports.20. United KingdomCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2017: 710,600The United Kingdom is a crude oil exporter with exports of 710,600 barrels per day as of 2017. Much of the country's exports is from offshore fields in the North Sea and the exports have helped the country's economy over the past few decades. Given its huge economy, the United Kingdom also imports crude oil which isn't factored into the CIA data on this list. In 2021, the country imported £17.6 billion crude oil and exported £17.9 billion crude oil in the same year.19. AzerbaijanCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2015: 718,800Azerbaijan is a former Soviet republic that borders the Caspian Sea that ranks #19 on our list of Top 20 Oil Exporting Countries in 2023 given crude oil exports of 718,800 as of 2015. In terms of more recent data, the International Monetary Fund estimates the country exported 557,991 barrels of crude oil per day as of April 27 2022.18. ColombiaCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2015: 726,700Colombia exported 726,700 barrels per day of crude oil in 2015, making it one of the larger South American exporters of crude oil for the year. As of December 2021, the country is still a substantial exporter, with exports of 442,167 barrels of crude oil per day according to CEIC Data. According to the Oil &amp; Gas Journal, Colombia has 1.8 billion barrels of crude oil reserves as of January 2022.17. BrazilCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2015: 736,600Brazil has an estimated 12.7 billion barrels of proved oil reserves as of January 2021 and the country has over the past few decades developed more of its potential, especially offshore. As a result of its potential and its development, Brazil's crude oil production has increased. While it exported 736,600 barrels of crude oil per day in 2015, Brazil's crude oil exports were over almost 1.3 million barrels per day in December of 2021 according to CEIC Data. Like many other countries, Brazil also imports crude, which isn't included in this data, but Brazil is still a net crude oil exporter overall.16. IranCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2015: 750,200Iran is a member of OPEC with proven crude oil reserves of 208.6 billion barrels as of 2021. Iran is also a considerable exporter of crude oil, with exports of 763,000 barrels per day in 2021 according to OPEC. In 2015, Iran exported 750,200 barrels of crude oil a day according to the CIA.15. AlgeriaCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2015: 756,400Algeria is another member of OPEC with proven crude oil reserves of 12.2 billion barrels. The country exported 446,000 barrels per day in 2021 according to OPEC. Algeria ranks #15 on our list of Top 20 Oil Exporting Countries in 2023.14. OmanCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2015: 844,100Oman is a member of OPEC+ which is OPEC countries in addition to some oil producing countries like Russia. In terms of exports, Oman exported 844,100 barrels of crude oil per day in 2015. In December 2021, the country exported 896,706 barrels per day according to CEIC Data.13. QatarCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2015: 1,150,000Qatar isn't just the host of the 2022 World Cup. The country is also a major oil and gas producer that 1,150,000 barrels of crude oil a day in 2015. As of 2021, Qatar is also the largest global exporter of LNG.12. United StatesCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2017: 1,158,000When taking into account imports, the United States was a net importer of crude oil in 2017. Nevertheless, given it is sometimes more economical to export crude oil to refineries outside the United States, the country exported 1,158,000 barrels of crude oil per day in 2017 according to the CIA.In terms of 2021, the United States remained a net crude oil importer, importing 6.11 million barrels of crude oil per day and exporting 2.96 million barrels of crude oil per day.Given crude oil production has increased in recent years, the United States has potential to be a net exporter of crude oil within a few years. When the United States becomes a net crude exporter will depend on the price of crude oil, the amount of investment in crude oil production, and on demand.11. MexicoCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2017: 1,214,000Mexico exported 1,214,000 barrels of crude oil in 2017, with a substantial percentage going to the United States refineries in the South. Mexico also exports crude oil to Europe, India, and various Asian Pacific countries.10. NorwayCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2017: 1,383,000Oil and gas is a big industry for Norway as the country exported 1,563,389 barrels per day in December 2021 according to CEIC Data. Given its substantial production, the country is the second largest exporter of crude oil in Europe. Globally, Norway ranks #10 on our list of Top 20 Oil Exporting Countries in 2023.9. KazakhstanCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2015: 1,409,000Kazakhstan is a former Soviet Republic that exported 1,323,000 barrels per day in December 2021 according to CEIC Data.8.

If you want to see more top oil importing countries in 2023, go directly to Top 5 Oil Importing Countries in 2023.In this article, oil is defined as crude oil.Because not every country has enough crude oil and crude oil is essential for a modern economy, many countries import crude oil. Given refineries that process crude oil are sometimes located in a different country than where the crude oil is produced, countries also have to import oil for refineries.The Largest Importers of Crude OilIn terms of the largest importers of crude oil, many of the top importers of crude oil also have large economies.In terms of the largest crude oil importers for example, the United States, China, and India are among the top three in 2017. With regard to the world's largest countries by GDP, PPP, all three countries are in the top three. In terms of the world's largest countries by nominal GDP, all three countries are in the top five in 2021.With regard to the United States, the country has imported less crude oil over time.The EIA writes on U.S imports, ""After generally increasing every year from 1954 through 2005, U.S. gross and net total petroleum imports peaked in 2005. Since 2005, increases in domestic petroleum production and increases in petroleum exports have helped to reduce annual total petroleum net imports.""The EIA adds, ""The United States remained a net crude oil importer in 2021, importing about 6.11 million b/d of crude oil and exporting about 2.96 million b/d. However, some of the crude oil that the U.S. imports is refined by U.S. refineries into petroleum products—such as gasoline, heating oil, diesel fuel, and jet fuel—that the U.S. exports. Also, some of imported petroleum may be stored and subsequently exported.""If U.S. crude oil production continues to increase, the country could be a net exporter.While the United States has imported less crude oil over time, countries like China and India have generally imported more oil in terms of the last decade up until recently.Story continuesUp until to 2021, China's crude oil imports rose for two decades given the nation's growing economy. In 2021 and 2022, the country's crude oil imports were down with 2022 imports 0.9% lower than in 2021 with the pandemic lockdowns accounting for some of the decline.In the near term, many countries need crude oil imports to power their economies although by how much will depend on economic conditions and on the price of crude oil. If crude oil prices are high, many countries might not import as much crude oil as demand will decrease. If crude oil prices are low, countries may import more crude oil as demand could rise.The price of crude oil will depend on economic conditions and on whether economic data meets estimates. The price of crude oil also depends on supply, demand, and many other factors. In the long term, crude oil demand will depend on how quickly electric vehicles adoption increases and how much crude oil emerging countries need to continue to develop their economies.Pixabay/Public DomainMethodologyFor our list of Top 20 Oil Importing Countries in 2023, we used data from the CIA.gov's The World Factbook (2021 Archive) crude oil imports list.The CIA.gov's crude oil import data does not account for crude oil exports. As a result, it is not net oil imports.Although much of the data is estimates from 2017, the CIA.gov is the only official data source that lists countries. Given oil consumption doesn't change very much from year to year unless there is a big economic change, the relative ordering of the countries is generally the same. Changes such as increases in domestic oil production or decreases in oil demand will change the absolute data however.For those of you interested, also check out Top 20 Oil Exporting Countries in 2023.Top 20 Oil Importing Countries in 2023This list is crude oil imports and not net crude oil imports.20.

As investors brace for an expected recession in 2023, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index was down 18.2% in 2022 and had its biggest annual decline since 2008, as the Federal Reserve mounts its most aggressive monetary policy tightening cycle in decades to fight surging inflation. Whether or not a bona fide recession is in the cards for 2023, the period of “slow growth” outlined by the Fed could just as well foreshadow further economic stagnation and job losses that characterize periods of recessions.William Dickens, a University Distinguished Professor and the chair of the Department of Economics at Northeastern University, states that:""Normally we think of just having to deal with a supply shock, which we’ve had plenty of over the last few years between COVID-19, Russia’s [war in Ukraine], with the food and energy crisis, and so on. On the other hand, we’ve also seen overstimulated economies before—ones where the unemployment rate gets so low that employers are having a hard time finding workers so they start jacking up wages, which is another source of inflation.”In periods of high inflation, dividend stocks have recorded strong performance relative to the broader market. Cash-rich companies that hold long dividend growth track records are particularly popular in this regard. The best dividend stocks this year exhibited strong performance and hold decades-long dividend growth track records. These include cash-rich companies that consistently grow their dividends in order to significantly increase portfolio returns for the long term during turbulent market conditions. Some dividend stocks that remained famous the previous year include Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), among others discussed in detail below.Story continuesIt is important to note that the performance of individual dividend stocks can vary greatly during a recession, and there is no guarantee that a particular dividend stock will perform well. As with any investment, it is important to carefully research and evaluate the financial health and prospects of a company before making an investment decision.12 Cash-Rich Dividend Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by NeONBRAND on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article we used stock screeners to list down companies that pay dividends and have enterprise values less than their market caps. A higher EV to Market Capitalization ratio is generally not preferred as it shows that the company has high levels of debt. Such firms are deemed risky. A lower EV to Market Capitalization ratio, on the other hand, is more favorable as that would mean that the firm has low debt levels and is, in turn, considered a relatively safer investment.The stocks in this list are ranked in ascending order according to the difference between their enterprise value and market capitalization. Additionally, Insider Monkey makes use of its database of 920 elite funds to track hedge fund holdings as of the third quarter of the year to gauge the hedge fund sentiment around each stock. We have mentioned number of hedge funds having stakes in these companies with each stock.Cash-Rich Dividend Stocks To Buy Now12. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Number Of Hedge Fund Holders: 77Dividend Yield As Of January 20: 3.64%Market Capitalization: $253.22 billionEnterprise Value (EV): $253 billionPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is an American multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology corporation that Pfizer develops and produces medicines and vaccines for immunology, oncology, cardiology, endocrinology, and neurology. The company boasts several standout drugs and products that each generate more than $1 billion in annual revenues.Earlier this December, Goldman Sachs analyst Chris Shibutani upgraded Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $60, up from $47. According to the analyst, positive updates from the company's pipeline, and the potential for outperformance from the commercial new product launch portfolio over the course of the coming year, can drive ""meaningful upside"" to the value ascribed to Pfizer's base business. He also believes that there is a ""sufficiently lessened degree of uncertainty"" regarding dynamics that will impact Pfizer's COVID-19 franchise, and the ""trough sales"" scenarios for the portfolio do not present ""thesis-changing downside.""Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has been consistently growing its dividends for the past 12 years. The company offers a quarterly dividend of $0.41 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.64%, as of January 20.Pfizer Inc.

(NYSE:PFE) is a dividend stock that pays handsomely.Here’s what Diamond Hill Capital said about Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Labs, global pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG). Although Pfizer continues to report strong performance of its core drugs, sales of its COVID vaccine and treatment have likely peaked and sales are expected to decline going forward. We remain optimistic about the company long term as we believe management is taking the company in the right direction, focusing R&amp;D, and making strategic acquisitions with profits generated from COVID vaccine sales.”11. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number Of Hedge Fund Holders: 85Dividend Yield As Of January 20: 2.56%Market Capitalization: $440.07 billionEnterprise Value (EV): $439.12 billionJohnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is an American multinational corporation founded in 1886 that develops medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and consumer packaged goods.

The majority of the group’s sales comes from its collection of pharmaceutical franchises, but a large majority (~45%) comes from its collection of medical device businesses and its consumer brands.Here’s how JNJ makes and spends a dollar of revenues: As of 2021, about 55 cents of that dollar comes from its pharmaceutical sales – sales of drugs to pharmacies and distributors – while 30 cents come from the sale of medical devices, such as surgery equipment and orthopedics. The rest of that dollar in sales comes from sales of JNJ’s consumer brands such as Listerine mouthwash, Nicorette nicotine tablets and Neutrogena cosmetics (…read more)10. Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN)Number Of Hedge Fund Holders: 59Dividend Yield As Of January 20: 2.87%Market Capitalization: $157 billionEnterprise Value (EV): $155.86 billionTexas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) is an American technology company headquartered in Dallas, Texas, that designs and manufactures semiconductors and various integrated circuits, which it sells to electronics designers and manufacturers globally.Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.24 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.87%, as recorded on January 20.Citi analyst Christopher Danely raised the firm's price target on Texas Instruments to $175 from $155 and maintained a Neutral rating on the shares on January 18. Although the analyst expects consensus estimates for the U.S. semiconductors group to further decline during earnings season driven by continued downside from the PC, wireless, consumer and auto end markets, he thinks the industrial end market appears to be holding up better than expected. Danely remains hopeful that semiconductor stocks will bottom in the first half ""after every company has aggressively cut estimates.""According to Insider Monkey’s database, 59 hedge funds owned stakes in the company at the end of the September quarter. First Eagle Investment Management held the biggest stake in Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) at the end of Q3 2022.9. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number Of Hedge Fund Holders: 69Dividend Yield As Of January 20: 0.79%Market Capitalization: $214.08 billionEnterprise Value (EV): $207.91 billionCostco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is an American multinational corporation that engages in the operation of membership warehouses, leading as one of the biggest retailers in the world across several selected categories.Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 17 years. The company pays a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share for a dividend yield of 0.79%, as of January 20.On December 9, Truist analyst Scot Ciccarelli lowered the price target on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) to $538 from $557 after its Q1 earnings miss but maintained a Buy rating on the shares. Despite some big-ticket softness, the analyst stated that Q1 sales remained extremely steady on a stacked basis, while sales of necessities like food and sundries also remain ""very strong"".

These stakes have an aggregate value of over $4.42 billion. With stakes over $1.2 billion, Fisher Asset Management owned the largest position in the company in Q3.Cooper Investors shared its outlook on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“The US economy continues to run hot – the labour market is extremely tight and a number of executives we spoke to described their challenges in retaining staff and preventing competitors from poaching talent. Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever than can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”8.

This makes the dividend yield about the same as the industry average at 2.2%. See our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland Archer-Daniels-Midland's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsUnless the payments are sustainable, the dividend yield doesn't mean too much. Before making this announcement, Archer-Daniels-Midland was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to fall by 11.2% over the next year. If the dividend continues along the path it has been on recently, we estimate the payout ratio could be 24%, which is comfortable for the company to continue in the future.historic-dividendArcher-Daniels-Midland Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.70 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $1.80. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 9.9% over that duration. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Archer-Daniels-Midland has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 23% per annum. Rapid earnings growth and a low payout ratio suggest this company has been effectively reinvesting in its business. Should that continue, this company could have a bright future.Archer-Daniels-Midland Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Archer-Daniels-Midland is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. The earnings easily cover the company's distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. If earnings do fall over the next 12 months, the dividend could be buffeted a little bit, but we don't think it should cause too much of a problem in the long term. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

The FTSE All Equity REIT Index lost a quarter of its value last year compared with a 40% drop during 2008.However, the article also notes that several real estate fund managers believe 2023 will be a good year for the sector because many REITs have already been priced for a recession. In addition, REITs had reasonably good balance sheets heading into the new year.“In 2023, we think the word is going to be ‘resilience,’” said John Worth, Nareit executive vice president for research and investor outreach. “In the face of an uncertain economy and rising rates, REITs are well prepared. They have built balance sheets that can weather higher rates.” InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsContrarian investors can find plenty of opportunities in the sector. Here are seven REITs that should be big winners in 2023PSAPublic Storage $292.38FRFirst Industrial Realty Trust$52.21HSTHost Hotels &amp; Resorts$18.25MAAMid-America Apartment Communities $162.41PEAKHealthpeak Properties$27.07BXPBoston Properties$71.10SPGSimon Property Group$125.19REITs to Buy: Public Storage (PSA)a Public Storage sign in front of a facility of storage buildingsSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comAnyone who has owned a home is probably familiar with Public Storage (NYSE:PSA), the “world’s largest owner, operator and developer of self-storage facilities.” It boasts more than 2,900 facilities across the United States that serve more than 2 million customers.  Founded in 1972, Public Storage and its self-storage REIT, Storage Equities Inc., were merged into a single REIT in 1995. In 2006, the REIT acquired Shurgard Storage Centers for $5.5 billion, giving it a foothold in Europe with 141 locations there. Since the beginning of 2019, Public Storage has spent $8 billion to expand its portfolio by 26%, adding an additional 42 million square feet of space. Story continuesIn the 12 months that ended Sept. 30, the REIT had $4 billion in revenue and $3 billion in net operating income. The REIT’s net debt and preferred equity are 3.3x earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Its long-term target is between 4x and 5x EBITDA.PSA appears more than ready to handle anything that happens in 2023. First Industrial Realty Trust (FR)stocks to buy: warehouse interior with shelves, pallets and boxes DSource: Don Pablo / Shutterstock.comFirst Industrial Realty Trust (NYSE:FR) is an industrial real estate owner, operator and developer. At the time it went public in 1994, it had 226 industrial properties with 17.4 million square feet of gross leasable space across nine cities. Today, it owns or has under development 68.4 million square feet of industrial space across 439 properties. And it serves nearly 1,000 customers.Over its nearly three-decade history, it’s developed over 80.3 million square feet. It focuses on bulk and regional distribution centers that enable its customers to meet their supply chain needs. While there are concerns about a recession weighing on consumer spending, e-commerce is trending in the right direction. In October, First Industrial Realty Trust reported excellent Q3 results. Highlights included a 98.3% occupancy rate and a nearly 31% increase in cash rental rates. Management also increased its 2022 funds from operations guidance to between $2.21 and $2.25 a share. Finally, the REIT began a three-building, 1.8 million-square-foot development in Phoenix with an estimated value of $210 million. Trading at 16.7 times cash flow, FR is relatively cheap now compared to its historical multiple.REITs to Buy: Host Hotels &amp; Resorts (HST)Hotel roomSource: Dragon Images / ShutterstockHost Hotels &amp; Resorts (NASDAQ:HST) is the largest lodging REIT in the world, owning 78 hotels with a combined 42,200 rooms primarily in the United States. Its stock has gotten off to a fast start in 2023 with shares up nearly 14% year to date.  The REIT’s balance sheet is very healthy. As of the third quarter of 2022, it had a net leverage multiple of 2.4x, with $2.2 billion of available liquidity should it want to acquire more properties. In addition, its revenue per available room was up 1.4% over the third quarter of 2019, suggesting that the hotel business is nearly recovered from the pandemic.On Nov. 2, Host Hotels &amp; Resorts announced it had acquired The Four Seasons Resort and Residences in Jackson Hole, Wyo., for $315 million. Host paid approximately 13.6 times EBITDA, or a 6.6% cap rate, defined as net operating income divided by the purchase price. The revenue per available room at the Four Seasons property is $855, making it one of the REIT’s top assets. A key to Host’s success is getting more for the properties it sells than what it’s paying for the properties it buys. For its 2021 and 2022 acquisitions, it paid 13.1x EBITDA, while its dispositions over the same period averaged 17.7x EBITDA. That’s a win in my books.  Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA)picture of the interior of an apartmentSource: ShutterstockAs its name suggests, Mid-America Apartment Communities (NYSE:MAA) owns and operates apartment communities primarily in the high-growth Sunbelt region of the U.S.  As of Sept. 30, it had an ownership interest in 101,769 apartment homes across 16 states and the District of Columbia.Its top five markets are Atlanta (12.8% of its Q3 same-store net operating income), Dallas (9.2%), Tampa, Fla. (6.9%), Charlotte, N.C. (6.5%), and Orlando, Fla. (6.3%). These markets are all experiencing higher-than-average job and population growth, according to a recent investor presentation. This should help Mid-America Apartment Communities attract higher-income tenants, leading to increased rents. For example, in its top market of Atlanta, the average new resident at one of its buildings earns $97,415, is 33, single, and pays $1,810 in monthly rent. The average income for all of its top 10 markets is $92,940, with an average monthly rent of $1,719. Spread out over more than 100,00o units, that’s pretty darn good.Over the past five years, MAA has had a cumulative return of 64.5%, considerably higher than the S&amp;P 500’s roughly 40% return over the same period. REITs to Buy: Healthpeak Properties (PEAK)two doctors look over a piece of paper while standing in a hallwaySource: ShutterstockHealthpeak Properties (NYSE:PEAK) invests in assets serving the U.S. healthcare industry. It focuses on life sciences, medical offices and continuing care retirement communities. Healthpeak went public in 1985 as Health Care Property Investors and became Healthpeak in November 2019. Today, it owns more than $20 billion of healthcare-related real estate.Healthcare is one of those sectors that’s always in style. In fact, with an aging population, healthcare real estate becomes even more critical to the success of our medical care.Highlights of Healthpeak’s Q3 results include a 7.5% year-over-year increase in its FFO for the quarter to 43 cents, 5.1% same-store cash adjusted net operating income growth, and an additional 36,000 square feet at its Brisbane, Calif., pharmaceutical and biotech campus being placed in service. The REIT’s balance sheet is fortress-like, with net debt that’s just one-third of its $21.3 billion enterprise value and around 5x adjusted EBITDA.  Of the 21 analysts who cover the stock, 14 rate it “overweight” or a “buy” with an average target price of $28.68, which is about 6% above the current share price.Boston Properties (BXP)Group of colleagues discuss something in an office conference room.Source: GaudiLab / ShutterstockBoston Properties (NYSE:BXP) is the “largest publicly traded developer, owner, and manager of premier workplaces in the United States”. It owns 193 properties with 53.5 million square feet of office space generating $3.1 billion in annualized revenue as of Sept. 30.Wisely, it concentrates its properties in six markets: Boston (34.7% of total premier space in the central business district), Washington D.C. (19.9%), San Francisco (39%), Seattle (25.1%), and Manhattan (9.6%). Over the past 10 years, its FFO per share has grown by a 3.5% compound annual rate from $5.26 in 2014 to an estimated $7.15 in 2023.  Between 2010 and 2022, Boston Properties did an excellent job of recycling its capital. Over the 12 years, it disposed of $7.3 billion of real estate at $574.80 a square foot, acquired $7.1 billion at $518.25 a square foot, and developed $8.8 billion at $556.96 a square foot. As I mentioned above, you want to see REITs getting more for dispositions than they pay out for acquisitions and development properties. Currently, Boston Properties has 4.4 million square feet in development, with between 49% and 100% of the space pre-leased. BXP trades at 9.9x its projected 2023 FFO per share. Based on its earnings, BXP shares are cheaper than they’ve been in a decade.  REITs to Buy: Simon Property Group (SPG)the interior of a crowded shopping mallSource: jayk67 / Shutterstock.comSimon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) went on a tear following the Great Recession. Between March 2009 and mid-2016, shares of the retail REIT gained 626%. Unfortunately for shareholders, it’s been mostly downhill since then. From retail implosions due to e-commerce’s rising dominance to Covid-19, it’s been tough for SPG stock to get on a roll, but not for lack of trying. It’s entered multiple partnerships in the past few years to diversify its revenue beyond rents at its malls in the U.S., Europe and Asia.  In October, Simon announced that it would partner with Jamestown, an Atlanta-based real estate asset management firm with $13.1 billion under management, to invest in future mixed-use real estate opportunities. Simon acquired 50% of Johnstown as part of this partnership. “With Jamestown, Simon will gain an opportunity to capitalize on the growing asset and investment management businesses with an experienced fund manager and mixed-use operator and developer, utilizing the Jamestown platform to accelerate Simon’s future densification projects,” the accompanying press release stated.In November, Simon celebrated the Nobu Hotel &amp; Restaurant opening at Phipps Plaza, Simon’s mixed-use redevelopment in the Buckhead community in Atlanta. CEO David Simon and his uncle, Herb Simon, are some of the REIT’s largest shareholders. Their long-term approach to growing the business should pay dividends over the long haul. If Simon fails, America fails.  On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The FTSE All Equity REIT Index lost a quarter of its value last year compared with a 40% drop during 2008.However, the article also notes that several real estate fund managers believe 2023 will be a good year for the sector because many REITs have already been priced for a recession. In addition, REITs had reasonably good balance sheets heading into the new year.“In 2023, we think the word is going to be ‘resilience,’” said John Worth, Nareit executive vice president for research and investor outreach. “In the face of an uncertain economy and rising rates, REITs are well prepared. They have built balance sheets that can weather higher rates.” InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsContrarian investors can find plenty of opportunities in the sector.

In 2006, the REIT acquired Shurgard Storage Centers for $5.5 billion, giving it a foothold in Europe with 141 locations there. Since the beginning of 2019, Public Storage has spent $8 billion to expand its portfolio by 26%, adding an additional 42 million square feet of space. Story continuesIn the 12 months that ended Sept. 30, the REIT had $4 billion in revenue and $3 billion in net operating income. The REIT’s net debt and preferred equity are 3.3x earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Its long-term target is between 4x and 5x EBITDA.PSA appears more than ready to handle anything that happens in 2023. First Industrial Realty Trust (FR)stocks to buy: warehouse interior with shelves, pallets and boxes DSource: Don Pablo / Shutterstock.comFirst Industrial Realty Trust (NYSE:FR) is an industrial real estate owner, operator and developer. At the time it went public in 1994, it had 226 industrial properties with 17.4 million square feet of gross leasable space across nine cities. Today, it owns or has under development 68.4 million square feet of industrial space across 439 properties. And it serves nearly 1,000 customers.Over its nearly three-decade history, it’s developed over 80.3 million square feet. It focuses on bulk and regional distribution centers that enable its customers to meet their supply chain needs. While there are concerns about a recession weighing on consumer spending, e-commerce is trending in the right direction. In October, First Industrial Realty Trust reported excellent Q3 results. Highlights included a 98.3% occupancy rate and a nearly 31% increase in cash rental rates. Management also increased its 2022 funds from operations guidance to between $2.21 and $2.25 a share. Finally, the REIT began a three-building, 1.8 million-square-foot development in Phoenix with an estimated value of $210 million. Trading at 16.7 times cash flow, FR is relatively cheap now compared to its historical multiple.REITs to Buy: Host Hotels &amp; Resorts (HST)Hotel roomSource: Dragon Images / ShutterstockHost Hotels &amp; Resorts (NASDAQ:HST) is the largest lodging REIT in the world, owning 78 hotels with a combined 42,200 rooms primarily in the United States. Its stock has gotten off to a fast start in 2023 with shares up nearly 14% year to date.  The REIT’s balance sheet is very healthy. As of the third quarter of 2022, it had a net leverage multiple of 2.4x, with $2.2 billion of available liquidity should it want to acquire more properties. In addition, its revenue per available room was up 1.4% over the third quarter of 2019, suggesting that the hotel business is nearly recovered from the pandemic.On Nov. 2, Host Hotels &amp; Resorts announced it had acquired The Four Seasons Resort and Residences in Jackson Hole, Wyo., for $315 million. Host paid approximately 13.6 times EBITDA, or a 6.6% cap rate, defined as net operating income divided by the purchase price. The revenue per available room at the Four Seasons property is $855, making it one of the REIT’s top assets. A key to Host’s success is getting more for the properties it sells than what it’s paying for the properties it buys. For its 2021 and 2022 acquisitions, it paid 13.1x EBITDA, while its dispositions over the same period averaged 17.7x EBITDA. That’s a win in my books.  Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA)picture of the interior of an apartmentSource: ShutterstockAs its name suggests, Mid-America Apartment Communities (NYSE:MAA) owns and operates apartment communities primarily in the high-growth Sunbelt region of the U.S.  As of Sept. 30, it had an ownership interest in 101,769 apartment homes across 16 states and the District of Columbia.Its top five markets are Atlanta (12.8% of its Q3 same-store net operating income), Dallas (9.2%), Tampa, Fla. (6.9%), Charlotte, N.C. (6.5%), and Orlando, Fla. (6.3%). These markets are all experiencing higher-than-average job and population growth, according to a recent investor presentation. This should help Mid-America Apartment Communities attract higher-income tenants, leading to increased rents. For example, in its top market of Atlanta, the average new resident at one of its buildings earns $97,415, is 33, single, and pays $1,810 in monthly rent. The average income for all of its top 10 markets is $92,940, with an average monthly rent of $1,719. Spread out over more than 100,00o units, that’s pretty darn good.Over the past five years, MAA has had a cumulative return of 64.5%, considerably higher than the S&amp;P 500’s roughly 40% return over the same period. REITs to Buy: Healthpeak Properties (PEAK)two doctors look over a piece of paper while standing in a hallwaySource: ShutterstockHealthpeak Properties (NYSE:PEAK) invests in assets serving the U.S. healthcare industry. It focuses on life sciences, medical offices and continuing care retirement communities. Healthpeak went public in 1985 as Health Care Property Investors and became Healthpeak in November 2019. Today, it owns more than $20 billion of healthcare-related real estate.Healthcare is one of those sectors that’s always in style. In fact, with an aging population, healthcare real estate becomes even more critical to the success of our medical care.Highlights of Healthpeak’s Q3 results include a 7.5% year-over-year increase in its FFO for the quarter to 43 cents, 5.1% same-store cash adjusted net operating income growth, and an additional 36,000 square feet at its Brisbane, Calif., pharmaceutical and biotech campus being placed in service. The REIT’s balance sheet is fortress-like, with net debt that’s just one-third of its $21.3 billion enterprise value and around 5x adjusted EBITDA.  Of the 21 analysts who cover the stock, 14 rate it “overweight” or a “buy” with an average target price of $28.68, which is about 6% above the current share price.Boston Properties (BXP)Group of colleagues discuss something in an office conference room.Source: GaudiLab / ShutterstockBoston Properties (NYSE:BXP) is the “largest publicly traded developer, owner, and manager of premier workplaces in the United States”. It owns 193 properties with 53.5 million square feet of office space generating $3.1 billion in annualized revenue as of Sept. 30.Wisely, it concentrates its properties in six markets: Boston (34.7% of total premier space in the central business district), Washington D.C.

Currently, Boston Properties has 4.4 million square feet in development, with between 49% and 100% of the space pre-leased. BXP trades at 9.9x its projected 2023 FFO per share.

The long hours and heavy workloads. Always on: rapid response and nonstop vigilance – head down and obedient. Bankers are the masters of appearances, Amid changing conditions and mounting demands, they operate with calm and certainty. They roll up their sleeves and cover every angle, boiling it all down to a 10-page pitchbook.And they carry their loves lost, vacations missed, and weekends worked as their badges of honor.Maybe that’s how banking used to be – the playground for technical wizards and wheeler-dealers, the overworked and overstimulated overlords who live to max their year-end. These days, bankers – associates and directors alike – are pushing back against this life. Forget money, they crave time and freedom. They seek a more balanced and relaxed approach, one where every client doesn’t call for all-hands-on-deck urgency. And the best banks are heeding this call according to the newly-released Vault Banking 25 ranking from Firsthand.HOW BANKS PERFORM…FROM BANKERS THEMSELVESFor the fourth consecutive year, Centerview Partners reigns as the top bank to work for, widening its lead over runner-up Evercore in the process. Overall, it earned the highest scores from bankers in 15 of 20 quality of work and life categories. By the same token, Golden Sachs again earned the highest score for Prestige, while Loop Capital made a clean sweep of all four diversity categories.Since 2007, the Vault Banking 25 has taken The Street’s pulse on everything from compensation to work conditions. The rankings are based on surveys conducted by Firsthand. An infobase platform that conducts professional coaching, collects employee reviews, and posts employment opportunities, Firsthand operates in industries ranging from consulting to law. In their latest banking survey, which was conducted in the fall of 2022, Firsthand received responses from over 3,000 banking professionals.In the first part of the survey, respondents evaluated their employers in 20 workplace and 4 diversity dimensions, including Leadership, Internal Mobility, Hiring Practices, and Relationships with Supervisors. To do this, Firsthand employs a 10-point scale, where 10 is the highest possible score. Firsthand also conducts a second survey on Prestige. In this dimension, respondents rate firms they are familiar with using the same scale (excluding their own employer, of course). From there, the responses are tabulated using a weighted formula. Like previous years, Prestige enjoys the highest weight at 40 percent. Firm culture accounts for 20 percent of a ranking, with Compensation, Business Outlook, and Overall Satisfaction each garnering 10 percent. The remaining 10 percent is split evenly between Work-Life Balance and Training.Story continuesCENTERVIEW SETS THE STANDARDWhat sets Centerview Partners apart from the rest? Start with the tale of the tape. Centerview Partners earned the highest average scores in three-fourths of the dimensions: Business Outlook, Compensation, Culture, Firm Leadership, Formal Training, ESG, Hiring Practices, Hours, Informal Training, Internal Mobility, Promotion Policies, Quality of Work, Overall Satisfaction, Wellness, and Work-Life Balance.Not only did Centerview Partners dominate across the board, they also gained ground. They replaced 3rd-ranked Moelis and Company as the top firm in a stunning nine dimensions (Business Outlook, Firm Leadership, Hours, Internal Mobility, Overall Satisfaction, Promotion Policies, Quality of Work, Wellness, and Work-Life Balance). At the same time, Centerview again produced the highest averages in five dimensions: Compensation, Culture, Formal Training, Hiring Practices, and Informal Training. Oh and it knocked off Guggenheim Securities as the best bank for ESG. In fact, Center Partners finished among the five highest averages in every category: Relationships with Managers (2nd), Vacation Policies (2nd), Benefits (3rd), and International Policies (5th). The only area where it remotely struggled was Prestige,  which carries a 40% weight. In this dimension, it ranked 5th among its peers.In employee reviews collected by Firsthand, you’ll hear employees gush about Centerview Partners in a number of areas: “Small firm feel”, “flexibility”, clear path to promotion”, and (of course) “insane pay.” One anonymous survey-taker boiled the firm’s appeal down this way: “Unparalleled deal flow, extremely competent and experienced management, and ability to win large mandates means Centerview is always in a position to do well in any environment.”And they do well by doing right by their employees, adds another employee who came to Centerview Partners from a different firm. “I moved from a platform that had protected Saturdays, which I thought was great. When I came here, and observed how senior people actively try to avoid having people work on weekends unnecessarily, I realized the protected Saturday thing is not necessary—you just need the right mindset/cultural framework.”A LONG-TERM GIGThe perks don’t hurt either, adds another 2022 survey-taker. “Our meal and Uber policies are by far the best in the industry. There is free breakfast, lunch, and barista-staffed coffee in the office. There is also no cap on dinner (unspoken $50 cap), and they do not enforce any Uber restrictions regarding the time you leave the office. We are also encouraged to go on mentorship lunches and dinners where we have the entire meal reimbursed, and where most people choose to go to Michelin-rated restaurants.”Even more, Centerview Partners invests heavily in its employees and sets them up to succeed. That’s because they expect hires to stay with the firm, rather than seek out opportunities elsewhere, Hence, the firm has developed a high touch, apprenticeship-driven culture. It includes regular training and one-on-one coaching, where employees are pushed to stretch their boundaries – or what is called “play up” at the firm.“Centerview continues to make career development a priority,” notes one staffer. “The three-year analyst and associate programs are built around a commitment to develop an overall business skill set, not just a narrow functionality in finance. A Centerview banker understands the full strategic, operational, and financial suite of issues—which is a huge boost relative to peers in banking or PE as your career progresses.”Evercore photoLOOSENING THEIR TIES AT EVERCOREEvercore again placed 2nd in the Vault Banking 25. The firm’s strengths? For one, Evercore is formidable in nearly every facet, posting Top 10 scores in 16 of 20 dimensions. It also produced the 2nd-highest score for Formal Training and 4th-best for Prestige. In 2022 surveys, employees laud “clear promotion pathway(s)” and regular performance reviews geared to help employees take the next step. Like Centerview Partners, Evercore takes a more “generalist” approach that exposes junior bankers to more industries and functions. That way, they can better tailor their work to their interests.“The training is unparalleled,” explains one Evercore survey respondent. “I’ve heard from colleagues at other banks about the kind of training they’re given, and Evercore’s is a class apart. Senior members of the team are constantly giving me the chance to learn, grow, and take on additional responsibility. The sky is truly the limit.”Quality of life is hit-or-miss at Evercore according to survey results. One respondent noted that vacations are respected, but staff is working Sundays “more often than not.” Another notes that “some of my colleagues will work 90-hour weeks, while some only 60.” Still, the compensation package is “generous,” notes one respondent who touts the heavy dose of equity and deferred cash as part of the bonus package. And the culture is a little less straightlaced than expected too, adds another employee surveyed by Firsthand.“Best parts: Dinner is paid for each night; people don’t care if you wear casual shoes in the office, and everyone wears t-shirts on Zoom; and flexibility to work from home (policy is four days in the office and one day WFH).”GREAT ACROSS THE BOARDMore than anything, Evercore respondents appreciate the firm’s patient, long-term planning that has made it the “bulge bracket boutique.” With that has come an aversion to layoffs, with the company instead placing a premium on flexibility to maximize talent and resources.“Leadership works as hard as everyone else and is always focused and reflecting on ways the firm can improve,” adds another survey respondent. “Evercore has a great position in both M&amp;A and restructuring, and can be dynamic about reallocating labor between the two practices.”Rounding out the Top 3 is Moelis &amp; Company. Despite falling behind Centerview Partners in several dimensions, Moelis &amp; Company’s number was quite impressive in 2022. Out of 20 dimensions, the firm ranked in the Top 10 in 19 of 20 dimensions (with ESG being its lowest average – and that was still good enough for 11th-best among banks). Notably, Moelis &amp; Company ranked 1st for Relationships with Managers and 2nd in 11 dimensions – including the all-important areas of Firm Leadership, Internal Mobility, Quality of Work, Satisfaction, and Wellness.Top feeder schools for investment Banking.A LONG-TERM VISIONOne reason for Moelis’ high satisfaction rate is quality of life. In a 2022 survey, a Moelis staffer noted that the firm mandates protected weekends and vacation time, along with the ability to work-from-home sometimes. That’s coincides with an enviable compensation package that is expanding rather than contracting.“One new benefit added this year is family-building assistance, which is an important addition for anyone who needs fertility treatments or is building a family via adoption/surrogacy,” writes one survey-taker.Another strength is how the firm’s growing its talent. That translates year-round classroom training, not to mention exposure to a variety of teams and deals. “Moelis is the only independent investment bank structured to develop talent internally and promote partners from within,” adds another staffer in a Firsthand review “We have promoted approximately 50 percent of our partners from the junior ranks at Moelis.”Like Evercore, Moelis doesn’t sweat the highs-and-lows. Instead, as one respondent observes, the firm measures business cycles in years. “Sometimes it’s easy to forget how insulated Moelis is relative to the bulge brackets,” adds another employee. “I’m glad that the firm takes a long-term view toward talent and growth, because when financing markets clam up or deals slow down, I don’t worry about losing my job.”LESS GRIND, MORE KINDToday, investment banking is threatened by something more insidious than evolving regulations, technologies, and models. Instead, it is something more common: burnout. Fatigue produces mistakes and dissatisfaction fuels turnover. In response, banks have been installing programs that provide greater freedom and consistency. They include enforcing protected weekends and and rolling out mental health and wellness tools such as flexible arrangements. These efforts have made a ripple. According to Firsthand survey results, Vacation Policy scores have risen by 8 points in the past year, with satisfaction rates for Compensation and Work Hours inching up by 6.0 and 4.5 percent respectively. These improvements have been the biggest takeaway in the 2023 Vault Banking 25 survey says Derek Loosvelt, editorial director at Firsthand.“Almost across the board, in all categories in our survey, satisfaction was up versus last year,” Loosvelt told P&amp;Q in an exclusive interview. “In fact, the only category that we saw a decrease in this year was Business Outlook, which was no surprise given the macroeconomic outlook last fall when we administered our survey. In addition to the rises in scores in vacation policies, work hours, comp, benefits, wellness, and work/life balance, scores rose in training, quality of work, client interaction, and diversity. So, it seems clear that, in general, the top banking firms are improving initiatives in many areas, addressing what young professionals want (out of any role, not just a finance one): a good culture, better work/life balance, meaningful and challenging work, more diversity, more mentoring, early responsibility, and fair compensation (to match the intensity, stress, and workloads of their jobs).”Overall, the Vault Banking 25 ranking remained relatively consistent. Morgan Stanley and Lazard again held the 4th and 5th spots respectively. Guggenheim Securities slipped from 7th to 8th, while Bank of America tumbled out of the Top 10 entirely after declining to participate in 2022. That left the window open for William Blair, which debuted at #9 after previously not being involved in the Vault Banking 25. Otherwise, Qatalyst Partners and Jefferies &amp; Company returned to the ranking in 2023. They replaced Stifel, Nomura, and Credit Suisse in the Top 25. DC Advisory gained the most traction, rising from 20th to 17th. In contrast, Tudor, Pickering, Holt &amp; Co. lost two spots to 19th. 14 of the 22 banks ranked in last year’s Vault Banking 25 posted lower scores, led by Tudor, Pickering, Holt &amp; Co. (-.350) and Greenhill &amp; Company (-.232). While Centerview Partners improved by .246 of a point, it was eclipsed by DC Advisory, whose score rose by .360. It ranked among the ten-bast in 6 categories (led by the 2nd-highest score in International Opportunities).Goldman Sachs was the most popular bank for men and women, but failed to make the top ten most popular companies on the overall list. Courtesy photoBIG BANKS COSIDERED THE MOST PRESTIGIOUSTrue to form, Prestige commands the most importance in the Vault Banking 50. Here, Goldman Sachs is the gold standard. Like previous years, Goldman Sachs ranked as the top bank for Prestige with an 8.984 average. To put that number in context, it was .574 and .762 of a point higher than runners-up Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan. Goldman Sachs’ Prestige score also overshadowed Evercore (8.118) and Centerview Partners (8.113), the top performers in the overall ranking.The Prestige average does represent a flaw in the Vault Banking 25. After all, the 40% weight enabled 8 banks that didn’t participate in the employee survey to be included in the ranking: Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Qatalyst Partners, Citi, Jefferies &amp; Company, and Barclays. It also measures a perception of excellence – rather than an on-the-ground evaluation of employer performance. Still, Firsthand has collected many qualitative reviews from employees of these firms. Take Goldman Sachs. According to a couple of employees, the firm is pushing employees to cut hours and take time off to curb burnout. Problem is, the workload makes it an issue of “manpower” not willpower.“There are active efforts to promote work/life balance. There is no shaming in taking vacation days. The firm, however, runs very lean, so there’s very little downtime at work and always a sense of urgency to finish and move on to the next pressing task.”THROWING DIVERSITY FOR A ‘LOOP’Strangely, the same firms comprise the most Prestigious list top-to-bottom – just in a slightly different order. The Top 13 remained the same, except for Qatalyst climbing three spots to replace Barclays. As a whole, 13 of the 25 banks averaged lower Prestige scores against the previous year. This includes Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and JP Morgan, whose averages dropped from .082 to .175 of a point. Credit Suisse plummeted by 1.239 points, followed by UBS Investment Banking at -.433. That said, several firms gained reputational capital in the past year. They include Lion Tree Advisors (+.482), Allen &amp; Company (+.354), Centerview Partners (+.347), and Evercore (+.254).Derek Loosvelt has a theory on why some larger banks dipped in their Prestige scores. “I think the largest banks had the toughest years,” Loosvelt asserts. “They made the deepest headcount cuts, and they were in the news as the “face” of the down year on Wall Street. So, that likely had much to do with some of the bulge bracket banks slipping in prestige. As for Credit Suisse, though, that’s a unique case, as they recently announced they were exiting certain lines of business in the U.S. (they might even spin off their investment bank and bring back the CS First Boston brand). This was huge, headline news. So, the perception must’ve been that, at least here in the U.S., the firm isn’t as prestigious as it once was. But that could certainly change after the firm reorganizes (if the reorg goes well).”Although the Vault Banking 25 doesn’t include Diversity measures in its ranking, the data proves insightful. In this space, Loop Capital Markets bests all comers in all four dimensions, though Centerview Partners cracks the Top 3 in each one. A 25 year-old-firm located in Chicago, Loop Capital Markets notes that it averages $750 million dollars a day in average trading volume across 80 countries. While the firm is regaled for its diverse leadership and teams, it also ranks among the best in several dimensions, including Hours (2nd), ESG Practices (4th), Vacation Policies (4th), and Work-Life Balance (6th).“We are led by true leaders, not executives who hide in offices and send down uninformed initiatives,” observes one employee in a recent Firsthand review. “We have people who are not afraid to enter the trenches to push the firm forward and who listen to rank-and-file employees’ inputs to develop business plans.”BOA Global Banking and Markets employees in New York CityWHY BANKING MATTERSLast year, banking focused on helping employees find a balance, so they could maximize their employees’ talents and stave off burnout and turnover. This issue has gained prominence as banking increasingly competes against consulting, tech, and entrepreneurship for talent. Question is, is money the only reason to enter banking?For Derek Loosvelt, banking offers an array of benefits for young professionals, particularly with gaining experience early in areas that can pay huge dividends down the line in any industry.“In recent years, many banks have pivoted from merely providing excellent entry-level programs (for young professionals to use to go on to other roles in private equity, hedge funds, tech, etc.) and now also focus on providing long-term career paths for new grads. That widens banks’ recruiting reach and makes banks more attractive to young professionals who want to build careers at a single firm, rather than use their first jobs (out of college or business school) as stepping stones. Add to that the ability to work alongside and learn from incredibly bright and talented senior professionals so early in their career, as well as work with some of the most high-profile companies (clients) in the world, and it’s easy to see why investment banking is still a very attractive career path.”Click on the links below for more detailed rankings:VAULT BANKING 25: OVERALL RANKINGVAULT BANKING 25: PRESTIGE RANKINGVAULT BANKING 25: CAREER, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND DIVERSITY RANKINGSGoldman Sachs headquarters in New York CityTeam meetingTOP INVESTMENT BANKS FOR... Benefits: 1) William Blair2) Moelis &amp; Company3) Centerview Partners Business Outlook: 1) Centerview Partners2) Moelis &amp; Company3) Guggenheim Securities Client Interaction:1) Centerview Partners2) Harris Williams3) Moelis &amp; Company Compensation:1) Centerview Partners2) Harris Williams3) Moelis &amp; Company Culture1) Centerview Partners2) Solomon Brothers3) William Blair ESG Practices1) Centerview Partners2) Guggenheim Securities3) William Blair Firm Leadership1) Centerview Partners2) Moelis &amp; Company3) William Blair Formal Training1) Centerview Partners2) Evercore3) Guggenheim Securities Hiring Process1) Centerview Partners2) Moelis &amp; Company3) Evercore Hours1) Centerview Partners2) Loop Capital Markets3) Moelis &amp; Company Informal Training1) Centerview Partners2) Moelis &amp; Company3) Perella Weinberg Partners Internal Mobility1) Centerview Partners2) Moelis &amp; Company3) William Blair International Opportunities1) Lazard2) DC Advisory3) Greenhill &amp; Co. Promotion Policies1) Centerview Partners2) Moelis &amp; Company3) Harris Williams Quality Of Work1) Centerview Partners2) Moelis &amp; Company3) Harris Williams Relationships With Managers1) Moelis &amp; Company2) Centerview Partners3) William Blair Satisfaction1) Centerview Partners2) Moelis &amp; Company3) William Blair Vacation Policies1) William Blair2) Centerview Partners3) Moelis &amp; Company Wellness1) Centerview Partners2) Moelis &amp; Company3) Solomon Partners Work/Life Balance1) Centerview Partners2) Moelis &amp; Company3) DC Advisory Overall Diversity1) Loop Capital Markets2) Centerview Partners3) Moelis &amp; Company Diversity For Women1) Loop Capital Markets2) Centerview Partners3) William Blair LGBTQ+ Diversity1) Loop Capital Markets2) Centerview Partners3) Moelis &amp; Company Racial &amp; Ethnic Diversity1) Loop Capital Markets2) Centerview Partners3) Evercore DON’T MISS: INTERESTED IN INVESTMENT BANKING?

Credit Netflix Screenshot 2022-12-15 at 08.39.09 (2).png - NETFLIXWhen Spotify signed up to host The Joe Rogan Experience in an exclusive deal in 2020, the streaming giant described the podcast’s host as a “driving force in culture helping to lay the foundation for the podcasting renaissance we are experiencing today.”The deal, later revealed to be worth more than $200m, was described as “a major addition” that would secure the hosting rights for “one of culture’s leading voices.”Just a few years later and the eye-wateringly large fee now looks like a high-water mark for a cash bubble that ballooned in the podcasting industry in recent years. A war for talent was fuelled by record-low interest rates and a belief that advertisers were poised to throw more and more money at the medium.Spotify last week announced the departure of Dawn Ostroff, the executive who led Spotify’s podcasting push and signed off on the reported $25m partnership with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, as well as the Rogan deal.The company said it was laying off 6pc of its workforce at the same time, with chief executive Daniel Ek admitting he was “too ambitious in investing ahead of our revenue growth”.Spotify isn’t alone. In September, podcast giant Acast said it was laying off 15pc of staff, while Audioboom, the Nick Candy-backed podcast firm once tipped for a takeover, this week also hinted at possible job cuts as a recession looms over the advertising market.The flurry of recent cuts raises the question of whether podcasting is starting to lose its shine - and whether the spending spree of the last few years was really worth the money.“The initial flurry of people making very big bets has calmed down,” says Matt Deegan, founder of radio consultancy Folder Media.LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - DECEMBER 07: Dawn Ostroff attends The Hollywood Reporter 2022 Power 100 Women in Entertainment presented by Lifetime at Fairmont Century Plaza on December 07, 2022 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Michael Kovac/The Hollywood Reporter via Getty Images) - Michael Kovac/The Hollywood Reporter via Getty Images“It’s the transition from bubble land to real-world economics.”Podcasting is not a new format. It began almost two decades ago, when the release of the first generations of iPods and was a slow burner for many years.The medium gained momentum after break-out hits such as the first series of Serial in 2014. Figures released last summer by radio statistics body Rajar revealed that 19pc of UK adults (10.5m) now listen to podcasts every week.Story continuesWhere the audience goes, money follows and the world’s biggest tech companies have pumped in billions of dollars into the market over the last decade in the race for listeners and talent.Spotify was at the forefront of the gold rush, splashing out €350m to buy podcasting companies Parcast, Gimlet and Anchor in 2019. Rivals Apple and Amazon have followed close behind, as the tech giants vie to establish themselves as listeners’ preferred platform.At its root, however, podcasting remains a relatively cheap medium. All that’s needed is a microphone and some affordable editing software.Low barriers to entry mean the market has been flooded with new entrants, making it harder to be heard through the noise. Jokes about naval-gazing millennials setting up their own podcasts have become common currency on social media.Saturation means even big companies hoping to bankroll the next Serial can be disappointed.Annie Langston, audio analyst at Midia Research, says: “The podcast market is increasingly fragmented as more creators enter the space. A ‘mainstream’ hit is difficult to achieve, even for a well-known celebrity.”For Spotify, high-profile deals have turned into headaches.In the case of Rogan, chief executive Daniel Ek was forced to apologise for a stream of vaccine misinformation and racial slurs on Rogan’s show in a row that led to artists including Neil Young and Joni Mitchell pulling their music from Spotify.The deal with the Duke &amp; Duchess of Sussex’s production company, Archewell Audio, has also failed to yield the same results enjoyed by Netflix with its Harry &amp; Meghan documentary.As rising interest rates slam the brakes on podcast investment and an advertising recession looms, the excitement is starting to fade.JOE ROGAN QUESTIONS EVERYTHING -- ""Podcast"" -- Pictured: (l-r) Joe Rogan, Duncan Trussell -- (Photo by: Vivian Zink/Syfy/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty Images) - NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty ImagesThe sector is bracing for a looming recession that will hit its advertising-funded business model. UK advertising spend is forecast to decline 3pc in real terms to £36.1bn this year, according to the latest figures from the Advertising Association and Warc.“The podcast market has been growing strongly for some time but companies have been investing for growth in a market dependent largely on ad revenue, which is always vulnerable during a recessionary environment,” says Langston.“Some companies may reflect: this is a time to streamline processes.”Despite gloom on the business side, audience numbers are holding up. Listening figures held steady through the pandemic, despite fears that working from home and the end of commuting meant people would fall out of the habit.Meanwhile, a number of successful new British shows demonstrate that demand for fresh programmes is still there too.The News Agents, set up by BBC defectors Emily Maitlis, Jon Sopel and Lewis Goodall and backed by radio group Global’s marketing prowess, has enjoyed huge success. The Rest is Politics, hosted by Alastair Campbell and Rory Stewart, and The Rest is History are other notable hits.News and factual shows are stand-out winners in the current market, something Deegan puts down to our current “newsy times” and listeners’ desire for a point of view in their coverage.However, these recent British successes do not involve the kind of huge sums spent by Spotify and its Big Tech peers - numbers that look unlikely to be replicated.“Everything is a bit more real than it used to be,” Deegan says. “Consumption will continue to grow, but it’s good growth, not stellar growth.”As advertising starts to dry up, platforms are rethinking their approach to podcasting. Some, such as Apple and Amazon, are pushing subscriptions in exchange for ad-free shows as a way to squeeze more cash out of programmes.Experts say podcasts' DIY ethos and its robust history mean it is more than just a passing fad, but the war for talent is over.“Essentially, the chess board has been set,” says Langston.]"

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX).

View our latest analysis for TJX Companies How Quickly Is TJX Companies Increasing Earnings Per Share?If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. TJX Companies managed to grow EPS by 4.6% per year, over three years. This may not be setting the world alight, but it does show that EPS is on the upwards trend.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. TJX Companies maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 8.0% to US$49b.

But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$157m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.2% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Story continuesIs TJX Companies Worth Keeping An Eye On?One positive for TJX Companies is that it is growing EPS.

The Feb. 1 meeting is also expected to end uneventfully, with a decision to likely roll over production targets agreed in December.Ask any OPEC+ delegate what the oil-producing alliance wishes to achieve and you’ll likely hear the word “balance” come up more than once.There are actually three published goals for the 13-member Saudi-led OPEC, or Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which embraced Russia and nine other oil producers in 2015 to form OPEC+.The three are to coordinate and unify the oil policies of the different producing countries to achieve “fair and stable prices”; maintain “efficient, economic and regular supply” to consuming countries; and work toward getting investors in the industry a fair return on capital.But in media interviews, OPEC spokespeople often mash those three ideals into one choice pursuit called “balance”. To them, the market is considered “balanced” when crude is trading at $100 a barrel or more, or at least above $90 (on Friday, U.S. crude settled at under $80 while Brent stalled at below $87). If oil gets to $200 someday, we can presume that it will be even “more balanced” in OPEC’s eyes.This is because, in the six decades of OPEC’s existence, oil producers have been razor-focused on one thing and one thing only: Higher prices. In practice, economic supply for consumers - one of the stated goals of OPEC - isn’t possible because what’s economical to consumers simply isn’t to producers.From OPEC’s viewpoint, consumers want the lowest price that would bankrupt oil companies and freeze investments in future production (those who argue against this should think of the minus $40 a barrel that U.S. crude got to, during the height of the pandemic). On the flip side, oil companies are now declaring record profits. But they’re still not investing in production, citing unfriendly government policies instead.Story continuesSo, here we are, stuck over the definition of what balanced prices for crude should be.With the just-ended week being a disappointing one for oil bulls wishing to put the market into a higher trajectory after a dismal start for the year, hopes will be rising again that OPEC+ can do something in the coming week to “balance” the market.In reality, OPEC+ is struggling to balance the market - not from external pressure but from within.Since early December, the Saudis have been beset with a new headache - the G7 price cap on Russian oil - that has been producing all sorts of undesirable reactions in its closest ally Moscow.The price cap has put a $60 ceiling on each barrel of Russia’s Urals’ oil. That is a discount of at least $27 a barrel to the latest settlement in global benchmark Brent. In the real marketplace, the Russians are selling Urals even cheaper, up to $30 a barrel or more under Brent, especially to Indian buyers, say trade sources.And because they’re getting less money for their oil, the Russians are also shipping out more barrels these days than the Saudis wish them to. And those barrels are primarily going to two destinations - India and China, which are the only two nations the United States allows to buy sanctioned Russian oil without questions. The increased exports from Russia are not only messing up OPEC+’s aim of keeping production tight but also hurting the Saudis as India and China were also the largest markets in Asia for Riyadh’s state oil company Saudi Aramco (TADAWUL:2222).India bought an average of 1.2 million barrels of Russian Urals a day in December, which was 33 times more than a year earlier and 29% more than in November. Discounts for Urals at Russia's western ports for sale to India under some deals widened to $32-$35 per barrel when freight wasn’t included, according to a Reuters report from Dec. 14.The Indians even exported fuel produced from Russian crude to New York via a high-seas transfer at one point, despite U.S. sanctions prohibiting the import of Russian-origin energy products, including refined fuels, distillates, crude oil, coal, and gas.Another Reuters report said China paid the deepest discounts in months for Russian ESPO crude oil in December, amid weak demand and poor refining margins. ESPO is a grade exported from the Russian Far East port of Kozmino and Chinese refiners are dominant clients for this.At least one ESPO cargo for early December arrival was sold to an independent Chinese refiner at a discount of $6 per barrel against the February Brent price on delivery-ex-ship (DES) basis, Reuters said, citing four traders with knowledge of the matter. That discount compared with a premium of about $1.80 fetched by an ESPO barrel in China three weeks prior to the deal. Brent’s plunge to a one-year low of just above $75 by Dec. 9 exacerbated the discount for Russian crude, though the U.K. crude’s rebound to $87 since has narrowed some of that difference.If that wasn’t enough, yet another Reuters report from Friday said Russia’s oil loadings from its Baltic ports were set to rise by 50% in January from December levels. Russia loaded 4.7 million tonnes of Urals and KEBCO from Baltic ports in December. The January surge comes as sellers try to meet strong demand in Asia and benefit from rising global energy prices, said the report, which became the single biggest reason for Friday’s slump in crude prices that basically turned oil into a losing bet for January.The Saudis, on their part, have slashed pricing on their own Arab Light crude to Asia to try and stay competitive amid the ruthless undercutting by the Russians — who are supposed to be their closest ally within OPEC+.Riyadh is also attempting to talk to Moscow, with Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud telling a Bloomberg interview recently that the kingdom was “engaging with Russia over keeping oil prices relatively stable”.“We have a very important partnership with Russia on OPEC+ … that has delivered stability [to] the oil market … we are gonna engage with Russia on that,” Al-Saud said.But on the same day that the Saudi minister spoke, some 1,600 miles away in Ashgabat, the capital of Turkmenistan, Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak was telling state news agency Tass that Moscow “is not discussing with OPEC+ possibility of its oil production cuts”.Novak was responding to a question on whether the Kremlin will reduce oil output to demand a higher price for its Urals crude as the G7’s $60-per-barrel cap allows buyers to lowball the Russian product versus rival crude benchmarks such as the U.K. Brent, U.S. West Texas Intermediate, the Arab Light and Dubai Light.""No, we are not discussing such issues,"" Novak said.It basically showed the two nations having different ideas on what they need to do at this point: The Russians need to sell as much oil as possible and at whatever price they can. The Saudis want to keep Arab Light competitive against Urals but not flood the market; hence their plan for a rollover in December production targets.The G7 will have two more price caps coming into force on Feb. 5 on refined oil products out of Russia. No one knows what effect those will have on the Kremlin.The powers-that-be in Riyadh are, however, aware that if workarounds aren’t found for these caps, they could be destructive to the fairytale-like harmony within OPEC+ that has masked the organization for what it really is — a bunch of states with contrasting finances and needs pressed into compliance by the Saudis and Russians on the mere promise of price stability.If that stability gets rocked for any reason, those within the alliance could see little reason for not returning to the days of old where each state looked out for itself - something the Russians are already making a marvelous example of.Oil: Market Settlements and Activity New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude for March did a final trade of $79.38 per barrel, after settling Friday’s trade down $1.33, or 1.6%, at $79.68.For the week, WTI fell 2.5% after a cumulative 11% rally in two previous weeks. Month-to-date, the U.S. crude benchmark fell 1%.London-traded Brent crude for March delivery did a final trade of $86.33 after completing Friday’s session down 81 cents, or almost 1%, at $86.66.Brent fell 1.1% on the week after rallying almost 12% over two previous weeks. January-to-date, the global crude benchmark rose less than 1%.Oil: Price OutlookIf WTI does not pop on the theater that OPEC+ pulls at its Feb. 1 meeting, then the U.S. crude benchmark could plummet to its recent low under $76 a barrel, technical chartist Sunil Kumar Dixit said.“In case of a strong break below $79.10 and $78.60, the next drop for WTI would be $77.76 and this may be followed by even lower levels at $76.78 and $75.65,” said Dixit, who is chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.Despite multiple attempts to make a sustainable break above $82.60, Dixit noted that WTI settled the week in a relatively bearish mood at $79.68.“Momentum appears trapped within a $4 range of $82.60-$78.60, which needs to break for further direction,” he added.Dixit said a decisive breakout above $82.60 will open the way for WTI’s next leg higher to $83.88. That could be followed by $84.70. which is a 61.8% Fibonacci retracement from the drop of $93.76 to $70.06Natural gas: Market Settlements and Activity The front-month March gas contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub did a final trade of $2.856 per mmBtu, or million metric British thermal units on Friday.It settled the day at $2.849 - down 10% from a week ago but virtually unchanged from Thursday’s close.Gas futures have lost 57% of their value over the past six weeks after an unusually warm start to the 2022/23 winter led to a collapse in demand for heating oil.Prior to this week’s plunge to $2 levels, gas hit 14-year highs of $10 per mmBtu in August, and even traded as high as $7 in December.Natural gas: Price OutlookDixit noted that untiring selloff efforts continued in natural gas for a seventh week in a row, pushing prices down to $2.747 per mmBtu, with hardly any signs of exhaustion yet to the plunge.“The stochastics and RSI on the weekly chart have reached oversold conditions that call for a rebound either from current lows or a bit lower, at $2.60 and $2.35,” Dixit said.On the flip side, oversold conditions call for a short-term rebound towards the resistance zone of $3.00 and $3.30, followed by peaks to the $3.50 and $3.70 supply zone, he added.Gold: Market Settlements and Activity Gold for February delivery on New York’s Comex did a final trade of $1,928 on Friday after settling the session at $1929.40, down just 60 cents.The spot price of gold, more closely followed than futures by some traders, settled at $1,928.15 - down 96 cents, or 1%, on the day. Spot gold peaked at $1,949.29 on Thursday before an intraday high of $1,935.40 on Friday.The $1,950 resistance is a key test for gold’s ability to scale towards record highs of above $2,000 an ounce, which it got to in April last year, almost reprising its all-time peak from August 2020. Since this year began, both futures and spot gold have gained more than 5% each.Gold: Price Outlook Spot gold's failure to settle the week above $1,932, with its drop to below $1,928, raises the possibility of a further descent, said Dixit.“We could revisit gold's recent low of $1,916 and extend the decline towards $1,912, followed by $1,900,” he said.If selling intensifies below $1,900, a further drop to $1,880 and $1,870 can be witnessed, Dixit said.But if spot gold’s bullish trend stays intact, buyers were likely to resurface on the support zone in anticipation of an upshot targeting $1,965 and $1,972, he said.Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related ArticlesU.S. lawmakers ask Kerry to urge UAE to replace oil boss as COP28 presidentEU must answer U.S. clean energy subsidies, commissioner says on Washington visit]"

She is six months younger than Kim was when Kim won the first of her five X Games Aspen halfpipe titles in 2015.Kim, the daughter of South Korean immigrants, is an inspiration and a mentor to Choi, according to organizers.Kim, the only woman to land back-to-back 1080s in a contest, is taking this season off after repeating as Olympic champion but plans to return ahead of the 2026 Milan-Cortina Winter Games.Mastro, who was 12th and 13th at the last two Olympics, landed her patented double crippler (two back flips) on two of her runs, but it wasn’t enough. She was the last woman to beat Kim at the 2019 U.S. Open.Earlier, American Colby Stevenson earned his second X Games ski slopestyle title, one year after taking silver in ski big air’s Olympic debut. Stevenson, who was one millimeter from brain damage in a 2016 car crash, capped his first two of four runs with 1620s, according to commentators, taking the lead for good after the latter.American Alex Hall, the Olympic slopestyle champion, was seventh.ON HER TURF: U.S. freeskier Maggie Voisin on grief, loss, finding motivationOlympicTalk is on Apple News.

They prevailed by 22.29 over Caroline Green and Michael Parsons, the largest margin of victory in a U.S. ice dance since it was shortened from three programs to two in 2011.“This is probably the best we’ve ever skated in our careers,” Bates said on NBC. “I think that’s the statement that we wanted to make.”Christina Carreira and Anthony Ponomarenko took bronze but are likely to be left off the three-couple team for March’s world championships in favor of Kaitlin Hawayek and Jean-Luc Baker, last year’s U.S. bronze medalists who planned to petition for a worlds spot after withdrawing before nationals citing mental health.Madison Hubbell and Zachary Donohue, the top U.S. couple at the 2022 Olympics (bronze) and 2022 Worlds (silver), retired after last season.FIGURE SKATING NATIONALS: Full Scores | Broadcast ScheduleChock, 30, and Bates, 33, who are engaged, became the first dance couple in their 30s to win a U.S. title in the modern era (at least the last 50 years).Chock and Bates made the nationals podium for an 11th consecutive year, one shy of the record for any discipline.Bates, who last year became the oldest U.S. champion in any discipline in decades, has made 13 career senior nationals podiums with Chock and former partner Emily Samuelson. It is believed that breaks the U.S. record for a single discipline that he shared with Michelle Kwan, Nathaniel Niles and Theresa Weld Blanchard.Those records matter less to Chock and Bates than what they’re hoping is a career first in March: a world championships gold medal.They earned silver or bronze a total of three times. All of the teams that beat them at last year’s Olympics and worlds aren’t competing this season, but Canadians Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier defeated Chock and Bates at December’s Grand Prix Final, which is a sort-of dress rehearsal for worlds.Story continues“If we don’t win gold at worlds, we’ll be disappointed,” Bates, whose first senior nationals in 2008 came when new U.S. women’s singles champion Isabeau Levito was 10 months old, said earlier this month. “We’ve set the goal for ourselves in he past and haven’t met it yet.”OlympicTalk is on Apple News.

If you want to see more top oil importing countries in 2023, go directly to Top 5 Oil Importing Countries in 2023.In this article, oil is defined as crude oil.Because not every country has enough crude oil and crude oil is essential for a modern economy, many countries import crude oil. Given refineries that process crude oil are sometimes located in a different country than where the crude oil is produced, countries also have to import oil for refineries.The Largest Importers of Crude OilIn terms of the largest importers of crude oil, many of the top importers of crude oil also have large economies.In terms of the largest crude oil importers for example, the United States, China, and India are among the top three in 2017. With regard to the world's largest countries by GDP, PPP, all three countries are in the top three. In terms of the world's largest countries by nominal GDP, all three countries are in the top five in 2021.With regard to the United States, the country has imported less crude oil over time.The EIA writes on U.S imports, ""After generally increasing every year from 1954 through 2005, U.S. gross and net total petroleum imports peaked in 2005. Since 2005, increases in domestic petroleum production and increases in petroleum exports have helped to reduce annual total petroleum net imports.""The EIA adds, ""The United States remained a net crude oil importer in 2021, importing about 6.11 million b/d of crude oil and exporting about 2.96 million b/d. However, some of the crude oil that the U.S. imports is refined by U.S. refineries into petroleum products—such as gasoline, heating oil, diesel fuel, and jet fuel—that the U.S. exports. Also, some of imported petroleum may be stored and subsequently exported.""If U.S. crude oil production continues to increase, the country could be a net exporter.While the United States has imported less crude oil over time, countries like China and India have generally imported more oil in terms of the last decade up until recently.Story continuesUp until to 2021, China's crude oil imports rose for two decades given the nation's growing economy. In 2021 and 2022, the country's crude oil imports were down with 2022 imports 0.9% lower than in 2021 with the pandemic lockdowns accounting for some of the decline.In the near term, many countries need crude oil imports to power their economies although by how much will depend on economic conditions and on the price of crude oil. If crude oil prices are high, many countries might not import as much crude oil as demand will decrease. If crude oil prices are low, countries may import more crude oil as demand could rise.The price of crude oil will depend on economic conditions and on whether economic data meets estimates. The price of crude oil also depends on supply, demand, and many other factors. In the long term, crude oil demand will depend on how quickly electric vehicles adoption increases and how much crude oil emerging countries need to continue to develop their economies.Pixabay/Public DomainMethodologyFor our list of Top 20 Oil Importing Countries in 2023, we used data from the CIA.gov's The World Factbook (2021 Archive) crude oil imports list.The CIA.gov's crude oil import data does not account for crude oil exports. As a result, it is not net oil imports.Although much of the data is estimates from 2017, the CIA.gov is the only official data source that lists countries. Given oil consumption doesn't change very much from year to year unless there is a big economic change, the relative ordering of the countries is generally the same. Changes such as increases in domestic oil production or decreases in oil demand will change the absolute data however.For those of you interested, also check out Top 20 Oil Exporting Countries in 2023.Top 20 Oil Importing Countries in 2023This list is crude oil imports and not net crude oil imports.20.

If you want to see more top oil exporting countries in 2023, go directly to Top 5 Oil Exporting Countries in 2023.There are different types of oils. When it comes to energy, oil is often used to mean crude oil. In this article, oil means crude oil.Crude oil is essential for a modern economy as it helps power internal combustion vehicles and helps produce plastics that consumers use every day.Given they have larger reserves of crude oil, some countries produce more crude oil than other countries do. For those of you interested, check out Top 20 Oil Producing Countries in 2022.It can take a lot of capital investment and multiple years for a country to develop their crude oil reserves to bring to the market. In order to export oil to overseas locations, a country will need to develop an oil field, build a pipeline or railway to export oil to a seaport, and build the seaport. Each of those steps can cost many millions or even billions of dollars depending on the scale of the project.For exporting oil over land, a country will still need to develop an oil field and build pipelines or railways to their destinations.In order to prevent oversupply, some oil producing countries in OPEC+ also limit their production. OPEC+ is OPEC countries in addition to countries like Russia which is a major oil producer. According to OPEC in 2021, the country's members had over 80% of the world's proven crude oil reserves.OPEC describes itself, ""OPEC's objective is to co-ordinate and unify petroleum policies among Member Countries, in order to secure fair and stable prices for petroleum producers; an efficient, economic and regular supply of petroleum to consuming nations; and a fair return on capital to those investing in the industry.""Net oil exports can help a country that exports oil develop economically. With the money raised from oil exports, countries can develop their infrastructure more or increase spending on education which could further increase economic growth in the future.Story continuesGiven the price of oil has changed substantially over the past decade, the value of total oil exports has also changed substantially over the past decades.If oil prices go substantially higher, the value of total oil exports can go higher if it is sold on the spot market. If oil prices go significantly lower, the value of total oil exports can also go lower if it is sold on the spot market. Some countries use financial derivatives to hedge production, however, so the values of exports might be different at different times depending on the derivatives and the value of oil prices.In terms of the price of crude oil, it depends on many different factors including supply, demand, economic conditions, and on whether economic data meets estimates. In the longer term, the price of oil will also depend on how quickly electric vehicle adoption increases and how much oil emerging markets will need to power their economies.Photo by David Thielen on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of Top 20 Oil Exporting Countries in 2023, we used the CIA World Factbook (2021 Archive) for crude oil exports.It is important to note that the data does not take into account crude oil imports. As a result, the data is not net crude oil exports.Some countries like Canada both import and export crude oil given some of the country's oil fields produce crude oil that its refineries isn't best suited for.Much of the data from the CIA is from 2015 so there could be some changes in terms of absolute production. We assume that the top exporting countries in 2023 will be similar but not the same on an absolute scale. Some countries like Russia might not export as much oil given the Russian Ukraine war.Top 20 Oil Exporting Countries in 2023The following is for exports and not net exports.20. United KingdomCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2017: 710,600The United Kingdom is a crude oil exporter with exports of 710,600 barrels per day as of 2017. Much of the country's exports is from offshore fields in the North Sea and the exports have helped the country's economy over the past few decades. Given its huge economy, the United Kingdom also imports crude oil which isn't factored into the CIA data on this list. In 2021, the country imported £17.6 billion crude oil and exported £17.9 billion crude oil in the same year.19. AzerbaijanCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2015: 718,800Azerbaijan is a former Soviet republic that borders the Caspian Sea that ranks #19 on our list of Top 20 Oil Exporting Countries in 2023 given crude oil exports of 718,800 as of 2015. In terms of more recent data, the International Monetary Fund estimates the country exported 557,991 barrels of crude oil per day as of April 27 2022.18. ColombiaCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2015: 726,700Colombia exported 726,700 barrels per day of crude oil in 2015, making it one of the larger South American exporters of crude oil for the year. As of December 2021, the country is still a substantial exporter, with exports of 442,167 barrels of crude oil per day according to CEIC Data. According to the Oil &amp; Gas Journal, Colombia has 1.8 billion barrels of crude oil reserves as of January 2022.17. BrazilCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2015: 736,600Brazil has an estimated 12.7 billion barrels of proved oil reserves as of January 2021 and the country has over the past few decades developed more of its potential, especially offshore. As a result of its potential and its development, Brazil's crude oil production has increased. While it exported 736,600 barrels of crude oil per day in 2015, Brazil's crude oil exports were over almost 1.3 million barrels per day in December of 2021 according to CEIC Data. Like many other countries, Brazil also imports crude, which isn't included in this data, but Brazil is still a net crude oil exporter overall.16. IranCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2015: 750,200Iran is a member of OPEC with proven crude oil reserves of 208.6 billion barrels as of 2021. Iran is also a considerable exporter of crude oil, with exports of 763,000 barrels per day in 2021 according to OPEC. In 2015, Iran exported 750,200 barrels of crude oil a day according to the CIA.15. AlgeriaCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2015: 756,400Algeria is another member of OPEC with proven crude oil reserves of 12.2 billion barrels. The country exported 446,000 barrels per day in 2021 according to OPEC. Algeria ranks #15 on our list of Top 20 Oil Exporting Countries in 2023.14. OmanCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2015: 844,100Oman is a member of OPEC+ which is OPEC countries in addition to some oil producing countries like Russia. In terms of exports, Oman exported 844,100 barrels of crude oil per day in 2015. In December 2021, the country exported 896,706 barrels per day according to CEIC Data.13. QatarCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2015: 1,150,000Qatar isn't just the host of the 2022 World Cup. The country is also a major oil and gas producer that 1,150,000 barrels of crude oil a day in 2015. As of 2021, Qatar is also the largest global exporter of LNG.12. United StatesCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2017: 1,158,000When taking into account imports, the United States was a net importer of crude oil in 2017. Nevertheless, given it is sometimes more economical to export crude oil to refineries outside the United States, the country exported 1,158,000 barrels of crude oil per day in 2017 according to the CIA.In terms of 2021, the United States remained a net crude oil importer, importing 6.11 million barrels of crude oil per day and exporting 2.96 million barrels of crude oil per day.Given crude oil production has increased in recent years, the United States has potential to be a net exporter of crude oil within a few years. When the United States becomes a net crude exporter will depend on the price of crude oil, the amount of investment in crude oil production, and on demand.11. MexicoCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2017: 1,214,000Mexico exported 1,214,000 barrels of crude oil in 2017, with a substantial percentage going to the United States refineries in the South. Mexico also exports crude oil to Europe, India, and various Asian Pacific countries.10. NorwayCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2017: 1,383,000Oil and gas is a big industry for Norway as the country exported 1,563,389 barrels per day in December 2021 according to CEIC Data. Given its substantial production, the country is the second largest exporter of crude oil in Europe. Globally, Norway ranks #10 on our list of Top 20 Oil Exporting Countries in 2023.9. KazakhstanCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2015: 1,409,000Kazakhstan is a former Soviet Republic that exported 1,323,000 barrels per day in December 2021 according to CEIC Data.8. VenezuelaCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2015: 1,656,000Venezuela is a member of OPEC that exported 448,000 barrels per day in 2021. The country also produced 23.72 billion cubic meters of natural gas in 2021.7. AngolaCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2015: 1,782,000Angola is an OPEC country that exported 1,080,000 barrels per day of crude oil in 2021. The country also exported 5.08 billion cubic meters of natural gas in the same year.6. NigeriaCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2015: 2,096,000Nigeria is an OPEC country in Africa that exported 1,592,000 barrels per day of crude oil and 38.46 billion cubic meters of natural gas in 2021.Click to continue reading and see Top 5 Oil Exporting Countries in 2023.Suggested articles:15 Most Innovative Countries in the World15 Most Valuable Silicon Valley Companies in the World25 Highest Paid Athletes of All TimeDisclosure: None.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. In other words, investors can purchase Synchrony Financial's shares before the 3rd of February in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 17th of February.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.23 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$0.92 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Synchrony Financial stock has a trailing yield of around 2.5% on the current share price of $37.06. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. See our latest analysis for Synchrony Financial Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Synchrony Financial is paying out just 15% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events.Generally speaking, the lower a company's payout ratios, the more resilient its dividend usually is.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. It's encouraging to see Synchrony Financial has grown its earnings rapidly, up 23% a year for the past five years.Story continuesMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the last six years, Synchrony Financial has lifted its dividend by approximately 10.0% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.The Bottom LineFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Synchrony Financial? When companies are growing rapidly and retaining a majority of the profits within the business, it's usually a sign that reinvesting earnings creates more value than paying dividends to shareholders. Perhaps even more importantly - this can sometimes signal management is focused on the long term future of the business. We think this is a pretty attractive combination, and would be interested in investigating Synchrony Financial more closely.While it's tempting to invest in Synchrony Financial for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 3 warning signs for Synchrony Financial (of which 1 can't be ignored!) you should know about.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

The Feb. 1 meeting is also expected to end uneventfully, with a decision to likely roll over production targets agreed in December.Ask any OPEC+ delegate what the oil-producing alliance wishes to achieve and you’ll likely hear the word “balance” come up more than once.There are actually three published goals for the 13-member Saudi-led OPEC, or Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which embraced Russia and nine other oil producers in 2015 to form OPEC+.The three are to coordinate and unify the oil policies of the different producing countries to achieve “fair and stable prices”; maintain “efficient, economic and regular supply” to consuming countries; and work toward getting investors in the industry a fair return on capital.But in media interviews, OPEC spokespeople often mash those three ideals into one choice pursuit called “balance”. To them, the market is considered “balanced” when crude is trading at $100 a barrel or more, or at least above $90 (on Friday, U.S. crude settled at under $80 while Brent stalled at below $87). If oil gets to $200 someday, we can presume that it will be even “more balanced” in OPEC’s eyes.This is because, in the six decades of OPEC’s existence, oil producers have been razor-focused on one thing and one thing only: Higher prices. In practice, economic supply for consumers - one of the stated goals of OPEC - isn’t possible because what’s economical to consumers simply isn’t to producers.From OPEC’s viewpoint, consumers want the lowest price that would bankrupt oil companies and freeze investments in future production (those who argue against this should think of the minus $40 a barrel that U.S. crude got to, during the height of the pandemic). On the flip side, oil companies are now declaring record profits. But they’re still not investing in production, citing unfriendly government policies instead.Story continuesSo, here we are, stuck over the definition of what balanced prices for crude should be.With the just-ended week being a disappointing one for oil bulls wishing to put the market into a higher trajectory after a dismal start for the year, hopes will be rising again that OPEC+ can do something in the coming week to “balance” the market.In reality, OPEC+ is struggling to balance the market - not from external pressure but from within.Since early December, the Saudis have been beset with a new headache - the G7 price cap on Russian oil - that has been producing all sorts of undesirable reactions in its closest ally Moscow.The price cap has put a $60 ceiling on each barrel of Russia’s Urals’ oil. That is a discount of at least $27 a barrel to the latest settlement in global benchmark Brent. In the real marketplace, the Russians are selling Urals even cheaper, up to $30 a barrel or more under Brent, especially to Indian buyers, say trade sources.And because they’re getting less money for their oil, the Russians are also shipping out more barrels these days than the Saudis wish them to. And those barrels are primarily going to two destinations - India and China, which are the only two nations the United States allows to buy sanctioned Russian oil without questions. The increased exports from Russia are not only messing up OPEC+’s aim of keeping production tight but also hurting the Saudis as India and China were also the largest markets in Asia for Riyadh’s state oil company Saudi Aramco (TADAWUL:2222).India bought an average of 1.2 million barrels of Russian Urals a day in December, which was 33 times more than a year earlier and 29% more than in November. Discounts for Urals at Russia's western ports for sale to India under some deals widened to $32-$35 per barrel when freight wasn’t included, according to a Reuters report from Dec. 14.The Indians even exported fuel produced from Russian crude to New York via a high-seas transfer at one point, despite U.S. sanctions prohibiting the import of Russian-origin energy products, including refined fuels, distillates, crude oil, coal, and gas.Another Reuters report said China paid the deepest discounts in months for Russian ESPO crude oil in December, amid weak demand and poor refining margins. ESPO is a grade exported from the Russian Far East port of Kozmino and Chinese refiners are dominant clients for this.At least one ESPO cargo for early December arrival was sold to an independent Chinese refiner at a discount of $6 per barrel against the February Brent price on delivery-ex-ship (DES) basis, Reuters said, citing four traders with knowledge of the matter. That discount compared with a premium of about $1.80 fetched by an ESPO barrel in China three weeks prior to the deal. Brent’s plunge to a one-year low of just above $75 by Dec. 9 exacerbated the discount for Russian crude, though the U.K. crude’s rebound to $87 since has narrowed some of that difference.If that wasn’t enough, yet another Reuters report from Friday said Russia’s oil loadings from its Baltic ports were set to rise by 50% in January from December levels. Russia loaded 4.7 million tonnes of Urals and KEBCO from Baltic ports in December. The January surge comes as sellers try to meet strong demand in Asia and benefit from rising global energy prices, said the report, which became the single biggest reason for Friday’s slump in crude prices that basically turned oil into a losing bet for January.The Saudis, on their part, have slashed pricing on their own Arab Light crude to Asia to try and stay competitive amid the ruthless undercutting by the Russians — who are supposed to be their closest ally within OPEC+.Riyadh is also attempting to talk to Moscow, with Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud telling a Bloomberg interview recently that the kingdom was “engaging with Russia over keeping oil prices relatively stable”.“We have a very important partnership with Russia on OPEC+ … that has delivered stability [to] the oil market … we are gonna engage with Russia on that,” Al-Saud said.But on the same day that the Saudi minister spoke, some 1,600 miles away in Ashgabat, the capital of Turkmenistan, Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak was telling state news agency Tass that Moscow “is not discussing with OPEC+ possibility of its oil production cuts”.Novak was responding to a question on whether the Kremlin will reduce oil output to demand a higher price for its Urals crude as the G7’s $60-per-barrel cap allows buyers to lowball the Russian product versus rival crude benchmarks such as the U.K. Brent, U.S. West Texas Intermediate, the Arab Light and Dubai Light.""No, we are not discussing such issues,"" Novak said.It basically showed the two nations having different ideas on what they need to do at this point: The Russians need to sell as much oil as possible and at whatever price they can. The Saudis want to keep Arab Light competitive against Urals but not flood the market; hence their plan for a rollover in December production targets.The G7 will have two more price caps coming into force on Feb. 5 on refined oil products out of Russia. No one knows what effect those will have on the Kremlin.The powers-that-be in Riyadh are, however, aware that if workarounds aren’t found for these caps, they could be destructive to the fairytale-like harmony within OPEC+ that has masked the organization for what it really is — a bunch of states with contrasting finances and needs pressed into compliance by the Saudis and Russians on the mere promise of price stability.If that stability gets rocked for any reason, those within the alliance could see little reason for not returning to the days of old where each state looked out for itself - something the Russians are already making a marvelous example of.Oil: Market Settlements and Activity New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude for March did a final trade of $79.38 per barrel, after settling Friday’s trade down $1.33, or 1.6%, at $79.68.For the week, WTI fell 2.5% after a cumulative 11% rally in two previous weeks. Month-to-date, the U.S. crude benchmark fell 1%.London-traded Brent crude for March delivery did a final trade of $86.33 after completing Friday’s session down 81 cents, or almost 1%, at $86.66.Brent fell 1.1% on the week after rallying almost 12% over two previous weeks. January-to-date, the global crude benchmark rose less than 1%.Oil: Price OutlookIf WTI does not pop on the theater that OPEC+ pulls at its Feb. 1 meeting, then the U.S. crude benchmark could plummet to its recent low under $76 a barrel, technical chartist Sunil Kumar Dixit said.“In case of a strong break below $79.10 and $78.60, the next drop for WTI would be $77.76 and this may be followed by even lower levels at $76.78 and $75.65,” said Dixit, who is chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.Despite multiple attempts to make a sustainable break above $82.60, Dixit noted that WTI settled the week in a relatively bearish mood at $79.68.“Momentum appears trapped within a $4 range of $82.60-$78.60, which needs to break for further direction,” he added.Dixit said a decisive breakout above $82.60 will open the way for WTI’s next leg higher to $83.88. That could be followed by $84.70. which is a 61.8% Fibonacci retracement from the drop of $93.76 to $70.06Natural gas: Market Settlements and Activity The front-month March gas contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub did a final trade of $2.856 per mmBtu, or million metric British thermal units on Friday.It settled the day at $2.849 - down 10% from a week ago but virtually unchanged from Thursday’s close.Gas futures have lost 57% of their value over the past six weeks after an unusually warm start to the 2022/23 winter led to a collapse in demand for heating oil.Prior to this week’s plunge to $2 levels, gas hit 14-year highs of $10 per mmBtu in August, and even traded as high as $7 in December.Natural gas: Price OutlookDixit noted that untiring selloff efforts continued in natural gas for a seventh week in a row, pushing prices down to $2.747 per mmBtu, with hardly any signs of exhaustion yet to the plunge.“The stochastics and RSI on the weekly chart have reached oversold conditions that call for a rebound either from current lows or a bit lower, at $2.60 and $2.35,” Dixit said.On the flip side, oversold conditions call for a short-term rebound towards the resistance zone of $3.00 and $3.30, followed by peaks to the $3.50 and $3.70 supply zone, he added.Gold: Market Settlements and Activity Gold for February delivery on New York’s Comex did a final trade of $1,928 on Friday after settling the session at $1929.40, down just 60 cents.The spot price of gold, more closely followed than futures by some traders, settled at $1,928.15 - down 96 cents, or 1%, on the day. Spot gold peaked at $1,949.29 on Thursday before an intraday high of $1,935.40 on Friday.The $1,950 resistance is a key test for gold’s ability to scale towards record highs of above $2,000 an ounce, which it got to in April last year, almost reprising its all-time peak from August 2020. Since this year began, both futures and spot gold have gained more than 5% each.Gold: Price Outlook Spot gold's failure to settle the week above $1,932, with its drop to below $1,928, raises the possibility of a further descent, said Dixit.“We could revisit gold's recent low of $1,916 and extend the decline towards $1,912, followed by $1,900,” he said.If selling intensifies below $1,900, a further drop to $1,880 and $1,870 can be witnessed, Dixit said.But if spot gold’s bullish trend stays intact, buyers were likely to resurface on the support zone in anticipation of an upshot targeting $1,965 and $1,972, he said.Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related ArticlesU.S. lawmakers ask Kerry to urge UAE to replace oil boss as COP28 presidentEU must answer U.S. clean energy subsidies, commissioner says on Washington visit]"

If you want to see more top oil importing countries in 2023, go directly to Top 5 Oil Importing Countries in 2023.In this article, oil is defined as crude oil.Because not every country has enough crude oil and crude oil is essential for a modern economy, many countries import crude oil. Given refineries that process crude oil are sometimes located in a different country than where the crude oil is produced, countries also have to import oil for refineries.The Largest Importers of Crude OilIn terms of the largest importers of crude oil, many of the top importers of crude oil also have large economies.In terms of the largest crude oil importers for example, the United States, China, and India are among the top three in 2017. With regard to the world's largest countries by GDP, PPP, all three countries are in the top three. In terms of the world's largest countries by nominal GDP, all three countries are in the top five in 2021.With regard to the United States, the country has imported less crude oil over time.The EIA writes on U.S imports, ""After generally increasing every year from 1954 through 2005, U.S. gross and net total petroleum imports peaked in 2005. Since 2005, increases in domestic petroleum production and increases in petroleum exports have helped to reduce annual total petroleum net imports.""The EIA adds, ""The United States remained a net crude oil importer in 2021, importing about 6.11 million b/d of crude oil and exporting about 2.96 million b/d. However, some of the crude oil that the U.S. imports is refined by U.S. refineries into petroleum products—such as gasoline, heating oil, diesel fuel, and jet fuel—that the U.S. exports. Also, some of imported petroleum may be stored and subsequently exported.""If U.S. crude oil production continues to increase, the country could be a net exporter.While the United States has imported less crude oil over time, countries like China and India have generally imported more oil in terms of the last decade up until recently.Story continuesUp until to 2021, China's crude oil imports rose for two decades given the nation's growing economy. In 2021 and 2022, the country's crude oil imports were down with 2022 imports 0.9% lower than in 2021 with the pandemic lockdowns accounting for some of the decline.In the near term, many countries need crude oil imports to power their economies although by how much will depend on economic conditions and on the price of crude oil. If crude oil prices are high, many countries might not import as much crude oil as demand will decrease. If crude oil prices are low, countries may import more crude oil as demand could rise.The price of crude oil will depend on economic conditions and on whether economic data meets estimates. The price of crude oil also depends on supply, demand, and many other factors. In the long term, crude oil demand will depend on how quickly electric vehicles adoption increases and how much crude oil emerging countries need to continue to develop their economies.Pixabay/Public DomainMethodologyFor our list of Top 20 Oil Importing Countries in 2023, we used data from the CIA.gov's The World Factbook (2021 Archive) crude oil imports list.The CIA.gov's crude oil import data does not account for crude oil exports. As a result, it is not net oil imports.Although much of the data is estimates from 2017, the CIA.gov is the only official data source that lists countries. Given oil consumption doesn't change very much from year to year unless there is a big economic change, the relative ordering of the countries is generally the same. Changes such as increases in domestic oil production or decreases in oil demand will change the absolute data however.For those of you interested, also check out Top 20 Oil Exporting Countries in 2023.Top 20 Oil Importing Countries in 2023This list is crude oil imports and not net crude oil imports.20.

If you want to see more top oil exporting countries in 2023, go directly to Top 5 Oil Exporting Countries in 2023.There are different types of oils. When it comes to energy, oil is often used to mean crude oil. In this article, oil means crude oil.Crude oil is essential for a modern economy as it helps power internal combustion vehicles and helps produce plastics that consumers use every day.Given they have larger reserves of crude oil, some countries produce more crude oil than other countries do. For those of you interested, check out Top 20 Oil Producing Countries in 2022.It can take a lot of capital investment and multiple years for a country to develop their crude oil reserves to bring to the market. In order to export oil to overseas locations, a country will need to develop an oil field, build a pipeline or railway to export oil to a seaport, and build the seaport. Each of those steps can cost many millions or even billions of dollars depending on the scale of the project.For exporting oil over land, a country will still need to develop an oil field and build pipelines or railways to their destinations.In order to prevent oversupply, some oil producing countries in OPEC+ also limit their production. OPEC+ is OPEC countries in addition to countries like Russia which is a major oil producer. According to OPEC in 2021, the country's members had over 80% of the world's proven crude oil reserves.OPEC describes itself, ""OPEC's objective is to co-ordinate and unify petroleum policies among Member Countries, in order to secure fair and stable prices for petroleum producers; an efficient, economic and regular supply of petroleum to consuming nations; and a fair return on capital to those investing in the industry.""Net oil exports can help a country that exports oil develop economically. With the money raised from oil exports, countries can develop their infrastructure more or increase spending on education which could further increase economic growth in the future.Story continuesGiven the price of oil has changed substantially over the past decade, the value of total oil exports has also changed substantially over the past decades.If oil prices go substantially higher, the value of total oil exports can go higher if it is sold on the spot market. If oil prices go significantly lower, the value of total oil exports can also go lower if it is sold on the spot market. Some countries use financial derivatives to hedge production, however, so the values of exports might be different at different times depending on the derivatives and the value of oil prices.In terms of the price of crude oil, it depends on many different factors including supply, demand, economic conditions, and on whether economic data meets estimates. In the longer term, the price of oil will also depend on how quickly electric vehicle adoption increases and how much oil emerging markets will need to power their economies.Photo by David Thielen on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of Top 20 Oil Exporting Countries in 2023, we used the CIA World Factbook (2021 Archive) for crude oil exports.It is important to note that the data does not take into account crude oil imports. As a result, the data is not net crude oil exports.Some countries like Canada both import and export crude oil given some of the country's oil fields produce crude oil that its refineries isn't best suited for.Much of the data from the CIA is from 2015 so there could be some changes in terms of absolute production. We assume that the top exporting countries in 2023 will be similar but not the same on an absolute scale. Some countries like Russia might not export as much oil given the Russian Ukraine war.Top 20 Oil Exporting Countries in 2023The following is for exports and not net exports.20. United KingdomCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2017: 710,600The United Kingdom is a crude oil exporter with exports of 710,600 barrels per day as of 2017. Much of the country's exports is from offshore fields in the North Sea and the exports have helped the country's economy over the past few decades. Given its huge economy, the United Kingdom also imports crude oil which isn't factored into the CIA data on this list. In 2021, the country imported £17.6 billion crude oil and exported £17.9 billion crude oil in the same year.19. AzerbaijanCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2015: 718,800Azerbaijan is a former Soviet republic that borders the Caspian Sea that ranks #19 on our list of Top 20 Oil Exporting Countries in 2023 given crude oil exports of 718,800 as of 2015. In terms of more recent data, the International Monetary Fund estimates the country exported 557,991 barrels of crude oil per day as of April 27 2022.18. ColombiaCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2015: 726,700Colombia exported 726,700 barrels per day of crude oil in 2015, making it one of the larger South American exporters of crude oil for the year. As of December 2021, the country is still a substantial exporter, with exports of 442,167 barrels of crude oil per day according to CEIC Data. According to the Oil &amp; Gas Journal, Colombia has 1.8 billion barrels of crude oil reserves as of January 2022.17. BrazilCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2015: 736,600Brazil has an estimated 12.7 billion barrels of proved oil reserves as of January 2021 and the country has over the past few decades developed more of its potential, especially offshore. As a result of its potential and its development, Brazil's crude oil production has increased. While it exported 736,600 barrels of crude oil per day in 2015, Brazil's crude oil exports were over almost 1.3 million barrels per day in December of 2021 according to CEIC Data. Like many other countries, Brazil also imports crude, which isn't included in this data, but Brazil is still a net crude oil exporter overall.16. IranCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2015: 750,200Iran is a member of OPEC with proven crude oil reserves of 208.6 billion barrels as of 2021. Iran is also a considerable exporter of crude oil, with exports of 763,000 barrels per day in 2021 according to OPEC. In 2015, Iran exported 750,200 barrels of crude oil a day according to the CIA.15. AlgeriaCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2015: 756,400Algeria is another member of OPEC with proven crude oil reserves of 12.2 billion barrels. The country exported 446,000 barrels per day in 2021 according to OPEC. Algeria ranks #15 on our list of Top 20 Oil Exporting Countries in 2023.14. OmanCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2015: 844,100Oman is a member of OPEC+ which is OPEC countries in addition to some oil producing countries like Russia.

QatarCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2015: 1,150,000Qatar isn't just the host of the 2022 World Cup. The country is also a major oil and gas producer that 1,150,000 barrels of crude oil a day in 2015. As of 2021, Qatar is also the largest global exporter of LNG.12. United StatesCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2017: 1,158,000When taking into account imports, the United States was a net importer of crude oil in 2017. Nevertheless, given it is sometimes more economical to export crude oil to refineries outside the United States, the country exported 1,158,000 barrels of crude oil per day in 2017 according to the CIA.In terms of 2021, the United States remained a net crude oil importer, importing 6.11 million barrels of crude oil per day and exporting 2.96 million barrels of crude oil per day.Given crude oil production has increased in recent years, the United States has potential to be a net exporter of crude oil within a few years. When the United States becomes a net crude exporter will depend on the price of crude oil, the amount of investment in crude oil production, and on demand.11. MexicoCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2017: 1,214,000Mexico exported 1,214,000 barrels of crude oil in 2017, with a substantial percentage going to the United States refineries in the South. Mexico also exports crude oil to Europe, India, and various Asian Pacific countries.10.

There are many ways to play this, but you may want to focus on bargain stocks instead of diving into meme stocks or even more established growth stocks.Why? According to some analysts, these stocks, also known as value stocks, could outperform growth names between now and when interest rates potentially start to come down. In addition, while rates could drop this year, chances are they will not fall back to the near-zero levels experienced during the pandemic.Growth stocks, which went on a tear in 2021 thanks to near-zero rates, may have more limited recovery potential. Alongside the potential for a more significant upside in a stock market rebound, limited downside risk with bargain names in this current macro climate may be wrong, with the bear market continuing from here.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThese seven bargain stocks are more favorable from a risk/reward standpoint. Thus, I think long-term investors should consider these companies above other high-growth names right now.BYDBoyd Gaming$60.61FFord$12.77HBIHanesbrands$7.84LEVILevi Strauss &amp; Co.$16.67OXYOccidental Petroluem$64.33QCOMQualcomm$131.35UALUnited Airlines$50.35Boyd Gaming (BYD)a room of slot machines in a casino to represent gambling stocksSource: ShutterstockBoyd Gaming (NYSE:BYD) operates casinos and other gaming properties. Boyd’s flagship properties are in downtown Las Vegas and off the Las Vegas strip, but the company’s portfolio also includes regional properties throughout the United States.Compared to other casino stocks, BYD stock is attractively priced. The company’s shares today trade for only 11.7-times earnings. By comparison, another prominent name in regional casino gaming, Penn Entertainment (NASDAQ:PENN), sells for 24-times earnings.Despite trading at a deep value multiple (implying limited growth potential), one analyst (Credit Suisse’s Benjamin Chaiken) has recently argued that Boyd does, in fact, have growth catalysts in play, in large part due to Boyd’s recent acquisition of iGaming company Pala Interactive. If a gaming market downturn is milder-than-expected, and stocks are on track to re-enter a bull market, undervalued BYD may be in for a significant re-rating higher.Story continuesFord (F)Ford logo badge on grill of carSource: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.comIn 2022, Ford (NYSE:F) shares fell out of the fast lane, with investors hitting the brakes on the legacy automaker. However, while this stock may be making a pit stop for now, a rebound could happen much sooner than the market’s current view on the state of the automotive market may suggest.Although tailwinds like tight supply and booming demand have begun to reverse course, this headwind may have become overly factored into the valuation of F stock. Shares today trade for just 7.5-times sell-side analyst forecasts for earnings in 2023.The current view of an auto market meltdown proves to be an overreaction. Ford could raise prices merely on reporting better-than-expected results over the next few quarters. As I argued earlier this month, Ford’s electric vehicle (or EV) catalyst isn’t going anywhere. This factor could also spark a big rebound for F stock.Hanesbrands (HBI)HanesBrands (HBI) logo on a storefront during daylightSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.comUp more than 36% in the past month, renewed bullishness has had an outsized impact on the performance of Hanesbrands (NYSE:HBI) shares. Last year, concerns about a recession, along with this apparel maker’s heavy debt load, led to a massive drop in its stock price.Investors may be starting to realize that they overreacted, especially after management’s release of a promising guidance update earlier this month. HBI stock has zoomed back to the high single-digits, but don’t assume it’s topping out. Shares may have ample room to continue making a recovery.Still sporting a deep value multiple (8-times earnings) and a high dividend yield (7.5%), if Hanesbrands continues to pleasantly surprise with its operating performance, HBI stock could keep climbing to a valuation more befitting of stock in the apparel industry. Similar names in the spice trade for between 10- and 15-times earnings.Levi Strauss &amp; Co. (LEVI)a stack of white t-shirts with the Levi's (LEVI) logo on themSource: Papin Lab / Shutterstock.comAmong the bargain stocks on this list, Levi Strauss &amp; Co. (NYSE:LEVI) may be a diamond in the rough. Although the current global economic downturn is a significant concern for the near-term performance of this famed denim apparel maker, a price-to-earnings (or P/E) multiple of only 12-times is far too low.Why? Consider the value of Levi Strauss’s globally recognized brand. This company’s impressive brand equity gives Levi a deep economic moat. As financial challenges dissipate and focus shifts to post-downturn results, LEVI stock is likely to return to a much higher valuation.Before the stock market downturn, shares were trading for between 15 and 20 times earnings. If Levi Strauss can deliver profits in line with forecasts for 2024 ($1.56 per share), it may not be difficult for LEVI to nearly double in price, from $17 back to the low-$30s per share.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Occidental Petroleum website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comOccidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) performed very well in 2022. This was due to the big jump in crude oil prices and Warren Buffett’s continued purchase of shares for the Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) portfolio.However, more recently, as oil has pulled back and the “Buffett buzz” surrounding this company has faded, OXY stock has fallen into a slump. Still, if you’re bullish on economic conditions normalizing this year, now may be a great time to buy this bargain stock. Currently, OXY trades for only 5.2-times earnings.If the global economy improves and China begins its post-pandemic “reopening,” oil demand (and therefore prices) could keep rising. Boosting profitability could help OXY make a comeback in 2023. Looking beyond the near-term, success with the company’s carbon capture endeavor could be another significant catalyst for the undervalued oil stock over the next few years.Qualcomm (QCOM)Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor signSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.comLike comparable names in its industry, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) has been hammered by the chip market slowdown. Yet, in contrast to many of its peers, this mobile chip maker shares have entered bargain stocks territory. How so?Other chip stocks have become cheaper, but still sport premium valuations. QCOM stock, on the other hand, trades at a low 12.8-times forward estimated earnings. That makes it even more affordable than Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), a longstanding “value play” (or “value trap,” depending on who you ask) among chip stocks. INTC currently trades for 16-times forward earnings.In a recent interview on CNBC, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon made promising statements regarding the semiconductor industry’s long-term demand prospects, and Qualcomm’s move into faster-growing areas such as advanced chips for the automotive industry. These factors could help re-accelerate growth for the company and help send QCOM back to substantially higher prices.United Airlines (UAL)The side of a United Airlines (UAL) plane with ""united"" written above passenger windows. Represents airline stocks.Source: travelview / Shutterstock.comThe airline industry has made a stunning post-pandemic comeback. United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) is no exception. The legacy airline is now not only generating revenues that exceed levels reported right before the pandemic.According to management, UAL’s earnings this year could be as high as $12 per share, exceeding the $11.58 per share in earnings reported in 2019. Investors are starting to take a “wait and see” approach with UAL stock. With a recession looming, it makes sense that many investors are skeptical that United will keep taking off.That said, even if this airline only delivers results in line with sell-side forecasts ($7.63 per share), one can argue UAL is already in the bargain stocks category, with a forward price-earnings ratio of around 6.5-times. As Louis Navellier recently argued, there may be a strong chance United exceeds expectations based on current airline demand trends.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayIt doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

In return, the state gets a share of the plant and the profits it makes,"" Papperger suggested.""This is an investment that is not feasible for the industry on its own. It is an investment into national security, and therefore we need the federal state,"" he said.The plant is needed as shortages in the production of special powders could turn out to be a bottleneck, hampering efforts to boost the output of tank and artillery shells, he noted.A few days before the meeting with the new defence minister, Papperger pushed for an increase of Germany's defence budget.""The 51 billion euros in the defence budget will not suffice to purchase everything that is needed. And the money in the 100 billion euro special funds has already been earmarked - and partially been eaten up by inflation,"" he said.""100 billion euros sounds like a giant sum but we would actually need a 300 billion euro package to order everything that's needed,"" he added, noting that the 100 billion special fund does not include ammunitions purchases.Even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Germany was 20 billion euros short of reaching NATO's target for ammunitions stockpiling, according to a defence source.To plug the munitions gap alone, Papperger estimates the Bundeswehr (German armed forces) would need to invest three to four billion euros per year.In the talks with the minister, the defence boss hopes for a turn towards a more sustainable long-term planning in German procurement, stretching several years into the future, as the industry needed to be able to make its arrangements in time.""What we are doing at the moment is actually war stocking: Last year, we prefinanced 600 to 700 million euros for goods,"" Papperger said. ""We must move away from this crisis management - it is crisis management when you buy (raw materials and other things) without having a contract - and get into a regular routine.""

If you want to skip our discussion and see the top stocks, go to 5 Cash-Rich Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. The persistent sell-off in equity markets last year is a powerful sign that the U.S. economy is heading for a hard landing amid the central bank’s fight to beat inflation. As investors brace for an expected recession in 2023, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index was down 18.2% in 2022 and had its biggest annual decline since 2008, as the Federal Reserve mounts its most aggressive monetary policy tightening cycle in decades to fight surging inflation. Whether or not a bona fide recession is in the cards for 2023, the period of “slow growth” outlined by the Fed could just as well foreshadow further economic stagnation and job losses that characterize periods of recessions.William Dickens, a University Distinguished Professor and the chair of the Department of Economics at Northeastern University, states that:""Normally we think of just having to deal with a supply shock, which we’ve had plenty of over the last few years between COVID-19, Russia’s [war in Ukraine], with the food and energy crisis, and so on. On the other hand, we’ve also seen overstimulated economies before—ones where the unemployment rate gets so low that employers are having a hard time finding workers so they start jacking up wages, which is another source of inflation.”In periods of high inflation, dividend stocks have recorded strong performance relative to the broader market. Cash-rich companies that hold long dividend growth track records are particularly popular in this regard. The best dividend stocks this year exhibited strong performance and hold decades-long dividend growth track records. These include cash-rich companies that consistently grow their dividends in order to significantly increase portfolio returns for the long term during turbulent market conditions. Some dividend stocks that remained famous the previous year include Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), among others discussed in detail below.Story continuesIt is important to note that the performance of individual dividend stocks can vary greatly during a recession, and there is no guarantee that a particular dividend stock will perform well. As with any investment, it is important to carefully research and evaluate the financial health and prospects of a company before making an investment decision.12 Cash-Rich Dividend Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by NeONBRAND on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article we used stock screeners to list down companies that pay dividends and have enterprise values less than their market caps. A higher EV to Market Capitalization ratio is generally not preferred as it shows that the company has high levels of debt. Such firms are deemed risky. A lower EV to Market Capitalization ratio, on the other hand, is more favorable as that would mean that the firm has low debt levels and is, in turn, considered a relatively safer investment.The stocks in this list are ranked in ascending order according to the difference between their enterprise value and market capitalization. Additionally, Insider Monkey makes use of its database of 920 elite funds to track hedge fund holdings as of the third quarter of the year to gauge the hedge fund sentiment around each stock. We have mentioned number of hedge funds having stakes in these companies with each stock.Cash-Rich Dividend Stocks To Buy Now12. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Number Of Hedge Fund Holders: 77Dividend Yield As Of January 20: 3.64%Market Capitalization: $253.22 billionEnterprise Value (EV): $253 billionPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is an American multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology corporation that Pfizer develops and produces medicines and vaccines for immunology, oncology, cardiology, endocrinology, and neurology. The company boasts several standout drugs and products that each generate more than $1 billion in annual revenues.Earlier this December, Goldman Sachs analyst Chris Shibutani upgraded Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $60, up from $47. According to the analyst, positive updates from the company's pipeline, and the potential for outperformance from the commercial new product launch portfolio over the course of the coming year, can drive ""meaningful upside"" to the value ascribed to Pfizer's base business. He also believes that there is a ""sufficiently lessened degree of uncertainty"" regarding dynamics that will impact Pfizer's COVID-19 franchise, and the ""trough sales"" scenarios for the portfolio do not present ""thesis-changing downside.""Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has been consistently growing its dividends for the past 12 years. The company offers a quarterly dividend of $0.41 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.64%, as of January 20.Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) was a part of 77 hedge fund portfolios in Q3 2022, up from 70 in the previous quarter, as per Insider Monkey’s database. The collective value of stakes owned by these hedge funds is over $2.4 billion. Among these hedge funds, AQR Capital Management was the company’s leading stakeholder in Q3.Similar to Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is a dividend stock that pays handsomely.Here’s what Diamond Hill Capital said about Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Labs, global pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG). Although Pfizer continues to report strong performance of its core drugs, sales of its COVID vaccine and treatment have likely peaked and sales are expected to decline going forward. We remain optimistic about the company long term as we believe management is taking the company in the right direction, focusing R&amp;D, and making strategic acquisitions with profits generated from COVID vaccine sales.”11. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number Of Hedge Fund Holders: 85Dividend Yield As Of January 20: 2.56%Market Capitalization: $440.07 billionEnterprise Value (EV): $439.12 billionJohnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is an American multinational corporation founded in 1886 that develops medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and consumer packaged goods. A premier dividend stock with over 60 consecutive years of dividend increases, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) paid a $1.13 per share quarterly dividend to shareholders with a yield of 2.56% on January 20.At the beginning of December, Morgan Stanley analyst Terence Flynn raised the price target on Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) to $178 from $170 and maintained an Equal Weight rating on the shares as he refreshed his sum-of-the-parts valuation ahead of the company separating its Consumer Health segment into an independent company, to be called ""Kenvue,"" in the second half of 2023.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 85 hedge funds were bullish on Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), compared to 83 funds in the last quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with nearly 6 million shares worth $967.2 million.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Mayar Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is currently our largest position and a long-standing holding. The majority of the group’s sales comes from its collection of pharmaceutical franchises, but a large majority (~45%) comes from its collection of medical device businesses and its consumer brands.Here’s how JNJ makes and spends a dollar of revenues: As of 2021, about 55 cents of that dollar comes from its pharmaceutical sales – sales of drugs to pharmacies and distributors – while 30 cents come from the sale of medical devices, such as surgery equipment and orthopedics. The rest of that dollar in sales comes from sales of JNJ’s consumer brands such as Listerine mouthwash, Nicorette nicotine tablets and Neutrogena cosmetics (…read more)10. Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN)Number Of Hedge Fund Holders: 59Dividend Yield As Of January 20: 2.87%Market Capitalization: $157 billionEnterprise Value (EV): $155.86 billionTexas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) is an American technology company headquartered in Dallas, Texas, that designs and manufactures semiconductors and various integrated circuits, which it sells to electronics designers and manufacturers globally.Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.24 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.87%, as recorded on January 20.Citi analyst Christopher Danely raised the firm's price target on Texas Instruments to $175 from $155 and maintained a Neutral rating on the shares on January 18. Although the analyst expects consensus estimates for the U.S. semiconductors group to further decline during earnings season driven by continued downside from the PC, wireless, consumer and auto end markets, he thinks the industrial end market appears to be holding up better than expected. Danely remains hopeful that semiconductor stocks will bottom in the first half ""after every company has aggressively cut estimates.""According to Insider Monkey’s database, 59 hedge funds owned stakes in the company at the end of the September quarter. First Eagle Investment Management held the biggest stake in Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) at the end of Q3 2022.9. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number Of Hedge Fund Holders: 69Dividend Yield As Of January 20: 0.79%Market Capitalization: $214.08 billionEnterprise Value (EV): $207.91 billionCostco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is an American multinational corporation that engages in the operation of membership warehouses, leading as one of the biggest retailers in the world across several selected categories.Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 17 years. The company pays a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share for a dividend yield of 0.79%, as of January 20.On December 9, Truist analyst Scot Ciccarelli lowered the price target on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) to $538 from $557 after its Q1 earnings miss but maintained a Buy rating on the shares. Despite some big-ticket softness, the analyst stated that Q1 sales remained extremely steady on a stacked basis, while sales of necessities like food and sundries also remain ""very strong"". Ciccarelli adds that he is positive on Costco given the potential for a membership fee increase, a special dividend/payout to shareholders, and the company's continual share gains.As of the close of Q3 2022, 69 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned stakes in Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), up from 64 in the previous quarter. These stakes have an aggregate value of over $4.42 billion. With stakes over $1.2 billion, Fisher Asset Management owned the largest position in the company in Q3.Cooper Investors shared its outlook on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“The US economy continues to run hot – the labour market is extremely tight and a number of executives we spoke to described their challenges in retaining staff and preventing competitors from poaching talent. Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever than can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”8. Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO)Number Of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Dividend Yield As Of January 20: 6.85%Market Capitalization: $192.18 billionEnterprise Value (EV): $181.27 billionCisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), commonly known as Cisco, is an American-based multinational digital communications technology conglomerate corporation that specializes in switches, routers, cybersecurity, and IoT.Earlier this November, BofA analysts added Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) to their ""US 1 List,"" which represents a collection of the best investment ideas that are drawn from the universe of Buy-rated, U.S.-listed stocks covered by BofA Global Research fundamental equity research analysts.On January 17, Piper Sandler analyst James Fish raised his price target on Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) to $49 from $47 and kept a Neutral rating on the shares. The analyst adjusted estimates and valuations across the cloud automation software sector ahead of earnings.On December 7, Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) declared a $0.38 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on January 25, to shareholders of record on January 5.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 68 hedge funds were long Cisco Systems, Inc.

John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 9.70 million shares worth $388 million.In its Q1 2022 investor letter, Carillon Tower Advisers, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) traded lower as investors weighed how supply chain concerns would impact sales growth. The company has been upgrading its switching and routing offerings, which should lead to strong demand as on-site locations upgrade infrastructure.”7. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number Of Hedge Fund Holders: 89Dividend Yield As Of January 20: 0.09%Market Capitalization: $448.04 billionEnterprise Value (EV): $436.65 billionNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a California-based technology company known for designing and manufacturing graphics processing units (GPUs). A global leader in artificial intelligence hardware and software, its professional line of GPUs are used in workstations for applications in such fields as architecture, engineering and construction, media and entertainment, automotive, scientific research, and manufacturing design.On January 11, KeyBanc analyst John Vinh maintained an Overweight rating on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) but lowered the firm’s price target on the shares to $220 from $230. Although his quarterly supply chain findings were mostly negative, the analyst continues to see a ""soft landing"" scenario and believes that semiconductor companies are in a much better position to navigate a downturn given better visibility, more secular drivers, and better pricing leverage.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 89 hedge funds were bullish on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) at the end of September 2022, compared to 84 funds in the prior quarter.

Therefore the domestic fertilizer sector is likely to grow rapidly, pushing fertilizer stock to new heights.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe global fertilizer market is expected to grow substantially, in line with population expansion.

Despite this, inventories still fell, and Nutrien anticipates the sector replenishing its inventories, particularly in North America and Brazil.Farmers were discouraged from buying Nutrien products during this period because fertilizer prices were not attractive enough. But with new price incentives, farmers are now ready to restock to prepare for the upcoming application season.

A Look At Its Intrinsic Value",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/williams-companies-inc-nyse-wmb-140105978.html,1674914465,STORY,['WMB'],"[Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of The Williams Companies, Inc. (NYSE:WMB) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Williams Companies What's The Estimated Valuation?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.84bUS$3.04bUS$2.97bUS$3.12bUS$3.31bUS$3.40bUS$3.48bUS$3.57bUS$3.65bUS$3.72bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 2.73%Est @ 2.51%Est @ 2.35%Est @ 2.24%Est @ 2.16% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 12% US$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.1kUS$2.0kUS$1.9kUS$1.8kUS$1.6kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$19bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 12%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.7b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (12%– 2.0%) = US$40bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$40b÷ ( 1 + 12%)10= US$13bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$32b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$31.5, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Williams Companies as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 12%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.586. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Williams CompaniesStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.Debt is well covered by cash flow.Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Oil and Gas industry.Interest payments on debt are not well covered.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 4 years.ThreatDividends are not covered by earnings.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price exceeding the intrinsic value? For Williams Companies, we've compiled three pertinent factors you should assess:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 3 warning signs  with Williams Companies (at least 1 which is concerning)  , and understanding these should be part of your investment process.Future Earnings: How does WMB's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

The FTSE All Equity REIT Index lost a quarter of its value last year compared with a 40% drop during 2008.However, the article also notes that several real estate fund managers believe 2023 will be a good year for the sector because many REITs have already been priced for a recession. In addition, REITs had reasonably good balance sheets heading into the new year.“In 2023, we think the word is going to be ‘resilience,’” said John Worth, Nareit executive vice president for research and investor outreach. “In the face of an uncertain economy and rising rates, REITs are well prepared. They have built balance sheets that can weather higher rates.” InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsContrarian investors can find plenty of opportunities in the sector.

In 2006, the REIT acquired Shurgard Storage Centers for $5.5 billion, giving it a foothold in Europe with 141 locations there. Since the beginning of 2019, Public Storage has spent $8 billion to expand its portfolio by 26%, adding an additional 42 million square feet of space. Story continuesIn the 12 months that ended Sept. 30, the REIT had $4 billion in revenue and $3 billion in net operating income. The REIT’s net debt and preferred equity are 3.3x earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Its long-term target is between 4x and 5x EBITDA.PSA appears more than ready to handle anything that happens in 2023. First Industrial Realty Trust (FR)stocks to buy: warehouse interior with shelves, pallets and boxes DSource: Don Pablo / Shutterstock.comFirst Industrial Realty Trust (NYSE:FR) is an industrial real estate owner, operator and developer. At the time it went public in 1994, it had 226 industrial properties with 17.4 million square feet of gross leasable space across nine cities. Today, it owns or has under development 68.4 million square feet of industrial space across 439 properties. And it serves nearly 1,000 customers.Over its nearly three-decade history, it’s developed over 80.3 million square feet. It focuses on bulk and regional distribution centers that enable its customers to meet their supply chain needs. While there are concerns about a recession weighing on consumer spending, e-commerce is trending in the right direction. In October, First Industrial Realty Trust reported excellent Q3 results. Highlights included a 98.3% occupancy rate and a nearly 31% increase in cash rental rates. Management also increased its 2022 funds from operations guidance to between $2.21 and $2.25 a share. Finally, the REIT began a three-building, 1.8 million-square-foot development in Phoenix with an estimated value of $210 million. Trading at 16.7 times cash flow, FR is relatively cheap now compared to its historical multiple.REITs to Buy: Host Hotels &amp; Resorts (HST)Hotel roomSource: Dragon Images / ShutterstockHost Hotels &amp; Resorts (NASDAQ:HST) is the largest lodging REIT in the world, owning 78 hotels with a combined 42,200 rooms primarily in the United States. Its stock has gotten off to a fast start in 2023 with shares up nearly 14% year to date.  The REIT’s balance sheet is very healthy. As of the third quarter of 2022, it had a net leverage multiple of 2.4x, with $2.2 billion of available liquidity should it want to acquire more properties. In addition, its revenue per available room was up 1.4% over the third quarter of 2019, suggesting that the hotel business is nearly recovered from the pandemic.On Nov. 2, Host Hotels &amp; Resorts announced it had acquired The Four Seasons Resort and Residences in Jackson Hole, Wyo., for $315 million. Host paid approximately 13.6 times EBITDA, or a 6.6% cap rate, defined as net operating income divided by the purchase price. The revenue per available room at the Four Seasons property is $855, making it one of the REIT’s top assets. A key to Host’s success is getting more for the properties it sells than what it’s paying for the properties it buys. For its 2021 and 2022 acquisitions, it paid 13.1x EBITDA, while its dispositions over the same period averaged 17.7x EBITDA. That’s a win in my books.  Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA)picture of the interior of an apartmentSource: ShutterstockAs its name suggests, Mid-America Apartment Communities (NYSE:MAA) owns and operates apartment communities primarily in the high-growth Sunbelt region of the U.S.  As of Sept. 30, it had an ownership interest in 101,769 apartment homes across 16 states and the District of Columbia.Its top five markets are Atlanta (12.8% of its Q3 same-store net operating income), Dallas (9.2%), Tampa, Fla. (6.9%), Charlotte, N.C. (6.5%), and Orlando, Fla. (6.3%). These markets are all experiencing higher-than-average job and population growth, according to a recent investor presentation. This should help Mid-America Apartment Communities attract higher-income tenants, leading to increased rents. For example, in its top market of Atlanta, the average new resident at one of its buildings earns $97,415, is 33, single, and pays $1,810 in monthly rent. The average income for all of its top 10 markets is $92,940, with an average monthly rent of $1,719. Spread out over more than 100,00o units, that’s pretty darn good.Over the past five years, MAA has had a cumulative return of 64.5%, considerably higher than the S&amp;P 500’s roughly 40% return over the same period. REITs to Buy: Healthpeak Properties (PEAK)two doctors look over a piece of paper while standing in a hallwaySource: ShutterstockHealthpeak Properties (NYSE:PEAK) invests in assets serving the U.S. healthcare industry. It focuses on life sciences, medical offices and continuing care retirement communities. Healthpeak went public in 1985 as Health Care Property Investors and became Healthpeak in November 2019. Today, it owns more than $20 billion of healthcare-related real estate.Healthcare is one of those sectors that’s always in style. In fact, with an aging population, healthcare real estate becomes even more critical to the success of our medical care.Highlights of Healthpeak’s Q3 results include a 7.5% year-over-year increase in its FFO for the quarter to 43 cents, 5.1% same-store cash adjusted net operating income growth, and an additional 36,000 square feet at its Brisbane, Calif., pharmaceutical and biotech campus being placed in service. The REIT’s balance sheet is fortress-like, with net debt that’s just one-third of its $21.3 billion enterprise value and around 5x adjusted EBITDA.  Of the 21 analysts who cover the stock, 14 rate it “overweight” or a “buy” with an average target price of $28.68, which is about 6% above the current share price.Boston Properties (BXP)Group of colleagues discuss something in an office conference room.Source: GaudiLab / ShutterstockBoston Properties (NYSE:BXP) is the “largest publicly traded developer, owner, and manager of premier workplaces in the United States”. It owns 193 properties with 53.5 million square feet of office space generating $3.1 billion in annualized revenue as of Sept. 30.Wisely, it concentrates its properties in six markets: Boston (34.7% of total premier space in the central business district), Washington D.C. (19.9%), San Francisco (39%), Seattle (25.1%), and Manhattan (9.6%). Over the past 10 years, its FFO per share has grown by a 3.5% compound annual rate from $5.26 in 2014 to an estimated $7.15 in 2023.  Between 2010 and 2022, Boston Properties did an excellent job of recycling its capital. Over the 12 years, it disposed of $7.3 billion of real estate at $574.80 a square foot, acquired $7.1 billion at $518.25 a square foot, and developed $8.8 billion at $556.96 a square foot. As I mentioned above, you want to see REITs getting more for dispositions than they pay out for acquisitions and development properties. Currently, Boston Properties has 4.4 million square feet in development, with between 49% and 100% of the space pre-leased. BXP trades at 9.9x its projected 2023 FFO per share. Based on its earnings, BXP shares are cheaper than they’ve been in a decade.  REITs to Buy: Simon Property Group (SPG)the interior of a crowded shopping mallSource: jayk67 / Shutterstock.comSimon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) went on a tear following the Great Recession. Between March 2009 and mid-2016, shares of the retail REIT gained 626%. Unfortunately for shareholders, it’s been mostly downhill since then. From retail implosions due to e-commerce’s rising dominance to Covid-19, it’s been tough for SPG stock to get on a roll, but not for lack of trying. It’s entered multiple partnerships in the past few years to diversify its revenue beyond rents at its malls in the U.S., Europe and Asia.  In October, Simon announced that it would partner with Jamestown, an Atlanta-based real estate asset management firm with $13.1 billion under management, to invest in future mixed-use real estate opportunities. Simon acquired 50% of Johnstown as part of this partnership. “With Jamestown, Simon will gain an opportunity to capitalize on the growing asset and investment management businesses with an experienced fund manager and mixed-use operator and developer, utilizing the Jamestown platform to accelerate Simon’s future densification projects,” the accompanying press release stated.In November, Simon celebrated the Nobu Hotel &amp; Restaurant opening at Phipps Plaza, Simon’s mixed-use redevelopment in the Buckhead community in Atlanta. CEO David Simon and his uncle, Herb Simon, are some of the REIT’s largest shareholders. Their long-term approach to growing the business should pay dividends over the long haul. If Simon fails, America fails.  On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

If you want to skip our discussion and see the top stocks, go to 5 Cash-Rich Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. The persistent sell-off in equity markets last year is a powerful sign that the U.S. economy is heading for a hard landing amid the central bank’s fight to beat inflation. As investors brace for an expected recession in 2023, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index was down 18.2% in 2022 and had its biggest annual decline since 2008, as the Federal Reserve mounts its most aggressive monetary policy tightening cycle in decades to fight surging inflation. Whether or not a bona fide recession is in the cards for 2023, the period of “slow growth” outlined by the Fed could just as well foreshadow further economic stagnation and job losses that characterize periods of recessions.William Dickens, a University Distinguished Professor and the chair of the Department of Economics at Northeastern University, states that:""Normally we think of just having to deal with a supply shock, which we’ve had plenty of over the last few years between COVID-19, Russia’s [war in Ukraine], with the food and energy crisis, and so on. On the other hand, we’ve also seen overstimulated economies before—ones where the unemployment rate gets so low that employers are having a hard time finding workers so they start jacking up wages, which is another source of inflation.”In periods of high inflation, dividend stocks have recorded strong performance relative to the broader market. Cash-rich companies that hold long dividend growth track records are particularly popular in this regard. The best dividend stocks this year exhibited strong performance and hold decades-long dividend growth track records. These include cash-rich companies that consistently grow their dividends in order to significantly increase portfolio returns for the long term during turbulent market conditions. Some dividend stocks that remained famous the previous year include Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), among others discussed in detail below.Story continuesIt is important to note that the performance of individual dividend stocks can vary greatly during a recession, and there is no guarantee that a particular dividend stock will perform well. As with any investment, it is important to carefully research and evaluate the financial health and prospects of a company before making an investment decision.12 Cash-Rich Dividend Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by NeONBRAND on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article we used stock screeners to list down companies that pay dividends and have enterprise values less than their market caps. A higher EV to Market Capitalization ratio is generally not preferred as it shows that the company has high levels of debt. Such firms are deemed risky. A lower EV to Market Capitalization ratio, on the other hand, is more favorable as that would mean that the firm has low debt levels and is, in turn, considered a relatively safer investment.The stocks in this list are ranked in ascending order according to the difference between their enterprise value and market capitalization. Additionally, Insider Monkey makes use of its database of 920 elite funds to track hedge fund holdings as of the third quarter of the year to gauge the hedge fund sentiment around each stock. We have mentioned number of hedge funds having stakes in these companies with each stock.Cash-Rich Dividend Stocks To Buy Now12. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Number Of Hedge Fund Holders: 77Dividend Yield As Of January 20: 3.64%Market Capitalization: $253.22 billionEnterprise Value (EV): $253 billionPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is an American multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology corporation that Pfizer develops and produces medicines and vaccines for immunology, oncology, cardiology, endocrinology, and neurology. The company boasts several standout drugs and products that each generate more than $1 billion in annual revenues.Earlier this December, Goldman Sachs analyst Chris Shibutani upgraded Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $60, up from $47. According to the analyst, positive updates from the company's pipeline, and the potential for outperformance from the commercial new product launch portfolio over the course of the coming year, can drive ""meaningful upside"" to the value ascribed to Pfizer's base business. He also believes that there is a ""sufficiently lessened degree of uncertainty"" regarding dynamics that will impact Pfizer's COVID-19 franchise, and the ""trough sales"" scenarios for the portfolio do not present ""thesis-changing downside.""Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has been consistently growing its dividends for the past 12 years. The company offers a quarterly dividend of $0.41 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.64%, as of January 20.Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) was a part of 77 hedge fund portfolios in Q3 2022, up from 70 in the previous quarter, as per Insider Monkey’s database. The collective value of stakes owned by these hedge funds is over $2.4 billion. Among these hedge funds, AQR Capital Management was the company’s leading stakeholder in Q3.Similar to Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is a dividend stock that pays handsomely.Here’s what Diamond Hill Capital said about Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Labs, global pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG). Although Pfizer continues to report strong performance of its core drugs, sales of its COVID vaccine and treatment have likely peaked and sales are expected to decline going forward. We remain optimistic about the company long term as we believe management is taking the company in the right direction, focusing R&amp;D, and making strategic acquisitions with profits generated from COVID vaccine sales.”11. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number Of Hedge Fund Holders: 85Dividend Yield As Of January 20: 2.56%Market Capitalization: $440.07 billionEnterprise Value (EV): $439.12 billionJohnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is an American multinational corporation founded in 1886 that develops medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and consumer packaged goods.

Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with nearly 6 million shares worth $967.2 million.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Mayar Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is currently our largest position and a long-standing holding. The majority of the group’s sales comes from its collection of pharmaceutical franchises, but a large majority (~45%) comes from its collection of medical device businesses and its consumer brands.Here’s how JNJ makes and spends a dollar of revenues: As of 2021, about 55 cents of that dollar comes from its pharmaceutical sales – sales of drugs to pharmacies and distributors – while 30 cents come from the sale of medical devices, such as surgery equipment and orthopedics. The rest of that dollar in sales comes from sales of JNJ’s consumer brands such as Listerine mouthwash, Nicorette nicotine tablets and Neutrogena cosmetics (…read more)10. Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN)Number Of Hedge Fund Holders: 59Dividend Yield As Of January 20: 2.87%Market Capitalization: $157 billionEnterprise Value (EV): $155.86 billionTexas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) is an American technology company headquartered in Dallas, Texas, that designs and manufactures semiconductors and various integrated circuits, which it sells to electronics designers and manufacturers globally.Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.24 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.87%, as recorded on January 20.Citi analyst Christopher Danely raised the firm's price target on Texas Instruments to $175 from $155 and maintained a Neutral rating on the shares on January 18. Although the analyst expects consensus estimates for the U.S. semiconductors group to further decline during earnings season driven by continued downside from the PC, wireless, consumer and auto end markets, he thinks the industrial end market appears to be holding up better than expected. Danely remains hopeful that semiconductor stocks will bottom in the first half ""after every company has aggressively cut estimates.""According to Insider Monkey’s database, 59 hedge funds owned stakes in the company at the end of the September quarter. First Eagle Investment Management held the biggest stake in Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) at the end of Q3 2022.9. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number Of Hedge Fund Holders: 69Dividend Yield As Of January 20: 0.79%Market Capitalization: $214.08 billionEnterprise Value (EV): $207.91 billionCostco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is an American multinational corporation that engages in the operation of membership warehouses, leading as one of the biggest retailers in the world across several selected categories.Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 17 years. The company pays a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share for a dividend yield of 0.79%, as of January 20.On December 9, Truist analyst Scot Ciccarelli lowered the price target on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) to $538 from $557 after its Q1 earnings miss but maintained a Buy rating on the shares. Despite some big-ticket softness, the analyst stated that Q1 sales remained extremely steady on a stacked basis, while sales of necessities like food and sundries also remain ""very strong"". Ciccarelli adds that he is positive on Costco given the potential for a membership fee increase, a special dividend/payout to shareholders, and the company's continual share gains.As of the close of Q3 2022, 69 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned stakes in Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), up from 64 in the previous quarter. These stakes have an aggregate value of over $4.42 billion. With stakes over $1.2 billion, Fisher Asset Management owned the largest position in the company in Q3.Cooper Investors shared its outlook on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“The US economy continues to run hot – the labour market is extremely tight and a number of executives we spoke to described their challenges in retaining staff and preventing competitors from poaching talent. Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever than can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”8. Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO)Number Of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Dividend Yield As Of January 20: 6.85%Market Capitalization: $192.18 billionEnterprise Value (EV): $181.27 billionCisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), commonly known as Cisco, is an American-based multinational digital communications technology conglomerate corporation that specializes in switches, routers, cybersecurity, and IoT.Earlier this November, BofA analysts added Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) to their ""US 1 List,"" which represents a collection of the best investment ideas that are drawn from the universe of Buy-rated, U.S.-listed stocks covered by BofA Global Research fundamental equity research analysts.On January 17, Piper Sandler analyst James Fish raised his price target on Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) to $49 from $47 and kept a Neutral rating on the shares. The analyst adjusted estimates and valuations across the cloud automation software sector ahead of earnings.On December 7, Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) declared a $0.38 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on January 25, to shareholders of record on January 5.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 68 hedge funds were long Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 63 funds in the prior quarter. John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 9.70 million shares worth $388 million.In its Q1 2022 investor letter, Carillon Tower Advisers, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) traded lower as investors weighed how supply chain concerns would impact sales growth. The company has been upgrading its switching and routing offerings, which should lead to strong demand as on-site locations upgrade infrastructure.”7. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number Of Hedge Fund Holders: 89Dividend Yield As Of January 20: 0.09%Market Capitalization: $448.04 billionEnterprise Value (EV): $436.65 billionNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a California-based technology company known for designing and manufacturing graphics processing units (GPUs).

Near term uncertainty from the crypto market correction and the semiconductor cycle have weighed on shares and offered an attractive entry point for long-term investors.”6. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)Number Of Hedge Fund Holders: 87Dividend Yield As Of January 20: 1.54%Market Capitalization: $442.49 billionEnterprise Value (EV): $421.18 billionTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is a Taiwanese multinational semiconductor contract manufacturing and design company that operates as one of the world's largest integrated circuit foundries that holds a significant edge over its competitors when it comes to the manufacture and production of advanced semiconductor chips.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.44 with a yield of 1.54% as of January 20.At the end of Q3 2022, 87 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database were long Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM). Berkshire Hathaway remained the leading stakeholder of the company at the end of Q3 2022.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) ranks among the likes of Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) as a decent cash-rich dividend stock.Here is what Baron Funds had to say about Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Semiconductor giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) detracted from performance due to the global macroeconomic slowdown and softening demand for consumer electronics. We retain conviction that Taiwan Semi’s technological leadership, pricing power, and exposure to secular growth markets, including high-performance computing, automotive, and IoT, will allow the company to deliver strong revenue growth over the next several years.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Cash-Rich Dividend Stocks to Buy Now. Suggested Articles:11 Best Mineral Stocks To Buy Now12 Best Momentum Stocks To Invest In11 Safe Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsDisclosure.

75,56c3be0e-3655-3a4f-adc0-b9214c0e8ca0,PYPL,2023-01-29,7 Growth Stocks to Buy as a New Bull Market Emerges,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-growth-stocks-buy-bull-215149958.html,1674683509,STORY,"['GOOGL', 'META', 'PYPL', 'AMZN']","[There are plenty of ominous headlines weighing on investors. There’s the Doomsday Clock, which now sits at 90 seconds to midnight. There are even growing fears of a potential recession. However, if you look beyond the negativity, there are still plenty of enticing opportunities, especially in growth stocks to buy.For one thing, if a recession materializes, it won’t catch people off guard as the Great Recession did. Therefore, it’s quite possible that the preparatory actions that many folks undeniably implemented may mitigate downside shocks. As well, households arguably stand on much firmer ground than during prior economic downcycles. So, it’s not out of the question that growth stocks to buy may perform well. Again, investors shouldn’t dismiss legitimate concerns, but they shouldn’t ignore opportunities either. With that, here are growth stocks to buy.AMZNAmazon$97.18GOOG GOOGLAlphabet$96.73PYPLPayPal$79.10METAMeta Platforms$141.50ROVRRover Group$3.73IMAXIMAX.$17.00LCIDLucid Group$8.87InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAmazon (AMZN)Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stockSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comThough typically a domineering force among growth stocks to buy, the wild events of 2022 gave Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) a beatdown. In the trailing year, AMZN lost over 31% of its equity value. Unfortunately, the main culprit centered on soaring inflation. With the velocity of money accelerating throughout 2022, prices had nowhere to go but up. Nevertheless, Amazon’s core e-commerce business may continue to enjoy significant relevance. Data from the U.S. Census Bureau revealed that since e-commerce sales as a percentage of total retail sales hit a recent low in the first quarter of 2022, this stat has since increased conspicuously. With online transactions rising despite inflationary pressures, this dynamic bodes well for AMZN.Since we’re talking about growth stocks to buy, we should also recognize that the years merely represent a number for Amazon. For instance, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 25.1%, beating out over 86% of the competition.Story continuesAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphoneSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) just announced Google will lay off a total of 12,000 employees. All in an effort to become leaner and meaner. Still, our own Louis Navellier believes the job cuts will have little positive impact on Google. While the layoffs might not be the game-changer for Alphabet, it’s still one of the growth stocks to buy (in my view). Fundamentally, the Google ecosystem has become too pervasive to ignore. As I’ve said a bunch of times, Google utterly dominates the search engine space. And even with rising competition in this arena, Google commands enormous brand awareness. It’s just too difficult to topple the king of the Internet. Combined with other arms of the Google ecosystem – such as Gmail and its cloud network – Alphabet will not go down without a fight.PayPal (PYPL)Future of PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL) Stock: It’s All About VenmoSource: ShutterstockPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) succumbed to pressure in 2022. In the trailing year, PYPL gave up nearly 50% of its equity value. And while shares gained nearly 7% on a year-to-date basis, it’s not that impressive given the scale of volatility. Nevertheless, in my view, PYPL ranks among the growth stocks to buy. Fundamentally, I’m a big believer in the gig economy. To be fair, I speak about the subject frequently because I’m a member of this movement. Nevertheless, the data aligns with my biases. For instance, experts from Industry Research believe that the gig economy will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.18% between 2022 to 2027. At the end of this forecasted period, the sector could reach a valuation of $873 billion. Given that PayPal’s services support small-business enterprises, it’s a lock for growth stocks to buy. Contrarians just need patience.Meta Platforms (META)META stock logo is shown on a device screen. Meta is the new corporate name of Facebook.Source: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.comOne of the most frustrating growth stocks to buy is Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Owning the world’s biggest online social network Facebook, Meta can exploit this platform for various upside endeavors. True, digital advertising spending eroded badly last year. Still, businesses must advertise to attract new customers. Better yet, the rate of ad-spending decline appears to have slowed. Personally, I think it’s wonderful news for META stock and similar growth stocks to buy. However, the underlying company continues to get in its own way. Mounting criticism (and losses) associated with the firm’s metaverse pivot cloud the overall organization.It’s a serious problem. Nevertheless, one positive factor exists. Management just needs to ride with what works and limit (or outright abandon) what doesn’t. That’s a much easier prospect than attempting to find a viable business. Therefore, patient investors should target META as one of the growth stocks to buy.Rover Group (ROVR)A terrier lies on a dog bed with a cone on.Source: ShutterstockIf Rover Group (NASDAQ:ROVR) ever decisively becomes one of the growth stocks to buy, it should thank Disney (NYSE:DIS). Not too long ago, the entertainment giant’s CEO Bog Iger effectively put an end to remote operations. Recalling hybrid workers back to the office for four days of the week, employees will no longer be able to directly care for their pets.Cynically, though, that puts Rover – which provides a marketplace connecting dog owners with canine service providers – in the driver’s seat. By itself, Rover plays into the aforementioned burgeoning economy. However, with Disney likely to inspire other major enterprises to recall their employees, Fido will be left home alone. Indeed, for the dogs that suddenly got used to their human family members staying at home all the time, the transition will be particularly traumatic. And this just raises the cynical catalyst for ROVR to a whole new level. While it’s undoubtedly risky, Rover also represents a compelling example of growth stocks to buy.Imax (IMAX)the exterior of an Imax theaterSource: imageAllan / Shutterstock.comIf you’re a history buff, you’ll recognize the bullish narrative for Imax (NYSE:IMAX) right away. For everyone else, back during the Great Depression, Americans needed a pick-me-up. That’s where the golden age of Hollywood filled a critical need, bolstering the psyche of a demoralized nation. In a similar fashion, Imax can do the same for the world today, making it one of the growth stocks to buy. Essentially, with fears of a recession and an ominous Doomsday Clock clouding the broader narrative, people need escapism. Worse yet, these aren’t just irrational concerns. As stated earlier, mass layoffs impose a real human cost to poor economic data.Considering how expensive other entertainment options are, Imax stands as a practical bargain. Combining this dynamic with the presence of other moviegoers, Imax could play a vital social role. As well, the Imax experience – with its special projectors – cannot be duplicated at home. Thus, the insulation from streaming companies adds to the case for growth stocks to buy.Lucid Group (LCID)Exterior of Lucid Motors (LCID) buildingSource: gg5795 / Shutterstock.comWhile range anxiety had its moment, if you ask consumers what their hesitation toward electric vehicles is, chances are, the answer would come down to cost. Basically, EVs have become too freaking expensive. Right now, the average price of a new EV stands at over $66,000. Sure, EV advocates can go into contortions to stretch this narrative however they like. But we’re still talking about $66,000.However, the one company that probably won’t be bothered by this barrier is Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID). Deliberately targeting customers of affluence, Lucid just won’t mess around with the middle-income crowd. While it might be in the future, management understands that current economies of scale don’t support mass-scale EV integration. Until the industry gets there, Lucid will focus on customers that can afford their products.Fundamentally, management probably operates on firm ground. Due to the widening wealth gap, the super-affluent command more of America’s wealth than ever before. Cynically, that should benefit Lucid, not necessarily the companies targeting middle-income drivers. Thus, LCID ranks among the growth stocks to buy.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

There are many ways to play this, but you may want to focus on bargain stocks instead of diving into meme stocks or even more established growth stocks.Why? According to some analysts, these stocks, also known as value stocks, could outperform growth names between now and when interest rates potentially start to come down. In addition, while rates could drop this year, chances are they will not fall back to the near-zero levels experienced during the pandemic.Growth stocks, which went on a tear in 2021 thanks to near-zero rates, may have more limited recovery potential. Alongside the potential for a more significant upside in a stock market rebound, limited downside risk with bargain names in this current macro climate may be wrong, with the bear market continuing from here.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThese seven bargain stocks are more favorable from a risk/reward standpoint.

Boyd’s flagship properties are in downtown Las Vegas and off the Las Vegas strip, but the company’s portfolio also includes regional properties throughout the United States.Compared to other casino stocks, BYD stock is attractively priced. The company’s shares today trade for only 11.7-times earnings. By comparison, another prominent name in regional casino gaming, Penn Entertainment (NASDAQ:PENN), sells for 24-times earnings.Despite trading at a deep value multiple (implying limited growth potential), one analyst (Credit Suisse’s Benjamin Chaiken) has recently argued that Boyd does, in fact, have growth catalysts in play, in large part due to Boyd’s recent acquisition of iGaming company Pala Interactive. If a gaming market downturn is milder-than-expected, and stocks are on track to re-enter a bull market, undervalued BYD may be in for a significant re-rating higher.Story continuesFord (F)Ford logo badge on grill of carSource: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.comIn 2022, Ford (NYSE:F) shares fell out of the fast lane, with investors hitting the brakes on the legacy automaker. However, while this stock may be making a pit stop for now, a rebound could happen much sooner than the market’s current view on the state of the automotive market may suggest.Although tailwinds like tight supply and booming demand have begun to reverse course, this headwind may have become overly factored into the valuation of F stock. Shares today trade for just 7.5-times sell-side analyst forecasts for earnings in 2023.The current view of an auto market meltdown proves to be an overreaction. Ford could raise prices merely on reporting better-than-expected results over the next few quarters. As I argued earlier this month, Ford’s electric vehicle (or EV) catalyst isn’t going anywhere. This factor could also spark a big rebound for F stock.Hanesbrands (HBI)HanesBrands (HBI) logo on a storefront during daylightSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.comUp more than 36% in the past month, renewed bullishness has had an outsized impact on the performance of Hanesbrands (NYSE:HBI) shares. Last year, concerns about a recession, along with this apparel maker’s heavy debt load, led to a massive drop in its stock price.Investors may be starting to realize that they overreacted, especially after management’s release of a promising guidance update earlier this month. HBI stock has zoomed back to the high single-digits, but don’t assume it’s topping out. Shares may have ample room to continue making a recovery.Still sporting a deep value multiple (8-times earnings) and a high dividend yield (7.5%), if Hanesbrands continues to pleasantly surprise with its operating performance, HBI stock could keep climbing to a valuation more befitting of stock in the apparel industry. Similar names in the spice trade for between 10- and 15-times earnings.Levi Strauss &amp; Co. (LEVI)a stack of white t-shirts with the Levi's (LEVI) logo on themSource: Papin Lab / Shutterstock.comAmong the bargain stocks on this list, Levi Strauss &amp; Co. (NYSE:LEVI) may be a diamond in the rough. Although the current global economic downturn is a significant concern for the near-term performance of this famed denim apparel maker, a price-to-earnings (or P/E) multiple of only 12-times is far too low.Why? Consider the value of Levi Strauss’s globally recognized brand. This company’s impressive brand equity gives Levi a deep economic moat. As financial challenges dissipate and focus shifts to post-downturn results, LEVI stock is likely to return to a much higher valuation.Before the stock market downturn, shares were trading for between 15 and 20 times earnings. If Levi Strauss can deliver profits in line with forecasts for 2024 ($1.56 per share), it may not be difficult for LEVI to nearly double in price, from $17 back to the low-$30s per share.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Occidental Petroleum website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comOccidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) performed very well in 2022. This was due to the big jump in crude oil prices and Warren Buffett’s continued purchase of shares for the Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) portfolio.However, more recently, as oil has pulled back and the “Buffett buzz” surrounding this company has faded, OXY stock has fallen into a slump. Still, if you’re bullish on economic conditions normalizing this year, now may be a great time to buy this bargain stock. Currently, OXY trades for only 5.2-times earnings.If the global economy improves and China begins its post-pandemic “reopening,” oil demand (and therefore prices) could keep rising. Boosting profitability could help OXY make a comeback in 2023. Looking beyond the near-term, success with the company’s carbon capture endeavor could be another significant catalyst for the undervalued oil stock over the next few years.Qualcomm (QCOM)Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor signSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.comLike comparable names in its industry, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) has been hammered by the chip market slowdown. Yet, in contrast to many of its peers, this mobile chip maker shares have entered bargain stocks territory. How so?Other chip stocks have become cheaper, but still sport premium valuations. QCOM stock, on the other hand, trades at a low 12.8-times forward estimated earnings. That makes it even more affordable than Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), a longstanding “value play” (or “value trap,” depending on who you ask) among chip stocks. INTC currently trades for 16-times forward earnings.In a recent interview on CNBC, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon made promising statements regarding the semiconductor industry’s long-term demand prospects, and Qualcomm’s move into faster-growing areas such as advanced chips for the automotive industry. These factors could help re-accelerate growth for the company and help send QCOM back to substantially higher prices.United Airlines (UAL)The side of a United Airlines (UAL) plane with ""united"" written above passenger windows. Represents airline stocks.Source: travelview / Shutterstock.comThe airline industry has made a stunning post-pandemic comeback. United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) is no exception. The legacy airline is now not only generating revenues that exceed levels reported right before the pandemic.According to management, UAL’s earnings this year could be as high as $12 per share, exceeding the $11.58 per share in earnings reported in 2019. Investors are starting to take a “wait and see” approach with UAL stock. With a recession looming, it makes sense that many investors are skeptical that United will keep taking off.That said, even if this airline only delivers results in line with sell-side forecasts ($7.63 per share), one can argue UAL is already in the bargain stocks category, with a forward price-earnings ratio of around 6.5-times. As Louis Navellier recently argued, there may be a strong chance United exceeds expectations based on current airline demand trends.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayIt doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

The FTSE All Equity REIT Index lost a quarter of its value last year compared with a 40% drop during 2008.However, the article also notes that several real estate fund managers believe 2023 will be a good year for the sector because many REITs have already been priced for a recession. In addition, REITs had reasonably good balance sheets heading into the new year.“In 2023, we think the word is going to be ‘resilience,’” said John Worth, Nareit executive vice president for research and investor outreach. “In the face of an uncertain economy and rising rates, REITs are well prepared. They have built balance sheets that can weather higher rates.” InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsContrarian investors can find plenty of opportunities in the sector. Here are seven REITs that should be big winners in 2023PSAPublic Storage $292.38FRFirst Industrial Realty Trust$52.21HSTHost Hotels &amp; Resorts$18.25MAAMid-America Apartment Communities $162.41PEAKHealthpeak Properties$27.07BXPBoston Properties$71.10SPGSimon Property Group$125.19REITs to Buy: Public Storage (PSA)a Public Storage sign in front of a facility of storage buildingsSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comAnyone who has owned a home is probably familiar with Public Storage (NYSE:PSA), the “world’s largest owner, operator and developer of self-storage facilities.” It boasts more than 2,900 facilities across the United States that serve more than 2 million customers.  Founded in 1972, Public Storage and its self-storage REIT, Storage Equities Inc., were merged into a single REIT in 1995. In 2006, the REIT acquired Shurgard Storage Centers for $5.5 billion, giving it a foothold in Europe with 141 locations there. Since the beginning of 2019, Public Storage has spent $8 billion to expand its portfolio by 26%, adding an additional 42 million square feet of space. Story continuesIn the 12 months that ended Sept. 30, the REIT had $4 billion in revenue and $3 billion in net operating income. The REIT’s net debt and preferred equity are 3.3x earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Its long-term target is between 4x and 5x EBITDA.PSA appears more than ready to handle anything that happens in 2023. First Industrial Realty Trust (FR)stocks to buy: warehouse interior with shelves, pallets and boxes DSource: Don Pablo / Shutterstock.comFirst Industrial Realty Trust (NYSE:FR) is an industrial real estate owner, operator and developer. At the time it went public in 1994, it had 226 industrial properties with 17.4 million square feet of gross leasable space across nine cities. Today, it owns or has under development 68.4 million square feet of industrial space across 439 properties. And it serves nearly 1,000 customers.Over its nearly three-decade history, it’s developed over 80.3 million square feet. It focuses on bulk and regional distribution centers that enable its customers to meet their supply chain needs. While there are concerns about a recession weighing on consumer spending, e-commerce is trending in the right direction. In October, First Industrial Realty Trust reported excellent Q3 results. Highlights included a 98.3% occupancy rate and a nearly 31% increase in cash rental rates. Management also increased its 2022 funds from operations guidance to between $2.21 and $2.25 a share. Finally, the REIT began a three-building, 1.8 million-square-foot development in Phoenix with an estimated value of $210 million. Trading at 16.7 times cash flow, FR is relatively cheap now compared to its historical multiple.REITs to Buy: Host Hotels &amp; Resorts (HST)Hotel roomSource: Dragon Images / ShutterstockHost Hotels &amp; Resorts (NASDAQ:HST) is the largest lodging REIT in the world, owning 78 hotels with a combined 42,200 rooms primarily in the United States. Its stock has gotten off to a fast start in 2023 with shares up nearly 14% year to date.  The REIT’s balance sheet is very healthy. As of the third quarter of 2022, it had a net leverage multiple of 2.4x, with $2.2 billion of available liquidity should it want to acquire more properties. In addition, its revenue per available room was up 1.4% over the third quarter of 2019, suggesting that the hotel business is nearly recovered from the pandemic.On Nov. 2, Host Hotels &amp; Resorts announced it had acquired The Four Seasons Resort and Residences in Jackson Hole, Wyo., for $315 million. Host paid approximately 13.6 times EBITDA, or a 6.6% cap rate, defined as net operating income divided by the purchase price. The revenue per available room at the Four Seasons property is $855, making it one of the REIT’s top assets. A key to Host’s success is getting more for the properties it sells than what it’s paying for the properties it buys. For its 2021 and 2022 acquisitions, it paid 13.1x EBITDA, while its dispositions over the same period averaged 17.7x EBITDA. That’s a win in my books.  Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA)picture of the interior of an apartmentSource: ShutterstockAs its name suggests, Mid-America Apartment Communities (NYSE:MAA) owns and operates apartment communities primarily in the high-growth Sunbelt region of the U.S.  As of Sept. 30, it had an ownership interest in 101,769 apartment homes across 16 states and the District of Columbia.Its top five markets are Atlanta (12.8% of its Q3 same-store net operating income), Dallas (9.2%), Tampa, Fla. (6.9%), Charlotte, N.C. (6.5%), and Orlando, Fla. (6.3%). These markets are all experiencing higher-than-average job and population growth, according to a recent investor presentation. This should help Mid-America Apartment Communities attract higher-income tenants, leading to increased rents. For example, in its top market of Atlanta, the average new resident at one of its buildings earns $97,415, is 33, single, and pays $1,810 in monthly rent. The average income for all of its top 10 markets is $92,940, with an average monthly rent of $1,719. Spread out over more than 100,00o units, that’s pretty darn good.Over the past five years, MAA has had a cumulative return of 64.5%, considerably higher than the S&amp;P 500’s roughly 40% return over the same period. REITs to Buy: Healthpeak Properties (PEAK)two doctors look over a piece of paper while standing in a hallwaySource: ShutterstockHealthpeak Properties (NYSE:PEAK) invests in assets serving the U.S. healthcare industry. It focuses on life sciences, medical offices and continuing care retirement communities. Healthpeak went public in 1985 as Health Care Property Investors and became Healthpeak in November 2019. Today, it owns more than $20 billion of healthcare-related real estate.Healthcare is one of those sectors that’s always in style. In fact, with an aging population, healthcare real estate becomes even more critical to the success of our medical care.Highlights of Healthpeak’s Q3 results include a 7.5% year-over-year increase in its FFO for the quarter to 43 cents, 5.1% same-store cash adjusted net operating income growth, and an additional 36,000 square feet at its Brisbane, Calif., pharmaceutical and biotech campus being placed in service. The REIT’s balance sheet is fortress-like, with net debt that’s just one-third of its $21.3 billion enterprise value and around 5x adjusted EBITDA.  Of the 21 analysts who cover the stock, 14 rate it “overweight” or a “buy” with an average target price of $28.68, which is about 6% above the current share price.Boston Properties (BXP)Group of colleagues discuss something in an office conference room.Source: GaudiLab / ShutterstockBoston Properties (NYSE:BXP) is the “largest publicly traded developer, owner, and manager of premier workplaces in the United States”. It owns 193 properties with 53.5 million square feet of office space generating $3.1 billion in annualized revenue as of Sept. 30.Wisely, it concentrates its properties in six markets: Boston (34.7% of total premier space in the central business district), Washington D.C. (19.9%), San Francisco (39%), Seattle (25.1%), and Manhattan (9.6%). Over the past 10 years, its FFO per share has grown by a 3.5% compound annual rate from $5.26 in 2014 to an estimated $7.15 in 2023.  Between 2010 and 2022, Boston Properties did an excellent job of recycling its capital. Over the 12 years, it disposed of $7.3 billion of real estate at $574.80 a square foot, acquired $7.1 billion at $518.25 a square foot, and developed $8.8 billion at $556.96 a square foot. As I mentioned above, you want to see REITs getting more for dispositions than they pay out for acquisitions and development properties. Currently, Boston Properties has 4.4 million square feet in development, with between 49% and 100% of the space pre-leased. BXP trades at 9.9x its projected 2023 FFO per share. Based on its earnings, BXP shares are cheaper than they’ve been in a decade.  REITs to Buy: Simon Property Group (SPG)the interior of a crowded shopping mallSource: jayk67 / Shutterstock.comSimon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) went on a tear following the Great Recession. Between March 2009 and mid-2016, shares of the retail REIT gained 626%. Unfortunately for shareholders, it’s been mostly downhill since then. From retail implosions due to e-commerce’s rising dominance to Covid-19, it’s been tough for SPG stock to get on a roll, but not for lack of trying. It’s entered multiple partnerships in the past few years to diversify its revenue beyond rents at its malls in the U.S., Europe and Asia.  In October, Simon announced that it would partner with Jamestown, an Atlanta-based real estate asset management firm with $13.1 billion under management, to invest in future mixed-use real estate opportunities. Simon acquired 50% of Johnstown as part of this partnership. “With Jamestown, Simon will gain an opportunity to capitalize on the growing asset and investment management businesses with an experienced fund manager and mixed-use operator and developer, utilizing the Jamestown platform to accelerate Simon’s future densification projects,” the accompanying press release stated.In November, Simon celebrated the Nobu Hotel &amp; Restaurant opening at Phipps Plaza, Simon’s mixed-use redevelopment in the Buckhead community in Atlanta. CEO David Simon and his uncle, Herb Simon, are some of the REIT’s largest shareholders. Their long-term approach to growing the business should pay dividends over the long haul. If Simon fails, America fails.  On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(NYSE:V),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estimating-fair-value-visa-inc-130021288.html,1674997221,STORY,['V'],"[Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Visa Crunching The NumbersWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$17.9bUS$20.0bUS$22.4bUS$23.9bUS$26.5bUS$28.3bUS$29.8bUS$31.2bUS$32.3bUS$33.3bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x7Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 6.95%Est @ 5.46%Est @ 4.41%Est @ 3.68%Est @ 3.17% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.1% US$16.6kUS$17.1kUS$17.7kUS$17.5kUS$17.9kUS$17.7kUS$17.3kUS$16.7kUS$16.0kUS$15.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$170bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$33b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.1%– 2.0%) = US$551bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$551b÷ ( 1 + 8.1%)10= US$252bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$422b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$231, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Visa as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.026. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for VisaStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the IT market.OpportunityAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

The Feb. 1 meeting is also expected to end uneventfully, with a decision to likely roll over production targets agreed in December.Ask any OPEC+ delegate what the oil-producing alliance wishes to achieve and you’ll likely hear the word “balance” come up more than once.There are actually three published goals for the 13-member Saudi-led OPEC, or Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which embraced Russia and nine other oil producers in 2015 to form OPEC+.The three are to coordinate and unify the oil policies of the different producing countries to achieve “fair and stable prices”; maintain “efficient, economic and regular supply” to consuming countries; and work toward getting investors in the industry a fair return on capital.But in media interviews, OPEC spokespeople often mash those three ideals into one choice pursuit called “balance”. To them, the market is considered “balanced” when crude is trading at $100 a barrel or more, or at least above $90 (on Friday, U.S. crude settled at under $80 while Brent stalled at below $87). If oil gets to $200 someday, we can presume that it will be even “more balanced” in OPEC’s eyes.This is because, in the six decades of OPEC’s existence, oil producers have been razor-focused on one thing and one thing only: Higher prices. In practice, economic supply for consumers - one of the stated goals of OPEC - isn’t possible because what’s economical to consumers simply isn’t to producers.From OPEC’s viewpoint, consumers want the lowest price that would bankrupt oil companies and freeze investments in future production (those who argue against this should think of the minus $40 a barrel that U.S. crude got to, during the height of the pandemic). On the flip side, oil companies are now declaring record profits. But they’re still not investing in production, citing unfriendly government policies instead.Story continuesSo, here we are, stuck over the definition of what balanced prices for crude should be.With the just-ended week being a disappointing one for oil bulls wishing to put the market into a higher trajectory after a dismal start for the year, hopes will be rising again that OPEC+ can do something in the coming week to “balance” the market.In reality, OPEC+ is struggling to balance the market - not from external pressure but from within.Since early December, the Saudis have been beset with a new headache - the G7 price cap on Russian oil - that has been producing all sorts of undesirable reactions in its closest ally Moscow.The price cap has put a $60 ceiling on each barrel of Russia’s Urals’ oil. That is a discount of at least $27 a barrel to the latest settlement in global benchmark Brent. In the real marketplace, the Russians are selling Urals even cheaper, up to $30 a barrel or more under Brent, especially to Indian buyers, say trade sources.And because they’re getting less money for their oil, the Russians are also shipping out more barrels these days than the Saudis wish them to. And those barrels are primarily going to two destinations - India and China, which are the only two nations the United States allows to buy sanctioned Russian oil without questions. The increased exports from Russia are not only messing up OPEC+’s aim of keeping production tight but also hurting the Saudis as India and China were also the largest markets in Asia for Riyadh’s state oil company Saudi Aramco (TADAWUL:2222).India bought an average of 1.2 million barrels of Russian Urals a day in December, which was 33 times more than a year earlier and 29% more than in November. Discounts for Urals at Russia's western ports for sale to India under some deals widened to $32-$35 per barrel when freight wasn’t included, according to a Reuters report from Dec. 14.The Indians even exported fuel produced from Russian crude to New York via a high-seas transfer at one point, despite U.S. sanctions prohibiting the import of Russian-origin energy products, including refined fuels, distillates, crude oil, coal, and gas.Another Reuters report said China paid the deepest discounts in months for Russian ESPO crude oil in December, amid weak demand and poor refining margins. ESPO is a grade exported from the Russian Far East port of Kozmino and Chinese refiners are dominant clients for this.At least one ESPO cargo for early December arrival was sold to an independent Chinese refiner at a discount of $6 per barrel against the February Brent price on delivery-ex-ship (DES) basis, Reuters said, citing four traders with knowledge of the matter. That discount compared with a premium of about $1.80 fetched by an ESPO barrel in China three weeks prior to the deal. Brent’s plunge to a one-year low of just above $75 by Dec. 9 exacerbated the discount for Russian crude, though the U.K. crude’s rebound to $87 since has narrowed some of that difference.If that wasn’t enough, yet another Reuters report from Friday said Russia’s oil loadings from its Baltic ports were set to rise by 50% in January from December levels. Russia loaded 4.7 million tonnes of Urals and KEBCO from Baltic ports in December. The January surge comes as sellers try to meet strong demand in Asia and benefit from rising global energy prices, said the report, which became the single biggest reason for Friday’s slump in crude prices that basically turned oil into a losing bet for January.The Saudis, on their part, have slashed pricing on their own Arab Light crude to Asia to try and stay competitive amid the ruthless undercutting by the Russians — who are supposed to be their closest ally within OPEC+.Riyadh is also attempting to talk to Moscow, with Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud telling a Bloomberg interview recently that the kingdom was “engaging with Russia over keeping oil prices relatively stable”.“We have a very important partnership with Russia on OPEC+ … that has delivered stability [to] the oil market … we are gonna engage with Russia on that,” Al-Saud said.But on the same day that the Saudi minister spoke, some 1,600 miles away in Ashgabat, the capital of Turkmenistan, Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak was telling state news agency Tass that Moscow “is not discussing with OPEC+ possibility of its oil production cuts”.Novak was responding to a question on whether the Kremlin will reduce oil output to demand a higher price for its Urals crude as the G7’s $60-per-barrel cap allows buyers to lowball the Russian product versus rival crude benchmarks such as the U.K. Brent, U.S. West Texas Intermediate, the Arab Light and Dubai Light.""No, we are not discussing such issues,"" Novak said.It basically showed the two nations having different ideas on what they need to do at this point: The Russians need to sell as much oil as possible and at whatever price they can. The Saudis want to keep Arab Light competitive against Urals but not flood the market; hence their plan for a rollover in December production targets.The G7 will have two more price caps coming into force on Feb. 5 on refined oil products out of Russia. No one knows what effect those will have on the Kremlin.The powers-that-be in Riyadh are, however, aware that if workarounds aren’t found for these caps, they could be destructive to the fairytale-like harmony within OPEC+ that has masked the organization for what it really is — a bunch of states with contrasting finances and needs pressed into compliance by the Saudis and Russians on the mere promise of price stability.If that stability gets rocked for any reason, those within the alliance could see little reason for not returning to the days of old where each state looked out for itself - something the Russians are already making a marvelous example of.Oil: Market Settlements and Activity New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude for March did a final trade of $79.38 per barrel, after settling Friday’s trade down $1.33, or 1.6%, at $79.68.For the week, WTI fell 2.5% after a cumulative 11% rally in two previous weeks. Month-to-date, the U.S. crude benchmark fell 1%.London-traded Brent crude for March delivery did a final trade of $86.33 after completing Friday’s session down 81 cents, or almost 1%, at $86.66.Brent fell 1.1% on the week after rallying almost 12% over two previous weeks. January-to-date, the global crude benchmark rose less than 1%.Oil: Price OutlookIf WTI does not pop on the theater that OPEC+ pulls at its Feb. 1 meeting, then the U.S. crude benchmark could plummet to its recent low under $76 a barrel, technical chartist Sunil Kumar Dixit said.“In case of a strong break below $79.10 and $78.60, the next drop for WTI would be $77.76 and this may be followed by even lower levels at $76.78 and $75.65,” said Dixit, who is chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.Despite multiple attempts to make a sustainable break above $82.60, Dixit noted that WTI settled the week in a relatively bearish mood at $79.68.“Momentum appears trapped within a $4 range of $82.60-$78.60, which needs to break for further direction,” he added.Dixit said a decisive breakout above $82.60 will open the way for WTI’s next leg higher to $83.88. That could be followed by $84.70. which is a 61.8% Fibonacci retracement from the drop of $93.76 to $70.06Natural gas: Market Settlements and Activity The front-month March gas contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub did a final trade of $2.856 per mmBtu, or million metric British thermal units on Friday.It settled the day at $2.849 - down 10% from a week ago but virtually unchanged from Thursday’s close.Gas futures have lost 57% of their value over the past six weeks after an unusually warm start to the 2022/23 winter led to a collapse in demand for heating oil.Prior to this week’s plunge to $2 levels, gas hit 14-year highs of $10 per mmBtu in August, and even traded as high as $7 in December.Natural gas: Price OutlookDixit noted that untiring selloff efforts continued in natural gas for a seventh week in a row, pushing prices down to $2.747 per mmBtu, with hardly any signs of exhaustion yet to the plunge.“The stochastics and RSI on the weekly chart have reached oversold conditions that call for a rebound either from current lows or a bit lower, at $2.60 and $2.35,” Dixit said.On the flip side, oversold conditions call for a short-term rebound towards the resistance zone of $3.00 and $3.30, followed by peaks to the $3.50 and $3.70 supply zone, he added.Gold: Market Settlements and Activity Gold for February delivery on New York’s Comex did a final trade of $1,928 on Friday after settling the session at $1929.40, down just 60 cents.The spot price of gold, more closely followed than futures by some traders, settled at $1,928.15 - down 96 cents, or 1%, on the day. Spot gold peaked at $1,949.29 on Thursday before an intraday high of $1,935.40 on Friday.The $1,950 resistance is a key test for gold’s ability to scale towards record highs of above $2,000 an ounce, which it got to in April last year, almost reprising its all-time peak from August 2020. Since this year began, both futures and spot gold have gained more than 5% each.Gold: Price Outlook Spot gold's failure to settle the week above $1,932, with its drop to below $1,928, raises the possibility of a further descent, said Dixit.“We could revisit gold's recent low of $1,916 and extend the decline towards $1,912, followed by $1,900,” he said.If selling intensifies below $1,900, a further drop to $1,880 and $1,870 can be witnessed, Dixit said.But if spot gold’s bullish trend stays intact, buyers were likely to resurface on the support zone in anticipation of an upshot targeting $1,965 and $1,972, he said.Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related ArticlesU.S. lawmakers ask Kerry to urge UAE to replace oil boss as COP28 presidentEU must answer U.S. clean energy subsidies, commissioner says on Washington visit]"

She is six months younger than Kim was when Kim won the first of her five X Games Aspen halfpipe titles in 2015.Kim, the daughter of South Korean immigrants, is an inspiration and a mentor to Choi, according to organizers.Kim, the only woman to land back-to-back 1080s in a contest, is taking this season off after repeating as Olympic champion but plans to return ahead of the 2026 Milan-Cortina Winter Games.Mastro, who was 12th and 13th at the last two Olympics, landed her patented double crippler (two back flips) on two of her runs, but it wasn’t enough. She was the last woman to beat Kim at the 2019 U.S. Open.Earlier, American Colby Stevenson earned his second X Games ski slopestyle title, one year after taking silver in ski big air’s Olympic debut.

They prevailed by 22.29 over Caroline Green and Michael Parsons, the largest margin of victory in a U.S. ice dance since it was shortened from three programs to two in 2011.“This is probably the best we’ve ever skated in our careers,” Bates said on NBC. “I think that’s the statement that we wanted to make.”Christina Carreira and Anthony Ponomarenko took bronze but are likely to be left off the three-couple team for March’s world championships in favor of Kaitlin Hawayek and Jean-Luc Baker, last year’s U.S. bronze medalists who planned to petition for a worlds spot after withdrawing before nationals citing mental health.Madison Hubbell and Zachary Donohue, the top U.S. couple at the 2022 Olympics (bronze) and 2022 Worlds (silver), retired after last season.FIGURE SKATING NATIONALS: Full Scores | Broadcast ScheduleChock, 30, and Bates, 33, who are engaged, became the first dance couple in their 30s to win a U.S. title in the modern era (at least the last 50 years).Chock and Bates made the nationals podium for an 11th consecutive year, one shy of the record for any discipline.Bates, who last year became the oldest U.S. champion in any discipline in decades, has made 13 career senior nationals podiums with Chock and former partner Emily Samuelson. It is believed that breaks the U.S. record for a single discipline that he shared with Michelle Kwan, Nathaniel Niles and Theresa Weld Blanchard.Those records matter less to Chock and Bates than what they’re hoping is a career first in March: a world championships gold medal.They earned silver or bronze a total of three times.

If you want to see more top oil importing countries in 2023, go directly to Top 5 Oil Importing Countries in 2023.In this article, oil is defined as crude oil.Because not every country has enough crude oil and crude oil is essential for a modern economy, many countries import crude oil. Given refineries that process crude oil are sometimes located in a different country than where the crude oil is produced, countries also have to import oil for refineries.The Largest Importers of Crude OilIn terms of the largest importers of crude oil, many of the top importers of crude oil also have large economies.In terms of the largest crude oil importers for example, the United States, China, and India are among the top three in 2017. With regard to the world's largest countries by GDP, PPP, all three countries are in the top three. In terms of the world's largest countries by nominal GDP, all three countries are in the top five in 2021.With regard to the United States, the country has imported less crude oil over time.The EIA writes on U.S imports, ""After generally increasing every year from 1954 through 2005, U.S. gross and net total petroleum imports peaked in 2005. Since 2005, increases in domestic petroleum production and increases in petroleum exports have helped to reduce annual total petroleum net imports.""The EIA adds, ""The United States remained a net crude oil importer in 2021, importing about 6.11 million b/d of crude oil and exporting about 2.96 million b/d. However, some of the crude oil that the U.S. imports is refined by U.S. refineries into petroleum products—such as gasoline, heating oil, diesel fuel, and jet fuel—that the U.S. exports. Also, some of imported petroleum may be stored and subsequently exported.""If U.S. crude oil production continues to increase, the country could be a net exporter.While the United States has imported less crude oil over time, countries like China and India have generally imported more oil in terms of the last decade up until recently.Story continuesUp until to 2021, China's crude oil imports rose for two decades given the nation's growing economy. In 2021 and 2022, the country's crude oil imports were down with 2022 imports 0.9% lower than in 2021 with the pandemic lockdowns accounting for some of the decline.In the near term, many countries need crude oil imports to power their economies although by how much will depend on economic conditions and on the price of crude oil. If crude oil prices are high, many countries might not import as much crude oil as demand will decrease. If crude oil prices are low, countries may import more crude oil as demand could rise.The price of crude oil will depend on economic conditions and on whether economic data meets estimates. The price of crude oil also depends on supply, demand, and many other factors. In the long term, crude oil demand will depend on how quickly electric vehicles adoption increases and how much crude oil emerging countries need to continue to develop their economies.Pixabay/Public DomainMethodologyFor our list of Top 20 Oil Importing Countries in 2023, we used data from the CIA.gov's The World Factbook (2021 Archive) crude oil imports list.The CIA.gov's crude oil import data does not account for crude oil exports. As a result, it is not net oil imports.Although much of the data is estimates from 2017, the CIA.gov is the only official data source that lists countries. Given oil consumption doesn't change very much from year to year unless there is a big economic change, the relative ordering of the countries is generally the same. Changes such as increases in domestic oil production or decreases in oil demand will change the absolute data however.For those of you interested, also check out Top 20 Oil Exporting Countries in 2023.Top 20 Oil Importing Countries in 2023This list is crude oil imports and not net crude oil imports.20.

If you want to see more top oil exporting countries in 2023, go directly to Top 5 Oil Exporting Countries in 2023.There are different types of oils. When it comes to energy, oil is often used to mean crude oil. In this article, oil means crude oil.Crude oil is essential for a modern economy as it helps power internal combustion vehicles and helps produce plastics that consumers use every day.Given they have larger reserves of crude oil, some countries produce more crude oil than other countries do. For those of you interested, check out Top 20 Oil Producing Countries in 2022.It can take a lot of capital investment and multiple years for a country to develop their crude oil reserves to bring to the market. In order to export oil to overseas locations, a country will need to develop an oil field, build a pipeline or railway to export oil to a seaport, and build the seaport. Each of those steps can cost many millions or even billions of dollars depending on the scale of the project.For exporting oil over land, a country will still need to develop an oil field and build pipelines or railways to their destinations.In order to prevent oversupply, some oil producing countries in OPEC+ also limit their production. OPEC+ is OPEC countries in addition to countries like Russia which is a major oil producer. According to OPEC in 2021, the country's members had over 80% of the world's proven crude oil reserves.OPEC describes itself, ""OPEC's objective is to co-ordinate and unify petroleum policies among Member Countries, in order to secure fair and stable prices for petroleum producers; an efficient, economic and regular supply of petroleum to consuming nations; and a fair return on capital to those investing in the industry.""Net oil exports can help a country that exports oil develop economically. With the money raised from oil exports, countries can develop their infrastructure more or increase spending on education which could further increase economic growth in the future.Story continuesGiven the price of oil has changed substantially over the past decade, the value of total oil exports has also changed substantially over the past decades.If oil prices go substantially higher, the value of total oil exports can go higher if it is sold on the spot market. If oil prices go significantly lower, the value of total oil exports can also go lower if it is sold on the spot market. Some countries use financial derivatives to hedge production, however, so the values of exports might be different at different times depending on the derivatives and the value of oil prices.In terms of the price of crude oil, it depends on many different factors including supply, demand, economic conditions, and on whether economic data meets estimates. In the longer term, the price of oil will also depend on how quickly electric vehicle adoption increases and how much oil emerging markets will need to power their economies.Photo by David Thielen on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of Top 20 Oil Exporting Countries in 2023, we used the CIA World Factbook (2021 Archive) for crude oil exports.It is important to note that the data does not take into account crude oil imports. As a result, the data is not net crude oil exports.Some countries like Canada both import and export crude oil given some of the country's oil fields produce crude oil that its refineries isn't best suited for.Much of the data from the CIA is from 2015 so there could be some changes in terms of absolute production. We assume that the top exporting countries in 2023 will be similar but not the same on an absolute scale. Some countries like Russia might not export as much oil given the Russian Ukraine war.Top 20 Oil Exporting Countries in 2023The following is for exports and not net exports.20. United KingdomCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2017: 710,600The United Kingdom is a crude oil exporter with exports of 710,600 barrels per day as of 2017. Much of the country's exports is from offshore fields in the North Sea and the exports have helped the country's economy over the past few decades. Given its huge economy, the United Kingdom also imports crude oil which isn't factored into the CIA data on this list. In 2021, the country imported £17.6 billion crude oil and exported £17.9 billion crude oil in the same year.19. AzerbaijanCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2015: 718,800Azerbaijan is a former Soviet republic that borders the Caspian Sea that ranks #19 on our list of Top 20 Oil Exporting Countries in 2023 given crude oil exports of 718,800 as of 2015. In terms of more recent data, the International Monetary Fund estimates the country exported 557,991 barrels of crude oil per day as of April 27 2022.18. ColombiaCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2015: 726,700Colombia exported 726,700 barrels per day of crude oil in 2015, making it one of the larger South American exporters of crude oil for the year. As of December 2021, the country is still a substantial exporter, with exports of 442,167 barrels of crude oil per day according to CEIC Data. According to the Oil &amp; Gas Journal, Colombia has 1.8 billion barrels of crude oil reserves as of January 2022.17. BrazilCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2015: 736,600Brazil has an estimated 12.7 billion barrels of proved oil reserves as of January 2021 and the country has over the past few decades developed more of its potential, especially offshore. As a result of its potential and its development, Brazil's crude oil production has increased. While it exported 736,600 barrels of crude oil per day in 2015, Brazil's crude oil exports were over almost 1.3 million barrels per day in December of 2021 according to CEIC Data. Like many other countries, Brazil also imports crude, which isn't included in this data, but Brazil is still a net crude oil exporter overall.16. IranCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2015: 750,200Iran is a member of OPEC with proven crude oil reserves of 208.6 billion barrels as of 2021. Iran is also a considerable exporter of crude oil, with exports of 763,000 barrels per day in 2021 according to OPEC. In 2015, Iran exported 750,200 barrels of crude oil a day according to the CIA.15. AlgeriaCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2015: 756,400Algeria is another member of OPEC with proven crude oil reserves of 12.2 billion barrels. The country exported 446,000 barrels per day in 2021 according to OPEC. Algeria ranks #15 on our list of Top 20 Oil Exporting Countries in 2023.14. OmanCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2015: 844,100Oman is a member of OPEC+ which is OPEC countries in addition to some oil producing countries like Russia.

QatarCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2015: 1,150,000Qatar isn't just the host of the 2022 World Cup. The country is also a major oil and gas producer that 1,150,000 barrels of crude oil a day in 2015. As of 2021, Qatar is also the largest global exporter of LNG.12. United StatesCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2017: 1,158,000When taking into account imports, the United States was a net importer of crude oil in 2017. Nevertheless, given it is sometimes more economical to export crude oil to refineries outside the United States, the country exported 1,158,000 barrels of crude oil per day in 2017 according to the CIA.In terms of 2021, the United States remained a net crude oil importer, importing 6.11 million barrels of crude oil per day and exporting 2.96 million barrels of crude oil per day.Given crude oil production has increased in recent years, the United States has potential to be a net exporter of crude oil within a few years. When the United States becomes a net crude exporter will depend on the price of crude oil, the amount of investment in crude oil production, and on demand.11. MexicoCrude Oil Exports (barrels per day) as of 2017: 1,214,000Mexico exported 1,214,000 barrels of crude oil in 2017, with a substantial percentage going to the United States refineries in the South.

94,ec0de520-80c9-3f85-a021-0639bb2647d5,VZ,2023-01-29,Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 63%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-communications-inc-nyse-vz-110033463.html,1674990033,STORY,['VZ'],"[Every investor in Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 63% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Verizon Communications, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Verizon Communications ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Verizon Communications?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Verizon Communications already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Verizon Communications' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Verizon Communications. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.3% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.6% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 3.9% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Verizon CommunicationsWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that Verizon Communications Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$31m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 37% stake in Verizon Communications. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

If you want to skip our discussion and see the top stocks, go to 5 Cash-Rich Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. The persistent sell-off in equity markets last year is a powerful sign that the U.S. economy is heading for a hard landing amid the central bank’s fight to beat inflation. As investors brace for an expected recession in 2023, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index was down 18.2% in 2022 and had its biggest annual decline since 2008, as the Federal Reserve mounts its most aggressive monetary policy tightening cycle in decades to fight surging inflation. Whether or not a bona fide recession is in the cards for 2023, the period of “slow growth” outlined by the Fed could just as well foreshadow further economic stagnation and job losses that characterize periods of recessions.William Dickens, a University Distinguished Professor and the chair of the Department of Economics at Northeastern University, states that:""Normally we think of just having to deal with a supply shock, which we’ve had plenty of over the last few years between COVID-19, Russia’s [war in Ukraine], with the food and energy crisis, and so on. On the other hand, we’ve also seen overstimulated economies before—ones where the unemployment rate gets so low that employers are having a hard time finding workers so they start jacking up wages, which is another source of inflation.”In periods of high inflation, dividend stocks have recorded strong performance relative to the broader market. Cash-rich companies that hold long dividend growth track records are particularly popular in this regard. The best dividend stocks this year exhibited strong performance and hold decades-long dividend growth track records. These include cash-rich companies that consistently grow their dividends in order to significantly increase portfolio returns for the long term during turbulent market conditions. Some dividend stocks that remained famous the previous year include Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), among others discussed in detail below.Story continuesIt is important to note that the performance of individual dividend stocks can vary greatly during a recession, and there is no guarantee that a particular dividend stock will perform well. As with any investment, it is important to carefully research and evaluate the financial health and prospects of a company before making an investment decision.12 Cash-Rich Dividend Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by NeONBRAND on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article we used stock screeners to list down companies that pay dividends and have enterprise values less than their market caps. A higher EV to Market Capitalization ratio is generally not preferred as it shows that the company has high levels of debt. Such firms are deemed risky. A lower EV to Market Capitalization ratio, on the other hand, is more favorable as that would mean that the firm has low debt levels and is, in turn, considered a relatively safer investment.The stocks in this list are ranked in ascending order according to the difference between their enterprise value and market capitalization. Additionally, Insider Monkey makes use of its database of 920 elite funds to track hedge fund holdings as of the third quarter of the year to gauge the hedge fund sentiment around each stock. We have mentioned number of hedge funds having stakes in these companies with each stock.Cash-Rich Dividend Stocks To Buy Now12. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Number Of Hedge Fund Holders: 77Dividend Yield As Of January 20: 3.64%Market Capitalization: $253.22 billionEnterprise Value (EV): $253 billionPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is an American multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology corporation that Pfizer develops and produces medicines and vaccines for immunology, oncology, cardiology, endocrinology, and neurology. The company boasts several standout drugs and products that each generate more than $1 billion in annual revenues.Earlier this December, Goldman Sachs analyst Chris Shibutani upgraded Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $60, up from $47. According to the analyst, positive updates from the company's pipeline, and the potential for outperformance from the commercial new product launch portfolio over the course of the coming year, can drive ""meaningful upside"" to the value ascribed to Pfizer's base business. He also believes that there is a ""sufficiently lessened degree of uncertainty"" regarding dynamics that will impact Pfizer's COVID-19 franchise, and the ""trough sales"" scenarios for the portfolio do not present ""thesis-changing downside.""Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has been consistently growing its dividends for the past 12 years. The company offers a quarterly dividend of $0.41 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.64%, as of January 20.Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) was a part of 77 hedge fund portfolios in Q3 2022, up from 70 in the previous quarter, as per Insider Monkey’s database. The collective value of stakes owned by these hedge funds is over $2.4 billion. Among these hedge funds, AQR Capital Management was the company’s leading stakeholder in Q3.Similar to Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is a dividend stock that pays handsomely.Here’s what Diamond Hill Capital said about Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Labs, global pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG). Although Pfizer continues to report strong performance of its core drugs, sales of its COVID vaccine and treatment have likely peaked and sales are expected to decline going forward. We remain optimistic about the company long term as we believe management is taking the company in the right direction, focusing R&amp;D, and making strategic acquisitions with profits generated from COVID vaccine sales.”11. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number Of Hedge Fund Holders: 85Dividend Yield As Of January 20: 2.56%Market Capitalization: $440.07 billionEnterprise Value (EV): $439.12 billionJohnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is an American multinational corporation founded in 1886 that develops medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and consumer packaged goods.

The majority of the group’s sales comes from its collection of pharmaceutical franchises, but a large majority (~45%) comes from its collection of medical device businesses and its consumer brands.Here’s how JNJ makes and spends a dollar of revenues: As of 2021, about 55 cents of that dollar comes from its pharmaceutical sales – sales of drugs to pharmacies and distributors – while 30 cents come from the sale of medical devices, such as surgery equipment and orthopedics. The rest of that dollar in sales comes from sales of JNJ’s consumer brands such as Listerine mouthwash, Nicorette nicotine tablets and Neutrogena cosmetics (…read more)10. Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN)Number Of Hedge Fund Holders: 59Dividend Yield As Of January 20: 2.87%Market Capitalization: $157 billionEnterprise Value (EV): $155.86 billionTexas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) is an American technology company headquartered in Dallas, Texas, that designs and manufactures semiconductors and various integrated circuits, which it sells to electronics designers and manufacturers globally.Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.24 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.87%, as recorded on January 20.Citi analyst Christopher Danely raised the firm's price target on Texas Instruments to $175 from $155 and maintained a Neutral rating on the shares on January 18. Although the analyst expects consensus estimates for the U.S. semiconductors group to further decline during earnings season driven by continued downside from the PC, wireless, consumer and auto end markets, he thinks the industrial end market appears to be holding up better than expected. Danely remains hopeful that semiconductor stocks will bottom in the first half ""after every company has aggressively cut estimates.""According to Insider Monkey’s database, 59 hedge funds owned stakes in the company at the end of the September quarter. First Eagle Investment Management held the biggest stake in Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) at the end of Q3 2022.9. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number Of Hedge Fund Holders: 69Dividend Yield As Of January 20: 0.79%Market Capitalization: $214.08 billionEnterprise Value (EV): $207.91 billionCostco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is an American multinational corporation that engages in the operation of membership warehouses, leading as one of the biggest retailers in the world across several selected categories.Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 17 years. The company pays a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share for a dividend yield of 0.79%, as of January 20.On December 9, Truist analyst Scot Ciccarelli lowered the price target on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) to $538 from $557 after its Q1 earnings miss but maintained a Buy rating on the shares. Despite some big-ticket softness, the analyst stated that Q1 sales remained extremely steady on a stacked basis, while sales of necessities like food and sundries also remain ""very strong"". Ciccarelli adds that he is positive on Costco given the potential for a membership fee increase, a special dividend/payout to shareholders, and the company's continual share gains.As of the close of Q3 2022, 69 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned stakes in Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), up from 64 in the previous quarter. These stakes have an aggregate value of over $4.42 billion. With stakes over $1.2 billion, Fisher Asset Management owned the largest position in the company in Q3.Cooper Investors shared its outlook on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“The US economy continues to run hot – the labour market is extremely tight and a number of executives we spoke to described their challenges in retaining staff and preventing competitors from poaching talent. Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever than can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”8. Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO)Number Of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Dividend Yield As Of January 20: 6.85%Market Capitalization: $192.18 billionEnterprise Value (EV): $181.27 billionCisco Systems, Inc.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Comcast Comcast Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Executive VP, Daniel Murdock, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$397k worth of shares at a price of US$44.50 each. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$39.60). So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.In the last year Comcast insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At Comcast Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Comcast shares. In total, Independent Director Kenneth Bacon sold US$72k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesDoes Comcast Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that Comcast insiders own 0.9% of the company, worth about US$1.5b. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Comcast Insiders?An insider hasn't bought Comcast stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

105,22639b6d-c15c-3000-b436-2af333c6fc53,DVN,2023-01-29,7 Energy Stocks to Buy as a New Bull Market Emerges,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-energy-stocks-buy-bull-221457266.html,1674684897,STORY,"['OXY', 'KMI', 'CVX', 'COP', 'DVN', 'FANG', '^GSPC', 'BRK-B']","[Energy prices remain volatile but have been trending upwards so far in 2023. The price of crude oil is currently hovering just above $80 a barrel. With China easing its Covid-19 restrictions, there is hope that global energy demand will strengthen in the coming months, potentially leading to a new bull market in oil and natural gas. While oil prices have come down over the last six months and remain sensitive to shifts in the global economy, there is optimism that energy stocks will again rally in 2023 as they did in 2022.With that in mind, here are seven energy stocks to buy now as a new bull market looks poised to emerge.HALHalliburton$40.40COPConocoPhillips$124OXYOccidental Petroleum$68.40KMIKinder Morgan$18.60CVXChevron$187.50FANGDiamondback Energy$149.50DVNDevon Energy$65.50InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHaliburton (HAL)The Halliburton (HAL) logo on the website homepage. HAL stock price prediction.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comHouston-based Haliburton (NYSE:HAL) is the largest hydraulic fracturing company and the second biggest oil field services company in the world with operations in more than 70 countries. The company just delivered a strong fourth quarter earnings beat, as its Q4 earnings per share  doubled to 72 cents from 36 cents a year ago.. HAL announced that it was raising its quarterly divided by 33% to 16 cents a share and also bought back $250 million of its own stock during the fourth quarter of 2022.The positive earnings, dividend hikes, and stock buybacks came after HAL stock gained 30% over the last 12 months . The stock’s dividend yield now stands at 1.2%.With oil companies all over the world maintaining high production levels, the demand for Haliburton’s oil field services should remain strong this year.ConocoPhillips (COP)a sign in front of the Conoco Philips office buildingSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comHouston-based ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is involved in oil and natural gas exploration as well as production. As with other energy companies, COP stock has boomed over the last year, as it has risen 38% during that period. And yet, its price-earnings ratio remains a modest 8.9.Story continuesAdd in a dividend yield of 2%, and ConocoPhillips looks like a no-brainer when it comes to energy stocks to buy.ConocoPhillips is also known for having a pristine balance sheet and taking a disciplined approach to capital allocation. That should help the company and COP stock weather any downturn in the energy sector that might occur in 2023.ConocoPhillips is also returning profits to shareholders, having recently announced an 11% increase in its dividend. The company’s long-term debt of $6.5 billion is extremely low given its market capitalization of nearly $154 billion.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comHouston-based Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) has got a lot going for it right now, including the backing of legendary investor Warren Buffett. It’s difficult to discuss OXY stock without mentioning Buffett who has been buying the company’s shares aggressively over the last year. At last tally, Buffett’s holding company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B), owned 21% of Occidental Petroleum’s common stock, making Berkshire the company’s largest shareholder.And the Oracle of Omaha has been granted permission to buy up to half of OXY stock, leading to speculation he might try to buy the company outright and add it to Berkshire’s stable of businesses. Like other investors, Buffett probably appreciates that Occidental Petroleum’s earnings have skyrocketed with the price of crude oil. The notorious dividend hound is probably also enticed by the fact that Occidental Petroleum has raised its quarterly dividend payment by 900% in the past year.But even with the huge boost, OXY stock’s dividend yield is still only 0.8% or 13 cents a share each quarter. Still, Occidental Petroleum’s stock is up 78% in the last 12-months and its P/E ratio of 5.5 makes the stock look like a bargain.Kinder Morgan (KMI)Momentum stocks: Natural gas pipeline through green field with blue sky aboveSource: ShutterstockKinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) is one of the largest energy infrastructure companies in North America, owning and operating 83,000 miles of pipelines and 143 oil and natural gas terminals, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. The stock has risen in the last year, though not as much as most oil and gas producers. Over the past 12 months, KMI stock has gained 5% . The share price is essentially flat looking back over five years. Part of the issue with the company and the stock is the challenges that it has faced with getting new pipelines approved.While KMI’s gains have not been as large as those of most other energy companies, KMI stock still has a lot of worthwhile attributes, especially  its 6% dividend yield . The company paid out nearly all of its $2.55 billion net income of shareholder dividends during 2022,. And its P/E ratio of 16 is reasonable and in line with the average among the stocks listed on the S&amp;P 500 index.Finally, analysts praise Kinder Morgan’s clean balance sheet and keeping  a lid on itsits capital expenditures.Chevron (CVX)chevron stockSource: LesPalenik / Shutterstock.comCalifornia-based Chevron (NYSE:CVX) is the second largest oil company in the U.S. with a market capitalization approaching $350 billion. Few energy companies have benefitted as greatly from the run-up in crude oil prices over the past year as Chevron. At the end of last October, the company reported a net profit of $11.2 billion, the second-highest quarterly profit in its 144 year history.Over the last 12-months, CVX stock has gained 35% to reach $178 a share. But even with the big run in its share price, Chevron’s stock retains a comparatively low price-earnings ratio of 10. On January 25 of this year, Chevron announced that it is raising its quarterly dividend to $1.51 per share from $1.42 and that its board of directors approved a new $75 billion stock buyback program that has no expiration date.Diamondback Energy (FANG)diamondback energy logo on its website to represent oil stocksSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comTexas-based Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) is one of the most active oil and natural gas companies in the energy rich Permian Basin that is spread across Texas and New Mexico. A smaller energy company with a $25 billion market cap, Diamondback Energy’s stock has gained 15% over the past year. Even with the increased share price, Diamondback Energy’s stock trades at a low P/E of 5.94.Like the others on this list, FANG stock pays a dividend. Currently, its divided yield is 2.05%. The share price is currently 13% below its 52-week high as crude oil prices fluctuate, providing a nice entry point for investors. Diamondback Energy also recently set a new target to return 75% of its excess cash to shareholders in the form of a base dividend, variable dividends, and stock buybacks. The company repurchased more than $1 billion of its own stock in 2022.Devon Energy (DVN)The logo for Devon Energy (DVN) is displayed on a sign outside an office.Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comFor an energy company with a monster dividend, look no further than Oklahoma City-based Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN). The leading oil and natural gas company offers shareholders a dividend yield of 8.4%. While the dividend is impressive, it is not the only reason to be bullish on DVN stock. The share price has increased 26% over the last year to $63. However, it is currently 19% below its 52-week high, presenting an opportunity for investors to grab shares on the pullback.With the boom of crude prices last year, Devon Energy was able to produce $2.1 billion of free cash flow, the highest level in its 52-year history. The company also bought back $1.3 billion of stock, reducing its outstanding shares by 4% compared to 2021.While some analysts worry aloud about the sustainability of Devon Energy’s dividend if oil prices slump, the company has given no indications that the payout is in jeopardy.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

The FTSE All Equity REIT Index lost a quarter of its value last year compared with a 40% drop during 2008.However, the article also notes that several real estate fund managers believe 2023 will be a good year for the sector because many REITs have already been priced for a recession. In addition, REITs had reasonably good balance sheets heading into the new year.“In 2023, we think the word is going to be ‘resilience,’” said John Worth, Nareit executive vice president for research and investor outreach. “In the face of an uncertain economy and rising rates, REITs are well prepared. They have built balance sheets that can weather higher rates.” InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsContrarian investors can find plenty of opportunities in the sector. Here are seven REITs that should be big winners in 2023PSAPublic Storage $292.38FRFirst Industrial Realty Trust$52.21HSTHost Hotels &amp; Resorts$18.25MAAMid-America Apartment Communities $162.41PEAKHealthpeak Properties$27.07BXPBoston Properties$71.10SPGSimon Property Group$125.19REITs to Buy: Public Storage (PSA)a Public Storage sign in front of a facility of storage buildingsSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comAnyone who has owned a home is probably familiar with Public Storage (NYSE:PSA), the “world’s largest owner, operator and developer of self-storage facilities.” It boasts more than 2,900 facilities across the United States that serve more than 2 million customers.  Founded in 1972, Public Storage and its self-storage REIT, Storage Equities Inc., were merged into a single REIT in 1995. In 2006, the REIT acquired Shurgard Storage Centers for $5.5 billion, giving it a foothold in Europe with 141 locations there. Since the beginning of 2019, Public Storage has spent $8 billion to expand its portfolio by 26%, adding an additional 42 million square feet of space. Story continuesIn the 12 months that ended Sept. 30, the REIT had $4 billion in revenue and $3 billion in net operating income. The REIT’s net debt and preferred equity are 3.3x earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Its long-term target is between 4x and 5x EBITDA.PSA appears more than ready to handle anything that happens in 2023. First Industrial Realty Trust (FR)stocks to buy: warehouse interior with shelves, pallets and boxes DSource: Don Pablo / Shutterstock.comFirst Industrial Realty Trust (NYSE:FR) is an industrial real estate owner, operator and developer. At the time it went public in 1994, it had 226 industrial properties with 17.4 million square feet of gross leasable space across nine cities. Today, it owns or has under development 68.4 million square feet of industrial space across 439 properties. And it serves nearly 1,000 customers.Over its nearly three-decade history, it’s developed over 80.3 million square feet. It focuses on bulk and regional distribution centers that enable its customers to meet their supply chain needs. While there are concerns about a recession weighing on consumer spending, e-commerce is trending in the right direction. In October, First Industrial Realty Trust reported excellent Q3 results. Highlights included a 98.3% occupancy rate and a nearly 31% increase in cash rental rates. Management also increased its 2022 funds from operations guidance to between $2.21 and $2.25 a share. Finally, the REIT began a three-building, 1.8 million-square-foot development in Phoenix with an estimated value of $210 million. Trading at 16.7 times cash flow, FR is relatively cheap now compared to its historical multiple.REITs to Buy: Host Hotels &amp; Resorts (HST)Hotel roomSource: Dragon Images / ShutterstockHost Hotels &amp; Resorts (NASDAQ:HST) is the largest lodging REIT in the world, owning 78 hotels with a combined 42,200 rooms primarily in the United States. Its stock has gotten off to a fast start in 2023 with shares up nearly 14% year to date.  The REIT’s balance sheet is very healthy. As of the third quarter of 2022, it had a net leverage multiple of 2.4x, with $2.2 billion of available liquidity should it want to acquire more properties. In addition, its revenue per available room was up 1.4% over the third quarter of 2019, suggesting that the hotel business is nearly recovered from the pandemic.On Nov. 2, Host Hotels &amp; Resorts announced it had acquired The Four Seasons Resort and Residences in Jackson Hole, Wyo., for $315 million. Host paid approximately 13.6 times EBITDA, or a 6.6% cap rate, defined as net operating income divided by the purchase price. The revenue per available room at the Four Seasons property is $855, making it one of the REIT’s top assets. A key to Host’s success is getting more for the properties it sells than what it’s paying for the properties it buys. For its 2021 and 2022 acquisitions, it paid 13.1x EBITDA, while its dispositions over the same period averaged 17.7x EBITDA. That’s a win in my books.  Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA)picture of the interior of an apartmentSource: ShutterstockAs its name suggests, Mid-America Apartment Communities (NYSE:MAA) owns and operates apartment communities primarily in the high-growth Sunbelt region of the U.S.  As of Sept. 30, it had an ownership interest in 101,769 apartment homes across 16 states and the District of Columbia.Its top five markets are Atlanta (12.8% of its Q3 same-store net operating income), Dallas (9.2%), Tampa, Fla. (6.9%), Charlotte, N.C. (6.5%), and Orlando, Fla. (6.3%). These markets are all experiencing higher-than-average job and population growth, according to a recent investor presentation. This should help Mid-America Apartment Communities attract higher-income tenants, leading to increased rents. For example, in its top market of Atlanta, the average new resident at one of its buildings earns $97,415, is 33, single, and pays $1,810 in monthly rent. The average income for all of its top 10 markets is $92,940, with an average monthly rent of $1,719. Spread out over more than 100,00o units, that’s pretty darn good.Over the past five years, MAA has had a cumulative return of 64.5%, considerably higher than the S&amp;P 500’s roughly 40% return over the same period. REITs to Buy: Healthpeak Properties (PEAK)two doctors look over a piece of paper while standing in a hallwaySource: ShutterstockHealthpeak Properties (NYSE:PEAK) invests in assets serving the U.S. healthcare industry. It focuses on life sciences, medical offices and continuing care retirement communities. Healthpeak went public in 1985 as Health Care Property Investors and became Healthpeak in November 2019. Today, it owns more than $20 billion of healthcare-related real estate.Healthcare is one of those sectors that’s always in style. In fact, with an aging population, healthcare real estate becomes even more critical to the success of our medical care.Highlights of Healthpeak’s Q3 results include a 7.5% year-over-year increase in its FFO for the quarter to 43 cents, 5.1% same-store cash adjusted net operating income growth, and an additional 36,000 square feet at its Brisbane, Calif., pharmaceutical and biotech campus being placed in service. The REIT’s balance sheet is fortress-like, with net debt that’s just one-third of its $21.3 billion enterprise value and around 5x adjusted EBITDA.  Of the 21 analysts who cover the stock, 14 rate it “overweight” or a “buy” with an average target price of $28.68, which is about 6% above the current share price.Boston Properties (BXP)Group of colleagues discuss something in an office conference room.Source: GaudiLab / ShutterstockBoston Properties (NYSE:BXP) is the “largest publicly traded developer, owner, and manager of premier workplaces in the United States”. It owns 193 properties with 53.5 million square feet of office space generating $3.1 billion in annualized revenue as of Sept. 30.Wisely, it concentrates its properties in six markets: Boston (34.7% of total premier space in the central business district), Washington D.C. (19.9%), San Francisco (39%), Seattle (25.1%), and Manhattan (9.6%). Over the past 10 years, its FFO per share has grown by a 3.5% compound annual rate from $5.26 in 2014 to an estimated $7.15 in 2023.  Between 2010 and 2022, Boston Properties did an excellent job of recycling its capital. Over the 12 years, it disposed of $7.3 billion of real estate at $574.80 a square foot, acquired $7.1 billion at $518.25 a square foot, and developed $8.8 billion at $556.96 a square foot. As I mentioned above, you want to see REITs getting more for dispositions than they pay out for acquisitions and development properties. Currently, Boston Properties has 4.4 million square feet in development, with between 49% and 100% of the space pre-leased. BXP trades at 9.9x its projected 2023 FFO per share. Based on its earnings, BXP shares are cheaper than they’ve been in a decade.  REITs to Buy: Simon Property Group (SPG)the interior of a crowded shopping mallSource: jayk67 / Shutterstock.comSimon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) went on a tear following the Great Recession. Between March 2009 and mid-2016, shares of the retail REIT gained 626%. Unfortunately for shareholders, it’s been mostly downhill since then. From retail implosions due to e-commerce’s rising dominance to Covid-19, it’s been tough for SPG stock to get on a roll, but not for lack of trying. It’s entered multiple partnerships in the past few years to diversify its revenue beyond rents at its malls in the U.S., Europe and Asia.  In October, Simon announced that it would partner with Jamestown, an Atlanta-based real estate asset management firm with $13.1 billion under management, to invest in future mixed-use real estate opportunities. Simon acquired 50% of Johnstown as part of this partnership. “With Jamestown, Simon will gain an opportunity to capitalize on the growing asset and investment management businesses with an experienced fund manager and mixed-use operator and developer, utilizing the Jamestown platform to accelerate Simon’s future densification projects,” the accompanying press release stated.In November, Simon celebrated the Nobu Hotel &amp; Restaurant opening at Phipps Plaza, Simon’s mixed-use redevelopment in the Buckhead community in Atlanta. CEO David Simon and his uncle, Herb Simon, are some of the REIT’s largest shareholders. Their long-term approach to growing the business should pay dividends over the long haul. If Simon fails, America fails.  On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This makes the dividend yield 4.1%, which will augment investor returns quite nicely.While the dividend yield is important for income investors, it is also important to consider any large share price moves, as this will generally outweigh any gains from distributions. Investors will be pleased to see that Seagate Technology Holdings' stock price has increased by 39% in the last 3 months, which is good for shareholders and can also explain a decrease in the dividend yield. See our latest analysis for Seagate Technology Holdings Seagate Technology Holdings' Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. Before making this announcement, the company's dividend was higher than its profits, and made up 77% of cash flows. While the cash payout ratio isn't necessarily a cause for concern, the company is probably focusing more on returning cash to shareholders than growing the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 97.0%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 48%, which would make us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend, despite the levels currently being quite high.historic-dividendSeagate Technology Holdings Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $1.00 total annually to $2.80. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 11% per annum over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.There Isn't Much Room To Grow The DividendSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. It's encouraging to see that Seagate Technology Holdings has been growing its earnings per share at 6.2% a year over the past five years. Although per-share earnings are growing at a credible rate, the massive payout ratio may limit growth in the company's future dividend payments.Story continuesThe Dividend Could Prove To Be UnreliableOverall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. We can't deny that the payments have been very stable, but we are a little bit worried about the very high payout ratio. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. Case in point: We've spotted 5 warning signs for Seagate Technology Holdings (of which 2 are significant!) you should know about.

(NYSE:UPS) Worth Looking At Closely?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-182-united-parcel-inc-110050792.html,1674990050,STORY,['UPS'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS). The company's stock saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Today I will analyse the most recent data on United Parcel Service’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for United Parcel Service Is United Parcel Service Still Cheap?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 12.23% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy United Parcel Service today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $162.24, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because United Parcel Service’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.Can we expect growth from United Parcel Service?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with a relatively muted profit growth of 2.5% expected over the next couple of years, growth doesn’t seem like a key driver for a buy decision for United Parcel Service, at least in the short term.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in UPS’s future outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on UPS, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

It's courtesy of Paramount. Paramount+ basically came out with 'Yellowstone' and '1883,' which was the spinoff, the prequel to 'Yellowstone,' and '1923,' which is another prequel to 'Yellowstone.' And they're the most popular things on television.”Western wear is back in style, largely due to the popularity of the television show ""Yellowstone."" (Photo: Paramount Network)Yellowstone’s popularity boomed this fall as the Paramount Network (PARA) show launched its fifth season. With 9.41 million viewers, Yellowstone’s Season 5 premiere finished fourth in network television viewership for the week of Nov. 7-13, only trailing NFL football. And the craze around the show has led to an increasing number of people looking to emulate the style of the show’s featured family — the Duttons — and their cowboy ranch.""Everybody wants to be Beth Dutton,"" Kniffen said, referring to one of the show's main characters. ""Everybody wants to meet Beth Dutton in a bar. And everybody wants John Dutton to be their dad. And that's going to cause Western wear to be great.""The show has not only led to a tourism boom in Montana but also a rise in wealthy individuals seeking to own land in the state. According to Kniffen, it could also help boost some public companies over the next several quarters.Retailers like Boot Barn (BOOT), Levi Stauss (LEVI), Wrangler (KTB), and even Tractor Supply (TSCO), which sells Carhartt clothing, all stand to benefit from the Western wear trend, he added, particularly because people who don't typically wear the style are now trying it out.Story continues""People like me, who have always worn it, are wearing more of it,"" Kniffen said. ""And even fashion videos and things are featuring Western wear. ... [But] it's not just Western — it's also outdoor looks. And we're seeing that take over. And if you haven't been invited to a denim and diamonds party, you will be. And you'll have to wear boots and a Western look.

There are many ways to play this, but you may want to focus on bargain stocks instead of diving into meme stocks or even more established growth stocks.Why? According to some analysts, these stocks, also known as value stocks, could outperform growth names between now and when interest rates potentially start to come down. In addition, while rates could drop this year, chances are they will not fall back to the near-zero levels experienced during the pandemic.Growth stocks, which went on a tear in 2021 thanks to near-zero rates, may have more limited recovery potential. Alongside the potential for a more significant upside in a stock market rebound, limited downside risk with bargain names in this current macro climate may be wrong, with the bear market continuing from here.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThese seven bargain stocks are more favorable from a risk/reward standpoint. Thus, I think long-term investors should consider these companies above other high-growth names right now.BYDBoyd Gaming$60.61FFord$12.77HBIHanesbrands$7.84LEVILevi Strauss &amp; Co.$16.67OXYOccidental Petroluem$64.33QCOMQualcomm$131.35UALUnited Airlines$50.35Boyd Gaming (BYD)a room of slot machines in a casino to represent gambling stocksSource: ShutterstockBoyd Gaming (NYSE:BYD) operates casinos and other gaming properties. Boyd’s flagship properties are in downtown Las Vegas and off the Las Vegas strip, but the company’s portfolio also includes regional properties throughout the United States.Compared to other casino stocks, BYD stock is attractively priced. The company’s shares today trade for only 11.7-times earnings. By comparison, another prominent name in regional casino gaming, Penn Entertainment (NASDAQ:PENN), sells for 24-times earnings.Despite trading at a deep value multiple (implying limited growth potential), one analyst (Credit Suisse’s Benjamin Chaiken) has recently argued that Boyd does, in fact, have growth catalysts in play, in large part due to Boyd’s recent acquisition of iGaming company Pala Interactive. If a gaming market downturn is milder-than-expected, and stocks are on track to re-enter a bull market, undervalued BYD may be in for a significant re-rating higher.Story continuesFord (F)Ford logo badge on grill of carSource: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.comIn 2022, Ford (NYSE:F) shares fell out of the fast lane, with investors hitting the brakes on the legacy automaker. However, while this stock may be making a pit stop for now, a rebound could happen much sooner than the market’s current view on the state of the automotive market may suggest.Although tailwinds like tight supply and booming demand have begun to reverse course, this headwind may have become overly factored into the valuation of F stock. Shares today trade for just 7.5-times sell-side analyst forecasts for earnings in 2023.The current view of an auto market meltdown proves to be an overreaction. Ford could raise prices merely on reporting better-than-expected results over the next few quarters. As I argued earlier this month, Ford’s electric vehicle (or EV) catalyst isn’t going anywhere. This factor could also spark a big rebound for F stock.Hanesbrands (HBI)HanesBrands (HBI) logo on a storefront during daylightSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.comUp more than 36% in the past month, renewed bullishness has had an outsized impact on the performance of Hanesbrands (NYSE:HBI) shares. Last year, concerns about a recession, along with this apparel maker’s heavy debt load, led to a massive drop in its stock price.Investors may be starting to realize that they overreacted, especially after management’s release of a promising guidance update earlier this month. HBI stock has zoomed back to the high single-digits, but don’t assume it’s topping out. Shares may have ample room to continue making a recovery.Still sporting a deep value multiple (8-times earnings) and a high dividend yield (7.5%), if Hanesbrands continues to pleasantly surprise with its operating performance, HBI stock could keep climbing to a valuation more befitting of stock in the apparel industry. Similar names in the spice trade for between 10- and 15-times earnings.Levi Strauss &amp; Co. (LEVI)a stack of white t-shirts with the Levi's (LEVI) logo on themSource: Papin Lab / Shutterstock.comAmong the bargain stocks on this list, Levi Strauss &amp; Co. (NYSE:LEVI) may be a diamond in the rough. Although the current global economic downturn is a significant concern for the near-term performance of this famed denim apparel maker, a price-to-earnings (or P/E) multiple of only 12-times is far too low.Why? Consider the value of Levi Strauss’s globally recognized brand. This company’s impressive brand equity gives Levi a deep economic moat. As financial challenges dissipate and focus shifts to post-downturn results, LEVI stock is likely to return to a much higher valuation.Before the stock market downturn, shares were trading for between 15 and 20 times earnings. If Levi Strauss can deliver profits in line with forecasts for 2024 ($1.56 per share), it may not be difficult for LEVI to nearly double in price, from $17 back to the low-$30s per share.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Occidental Petroleum website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comOccidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) performed very well in 2022. This was due to the big jump in crude oil prices and Warren Buffett’s continued purchase of shares for the Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) portfolio.However, more recently, as oil has pulled back and the “Buffett buzz” surrounding this company has faded, OXY stock has fallen into a slump. Still, if you’re bullish on economic conditions normalizing this year, now may be a great time to buy this bargain stock. Currently, OXY trades for only 5.2-times earnings.If the global economy improves and China begins its post-pandemic “reopening,” oil demand (and therefore prices) could keep rising. Boosting profitability could help OXY make a comeback in 2023. Looking beyond the near-term, success with the company’s carbon capture endeavor could be another significant catalyst for the undervalued oil stock over the next few years.Qualcomm (QCOM)Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor signSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.comLike comparable names in its industry, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) has been hammered by the chip market slowdown. Yet, in contrast to many of its peers, this mobile chip maker shares have entered bargain stocks territory. How so?Other chip stocks have become cheaper, but still sport premium valuations. QCOM stock, on the other hand, trades at a low 12.8-times forward estimated earnings. That makes it even more affordable than Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), a longstanding “value play” (or “value trap,” depending on who you ask) among chip stocks. INTC currently trades for 16-times forward earnings.In a recent interview on CNBC, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon made promising statements regarding the semiconductor industry’s long-term demand prospects, and Qualcomm’s move into faster-growing areas such as advanced chips for the automotive industry. These factors could help re-accelerate growth for the company and help send QCOM back to substantially higher prices.United Airlines (UAL)The side of a United Airlines (UAL) plane with ""united"" written above passenger windows. Represents airline stocks.Source: travelview / Shutterstock.comThe airline industry has made a stunning post-pandemic comeback. United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) is no exception. The legacy airline is now not only generating revenues that exceed levels reported right before the pandemic.According to management, UAL’s earnings this year could be as high as $12 per share, exceeding the $11.58 per share in earnings reported in 2019. Investors are starting to take a “wait and see” approach with UAL stock. With a recession looming, it makes sense that many investors are skeptical that United will keep taking off.That said, even if this airline only delivers results in line with sell-side forecasts ($7.63 per share), one can argue UAL is already in the bargain stocks category, with a forward price-earnings ratio of around 6.5-times. As Louis Navellier recently argued, there may be a strong chance United exceeds expectations based on current airline demand trends.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayIt doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

While oil prices have come down over the last six months and remain sensitive to shifts in the global economy, there is optimism that energy stocks will again rally in 2023 as they did in 2022.With that in mind, here are seven energy stocks to buy now as a new bull market looks poised to emerge.HALHalliburton$40.40COPConocoPhillips$124OXYOccidental Petroleum$68.40KMIKinder Morgan$18.60CVXChevron$187.50FANGDiamondback Energy$149.50DVNDevon Energy$65.50InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHaliburton (HAL)The Halliburton (HAL) logo on the website homepage. HAL stock price prediction.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comHouston-based Haliburton (NYSE:HAL) is the largest hydraulic fracturing company and the second biggest oil field services company in the world with operations in more than 70 countries. The company just delivered a strong fourth quarter earnings beat, as its Q4 earnings per share  doubled to 72 cents from 36 cents a year ago.. HAL announced that it was raising its quarterly divided by 33% to 16 cents a share and also bought back $250 million of its own stock during the fourth quarter of 2022.The positive earnings, dividend hikes, and stock buybacks came after HAL stock gained 30% over the last 12 months . The stock’s dividend yield now stands at 1.2%.With oil companies all over the world maintaining high production levels, the demand for Haliburton’s oil field services should remain strong this year.ConocoPhillips (COP)a sign in front of the Conoco Philips office buildingSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comHouston-based ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is involved in oil and natural gas exploration as well as production. As with other energy companies, COP stock has boomed over the last year, as it has risen 38% during that period. And yet, its price-earnings ratio remains a modest 8.9.Story continuesAdd in a dividend yield of 2%, and ConocoPhillips looks like a no-brainer when it comes to energy stocks to buy.ConocoPhillips is also known for having a pristine balance sheet and taking a disciplined approach to capital allocation. That should help the company and COP stock weather any downturn in the energy sector that might occur in 2023.ConocoPhillips is also returning profits to shareholders, having recently announced an 11% increase in its dividend. The company’s long-term debt of $6.5 billion is extremely low given its market capitalization of nearly $154 billion.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comHouston-based Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) has got a lot going for it right now, including the backing of legendary investor Warren Buffett. It’s difficult to discuss OXY stock without mentioning Buffett who has been buying the company’s shares aggressively over the last year. At last tally, Buffett’s holding company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B), owned 21% of Occidental Petroleum’s common stock, making Berkshire the company’s largest shareholder.And the Oracle of Omaha has been granted permission to buy up to half of OXY stock, leading to speculation he might try to buy the company outright and add it to Berkshire’s stable of businesses. Like other investors, Buffett probably appreciates that Occidental Petroleum’s earnings have skyrocketed with the price of crude oil. The notorious dividend hound is probably also enticed by the fact that Occidental Petroleum has raised its quarterly dividend payment by 900% in the past year.But even with the huge boost, OXY stock’s dividend yield is still only 0.8% or 13 cents a share each quarter. Still, Occidental Petroleum’s stock is up 78% in the last 12-months and its P/E ratio of 5.5 makes the stock look like a bargain.Kinder Morgan (KMI)Momentum stocks: Natural gas pipeline through green field with blue sky aboveSource: ShutterstockKinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) is one of the largest energy infrastructure companies in North America, owning and operating 83,000 miles of pipelines and 143 oil and natural gas terminals, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. The stock has risen in the last year, though not as much as most oil and gas producers. Over the past 12 months, KMI stock has gained 5% . The share price is essentially flat looking back over five years. Part of the issue with the company and the stock is the challenges that it has faced with getting new pipelines approved.While KMI’s gains have not been as large as those of most other energy companies, KMI stock still has a lot of worthwhile attributes, especially  its 6% dividend yield . The company paid out nearly all of its $2.55 billion net income of shareholder dividends during 2022,. And its P/E ratio of 16 is reasonable and in line with the average among the stocks listed on the S&amp;P 500 index.Finally, analysts praise Kinder Morgan’s clean balance sheet and keeping  a lid on itsits capital expenditures.Chevron (CVX)chevron stockSource: LesPalenik / Shutterstock.comCalifornia-based Chevron (NYSE:CVX) is the second largest oil company in the U.S. with a market capitalization approaching $350 billion. Few energy companies have benefitted as greatly from the run-up in crude oil prices over the past year as Chevron. At the end of last October, the company reported a net profit of $11.2 billion, the second-highest quarterly profit in its 144 year history.Over the last 12-months, CVX stock has gained 35% to reach $178 a share. But even with the big run in its share price, Chevron’s stock retains a comparatively low price-earnings ratio of 10. On January 25 of this year, Chevron announced that it is raising its quarterly dividend to $1.51 per share from $1.42 and that its board of directors approved a new $75 billion stock buyback program that has no expiration date.Diamondback Energy (FANG)diamondback energy logo on its website to represent oil stocksSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comTexas-based Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) is one of the most active oil and natural gas companies in the energy rich Permian Basin that is spread across Texas and New Mexico. A smaller energy company with a $25 billion market cap, Diamondback Energy’s stock has gained 15% over the past year. Even with the increased share price, Diamondback Energy’s stock trades at a low P/E of 5.94.Like the others on this list, FANG stock pays a dividend. Currently, its divided yield is 2.05%. The share price is currently 13% below its 52-week high as crude oil prices fluctuate, providing a nice entry point for investors. Diamondback Energy also recently set a new target to return 75% of its excess cash to shareholders in the form of a base dividend, variable dividends, and stock buybacks. The company repurchased more than $1 billion of its own stock in 2022.Devon Energy (DVN)The logo for Devon Energy (DVN) is displayed on a sign outside an office.Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comFor an energy company with a monster dividend, look no further than Oklahoma City-based Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN). The leading oil and natural gas company offers shareholders a dividend yield of 8.4%. While the dividend is impressive, it is not the only reason to be bullish on DVN stock. The share price has increased 26% over the last year to $63. However, it is currently 19% below its 52-week high, presenting an opportunity for investors to grab shares on the pullback.With the boom of crude prices last year, Devon Energy was able to produce $2.1 billion of free cash flow, the highest level in its 52-year history. The company also bought back $1.3 billion of stock, reducing its outstanding shares by 4% compared to 2021.While some analysts worry aloud about the sustainability of Devon Energy’s dividend if oil prices slump, the company has given no indications that the payout is in jeopardy.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

120,c64e64de-dde1-3a95-b6d3-8fc85e64ddb9,VRTX,2023-01-29,3 Gene Editing Stocks to Buy Now OR You’ll Be Kicking Yourself Later,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-gene-editing-stocks-buy-222018942.html,1674685218,STORY,"['ABBV', 'NTLA', 'VRTX']","[To many investors, gene editing sounds like the plot of a science fiction movie. The concept of being able to edit our DNA to cure genetic diseases is quite unbelievable, and the upside of gene editing to treat rare diseases is impressive. However, many gene editing stocks are making waves, looking to advance toward eradicating cancer and other serious illnesses.But ever since 2012, gene editing has been a reality, at least in terms of having the technology needed to edit genes. Don’t get me wrong, early investors in gene editing have had an opportunity to earn big payouts, but it’s been an exercise in patience. Many companies in this sector are still in the clinical trial stage, which means it will be years before they have commercially-available treatments.Additionally, several gene editing stocks got caught up in the meme stock movement. Investors that bought at the wrong time may be licking their wounds after some steep losses. But even in a risk-off market, some of these stocks are beginning to look attractive. Here are three gene editing stocks that I think may be worth a closer look.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCRSPCRSPR Therapeutics$50.75NTLAIntellia Therapeutics$39.02ABBVAbbVie$147.79CRSPR Therapeutics (CRSP) CRISPR (CSPR) logo within a DNA sequenceSource: Catalin Rusnac/ShutterStock.comFor those new to the field of gene editing, CRSPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CRSP) is a pioneer of the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing platform. Many companies use this platform to make precise, directed changes to genomic DNA.It’s impossible to understate the potential opportunity for CRSPR Therapeutics. The CRSPR/Cas9 platform will be at the forefront of gene editing treatments. For example, CRSPR is partnering with Vertex Pharmaceuticals(NASDAQ;VRTX) to bring its CTX110 candidate to market. Known as exa-cel, this is a one-time treatment for sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia.This could be a multi-billion opportunity, with an estimated addressable market of 32,000 patients in the U.S. and Europe. But this also presents investors with one of the obstacles that many companies in this space face. Companies like Vertex can provide CRSPR with resources to push their projects forward. But, in this case, Vertex stands to make 60% of the profits from future sales.Story continuesWith that in mind, you could easily consider VRTX stock as a fourth pick for this list. But for now, I think keeping it simple by investing in CRSP stock is a move that makes sense for risk-tolerant investors looking for exposure to this disruptive technology.Intellia Therapeutics (NTLA) close up of Businessman holding glowing DNA helix with energy sparks.Source: ShutterstockIntellia Therapeutics (NASDAQ:NTLA) is another company that illustrates the risks and rewards of investing in gene editing stocks. Intellia has a robust pipeline, and its lead candidate, NTLA-2001, delivered impressive results in a phase one trial in 2022.That said, the company is years away from the potential revenue that comes from one of these treatments being commercially available. In the meantime, investors must be concerned about events like the company’s public stock offering in December 2022. The stock dropped over 20% and has still not recovered.However, as was noted at that time, with over $800 million of cash on hand before the stock offering, this may simply be a case of the company ensuring it had sufficient capital to get its products through the clinical trial stages at a time when the cost of money will not be cheap. If that insight is correct, this may be an attractive time for risk-tolerant investors to buy the dip in NTLA stock.AbbVie (ABBV) Closeup of AbbVie (ABBV) building corporate office, an American biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Lake Bluff, Illinois, USASource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.comWhenever I recommend AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), I kick myself (symbolically) for not owning it. And that’s the case again, as I make AbbVie the last pick on this list of gene editing stocks.One of the enticing goals of gene editing is the potential to find possible treatments for cancer. Chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy (CAR-T) is an area showing promise. CAR-T cell therapy creates engineered molecules called chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) that identify and destroy antigens found in lymphoma cells.Like many companies in this space, AbbVie isn’t going it alone. In this case, the company is partnering with a small-cap company Caribou Biosciences (NASDAQ:CRBU). The goal is to improve CAR-T cell therapies with an assist from CRISPR gene editing technology.Unlike many stocks in this sector, AbbVie is a well-established large-cap stock. Gene editing isn’t the first thing you think of when it comes to AbbVie. But that’s why I wanted to include it on this list. The market is likely to continue unpredictable changes for most of 2023, and ABBV stock has many qualities that investors should look for now – mainly its rock-solid dividend.On the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

121,8a1a6945-a7ab-3482-bd8d-3b01db468304,WM,2023-01-29,Investing in Waste Management (NYSE:WM) five years ago would have delivered you a 93% gain,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-waste-management-nyse-wm-120114555.html,1674993674,STORY,['WM'],"[When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average. And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, long term Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) shareholders have enjoyed a 76% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 42% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 4.8% in the last year , including dividends .Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. Check out our latest analysis for Waste Management To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, Waste Management managed to grow its earnings per share at 12% a year. That makes the EPS growth particularly close to the yearly share price growth of 12%. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Waste Management has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Waste Management will grow revenue in the future.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Waste Management, it has a TSR of 93% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Waste Management shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 4.8% over the last year. That's including the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 14% a year, is even better. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Waste Management , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

(NYSE:SLG) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 17% in the last month. But if you look at the last five years the returns have not been good. You would have done a lot better buying an index fund, since the stock has dropped 62% in that half decade.The recent uptick of 7.5% could be a positive sign of things to come, so let's take a look at historical fundamentals. See our latest analysis for SL Green Realty In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.In the last half decade SL Green Realty saw its share price fall as its EPS declined below zero. This was, in part, due to extraordinary items impacting earnings. Since the company has fallen to a loss making position, it's hard to compare the change in EPS with the share price change. But we would generally expect a lower price, given the situation.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on SL Green Realty's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for SL Green Realty the TSR over the last 5 years was -48%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that SL Green Realty shareholders are down 41% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 7.7%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 8% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand SL Green Realty better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for SL Green Realty (1 is potentially serious)  that you should be aware of.If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

(NASDAQ:CSCO) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Cisco Systems The ModelWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$14.9bUS$16.1bUS$16.2bUS$17.4bUS$18.2bUS$18.8bUS$19.4bUS$19.9bUS$20.4bUS$20.9bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x9Analyst x6Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 3.44%Est @ 3.00%Est @ 2.70%Est @ 2.48%Est @ 2.33% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.1% US$13.8kUS$13.8kUS$12.8kUS$12.8kUS$12.4kUS$11.8kUS$11.3kUS$10.7kUS$10.2kUS$9.6k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$119bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$21b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.1%– 2.0%) = US$351bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$351b÷ ( 1 + 8.1%)10= US$162bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$281b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$48.5, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 29% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Cisco Systems as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.011. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Cisco SystemsStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Communications industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Communications market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

If you want to skip our discussion and see the top stocks, go to 5 Cash-Rich Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. The persistent sell-off in equity markets last year is a powerful sign that the U.S. economy is heading for a hard landing amid the central bank’s fight to beat inflation. As investors brace for an expected recession in 2023, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index was down 18.2% in 2022 and had its biggest annual decline since 2008, as the Federal Reserve mounts its most aggressive monetary policy tightening cycle in decades to fight surging inflation. Whether or not a bona fide recession is in the cards for 2023, the period of “slow growth” outlined by the Fed could just as well foreshadow further economic stagnation and job losses that characterize periods of recessions.William Dickens, a University Distinguished Professor and the chair of the Department of Economics at Northeastern University, states that:""Normally we think of just having to deal with a supply shock, which we’ve had plenty of over the last few years between COVID-19, Russia’s [war in Ukraine], with the food and energy crisis, and so on. On the other hand, we’ve also seen overstimulated economies before—ones where the unemployment rate gets so low that employers are having a hard time finding workers so they start jacking up wages, which is another source of inflation.”In periods of high inflation, dividend stocks have recorded strong performance relative to the broader market. Cash-rich companies that hold long dividend growth track records are particularly popular in this regard. The best dividend stocks this year exhibited strong performance and hold decades-long dividend growth track records. These include cash-rich companies that consistently grow their dividends in order to significantly increase portfolio returns for the long term during turbulent market conditions. Some dividend stocks that remained famous the previous year include Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), among others discussed in detail below.Story continuesIt is important to note that the performance of individual dividend stocks can vary greatly during a recession, and there is no guarantee that a particular dividend stock will perform well. As with any investment, it is important to carefully research and evaluate the financial health and prospects of a company before making an investment decision.12 Cash-Rich Dividend Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by NeONBRAND on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article we used stock screeners to list down companies that pay dividends and have enterprise values less than their market caps. A higher EV to Market Capitalization ratio is generally not preferred as it shows that the company has high levels of debt. Such firms are deemed risky. A lower EV to Market Capitalization ratio, on the other hand, is more favorable as that would mean that the firm has low debt levels and is, in turn, considered a relatively safer investment.The stocks in this list are ranked in ascending order according to the difference between their enterprise value and market capitalization. Additionally, Insider Monkey makes use of its database of 920 elite funds to track hedge fund holdings as of the third quarter of the year to gauge the hedge fund sentiment around each stock. We have mentioned number of hedge funds having stakes in these companies with each stock.Cash-Rich Dividend Stocks To Buy Now12. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Number Of Hedge Fund Holders: 77Dividend Yield As Of January 20: 3.64%Market Capitalization: $253.22 billionEnterprise Value (EV): $253 billionPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is an American multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology corporation that Pfizer develops and produces medicines and vaccines for immunology, oncology, cardiology, endocrinology, and neurology. The company boasts several standout drugs and products that each generate more than $1 billion in annual revenues.Earlier this December, Goldman Sachs analyst Chris Shibutani upgraded Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $60, up from $47. According to the analyst, positive updates from the company's pipeline, and the potential for outperformance from the commercial new product launch portfolio over the course of the coming year, can drive ""meaningful upside"" to the value ascribed to Pfizer's base business. He also believes that there is a ""sufficiently lessened degree of uncertainty"" regarding dynamics that will impact Pfizer's COVID-19 franchise, and the ""trough sales"" scenarios for the portfolio do not present ""thesis-changing downside.""Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has been consistently growing its dividends for the past 12 years. The company offers a quarterly dividend of $0.41 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.64%, as of January 20.Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) was a part of 77 hedge fund portfolios in Q3 2022, up from 70 in the previous quarter, as per Insider Monkey’s database. The collective value of stakes owned by these hedge funds is over $2.4 billion. Among these hedge funds, AQR Capital Management was the company’s leading stakeholder in Q3.Similar to Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is a dividend stock that pays handsomely.Here’s what Diamond Hill Capital said about Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Labs, global pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG). Although Pfizer continues to report strong performance of its core drugs, sales of its COVID vaccine and treatment have likely peaked and sales are expected to decline going forward. We remain optimistic about the company long term as we believe management is taking the company in the right direction, focusing R&amp;D, and making strategic acquisitions with profits generated from COVID vaccine sales.”11. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number Of Hedge Fund Holders: 85Dividend Yield As Of January 20: 2.56%Market Capitalization: $440.07 billionEnterprise Value (EV): $439.12 billionJohnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is an American multinational corporation founded in 1886 that develops medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and consumer packaged goods.

The majority of the group’s sales comes from its collection of pharmaceutical franchises, but a large majority (~45%) comes from its collection of medical device businesses and its consumer brands.Here’s how JNJ makes and spends a dollar of revenues: As of 2021, about 55 cents of that dollar comes from its pharmaceutical sales – sales of drugs to pharmacies and distributors – while 30 cents come from the sale of medical devices, such as surgery equipment and orthopedics. The rest of that dollar in sales comes from sales of JNJ’s consumer brands such as Listerine mouthwash, Nicorette nicotine tablets and Neutrogena cosmetics (…read more)10. Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN)Number Of Hedge Fund Holders: 59Dividend Yield As Of January 20: 2.87%Market Capitalization: $157 billionEnterprise Value (EV): $155.86 billionTexas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) is an American technology company headquartered in Dallas, Texas, that designs and manufactures semiconductors and various integrated circuits, which it sells to electronics designers and manufacturers globally.Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.24 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.87%, as recorded on January 20.Citi analyst Christopher Danely raised the firm's price target on Texas Instruments to $175 from $155 and maintained a Neutral rating on the shares on January 18. Although the analyst expects consensus estimates for the U.S. semiconductors group to further decline during earnings season driven by continued downside from the PC, wireless, consumer and auto end markets, he thinks the industrial end market appears to be holding up better than expected. Danely remains hopeful that semiconductor stocks will bottom in the first half ""after every company has aggressively cut estimates.""According to Insider Monkey’s database, 59 hedge funds owned stakes in the company at the end of the September quarter. First Eagle Investment Management held the biggest stake in Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) at the end of Q3 2022.9. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number Of Hedge Fund Holders: 69Dividend Yield As Of January 20: 0.79%Market Capitalization: $214.08 billionEnterprise Value (EV): $207.91 billionCostco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is an American multinational corporation that engages in the operation of membership warehouses, leading as one of the biggest retailers in the world across several selected categories.Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 17 years. The company pays a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share for a dividend yield of 0.79%, as of January 20.On December 9, Truist analyst Scot Ciccarelli lowered the price target on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) to $538 from $557 after its Q1 earnings miss but maintained a Buy rating on the shares. Despite some big-ticket softness, the analyst stated that Q1 sales remained extremely steady on a stacked basis, while sales of necessities like food and sundries also remain ""very strong"". Ciccarelli adds that he is positive on Costco given the potential for a membership fee increase, a special dividend/payout to shareholders, and the company's continual share gains.As of the close of Q3 2022, 69 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned stakes in Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), up from 64 in the previous quarter. These stakes have an aggregate value of over $4.42 billion. With stakes over $1.2 billion, Fisher Asset Management owned the largest position in the company in Q3.Cooper Investors shared its outlook on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“The US economy continues to run hot – the labour market is extremely tight and a number of executives we spoke to described their challenges in retaining staff and preventing competitors from poaching talent. Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever than can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”8. Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO)Number Of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Dividend Yield As Of January 20: 6.85%Market Capitalization: $192.18 billionEnterprise Value (EV): $181.27 billionCisco Systems, Inc.
