Let’s take a closer look at each one.MicrosoftWe’re all familiar with Microsoft, the mega-cap titan that’s one of the largest broad-based technology providers in the world. Currently, MSFT is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The company’s annual dividend currently yields 1.1%, a tick above its Zacks Computer and Technology sector average.Impressively, MSFT has upped its dividend payout five times over the last five years, translating to a nearly 10% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMicrosoft is one of the biggest cash-generating machines in the S&amp;P 500; in its latest release (2023 Q1), the company reported free cash flow of a sizable $16.9 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTexas Instruments Inc.Texas Instruments is an original equipment manufacturer of analog, mixed-signal, and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits. Currently, TXN carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).TXN’s annual dividend currently yields a solid 2.8% paired with a payout ratio sitting sustainability at 49% of its earnings. As we can see, the company’s current yield handily surpasses its Zacks sector average.Story continuesTXN’s payout has grown by an inspiring 15% over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, the company has been on a strong earnings streak as of late, exceeding earnings and revenue estimates in four consecutive quarters.In TXN’s latest print (2022 Q3), the company registered a 3.4% bottom-line beat paired with a 2.7% sales surprise. Below is a chart illustrating the company's revenue on a quarterly basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOracleOracle is one of the largest enterprise-grade database, middleware, and application software providers, offering cloud solutions and services that can be used to build and manage various cloud deployment models.ORCL has witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions over the last several months, helping land the stock into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).As it stands, ORCL’s annual dividend yield comes in at 1.6%, nicely above its Zacks sector average. In addition, Oracle has increasingly rewarded its shareholders, carrying a 14% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOracle’s growth profile is also solid; earnings are forecasted to climb a modest 1.2% in its current fiscal year (FY23) and a further 11% in FY24. The projected earnings upticks come paired with forecasted Y/Y revenue growth of 17% in FY23 and 6.8% in FY24.Like MSFT, it’s hard to ignore the company’s cash-generating abilities; in its latest earnings release (2023 Q1), Oracle reported free cash flow of $4.6 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineTechnology isn’t a typical sector that income-focused investors flock to. Generally, stocks within the utilities, finance, and consumer staples sectors are a common target of these investors.Still, there are several tech stocks – Microsoft MSFT, Texas Instruments TXN, and Oracle ORCL – that reward their shareholders, and their payouts have been growing.For those that seek income paired with exposure to tech, all three precisely fit the criteria.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Section 232 measures on steel were implemented to protect the national security of the United States and are helping to strengthen the American steel supply chain after being hollowed out by years of global excess capacity and unfair trade.For years, the U.S. government has recognized that the WTO dispute settlement system often overreaches in its findings and infringes on U.S. sovereignty. The WTO system has allowed non-market economies like China and other countries to exploit the global trading order by building massive, high-polluting excess capacity at the expense of market-based manufacturers around the world. It is time to fundamentally rethink the global trading system to ensure that it is based on fair trade and environmentally friendly production processes.""The WTO's recent decision is one more example of overreaching and further undermines the legitimacy of the WTO dispute settlement system.  Reform of this broken system is long overdue,"" said Leon Topalian, Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer of Nucor Corporation.About NucorNucor and its affiliates are manufacturers of steel and steel products, with operating facilities in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

The raised dividend is scheduled to be paid out on Feb 2 to shareholders of record as of Dec 28, 2022.Based on the new rate, the annualized dividend rate comes to $6.24 per share, up from the prior annual rate of $5.88. This indicates an annualized yield of roughly 2.94%, considering American Tower’s closing price of $212.25 on Dec 8.Can American Tower Maintain Its Payout?AMT has a disciplined capital-allocation strategy and has consistently increased its dividend since 2012. Based on the dividends paid out over the trailing four quarters, the company’s dividend yield is 2.79%.It has increased its dividend 21 times in the last five years, and the five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 17.67%. This is attractive to income investors and represents a steady income stream. Check American Tower’s dividend history here.American Tower’s extensive and geographically diversified communication real estate portfolio is expected to significantly benefit from increased capital spending by wireless carriers. Incremental demand from global 4G and 5G deployment efforts, growing wireless penetration and spectrum auctions are likely to push up the spending levels of wireless carriers.Between 2011 and 2021, AMT’s revenues from the property segment and adjusted EBITDA witnessed a CAGR of 14.2% and 14.1%, respectively. Amid secular growth trends in the wireless industry, the healthy performance is expected to continue in 2022. Management projects property revenues and adjusted EBITDA to increase 14.6% and 10.6%, respectively, at the midpoint.Also, between 2011 and 2021, American Tower’s consolidated adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) witnessed a CAGR of 15.3%. This healthy trend is expected to continue in 2022, with the consolidated AFFO projected in the range of $4,595-$4,675 million, suggesting midpoint growth of 6.0%. This promises rewards for investors in the upcoming period.Moreover, American Tower’s current payout ratio is 59%. Looking at the company’s AFFO growth and payout ratio, it is likely to be able to sustain the hiked dividend.Story continuesBottom LineThe abovementioned disbursements demonstrate American Tower’s operational strength and commitment to rewarding its shareholders handsomely. The hike reflects American Tower’s ability to generate solid cash flow growth through its operating platform and high-quality portfolio.As investors are always on the lookout for companies with a track record of consistent and incremental dividend payouts to bet their money on, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for them.However, customer concentration is high for American Tower. Also, a hike in the interest rate and stiff competition in its industry for new businesses and asset acquisitions add to its woes.Shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have declined 3.9% over the past month, wider than the industry's fall of 2.9%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Recent Dividend IncreasesOn Dec 5, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.

3,26cb509d-bca5-3477-a320-121649f98167,UNM,2022-12-10,5 Stocks to Watch From the Thriving Accident & Health Insurance Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-stocks-watch-thriving-accident-160104822.html,1670601664,STORY,"['AFL', 'AMSF', 'UNM', 'EIG']","[The Zacks Accident and Health Insurance industry is expected to ride on the increase in underwriting exposure. Aflac Incorporated AFL, Unum Group UNM, Trupanion TRUP, Employers Holdings EIG and AMERISAFE AMSF should continue benefiting from prudent underwriting standards. However, a rise in claims frequency could weigh on the positives.The industry has been witnessing soft pricing over the past several quarters, which is not expected to change any time soon. Nonetheless, a rise in claims, with business activities returning to normal levels, is likely to increase pricing for this industry in the coming days. Also, the increasing adoption of technology in operations will help in the smooth functioning of the industry amid coronavirus-induced challenges.About the IndustryThe Zacks Accident and Health Insurance industry comprises companies that provide workers’ compensation insurance, largely to employers operating in hazardous industries. These players offer group, individual or voluntary supplemental insurance products. Workers' compensation is a form of accident insurance paid by employers without affecting employees’ pay. Claims are generally met by insurance companies or state-run workers’ compensation fund, benefiting both employers and employees. While it boosts employees’ morale, thus, productivity, employers stand to benefit from lower claims costs. As awareness about the benefits of having such coverage rises, the future of these insurers seems bright. Per reports published in IBISWorld, the U.S. workers' compensation insurance industry is estimated to grow 3% to $48.3 billion in 2022 based on revenues.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Accident &amp; Health Insurance IndustryPricing Pressure to Continue: The worker compensation industry has been witnessing pricing pressure over the past several quarters. Given this soft pricing, efforts to retain market share will again induce pricing pressure, which might curb top-line growth. Per Willis Towers Watson’s Commercial Lines Insurance Pricing Survey, workers’ compensation witnessed a slight price reduction in 2021. Per the survey, pricing at workers' compensation could be down 2% to up 4% in 2022.  With commercial and industrial activities back on track, the demand for insurance coverage is likely to be on the rise. SpendEdge estimates workers compensation insurance pricing to increase at a five-year (2022-2026) CAGR of 5.25%.Claims Frequency Might Rise: The accident and health insurance space has witnessed growth over the years, primarily driven by an increase in benefits offered by employers. The right kind of workers’ compensation policy translates into personal care for injured workers, increased productivity, higher employee morale, lower turnover, reduced claims costs and less financial worry amid rising medical costs. Increasing underwriting exposure, sustained decrease in claims frequency rates attributable to a better working environment and conservative reserve levels have been boosting the industry’s performance. Per The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data in an AmTrust Financial report, workers over the age of 55 will increase to about 25% in 2024 from 21.7% in 2014. Thus, claims could rise based on the magnitude of severity, the report states. Also, with business activities getting normal, claims may rise.Increasing Adoption of Technology: The industry is witnessing accelerated adoption of technology in operations. Telemedicine has gained pace amid the pandemic. Carriers started selling policies online that appealed to the tech-savvy population. Given the current pandemic, several organizations are working remotely to comply with social distancing norms. Electronic applications, e-signatures, electronic policy delivery, cloud computing and blockchain should help insurers gain a competitive edge. Nonetheless, higher spending on technological advancements will result in escalated expense ratios.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects. The Zacks Accident and Health Insurance industry, housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #19, which places it in the top 8% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company to watch right now is Unum Group (UNM). UNM is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 6.54. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 11.87. UNM's Forward P/E has been as high as 7.46 and as low as 4.49, with a median of 6.34, all within the past year.We should also highlight that UNM has a P/B ratio of 0.95. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of 1.56. Over the past year, UNM's P/B has been as high as 1.06 and as low as 0.42, with a median of 0.66.Value investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. UNM has a P/S ratio of 0.67. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.91.Story continuesFinally, investors will want to recognize that UNM has a P/CF ratio of 5.65. This metric focuses on a firm's operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook. UNM's P/CF compares to its industry's average P/CF of 7.27. Within the past 12 months, UNM's P/CF has been as high as 6.63 and as low as 4.67, with a median of 5.69.These are only a few of the key metrics included in Unum Group's strong Value grade, but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now. When factoring in the strength of its earnings outlook, UNM looks like an impressive value stock at the moment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Please note all AUM is unaudited.Important Risk DisclosuresInvesting involves risk of including the risk of loss of principal.ETFs trade like stocks, are subject to investment risk, fluctuate in market value and may trade at prices above or below the ETFs net asset value. Brokerage commissions and ETF expenses will reduce returns.Investing in high yield fixed income securities, otherwise known as ""junk bonds"", is considered speculative and involves greater risk of loss of principal and interest than investing in investment grade fixed income securities. These Lower-quality debt securities involve greater risk of default or price changes due to potential changes in the credit quality of the issuer.The value of the debt securities may increase or decrease as a result of the following: market fluctuations, increases in interest rates, inability of issuers to repay principal and interest or illiquidity in the debt securities markets; the risk of low rates of return due to reinvestment of securities during periods of falling interest rates or repayment by issuers with higher coupon or interest rates; and/or the risk of low income due to falling interest rates. To the extent that interest rates rise, certain underlying obligations may be paid off substantially slower than originally anticipated and the value of those securities may fall sharply. This may result in a reduction in income from debt securities income.The municipal market is volatile and can be significantly affected by adverse tax, legislative or political changes and the financial condition of the issuers of municipal securities. Interest rate increases can cause the price of a debt security to decrease. A portion of the dividends you receive may be subject to federal, state, or local income tax or may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax.High-yield municipal bonds are subject to greater credit risk and are likely to be more sensitive to adverse economic changes or subject to greater risk of loss of income and principal than higher-rated securities.The municipal market is volatile and can be significantly affected by adverse tax, legislative or political changes and the financial condition of the issuers of municipal securities. Interest rate increases can cause the price of a debt security to decrease. A portion of the dividends you receive may be subject to federal, state, or local income tax or may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax.HYMB, SPYX and EFAX are classified as ""diversified"" under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the ""1940 Act""); however, the Fund may become ""non-diversified,"" as defined under the 1940 Act, solely as a result of tracking the Index (e.g., changes in weightings of one or more component securities). When the Fund is non-diversified, it may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in a limited number of issuers.No fossil fuel reserve ownership may have an adverse effect on a company’s profitability and, in turn, the returns of the fund.Equity securities may fluctuate in value and can decline significantly in response to the activities of individual companies and general market and economic conditions.Concentrated investments in a particular industry or sector tend to be more volatile than the overall market and increases risk that events negatively affecting such sectors or industries could reduce returns, potentially causing the value of the Fund’s shares to decrease.Investments in mid-sized companies may involve greater risks than in those of larger, better known companies, but may be less volatile than investments in smaller companies.Foreign (non-U.S.) securities may be subject to greater political, economic, environmental, credit and information risks. Foreign securities may be subject to higher volatility than U.S. securities, due to varying degrees of regulation and limited liquidity.As a ""non-diversified"" fund, EEMX may hold a smaller number of portfolio securities than many other funds. To the extent the Fund invests in a relatively small number of issuers, a decline in the market value of a particular security held by the Fund may affect its value more than if it invested in a larger number of issuers. The value of Fund Shares may be more volatile than the values of shares of more diversified funds.

Click to skip ahead to the billionaire’s top stock picks by clicking on Seth Klarman Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks.The Liberty SiriusXM Group (NASDAQ:LSXMA), Qorvo, Inc. (NASDAQ:QRVO), and Liberty Global plc (NASDAQ:LBTYK) are a few of the top stock picks of billionaire value investing icon Seth Klarman.Seth Klarman is the co-founder of Baupost Group, which he founded in 1982 alongside four others and has managed ever since. Under his guidance, Baupost Group has delivered average annualized returns of greater than 20% since inception, a four-decade run of success that elevated Klarman to billionaire status with a net worth of about $1.5 billion.Klarman is also the author of the value investing book Margin of Safety, which was published in 1991 in limited quantities and is extremely difficult to find today. Physical copies of the book sell for as much as $2,500 on Amazon. The book lays out Klarman’s approach to value investing, which includes conducting bottom up analysis of companies and only buying them at a discount (the margin of safety).Like most value investors, Klarman invests in the majority of stocks for the long-term, which makes him a great money manager to follow and potentially mimic. Like fellow value investing legend Warren Buffett, Klarman also loves companies that have wide moats and/or valuable patents and IP rights, which give them an edge over the competition.In a recent interview with Harvard Business School, Klarman noted that investors have had to significantly raise their game over the past few decades, as the market has become far more difficult to predict. Given the current market volatility, the various macroeconomic forces, and the rapid pace of technological change, he believes today is an extremely challenging period for investors, sentiments which were recently echoed by fellow billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller.Story continuesUnsurprisingly, there wasn’t a great deal of activity in Baupost’s 13F portfolio during Q3, though the fund did sell off 11 of its former holdings during the quarter, including one of its former top ten holdings. Just four new positions were added to the fund’s 13F portfolio, the value of which fell to $5.79 billion as of September 30 from $6.77 billion on June 30. It was the sixth straight quarter the fund’s 13F portfolio has dropped in value.The bulk of Klarman’s investments remained in the communications and IT sectors, which accounted for about 72% of the fund’s 13F assets, down slightly from 75% at the end of Q2.In this article, we’ll check out Seth Klarman’s top ten holdings and try to uncover why the billionaire money manager is bullish on them, most likely for the long haul.Seth Klarman Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks.Our MethodologyThe following data is gathered from Baupost Group‘s latest 13F filing with the SEC. We follow hedge funds like Baupost Group because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q3 2022 reporting period.Seth Klarman Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks10. Garrett Motion Inc. (NASDAQ:GTX)Value of Baupost Group‘s 13F Position: $181 Million (GTXAP), $27.6 Million (GTX) Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 30 Liberty Global plc (NASDAQ:LBTYK), The Liberty SiriusXM Group (NASDAQ:LSXMA), and Qorvo, Inc. (NASDAQ:QRVO) are some of the top stock holdings in Seth Klarman’s 13F portfolio. Also grabbing a spot in the top ten is Garrett Motion Inc. (NASDAQ:GTX), which Klarman owns 25.5 million shares of after leaving the position unchanged during Q3. Several funds have extremely aggressive 13F exposure to GTX, including Mark T. Gallogly’s Centerbridge Partners (53.8%) and Stephen C. Freidheim’s Cyrus Capital Partners (37.4%).Garrett Motion Inc. (NASDAQ:GTX) was spun off from Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE:HON) in 2017 and fully redeemed the Series B stock held by its former parent company earlier this year. The Switzerland-based company sells turbochargers for use in gas-powered and hybrid electric vehicles, which leaves it somewhat out in the cold when it comes to the longer-term trend towards fully electric vehicles, which don’t use turbochargers. In the medium term however, Garrett Motion has a solid growth runway ahead of it, and is investing in EV-related software technology that could eventually mitigate some of the longer-term downside risk in its core business.Alluvial Capital discussed the pros and cons of Garrett Motion Inc. (NASDAQ:GTX)’s new preferred shares dividend policy in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Garrett Motion Inc. (NASDAQ:GTX) has elected to begin paying cash dividends on its convertible preferred shares. Doing so prevents dividends in arrears from further accruing and is a wise use of the company’s free cash flow. I believe the choice to initiate a cash dividend is a tacit admission by the company that the necessary conditions for converting the preferred shares will not be met soon. This is a mild short-term negative, as the complex capital structure will remain in place for now. On the other hand, I am thrilled for us to earn a 9% yield as the company uses its free cash flow to buy back cheap stock and wait for the automotive cycle to turn.”9. New Oriental Education &amp; Technology Group Inc. (NYSE:EDU)Value of Baupost Group‘s 13F Position: $184 Million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 29 Seth Klarman trimmed his stake in New Oriental Education &amp; Technology Group Inc. (NYSE:EDU) by 4% during Q3, ending the quarter with 7.69 million shares. Hedge fund ownership of EDU fell for five straight quarters through the middle of 2022, declining by more than 50% during that time, but rebounded somewhat in Q3. Fang Zheng’s Keywise Capital Management and Dmitry Balyasny’s Balyasny Asset Management added EDU to their 13F portfolios during the September quarter.New Oriental Education &amp; Technology Group Inc. (NYSE:EDU) shares have crumbled by 85% since February 2021 after legislation was passed by the Chinese government that banned for-profit K-12 tutoring. The company has had dramatically pivot its business in the wake of those regulations, shifting to non-academic tutoring and on the growth of its overseas operations.The results showed promise for New Oriental Education &amp; Technology Group Inc. (NYSE:EDU) during its fiscal year 2023 Q1 results, as its revenue of $744.8 million beat estimates by more than 10%. While the year-over-year sales comps weren’t favorable, as revenue fell by 43.1% compared to a year earlier, the company nonetheless managed to grow its adjusted operating income by 28.3% to $97 million.8. Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:WTW)Value of Baupost Group‘s 13F Position: $258 Million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 45 Seth Klarman raised his stake in Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:WTW) by 39% during the third quarter, ending September with 1.29 million shares. Numerous other hedge funds have cut ties with the stock over the last year, as there’s been a 43% drop in the number of funds long WTW since Q3 2021. Leading quant funds Renaissance Technologies and Two Sigma Advisors both sold off their WTW holdings during Q3.Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:WTW) had solid organic growth of 6% during Q3 as revenue hit $2 billion, which was in-line with estimates. The insurance advisor delivered a slight beat on adjusted EPS, pulling in $2.20 per share compared to estimates of $2.13. Credit Suisse analyst Andrew Kligerman believes the company will continued to expand that metric at a double digit rate, predicting 22% and 19% adjusted EPS growth in 2023 and 2024 respectively. The analyst has an ‘Outperform’ rating and $288 price target on the stock.Artisan Partners shared its thoughts on Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:WTW) in the fund’s Q3 2022 investor letter:“Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:WTW) shares rose 2% in the quarter. This modest increase made it one of our best performers during a difficult quarter. Absent significant news, the business continues to benefit from a hard insurance market. Results are still lagging peers, but the management team seems to be making progress in closing the gap. In the meantime, the company is returning significant amounts of capital to shareholders. Over the past eight months, it has repurchased $4 billion in stock and reduced the share count by 15%. And there is more on the way. This is a good business in a fantastic industry trading at 12X normalized earnings. We believe it is worth much more.”7. Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV)Value of Baupost Group‘s 13F Position: $331 Million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 60 Klarman’s stake in Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV) was left untouched during Q3, as Baupost Group maintained its position of 3.53 million FISV shares. The stock has hit a 3-year low in terms of hedge fund ownership, with a 38% drop in the number of funds long FISV since the end of 2020. Jeffrey Ubben’s ValueAct Capital owns 14.6 million Fiserv shares as of September 30, giving the activist fund 23% 13F exposure to the stock.Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV) is a major player in the financial transactions space, processing more than 15.7 billion transactions annually from about 1.4 billion customer accounts. The company grew revenue by 10% during the first half of this year, to $8.6 billion, while adjusted EPS grew by 17% to $2.96. Its shares currently trade at a forward P/E of just 15.9x, which is quite a bit cheaper than the NASDAQ.The aforementioned ValueAct Capital was awarded a seat on the company’s board earlier this year and has stated that Clover alone could be worth close to half the company’s enterprise value.Artisan Partners also discussed Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV) in its Q3 2022 investor letter, and echoed ValueAct’s point that the market doesn’t seem to be giving as much credit as it should be to Fiserv subsidiary Clover:“While our list of potential candidates is filling up, we are being patient. We added two new positions in Q3: Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV) and Heineken. Fiserv is a provider of financial technology, core processing and payment processing services to financial institutions and merchants. The company reports three segments: acceptance (merchant acquiring), payments &amp; networks (issuer processing and debit network), and fintech (core bank processing). Fiserv has strong market positions and scale across these businesses, but competitive intensity varies. In the acceptance segment, Fiserv owns Clover, a high-growth point-of-sale (POS) system forsmall and medium businesses, with similar annualized gross payment volume to Block’s Square. However, Fiserv is receiving little credit for Clover. The market is overly concerned about the competitive nature of merchant acquiring and legacy processors losing market share to new entrants. We believe Fiserv’s business is more resilient and will continue to grow in the medium term driven by its scale and Clover. Moreover, fintech and payments are good businesses that are undervalued by the market. Both businesses are in highly consolidated industries where scale advantages are critical, and revenues are sticky due to high switching costs. A high share of recurring revenue and profit, an attractive margin profile and high free cash flow conversion are characteristics that should provide downside protection, in our view. We started our position with shares selling for about 11X normalized operating profit. That is a below-average multiple for an above-average business.”6. Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD)Value of Baupost Group‘s 13F Position: $334 Million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 76 Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) closes out the first half of Seth Klarman’s top 10 stock picks. He held 18 million shares of the company at the end of Q2 and raised his position by another 62% to 29 million shares during Q3. WBD went public in the second quarter after WarnerMedia was spun off by AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) and subsequently merged with Discovery Inc.Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) is in the midst of a significant restructuring plan that includes the company merging its streaming services Discovery and HBO Max into a single entity. It’s also looking to slash billions of dollars in costs from its balance sheet, which has resulted in the company axing both employees and content. The company has an impressive stable of content lined up for 2023, including multiple DC movies and the highly-anticipated videogame Hogwarts Legacy.Greenlight Capital shared the reasons why it unloaded its shares in Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Finally, we sold unsuccessful investments in PLBY and Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD). We thought both companies were going through substantial corporate transformations. PLBY failed to execute on its strategy and we exited with a 50% loss on our investment. We sold WBD as it faces a more challenging path to executing its integration plan than we expected. It also has a sizable amount of debt. We are trying to avoid levered equities in the current economic environment. We lost approximately 40% on WBD in half a year. Both positions were small.”Qorvo, Inc. (NASDAQ:QRVO), Liberty Global plc (NASDAQ:LBTYK), and The Liberty SiriusXM Group (NASDAQ:LSXMA) are some of the top stocks in Seth Klarman’s portfolio.

LULU reported strong third-quarter fiscal 2022 results, with revenues and earnings surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimates. The top and bottom lines also improved year over year. The results were driven by the continued business momentum, which led to robust sales.However, the company ended the quarter with elevated inventory levels compared with the last year. Inventory increased 84.5% year over year as of Oct 30, 2022. The company also outlined its guidance for the fourth quarter and revised its view for fiscal 2022.Although lululemon reported strong fiscal third-quarter results, its shares declined 7.5% in the after-hours trading session on Dec 8. This can be attributed to management’s commentary on elevated inventory levels at the end of the quarter. LULU’s soft view for the holiday quarter (the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022) also concerned investors’ sentiments.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have risen 6.2% in the past three months against the industry’s decline of 1.6%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ3 Detailslululemon’s fiscal third-quarter earnings of $2.00 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.96 and our estimates of $1.94. The figure also reflected an increase of 23.5% from the adjusted earnings of $1.62 in the year-ago quarter. The company’s adjusted earnings improved 28% on a three-year CAGR basis.On a GAAP basis, earnings per share (EPS) of $2.00 for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 improved from the $1.44 reported in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and 96 cents in the third quarter of 2019.The Vancouver, Canada-based company’s quarterly revenues advanced 28% year over year to $1,856.9 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,806 million and our estimates of 1,782.1 million. Revenue growth was mainly driven by the strong momentum in its business, backed by a favorable response to its products. The company’s net revenues grew 26% in North America and 41% internationally.Compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2019, net revenues improved 103%, witnessing a three-year CAGR of 27%. On a three-year CAGR basis, revenues improved 24% in North America and 42% internationally.lululemon’s total comparable sales rose 22% year over year and 25% on a constant-dollar basis. Comps were driven by robust traffic trends in both stores and e-commerce, with more than 25% traffic growth at stores and about 50% growth in e-commerce. On a three-year CAGR basis, traffic was up 9% in stores and more than 41% in e-commerce.Direct-to-consumer net revenues climbed 31% (up 34% on a constant-dollar basis).

Management highlighted that store productivity in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 continued to trend above the 2019 level. The company had 99% of its store fleet open in the fiscal third quarter.Story continuesMarginsThe gross profit improved 25% year over year to $1,038.9 million. However, the gross margin contracted 130 basis points (bps) to 55.9% due to a 40-bps decline in the product margin and 60-bps deleverage from foreign currency.The product margin in the fiscal third quarter was impacted by increased markdowns and inventory provisions compared with the low levels last year, partly negated by lower air freight expenses. lululemon also witnessed a 30-bps deleverage on fixed costs due to investments in product teams and distribution centers, offset by leverage in occupancy and depreciation expenses. The gross margin expanded 80 bps from the third quarter of fiscal 2019.SG&amp;A expenses of $684.2 million increased 25.5% from the year-ago quarter. SG&amp;A expenses, as a percentage of net revenues, were 36.8%, down 80 bps from the 37.6% reported in the prior-year quarter due to the leverage in store and other channels on corporate SG&amp;A and on foreign exchange. This was somewhat offset by higher depreciation and amortization.Income from operations jumped 36.6% to $352.4 million from the $257.9 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The operating margin expanded 120 bps to 19% from the prior-year quarter’s 17.8% and 20 bps from the third quarter of fiscal 2019.The adjusted income from operations rose 25% year over year in the third quarter of fiscal 2022, while the adjusted operating margin contracted 40 bps.Store UpdateIn the fiscal third quarter, the company opened 23 net new stores and completed seven co-located optimizations.

It anticipates opening approximately 79 net new company-operated stores in fiscal 2022 compared with the 75 store openings mentioned earlier.The store openings in fiscal 2022 are likely to include 45-50 stores in international markets. The total store openings in fiscal 2022 will imply a square footage increase in the low 20% range.Financialslululemon exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $352.6 million and stockholders’ equity of $3,039.2 million. At the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2022, the company had $400 million remaining under its committed revolving credit facility.At the end of the fiscal third quarter, the company’s inventories grew 84.5% to $1,741.7 million. On a unit basis, inventory was up 80%, witnessing a three-year CAGR of 38%.In-transit inventory increased relative to 2019 and contributed three-percentage points to the three-year unit growth rate. The company noted that the off-season made up for about 45% of its inventory. However, it expects inventory levels to be sufficient to meet consumer demand in the fiscal fourth quarter.lululemon expects the inventory growth rate at the end of the fiscal fourth quarter to start moderating, representing growth of 60% year over year. It expects unit inventory to increase about 39% on a three-year CAGR basis at the end of the fiscal fourth quarter.In the third quarter of fiscal 2022, management repurchased 55,000 shares at an average rate of $311 per share. As of Oct 30, 2022, the company had $812 million remaining under its recently authorized $1 billion share repurchase program.OutlookFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, management anticipates net revenues of $2.605-$2.655 billion, indicating 22-25% year-over-year growth and a 23-24% rise on a three-year CAGR basis. The company expects the fiscal fourth-quarter gross margin to expand 10-20 bps year over year.The gross margin is expected to gain from a year-over-year increase in the product margin, driven by reduced airfreight expenses, partly negated by persistent currency headwinds and the timing related to its supply-chain investments. The company anticipates markdowns to be in line with the 2019 levels.Further, lululemon anticipates a 30-50 bps leverage in the SG&amp;A expense rate for the fiscal fourth quarter. Adjusted EPS is projected to be $4.20-$4.30 for the fiscal fourth quarter. The company estimates an effective tax rate of 28.5% for the fiscal fourth quarter.LULU raised its guidance for fiscal 2022. It anticipates net revenues in the range of $7.944-$7.994 billion compared with the prior mentioned $7.865-$7.94 billion. The revised view represents a three-year CAGR of 26%, higher than the three-year revenue CAGR of 19% leading up to fiscal 2020. The sales view assumes e-commerce growth of 30% relative to that reported in fiscal 2021 and compares with the low-to-mid-20s growth expected earlier.lululemon anticipates a gross margin decline of 100-140 bps for fiscal 2022 compared with the 100-130 bps decline mentioned earlier. The decline is expected to mainly result from adverse currency rates. Further, higher investments in the distribution center network and more normalized markdowns from the low levels witnessed in the prior year are expected to hurt margins.For fiscal 2022, LULU expects the SG&amp;A rate to leverage 100-140 bps year over year compared with a decline of 100-130 bps mentioned earlier. The leverage is likely to be driven by increased sales.The company expects the operating margin for fiscal 2022 to be nearly flat with that reported last year compared with the flat-to-up operating margin expected earlier. lululemon expects an effective tax rate of 28-28.5% for fiscal 2022.GAAP EPS is projected to be $9.94-$10.04 for fiscal 2022 compared with $9.82-$9.97 expected earlier. Excluding the gain from the sale of an administrative office building, adjusted EPS for the fiscal year is envisioned to be $9.87-$9.97 compared with $9.75-$9.90 expected earlier.lululemon expects capital expenditure of $630-$655 million for fiscal 2022, suggesting 8% of revenues. This is in line with the company’s power of three X2 initiative’s target of 7-9% of revenues.

The company's market valuation decreased by US$3.9b after the stock price dropped 5.5% over the past week, but insiders were spared from painful losses.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At U.S. BancorpOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Timothy Welsh, for US$834k worth of shares, at about US$43.92 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$43.11. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.Insiders in U.S. Bancorp didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

In total, insiders dumped US$2.0m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Insider OwnershipMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. U.S. Bancorp insiders own about US$107m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The U.S. Bancorp Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales.

That is because the Jan 20, 2023 $17.50 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for U.S. Bancorp shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, U.S. Bancorp is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Banks - Major Regional industry that ranks in the Top 39% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, three analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while four have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.15 per share to $1.14 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about U.S. Bancorp right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

The average selling price of US$143 is still lower than the current share price, or in other words, insiders would have been better off holding on to their shares.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Walmart Walmart Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the , M. Biggs, for US$3.1m worth of shares, at about US$140 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$145). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 8.2% of M.

Specifically, insiders ditched US$7.6m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of WalmartLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Walmart insiders own 0.9% of the company, worth about US$3.5b. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Walmart Tell Us?Insiders haven't bought Walmart stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. But since Walmart is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

Riley Wealth.Some of the largest American banks are already sounding alarm bells on the economy in their client notes, with a few predicting a slowdown, while others are signaling an outright recession.A Reuters poll of economists published on Thursday showed that U.S. economic growth was expected to slow to 0.3% in 2023 following a 1.9% rise this year. It also suggests a 60% chance of a U.S. recession next year.Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk said in October a recession would last until the spring of 2024.Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told CNBC a downturn might be the necessary evil to ease inflation for his customers, who are more budget conscious.A Wall Street Journal report said Pepsi is looking to lay off hundreds of workers in headquarter roles, potentially joining a list of corporations, from tech majors to consumer firms that are reducing headcount to rein in costs as they brace for the uncertain outlook.Story continuesGRIM EARNINGS OUTLOOKSigns of a recession are driving American companies and brokerages that cover them to dial down profit expectations, with S&amp;P 500 firms likely to see their first decline in earnings in two years in the fourth quarter.For 2023, analysts expect profit growth at S&amp;P 500 companies to slow to 4.9%, after rising 5.8% in 2022, according to Refinitiv IBES data.While forecasts for the size and timing of recession vary, expectations for an economic recovery largely hinge on the Fed's stance on rates.""While there is significant uncertainty on the timing and severity of this downturn, we think that financial markets may react sooner and more violently than the economy itself,"" said J.P.Morgan Chief Global Markets Strategist Marko Kolanovic.Fed's rapid pace of rate hikes has pushed the S&amp;P 500 down about 17% in 2022, and barring any major rallies in the three weeks until new year, the benchmark index is set for its worst year in four.""Continued cautious comments is leading investors to become skeptical of a full rebound in markets and is part of the reason that recent rallies have failed to gain strong momentum,"" said Rick Meckler, a partner of Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.(Reporting by Medha Singh and Johann Cherian in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)]"

JWN has been gaining from its strength in core categories in men's and women's apparel and shoes. Its Closer to You strategy and supply-chain-optimization efforts also bode well. This led to its third-quarter fiscal 2022 results, wherein the top and bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This marked the fourth straight quarter of a bottom-line beat and the ninth consecutive quarter of a top-line beat.The company has been making efforts to drive efficiency and improve customer experience via faster order fulfillment. It is also on track to reduce inventory and optimize product mix. Also, increased focus on Nordstrom Rack bodes well. Notably, Nordstrom Rack reduced store-based order fulfillment and raised the minimum order amount for free ship-to-store delivery on rack.com.These actions led to lesser order cancellations, simplified rack operations and improved profitability. The company continues focusing on introducing more premium brands at Rack, better assortment and increased brand awareness. Driven by these factors, it expects to optimize the Rack product mix by mid-2023.Nordstrom is focused on its long-term strategy, which aims at enhancing its digital-first platform, expanding the reach of Nordstrom Rack, gaining market share and delivering growth. As part of the strategy, the company continues to scale enhanced capabilities like the expansion of order pickup and ship-to-store to all Nordstrom Rack stores. It also expanded its market strategy to its 20 top markets.As part of its closer-to-you strategy, the company aims to link stores and services to expedite deliveries, expand online offerings, and add cheaper merchandise at its Rack off-price stores, to improve customers’ shopping experiences. It is also on track to integrate Nordstrom Rack assets and offer a wide range of price points at Nordstrom Rack. Increased focus on distribution capabilities, along with improved connectivity of physical and digital inventory, is likely to contribute to Nordstrom Rack sales by roughly $2 billion in the long term.Driven by these factors, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company expects total revenue growth of 5-7% from the last fiscal year’s reported figure. Adjusted earnings are envisioned to be $2.30-$2.60. The EBIT margin is likely to be 4.1-4.4%, reflecting a year-over-year improvement, driven by lower SG&amp;A. Meanwhile, the adjusted EBIT margin is expected to be 4.3-4.7%.Shares of JWN have lost 19.7% year to date, outperforming the industry’s decline of 36.3%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, Nordstrom continues to reel under declining discretionary spending stemming from inflation. It witnessed a sluggish year-over-year performance during the fiscal third quarter. Adjusted earnings of 20 cents per share compared unfavorably with the year-ago quarter’s 39 cents.Total revenues of $3,546 million declined 2.5% from the year-ago quarter due to the shift in the timing of the Anniversary sale, wherein a day of the sale was part of the third quarter of 2022. This had a 200-basis-points (bps) negative impact on sales.Net sales fell 2.9% from the year-ago quarter to $3,433 million. Net sales for the Nordstrom brand decreased 3.4% from the year-ago quarter to $2,264 million. Sales for the Nordstrom Rack brand dipped 1.9% from the year-ago quarter to $1,169 million due to muted demand, particularly from lower-income customers.Also, higher markdowns dented Q3 margins. In third-quarter fiscal 2022, Nordstrom’s gross profit margin contracted 190 bps from the year-ago quarter to 33.2%. Adjusted EBIT was $73 million in the reported quarter, down 42.5% from the year-ago quarter. SG&amp;A expenses, as a percentage of sales, expanded 200 bps to 36.4% due to supply-chain technology and a related asset impairment charge, partly offset by reduced fulfillment expenses.Bottom LineDespite the inflation concerns and higher markdown, Nordstrom is likely to sustain momentum, driven by strong demand, solid online show and long-term growth strategy. The consensus mark for fiscal 2022 earnings has moved up 2.5% over the past 30 days to $2.42. Topping it, a VGM Score of A and a long-term earnings growth rate of 17.6% reflects its inherent strength.Stocks to ConsiderHere are three better-ranked stocks to consider, namely Wingstop WING, Ross Stores ROST and Chipotle Mexican Grill CMG.Wingstop currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Today's Research Daily features an update on the Q4 earnings season which got underway this week. We are also featuring the updated December Economic Outlook report, in addition to new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (MRK), Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY) and Deere &amp; Company (DE). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Zacks Economic Outlook for December 2022 ----&gt; Christmastime U.S. Retail Sales Update Q4 Earnings Season Gets Underway This week's quarterly reports from AutoZon AZO and Costco COST for their fiscal quarters ending in November that we count as part of the 2022 Q4 earnings tally. Next week's reports from the likes of Adobe, Orable, Accenture, Lennar and others will similarly count as part of the 2022 Q4 tally. Aggregate Q4 earnings for Costco and AutoZone are up +2.2% from the same period last year on +8.1% higher revenues, with only one of the two (AutoZone) beating EPS and revenue estimates. Looking at Q4 as a whole, total S&amp;P 500 earnings are expected to be down -5.9% from the same period last year on +4.3% higher revenues. Excluding contribution from the Energy sector whose earnings are expected to be up +56.9%, Q4 earnings for the rest of the index are expected to be down -10.3% from the same period last year. Estimates have been steadily coming down, with the current -5.9% decline down from +1.7% on October 5th. Today's Featured Analyst ReportsShares of Merck &amp; Co have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+52.7% vs. +19.3%) on the back of strong sales momentum from drugs like Keytruda and the Gardasil vaccine. With continued label expansion into new indications &amp; early-stage settings, Keytruda is expected to remain a key top-line driver.Animal health and vaccine products are core growth drivers. Its new COVID oral antiviral pill, Lagevrio has become a key top-line driver in 2022. Merck boasts a strong cancer pipeline, including Keytruda, which should help drive long-term growth.However, generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure, mainly on the diabetes franchise, will continue to be overhangs on the top line. There are concerns about Merck’s ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda’s loss of exclusivity later in the decade.(You can read the full research report on Merck &amp; Co here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the past year (+41.7% vs. -17.8%). Solid demand for the company’s blood thinner drug Eliquis and the label expansion of Opdivo are maintaining momentum for Bristol-Myers. Eliquis is the leading oral anticoagulant drug and continues to experience growth in its market share.The label expansion of Opdivo into indications for lung cancer, renal cancer and gastric cancer boosted sales. The recent approval of drugs like Opdualag, Breyanzi and Sotyktu will add a new stream of revenues. Our estimates for BMY’s top line suggest a CAGR of around 1% over the next three years, driven by solid demand for legacy drugs and the approval of new drugs.However, Revlimid, one of the top revenue generators, is facing generic competition and sales are being adversely impacted.(You can read the full research report on Bristol-Myers Squibb here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Deere &amp; Company shares have outperformed the Zacks Manufacturing - Farm Equipment industry over the past year (+23.6% vs. +21.7%). The company is poised well to gain on improving commodity prices, which will encourage farmers to spend more on farm equipment. Strong replacement demand will also continue to boost its top line.Demand for Construction equipment will likely benefit from anticipated growth in infrastructure investments. Higher material and labor costs will likely dent margins. However, we expect Deere’s adjusted earnings per share to grow 16% in fiscal 2023, led by strong demand and pricing. Product launches equipped with the latest technology to make farming automated will continue to provide it with an edge over its competitors.It will benefit in the long run from rapid growth in global population as well as the rising worldwide infrastructure needs. Our estimates for Deere’s bottom line suggest a CAGR of around 2% over the 2022-2025 forecast period.(You can read the full research report on Deere &amp; Company here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (BUD), Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc.

MMC is well poised to grow on the back of strategic acquisitions, solid Risk and Insurance Services business and geographic expansions. Its disciplined capital-allocation strategy bodes well. However, rising expenses are affecting margins.Marsh &amp; McLennan — with a market cap of $84.9 billion — is a leading professional services company. It operates in the areas of risk, strategy and people. It provides insurance and consulting services to clients worldwide.Courtesy of solid prospects, this currently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is worth holding on to at the moment.Trend in EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Marsh &amp; McLennan’s 2022 earnings is pegged at $6.77 per share, indicating a 9.7% rise from the year-ago reported figure. MMC has witnessed no movement in revisions in the past week. Its earnings beat estimates in all the last four quarters, the average being 3.2%.Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMarsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMarsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc. QuoteFurthermore, the consensus mark for revenues is $20.9 billion for 2022, indicating a 5.4% rise from the year-ago reported figure.Key DriversThe company’s strategic acquisitions are driving growth. Its prudent choice in buying companies is enabling the company to scale operations, enter new locations and markets, expand existing businesses and products, and develop new opportunities. This helps the company to increase ownership in profitable operations. It also does not shy away from divesting less-profitable operations to boost efficiency.Marsh &amp; McLennan’s return on equity of 31.7% is higher than the industry average of 30.5%.As economies around the world are recovering, MMC’s Consulting business is likely to flourish. Adjusted operating income from this unit improved 5% year over year to $1.1 billion in the first nine months of 2022. Also, sales in the Career sub-segment are expected to increase as more people join the working population.Story continuesMMC’s solid Risk and Insurance Services business is a major driver. This unit operates through Marsh and Guy Carpenter. It accounted for 61% of MMC's total revenues last year. Adjusted operating income from the segment rose 13% year over year to $2.8 billion in the first nine months of 2022. It is likely to register exponential growth in the days ahead, primarily on the back of its Marsh unit.MMC has a disciplined capital-allocation strategy in place. Its dividend yield of 1.4% is higher than the industry average of 1.1%. This July, the board of directors approved a 10% hike in the quarterly dividend, reflecting 13 consecutive years of dividend increases.It also has a strong repurchase program in place. The company bought back 3.1 million shares worth $500 million in the September quarter. It had $4.7 billion left under its authorization at the third-quarter end.Key ConcernsHowever, there are a few factors that are holding back the stock.Rising expenses are affecting its margins. In the first three quarters of 2022, total expenses escalated 6.5% from the prior-year comparable period’s figure. Also, MMC’s price-to-earnings ratio for the forward 12-month period is at 23.52X, above the industry average of 21.25X, making the stock overvalued. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive its long-term growth.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broader finance space are MGIC Investment Corporation MTG, XP Inc. XP and NerdWallet, Inc. NRDS, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Milwaukee, WI-based MGIC Investment is a private mortgage insurance and other products provider.

25,30f4b5ea-eec3-3e0b-9df2-c6435a99a11b,MCHP,2022-12-10,3 Long-Term Picks from the Semiconductor Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-long-term-picks-semiconductor-205008027.html,1670619008,STORY,"['ADI', 'MCHP', 'MTSI', '^GSPC']","[The strong demand environment of the last few months has allowed several semiconductor players to enter into long-term, preferred-supplier or other special relationships with customers. This has improved visibility for players and stabilized revenue streams. However, the industry remains supply constrained, which is a limiting factor. Growth prospects over the next 5-10 years are excellent, because of the adoption of new technologies like AI-ML, EVs, smart cities, IoT, etc. While the longer-term outlook is extremely bright, near-term concerns related to the Fed-engineered economic slowdown and supply challenges remain. The most likely result will be increased caution at customers, who could order closer to consumption, thus reducing visibility. But this should not be a deterrent considering that valuations are supportive.  Our current picks are Analog Devices, MACOM Technology and Microchip.About the IndustryThe electronic gadgets we use to accurately read our commands, and record, store, retrieve and process the information we throw at them run on semiconductor technology, whether analog (enabling the recording and measurement of real-world information), digital (processing information available in machine-readable language) or mixed signal (enabling conversion of analog signals to digital or digital to analog among other things). Most electronic gadgets use a combination of these components, whether in consumer, industrial, auto, medical, communications, or IoT and other markets.The industry is cyclical and prices are elastic. Players usually serve multiple markets that offset their individual seasonality, or focus on certain core markets for which they have highly differentiated technology and relationships.Major Themes Driving the IndustryMost companies in this industry are positioned for strong growth this year followed by difficult comps and weaker demand in the next. It is the net effect of these companies being still somewhat behind schedule in delivering to the post-pandemic rush in demand. This in turn is because of supply chain disruption (which continues for most), driven by the pandemic, geopolitical tensions and the more recent COVID shutdowns in China. Supply constraints also impact profitability as it may be necessary to idle capacity despite demand being out there. Going into 2023, some segments are seeing orders slow down or get rescheduled, which along with the slight uptick in cancellations, points to increasing caution at customers. But many of these companies have long term agreements stretching well into 2023, which means that any softness could take longer to show up in the results.Story continues The increasing use of electronics in vehicles, airplanes and defense equipment; increased factory automation; greater penetration of smartphones, tablets, notebooks, PCs and all manner of personal computing and other personal devices and smart household appliances; communications infrastructure moving to 5G; greater reliance on cloud infrastructure; the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), more advanced medical devices, EVs, self-driving cars etc continue to expand the addressable market for semiconductor chips. The constantly expanding addressable market makes this a very attractive industry for long-term investment. This is particularly true because the industry is capacity constrained based on today’s level of digitization, but this digitization is expected to increase manifold over the next decade because of the adoption of AI, EV and other emerging technologies. Additionally, the breadth of  markets and applications ensure that even if some segments (like consumer/computing) see demand pullbacks, emerging areas like AI, EV, IoT, etc. balance them out.  The post-pandemic hybrid model, where more people move out of their homes more often but not all the time, is leading to an expansion of the overall electronic footprint of the consumer/computing segment. Near-term challenges here are related to strong uptake in the last couple of years. But there are other opportunities, including the metaverse and consumer devices incorporating newer technologies to enable more experiences. The number of semiconductors per device and their complexities also continue to increase, thus supporting demand. The adoption of 5G communications technology, enabling 10X the data rate as 4G, is another boost to analog-mixed signal sales both in base stations and end devices. Because of the multiple input (MI) and multiple output (MO) streams the technology enables in base stations, demand for sensors and power management analog including envelope tracking chips (to manage excess power flow and thus reduce heating), as well as gallium nitride (GaN) materials are increasing. Moreover, since 5G is only involved in short range signals, it is not totally replacing 4G but supplementing it, thus adding to component demand. Industry consolidation is important because the cost and complications of making chips rises in an environment where the adoption of semiconductors in devices of varying value requires prices to decline. Acquisitions are also driven by the need to expand R&amp;D capabilities and to acquire key talent. U.S. government officials worry that none of the most advanced chips are currently manufactured in the country. This is considered to be a national security concern given that semiconductors are playing an increasingly larger role in AI-driven electronic weaponry and surveillance mechanisms. So the government is trying to incentivize companies to build in the U.S. TSM, the main supplier to the U.S. is setting up in the country but the plan is to have this on a much larger scale. How exactly this situation will play out for the industry is unknown. Increasing capacity would depress prices. And U.S. production would increase cost. So much depends on the government’s contribution (perhaps through the CHIPS Act). In the meantime, the U.S. has ordered restrictions on trading with China, which is also a near-term headwind for players.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Uncertain ProspectsThe Zacks Semiconductor – Analog and Mixed industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector.

ADI: A fabless semiconductor company, Analog Devices is an original equipment manufacturer of semiconductor devices, specifically, analog, mixed signal and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits for industrial, consumer, communications and automotive customers. Other than manufacturing at its facilities in the U.S., Ireland and Southeast Asia, it also outsources some production to outside foundries, mainly Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for front-end processing and third-party subcontractors for back-end operations.Management is optimistic about near-term strength based on stabilizing orders, a strong backlog and continued design win momentum. Additionally, the increased scale and diversification, flexibility of its manufacturing model, and strengthening brand value are expected to help it navigate the economic downturn. This strength has allowed it to generate all-time high fourth-quarter revenues in the industrial, automotive and communications markets, as well as relatively modest growth in consumer. Analog Devices pays a regular dividend, and it increased the payout on a per share basis by over 10%.The company beat October quarter estimates by 5.8% and in the last 60 days, the 2023 estimates for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company increased 28 cents (2.9%).

Its 2023 (ending September) EPS estimate has dropped a penny in the last 60 days while the 2024 estimate increased a couple of cents.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 stock are down 9.6% over the past year.Price and Consensus: MTSIZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Microchip Technology Inc. MCHP: Microchip Technology Incorporated operates in the Americas, Europe and Asia. It develops, manufactures and sells smart, connected, and secure embedded control solutions such as general purpose 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit microcontrollers; 32-bit embedded microprocessors; and specialized microcontrollers for automotive, industrial, computing, communications, lighting, power supplies, motor control, human machine interface, security, wired connectivity, and wireless connectivity applications.Microchip’s demand far outpaces its ability to supply. It is a good thing that more than 50% of its backlog is non-cancellable under its Preferred Supply Program (PSP). Other than the fact that it greatly improves visibility, it also helps in the current environment where the company is seeing supply constraints. This is also stretching out lead times and forcing the company to idle capacity, which hurts its profitability.Investors would also be interested to know that its strong cash flows have enabled the company to pay down a substantial portion of its debt over the last few years and also pay a consistent dividend. The company recently bought back a substantial number of shares and earlier this year, the board announced a 37.8% increase in the dividend.Therefore management continues to return value to shareholders. Microchip beat estimates by 1.4% in the last quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 has increased 24 cents (4.2%) in the last 60 days.

26,604527f6-00dc-37fc-bfd5-9ba498c8760f,O,2022-12-10,Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad's (KLSE:HIBISCS) Prospects Need A Boost To Lift Shares,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hibiscus-petroleum-berhads-klse-hibiscs-222344126.html,1670624624,STORY,['CL=F'],"[With a price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 2.8x Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad (KLSE:HIBISCS) may be sending very bullish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in Malaysia have P/E ratios greater than 13x and even P/E's higher than 24x are not unusual. However, the P/E might be quite low for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad has been doing relatively well. One possibility is that the P/E is low because investors think this strong earnings performance might be less impressive moving forward. If not, then existing shareholders have reason to be quite optimistic about the future direction of the share price. Check out our latest analysis for Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad will help you uncover what's on the horizon.Is There Any Growth For Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as depressed as Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad's is when the company's growth is on track to lag the market decidedly.Retrospectively, the last year delivered an exceptional 411% gain to the company's bottom line. The latest three year period has also seen an excellent 303% overall rise in EPS, aided by its short-term performance. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been superb for the company.Shifting to the future, estimates from the seven analysts covering the company suggest earnings growth is heading into negative territory, declining 18% each year over the next three years. That's not great when the rest of the market is expected to grow by 12% each year.In light of this, it's understandable that Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad's P/E would sit below the majority of other companies. However, shrinking earnings are unlikely to lead to a stable P/E over the longer term. Even just maintaining these prices could be difficult to achieve as the weak outlook is weighing down the shares.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayWe'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.We've established that Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad maintains its low P/E on the weakness of its forecast for sliding earnings, as expected. Right now shareholders are accepting the low P/E as they concede future earnings probably won't provide any pleasant surprises. Unless these conditions improve, they will continue to form a barrier for the share price around these levels.There are also other vital risk factors to consider and we've discovered 2 warning signs for Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad (1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that you should be aware of before investing here.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates.

32,68960c02-8e8a-36e5-9b36-686beebbe15c,O,2022-12-10,The biggest oil spill in the history of the Keystone pipeline is dumping more than a half million gallons of crude into a creek in Kansas,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biggest-oil-spill-history-keystone-200524707.html,1670616324,STORY,['CL=F'],"[An oil spill in a creek in northeastern Kansas this week is the largest for an onshore crude pipeline in more than nine years and by far the biggest in the history of the Keystone pipeline, according to federal data.Canada-based TC Energy on Thursday estimated the spill on the Keystone system at about 14,000 barrels, or 588,000 gallons. It said the affected pipeline segment had been “isolated,” the oil had been contained at the site with booms, or barriers, and environmental monitoring had been set up, including around-the-clock air-quality monitoring. It did not say how the spill occurred.After a drop in pressure on the pipeline that carries oil from Canada to the Texas Gulf Coast, the company said it shut down its Keystone system Wednesday night. Oil spilled into a creek in Washington County, Kansas, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) northwest of Kansas City.Zack Pistora, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club in Kansas, noted the spill in his state was larger than all of the 22 previous spills combined on the Keystone pipeline, which began operations in 2010.“This is going to be months, maybe even years before we get the full handle on this disaster and know the extent of the damage and get it all cleaned up,” he said.In September 2013, a Tesoro Corp. pipeline in North Dakota ruptured and spilled 20,600 barrels, according to U.S. Department of Transportation data.A more expensive spill happened in July 2010, when an Enbridge Inc. pipeline in Michigan ruptured and spilled more than 20,000 barrels into Talmadge Creek and the Kalamazoo River. Hundreds of homes and businesses were evacuated.The Keystone pipeline's previous largest spill came in 2017, when more than 6,500 barrels spilled near Amherst, South Dakota, according to a U.S. Government Accountability Office report released last year. The second largest, 4,515 barrels, was in 2019 near Edinburg, North Dakota.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said drinking water wells were not affected by this week's spill and the oil didn't move from the creek to larger waterways. The spill was in pastureland about 5 miles (8 kilometers) northeast of Washington, the county seat of about 1,100 residents and no evacuations were ordered.Story continuesPipelines are often considered safer than shipping oil by railcar or truck, but large spills can create significant environmental damage.The nearly 2,700-mile Keystone pipeline carries thick, Canadian tar-sands oil to refineries in Illinois, Oklahoma and Texas. An arm of the Transportation Department that oversees pipeline safety permitted operator TC Energy run the pipeline at pressure greater than is usually allowed if the company used pipe made from better steel.In a report to Congress last year, the Government Accountability Office said Keystone’s accident history was similar to other oil pipelines, but the spills have gotten larger in recent years. Investigations ordered by regulators found that the four worst spills were caused by flaws in design or pipe manufacturing during construction.The TC Energy permit included more than 50 special conditions, including on its design, construction and operation, the GAO report said. Bill Caram, executive director of the nonprofit advocacy Pipeline Safety Trust, said Friday that he would have thought that the additional safety measures would have been enough to offset the pipeline’s higher pressure.“When we see multiple failures like this of such large size and a relatively short amount of time after that pressure has increased, I think it’s time to question that,” Caram said, noting the 2017 and 2019 spills.Concerns that spills could pollute waterways spurred opposition to plans by TC Energy to build another crude oil pipeline in the Keystone system, which would have cut across Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska. Critics also argued that using crude from western Canada’s oil sands would worsen climate change, and President Joe Biden’s cancelation of a U.S. permit for the project led the company to pull the plug last year.The spill caused a brief surge in crude prices Thursday. Benchmark U.S. oil was up more modestly -- about 1% — on Friday morning as fears of a supply disruption were overshadowed by bigger concerns about an economic downturn in the U.S. and other major countries that would reduce demand for oil.Tom Kloza, an Oil Price Information Service analyst, said that oil is now perceived as plentiful, “and this mishap will not have any appreciable impact on gasoline or diesel prices.” Prices at the pump will continue to drop a few cents a day, or even more, and that between Canadian imports and the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the U.S. has enough crude to last more than three years at current demand, he said.Patrick De Haan, an analyst for GasBuddy, which operates a price-tracking app, said there is pressure to repair the pipeline quickly and keep refineries supplied, adding that “if it lasts more than a few days, that could spell trouble.""Past Keystone spills have led to outages that lasted about two weeks, but this outage could possibly be longer because it involves a body of water, RBC Capital Markets analysts said in a note to investors. Though it's possible that a portion of the pipeline could restart sooner, they said.The spill was 5 miles (8 kilometers) northeast of Washington, the county seat of about 1,100 residents.The pipeline runs through Chris and Bill Pannbacker’s family farm. The hill where the breach happened was a landmark to locals and used to be a popular destination for hayrides, said Bill Pannbacker, a farmer and stockman. He disagreed with the company’s decision to build the pipeline over that 80-foot hill rather than bore through it, now questioning himself for relenting.“I wish I would have held firmer. And I bet now they wish I would have held firmer too because I’m assuming the flow against that bend in the pipe is maybe what caused some of the problem.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune:  Rishi Sunak’s old hedge fund boss paid himself $1.9 million a day this year Meet the 29-year-old teacher with four degrees who wants to join the Great Resignation How much money you need to earn to buy a $400,000 home Elon Musk ‘wanted to punch’ Kanye West after deeming the rapper’s swastika tweet an ‘incitement to violence’ ]"

WHY THE NEED TO RESTRUCTURE? Inflation in Ghana has soared in 2022 to a 21-year peak of 40.4% annually in October. Several steep interest rate hikes - the most recent by 250 basis points to 27% in November - have failed to check rising prices.The cedi has lost more than 50% of its value this year , pushing up the cost of Ghana's external debt.The gold, cocoa and oil producer has been locked out of international markets as the premium demanded by investors to hold its debt over safe-haven U.S. Treasuries has been above the 1,000-basis points mark for most of the past 12 months. The spread is currently at over 3,000 bps.Ghana's domestic borrowing costs have soared. Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta said on Monday interest payments were consuming between 70 and 100% of government revenues. Other than default-stricken Sri Lanka, that is the worst statistic in the world, according to credit rating agency Fitch. HOW BIG IS GHANA'S DEBT? Ghana's public debt was 467.4 billion cedis ($37.4 billion) in September, of which 42% was domestic debt, according to the most recent central bank figures released last month.It is now more than 100% of GDP, Ofori-Atta said on Monday, as he announced some of the plans the government hopes will bring that ratio down to 55% by 2028.The country is at high risk of debt distress, he said last month while presenting the 2023 budget. WHO OWNS GHANA'S DEBT? Commercial banks held a third of the domestic debt of Ghana and its state-owned enterprises at the end of September, according to the country's Central Securities Depository. Other major holders include foreign investors, pension funds and the central bank.Story continuesGhana has $13 billion in Eurobonds, with holders including major global asset managers such as BlackRock, Vontobel, AllianceBernstein, Neuberger Berman and PIMCO, according to recent filings.It is not clear if a $1 billion 2030 Eurobond, which has a $400 million World Bank guarantee and is trading well above other non-guaranteed bonds, will be included in the debt restructuring.At the end of 2021, Ghana had $3.2 billion of bilateral debt and $6.3 billion with multilateral institutions, $4.6 billion of that with the World Bank, according to World Bank data. WHAT IS GHANA PROPOSING? Ofori-Atta on Monday announced a plan to exchange the country's local bonds worth about 137.3 billion Ghana cedis ($10.5 billion) by Dec. 19.More than 60 local bonds maturing between 2023 and 2039 will be exchanged for new ones maturing in 2027, 2029, 2032 and 2037, with the annual coupon set at 0% in 2023, 5% in 2024 and 10% from 2025 until maturity.The country's central bank on Friday announced relief measures for banks participating in the bond exchange, which followed treasury and debt management director Samuel Arkhurst warning on Wednesday that large holdouts would spell ""trouble"".A $1.2-billion financial stability fund is being set up to cushion the impact on the financial sector. External debt restructuring plans would be announced in ""due course"", Ofori-Atta said on Monday. WHAT ABOUT THE IMF? Ghana's government sought help from the IMF in July, going back on its pledge to never to do so. Ofori-Atta said it was looking at a three-year programme potentially worth between $2 billion and $3 billion.The IMF and Ghana are expected to reach a staff-level agreement on a loan deal by Tuesday at the latest, three sources with knowledge of the ongoing talks told Reuters.An IMF visit to Ghana finishes on Tuesday. The fund is yet to comment on Ghana's debt sustainability or domestic bond exchange plans.

43,ae721183-6b07-3206-a452-ea0d30b9f1a5,CRM,2022-12-10,"In the wake of Salesforce, Inc.'s (NYSE:CRM) latest US$13b market cap drop, institutional owners may be forced to take severe actions",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wake-salesforce-inc-nyse-crm-130019584.html,1670677219,STORY,['CRM'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 79% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).And institutional investors saw their holdings value drop by 9.3% last week. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 51% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors. Institutions or ""liquidity providers"" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. Hence, if weakness in Salesforce's share price continues, institutional investors may feel compelled to sell the stock, which might not be ideal for individual investors.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Salesforce. See our latest analysis for Salesforce ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Salesforce?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Salesforce does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Salesforce, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Salesforce. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.1% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 6.9% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.5% of the company stock. In addition, we found that Marc Benioff, the CEO has 2.8% of the shares allocated to their name.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of SalesforceThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in Salesforce, Inc.. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$4.1b. we sometimes take an interest in  whether they have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 18% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Salesforce. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

With many analysts covering the mid-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine Sealed Air’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. View our latest analysis for Sealed Air Is Sealed Air Still Cheap?The share price seems sensible at the moment according to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 12.99x is currently trading slightly below its industry peers’ ratio of 13.45x, which means if you buy Sealed Air today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe Sealed Air should be trading in this range, then there isn’t much room for the share price to grow beyond the levels of other industry peers over the long-term. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Sealed Air’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What kind of growth will Sealed Air generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Sealed Air's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 30%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? SEE’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at SEE? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below the industry PE ratio?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on SEE, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the optimistic forecast is encouraging for SEE, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

47,61a557f6-fdcb-3a73-af6b-5c11cc8d4e43,RL,2022-12-10,11 Best Fashion Stocks To Buy Now,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-best-fashion-stocks-buy-114356357.html,1670672636,STORY,"['ANF', 'NKE', 'HBI', 'GPS', 'RL', 'TLYS', 'GES', 'LULU']","[In this article we present the list of 11 Best Fashion Stocks To Buy Now. Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Best Fashion Stocks To Buy Now.If you’re in the market for fashion stocks, then NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU), and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. (NYSE:ANF) should be at the top of your list.It’s been a volatile few years for the apparel and fashion industry as a whole, and its companies’ share prices in particular. Sales at clothing and accessories stores sank by 26% year-over-year in 2020, as pandemic lockdowns across the globe shuttered stores and kept people lounging around in their sweats at home.After a year of barely updating their wardrobes, consumers went crazy catching up for lost time in 2021 as societies reopened and people began socializing again. Sales jumped by 60% during the first nine months of 2021 and continued to be strong through the first half of this year.Another slowdown for the industry appears to be underway now however, with inflation and depressed consumer sentiment driving fashion sales into negative territory in the second half of this year. McKinsey predicts that the industry will grow by about 2-3% during 2023, primarily due to solid sustained growth in the luxury fashion market, which is expected to grow between 5-10%.That’s not surprising given that luxury retailers and other sellers of high-priced goods tend to weather economic storms better thanks to their focus on the wealthy consumer, who isn’t as affected by economic downturns.The fashion market is expected to be strong in both China and the United States, growing by as much 6% or 7% in each country, while an energy crisis in Europe is expected to lead to a 1% to 4% downturn for the fashion market in that region next year.As cash-strapped consumers more carefully consider their clothing options, the rise of secondhand apparel is becoming apparent and represents another challenge for apparel brands and retailers. The secondhand market is expected to grow by 24% to $119 billion this year and to reach $218 billion in sales by 2026. Meanwhile, the broader apparel market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.6% through 2026, hitting $843 billion, and those projections might be somewhat optimistic.Story continuesThe secondhand trend is particularly pronounced in North America, where secondhand apparel has been outgrowing the broader apparel market by a staggering 700%. In response, some fashion brands are beginning to launch their own resale initiatives to bring some of that market back within their own ecosystem.All told, it could be a lean year or two for some or even many fashion companies and their corresponding shares, which makes pinpointing only the best fashion stocks to buy now a priority for investors interested in the space. We’ll do that in this article, using the smart money sentiment as our guide to which fashion stocks are likely to perform well in the years to come.11 Best Fashion Stocks To Buy NowOur MethodologyThe following fashion stocks are ranked based on hedge fund sentiment. We follow a select group of hedge funds because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q3 2022 reporting period.11 Best Fashion Stocks To Buy Now11. Tilly’s, Inc. (NYSE:TLYS)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 15 Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. (NYSE:ANF), NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), and Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU) rank among the top five best fashion stocks to buy right now. Just cracking the list in 11th is Tilly’s, Inc. (NYSE:TLYS), which sells apparel and accessories geared towards kids and teens.Hedge fund ownership of Tilly’s, Inc. (NYSE:TLYS) peaked in the third quarter of 2018 and has declined by 33% since. It did tick up during Q3 of this year however, as multiple funds opened small stakes in the company. Among them were Israel Englander’s Millennium Management and Frederick Disanto’s Ancora Advisors.Tilly’s, Inc. (NYSE:TLYS) was a big beneficiary of the pandemic, but has struggled to match up against those tougher comps in 2022. The third quarter wasn’t great, but the company did perform better than both it and the market expected, pulling in $178 million in revenue and $0.17 per share in earnings, both of which beat estimates. Comparable net sales in Q4 had declined by 18.5% through November 29 compared to the year-ago period.10. Guess’, Inc. (NYSE:GES)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 17 Hedge funds bailed on Guess’, Inc. (NYSE:GES) in droves during the first quarter, as there was a 41% decline in the number of smart money managers long the stock. There was a slight rebound in Q2 as Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies and Lee Ainslie’s Maverick Capital were among the funds to add GES to their 13F portfolios.Guess’, Inc. (NYSE:GES) has hung in there somewhat better than Tilly’s this year, growing Q3 sales by 10% year-over-year on a constant currency basis thanks to continued strong performance in Europe. The jeans and apparel maker’s operating margin stood at 8.6% in Q3, down from 14.1% a year earlier, though company expects that figure to rebound to 13.2% in Q4 on an adjusted basis.Guess’, Inc. (NYSE:GES) is undergoing several initiatives to improve its customer acquisition and retention efforts, as well as its marketing capabilities. Chief among them is the company’s Customer 360 platform, some of which has already been implemented in Europe with promising results. Guess has also been growing its digital business, including its data analytics capabilities.9. Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE:RL)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 22 There’s been a 29% drop in the number of hedge funds long Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE:RL) over the past two quarters, with the stock hitting a ten-year low in smart money ownership as a result. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates sold off its stake in RL during Q3, while Arrowstreet Capital, founded by Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke and John Campbell, held the largest long position, consisting of 801,348 shares.Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE:RL) could be poised for a good holiday season if demand trends for the high-end fashion retailer are strong, as the company significantly bolstered its inventory ahead of the fourth quarter to stave off any potential supply chain challenges. High-end retailers tend to perform better during economic downturns due to their wealthier clientele being less affected by the conditions of the day, which the company appears to be banking on.There are some troubling signs in the company’s recent results however, which may be why hedge funds have been bailing on the stock. Ralph Lauren grew sales by 13% in its Q1 of fiscal 2023, but sales growth slowed to 5% year-over-year in its fiscal Q2. Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE:RL)’s bottom line has also been getting pinched due to rising cost of goods sold, which jumped by 14% in fiscal Q2, dwarfing the company’s sales growth. That contributed to earnings falling to $2.23 per share compared to $2.62 a year earlier, despite the company having also bought back over 6 million shares, or about 8.4% of its outstanding float prior to those purchases.8. Victorias Secret &amp; Co. (NYSE:VSCO)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 24 Hedge funds showed noteworthy interest in Victorias Secret &amp; Co. (NYSE:VSCO) during its first quarter on the market as a publicly traded company following its separation from Bath &amp; Body Works, Inc. (NYSE:BBWI) in Q3 of 2021. That interest has waned considerably in the four quarters since however, as there’s been a drop in hedge fund ownership of VSCO during each of those quarters.The lingerie retailer was spun off in part so a new management team could take charge and help turn around the struggling company, which suffered a major sales drop during its fiscal 2020 year. Victorias Secret &amp; Co. (NYSE:VSCO)’s gross margins have trailed its peers by a wide margin (pardon the pun?), which is something management has been focused on improving, with some success, but more work remains to be done.Victorias Secret &amp; Co. (NYSE:VSCO)‘s Q3 comparable sales slumped by 11% year-over-year, with the company pulling in $1.32 billion in sales, in line with estimates. The retailer’s EPS of $0.29 topped estimates by a healthy $0.06 and also came in ahead of the company’s own guidance. Cowen analyst Jonna Kim has a $45 price target and ‘Outperform’ rating on VSCO shares. The analyst believes the company’s sales will remain pressured in the near-term, but that longer-term, it has a good opportunity to regain share in the U.S. and grow internationally.T-6. Hanesbrands Inc. (NYSE:HBI)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 25 Ownership of Hanesbrands Inc. (NYSE:HBI) among the select group of funds tracked by Insider Monkey sank to a nine-year low during the second quarter, but rebounded big time during Q3, shooting up by nearly 50%. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group and Andrew Kurita’s Kettle Hill Capital Management were two of the funds to add HBI to their 13F portfolios during Q3.Hanesbrands Inc. (NYSE:HBI) shares have trended down throughout the year, losing 63% of their value, which may have prompted some funds to go bargain hunting. The clothing and undergarments manufacturer has been facing several challenges in recent quarters, including tighter inventory management among retailers and rising costs. Sales slumped by 7% year-over-year in Q3, sliding to $1.67 billion, while adjusted net income fared far worse, tumbling by 46% to $102 million. The company’s guidance for the holiday season also came in well below estimates, with projections for as little as $1.4 billion in sales and $0.04 in adjusted EPS compared to $1.63 billion and $0.21 estimates respectively.Chartwell Investment Partners shared some of the challenges that Hanesbrands Inc. (NYSE:HBI) has faced of late in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“The three worst-performing stocks in the Dividend Equity accounts includes Hanesbrands (NYSE:HBI, 1.1%), down 30.1%. Hanesbrands’ management is executing well, but the challenging environment includes supply-chain headwinds, higher input costs and some post-Covid inventory build-up.”T-6. The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 25 Hedge funds were adding The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS) to their portfolio in the first year of the pandemic, but many unloaded the stock during the third quarter of 2021. Richard S. Pzena’s Pzena Investment Management owns the largest GPS position among the funds tracked by our database, while Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management built a large stake in the company during Q3.The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS) was another fashion stock trading at bargain bin prices heading into Q4, but the stock has enjoyed a nice resurgence this quarter, gaining 76%. As noted above, high-end products tend to perform better than their counterparts during economic slowdowns, and that’s been evident at The Gap. A strong performance from the company’s Banana Republic brand, which grew comparable sales by 10% during Q3, was driven in part by the brand’s wider range of premium items.The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS)’s core brand also swung to 4% comparable sales growth after two quarters of double digit declines. All told, The Gap grew sales by 2% to $4.04 billion during Q3, which beat estimates. It was also far more profitable than analysts expected, pulling in $0.71 per share on an adjusted basis against expectations of neutral earnings.One of Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU), Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. (NYSE:ANF), and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is the top fashion stock to buy.

48,9ee600d6-fe85-3b86-8e14-502b7683bddb,MRO,2022-12-10,Top Wall Street Analyst Predicts Over 70% Rally for These 3 Energy Stocks,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-wall-street-analyst-predicts-204808346.html,1670618888,STORY,"['AR', 'NOG', 'MRO']","[Finding the right stock is the key to successful investing, but it’s never as easy as that sounds. The answer to the question, which stock to buy? is no secret, but it is hidden, in the avalanche of data that the markets produce. What’s needed is some clear signal that will cut through the noise and indicate the right stocks for the times.The quantity of data, and the sheer impossibility of parsing all of it in real time, makes a formidable barrier to successful stock picking – but Wall Street’s analysts have that part under control, which turns the question into one that’s much more manageable: which analysts to follow? The quick answer is, follow the top-ranked analysts.That will take us to Raymond James analyst John Freeman. This 5-star stock expert is a perennial dweller among the top-rated analysts contributing to the TipRanks database; the 66% success rate of his stock calls, and the 39% average return those calls would bring to investors who follow them, have Freeman standing tall among his peers on Wall Street. He's currently ranked #2 out of 8,170 analysts.In recent weeks, Freeman has picked out three stocks that he believes are primed for over 70% gains. Let’s open up the TipRanks database and get the lowdown.Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO)The first ‘Freeman pick’ we’ll look at is Marathon Oil, a $17.4 billion oil industry leader. Marathon spun off from the parent company Marathon Petroleum in 2011, to focus on hydrocarbon exploration and production operations, and since then has built its business on some of the best production regions for oil and natural gas in the US. The Texas-based company has major production activities in the Bakken, Eagle Ford, Delaware, and Stack/Scoop regions, spread from Texas to Montana.These extensive operations generated solid production numbers, the foundation of Marathon’s financial success. In Q322, the company average 295,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, with oil production making up 166,000 net barrels of that total. The company realized $2.25 billion in total revenues from that production, a total that was up 55% year-over-year.Story continuesOther financial metrics in Q3 were also solid. Net income came in at $817 million, or $1.22 per share; on an adjusted basis, these numbers were $832 million and $1.24. The adjusted EPS was up more than 217% y/y. Cash flows, which support the dividend and other shareholder returns, were also strong; Marathon had $1.556 billion in net operating cash for the quarter, and after accounting for working capital, still reported $1.44 billion in cash flow. This included $1.03 billion in adjusted free cash flow.Marathon returned $1.2 billion to shareholders during the quarter, mainly through share repurchases – but also through a modest dividend. That payment, in the last declaration, was set at 9 cents per common share for payout on December 12. This dividend annualizes to 36 cents per share, and yields a modest 1.3%; the key point in the dividend is the rapid rate at which Marathon has been raising it – since the February quarter of 2021, the dividend has been increased by 200%.Freeman sees Marathon’s strong commitment to maintaining share value – and to returning that share value to stockholders – as one of this stock’s most attractive features.“Marathon represents one of the few companies in our coverage with steady/rising per-share metrics thanks to their incredibly aggressive buyback program. 4Q22 will be the low point, with MRO stating they intend to repurchase ~$300M of stock during the quarter, representing an estimated 51% of CFFO on the year. Assuming the same payout next year, we estimate a 13% yield on buybacks and 15% total shareholder return,"" Freeman noted.""Given Marathon’s strong balance sheet, and top tier return strategy, we reiterate our Strong Buy rating,"" the top analyst summed up. That rating comes with a $48 price target that implies a one-year gain of ~82%. (To watch Freeman’s track record, click here)Overall, the Street’s consensus rating on Marathon Oil is a Moderate Buy, based on 14 recent analyst reviews that include 7 Buys, 5 Holds, and 2 Sells. The shares are priced at $26.38 and their average price target of $34.86 suggests an upside potential of ~32% on the one-year horizon. (See MRO stock forecast on TipRanks)Northern Oil and Gas (NOG)Next up is Northern Oil and Gas, an exploration and production company in the North American market. Northern focuses its operations in North Dakota and Montana, specifically in the Williston Basin, but also has activities in the Marcellus shale region of Pennsylvania and West Virginia, and in the Permian Basin on the Texas-New Mexico border.Like Marathon above, Northern’s recent Q3 results show that solid production numbers are underlying sound results. The company produced 79,123 barrel of oil equivalent per day in Q3, a company record, for a 37% increase from the year-ago period. Of the total, 57% was oil, and the rest was natural gas and natural gas products.Northern realized $276.8 million in GAAP cash flow during the quarter, with cash from operations coming in at $269.3 million. This was up 7% quarter-over-quarter, and included $110.6 million in free cash flow. The FCF was up 99% year-over-year.During Q3, Northern closed on a major acquisition in the Texas Delaware Basin. The company picked up properties from Alpha Energy Partners, for a settlement of $155.1 million in cash. This is a bolt-on acquisition, with expected production next year of 3,000 to 3,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day.For return-minded investors, we should note that Northern started paying dividends in the June quarter of last year, at 3 cents per common share; the company has increased the payment in every quarterly declaration since then, and the most recent, for 30 cents per common share, represents an increase of 20% over the last payout. The 30-cent div is scheduled for payment on January 31, 2023. At that rate, it will annualize to $1.20 and yield 3.7%.Freeman notes that Northern saw higher-than-expected capital expenditures during Q3, mainly related to the company’s recent acquisition moves. Looking ahead, he writes of Northern’s capital guidance: “NOG’s capital guidance was bumped substantially with full year up 11% to $485M at the midpoint. The bump isn’t without benefits, as net spuds increased by 3% and net wells added to production increased by 6.5%. It also stands to reason that NOG has had a bit more ground game success this year than they had forecast.""""The company has made substantial additions to wells in progress every quarter this year, from 49.1 in Q1 to 61.5 in Q3. We aren’t naive enough to think NOG will be insulated from inflationary pressures, but 5% increase in AFEs from last quarter stands up pretty well to industry peers,"" Freeman added.To this end, Freeman rates NOG a Strong Buy, while his $60 price target suggests an 85% price gain in the year ahead.Overall, Northern Oil and Gas gets a Strong Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 10 recent reviews which break down 9 to 1 in favor of Buy over Hold. With a trading price of $31.32 and an average price target of $50.30, Northern has an average upside potential of ~61% for the coming year. (See NOG stock forecast on TipRanks)Antero Resources (AR)The last stock on our list of Freeman picks is AR, or Antero Resources. This company is a natural gas producer working in the area of the upper Ohio River, in the Marcellus and Utica shale formations where Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia come together. This area, in the heart of Appalachia, has long been known as one of the richest natural gas basins in the US. Antero boasts well over half a million net acres of productive holdings, with more than 17.7 trillion cubic feet of proven natural gas reserves.The company’s net production during 3Q22 was 3.2 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas, a total that includes 171 thousand barrels per day of natural gas liquids. This brought in a net cash from operations of $1.1 billion, a free cash flow of $797 million, and a non-GAAP adjusted net income of $531 million.Antero does not pay out a dividend, but the company has a strong share buyback program – which saw the company buy back over $382 million shares during the third quarter. In Antero’s Q3 financial release, the company announced that it was increasing its buyback authorization by $1 billion, to a new total of $2 billion.In addition to supporting the share price through repurchases, Antero is also committed to reducing debt, and the company paid of $404 million during the quarter. As of September 30, Antero had $1.17 billion in outstanding debt, a total that is down nearly $1 billion so far this year.Freeman sees Antero benefiting from continued increases in natural gas demand, and his forecast for next year paints a pretty picture of the company’s prospects.“While 2023 guidance remains a quarter away, RJe 2023 production of ~3.4 Bcfe/d (~in line with Street) represents a ~5% increase y/y, which sets them apart from most of their Marcellus peers driven by both 1) increased ethane production via Shell’s Petrochemical Complex and 2) a net-gain of ~3.75% WI on each well drilled post-March 2023, following conclusion of AR’s Quantum joint venture,"" Freeman noted.""Currently,"" the analyst added, ""AR trades at just a ~3.7X forward EBITDA multiple and sports a 22% 2023 FCF yield — both best among large-caps.""Quantifying his stance, Freeman gives Antero’s stock a Strong Buy rating with a price target of $55, which indicates his confidence in a 72% upside over the next 12 months. (To watch Freeman’s track record, click here)All in all, there are 8 recent analyst reviews on file for Antero, and they include 5 Buys and 3 Holds – which gives the stock a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Meanwhile, the average price target of $50.14 implies a 57% upside from the current trading price of $31.82.

49,f159e331-ceec-3292-8693-753eed28af5c,MSFT,2022-12-10,Stan Druckenmiller Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stan-druckenmiller-portfolio-top-10-123112512.html,1670675472,STORY,"['AMZN', 'VRT', 'DDOG', 'LW', 'MSFT', 'TMUS', 'CPNG', 'KBR']","[In this article we take a look at the Stan Druckenmiller Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks. Click to skip straight to the top holdings found in the Stan Druckenmiller Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks.Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS), and Coupang, Inc. (NYSE:CPNG) are a few of the top stock picks of famed investor Stanley Druckenmiller.Stan Druckenmiller’s Duquesne Capital is a family office that primarily manages the billionaire money manager’s personal fortune, which stands at about $6.8 billion according to Forbes. Druckenmiller made his billions by being one of the most successful investors of the 1990’s and 2000’s, averaging returns of greater than 30% annually over a period spanning more than two decades.Druckenmiller is perhaps most famous for shorting the British Pound against the German Deutschmark in 1992 alongside George Soros, a trade that ended up being worth $1 billion when the Pound sank by more than 10% against the Deutschmark over a 21-day span in late September/early October 1992.Druckenmiller is again looking for stuff to short in the coming year, including stocks and the U.S. dollar, given his bearish outlook on not only the near-term state of the market, but a much longer view of it as well. At the Delivering Alpha Conference in September, Druckenmiller stated that he “would be stunned” if there isn’t a recession next year.He has an even gloomier outlook on the longer-term state of the market, claiming earlier in the year that there’s a “high probability” the market will be flat for the next decade. Druckenmiller has also conceded that this is the hardest market to forecast that he’s ever seen, given the wide ranging variables of surging inflation, rising interest rates, and the Ukraine war.There’s also the growing de-globalization trend that’s taking place in many developed countries, which have seen the perils of relying too heavily on cheaper overseas goods and are looking instead to bring more of their production capacity back home.Story continuesYou wouldn’t know Druckenmiller was as bearish on the state of things as he is given his family’s office trading activity in Q3. Duquesne Capital found plenty of stocks to buy, adding 28 new holdings to its 13F portfolio, while parting ways with just six former holdings. Three of those new additions now rank among the firm’s top ten stock picks.That quarterly buying spree raised the value of the firm’s 13F portfolio to $1.76 billion September 30, up from $1.38 billion a quarter earlier. That reversed a trend of five straight quarterly declines in the value of Duquesne’s 13F portfolio, which is still significantly smaller than it was in early 2021.Druckenmiller was further loading up on defensive stocks during the quarter, increasing his family office’s exposure to consumer discretionary and health stocks, while paring back his bets on IT, energy, and materials companies.In this article, we’ll check out the top ten stock picks in Stanley Druckenmiller’s portfolio as of September 30 to see which companies the legendary investor has conviction in during these chaotic and unpredictable times.Stan Druckenmiller Portfolio: Top 10 Stock PicksStan DruckenmillerOur MethodologyThe following data is gathered from Duquesne Capital’s latest 13F filing with the SEC. We follow hedge funds and family offices like Duquesne Capital because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q3 2022 reporting period.Stan Druckenmiller Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks10. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) Value of Duquesne Capital‘s 13F Position: $45.1 Million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 272 Coupang, Inc. (NYSE:CPNG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) are some of the top stocks found in Stanley Druckenmiller’s 13F portfolio as of September 30. Barely hanging on to a place in the top ten is Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) after Druckenmiller sold off 74% of his MSFT stake during Q3, ending the quarter with 193,535 shares. Microsoft remained the most popular stock among hedge funds during Q3 and has hovered near all-time highs in hedge fund ownership during seven of the last eight quarters.It’s somewhat surprising to see Druckenmiller sell off the majority of his Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stake given the shares are down by 27% this year and look like a good candidate for a big rebound once the current economic woes subside. Druckenmiller could see more promising near term action elsewhere though, which may have prompted the sale.Microsoft has its hands in plenty of high-growth tech fields, namely AI and the cloud, and also boasts an outstanding suite of productivity software that generates steady recurring revenue for the tech giant. Microsoft has grown its adjusted earnings per share at an impressive 17% CAGR since its fiscal 2014 year and should continue to generate double-digit growth and exceptional free cash flow in the years to come.Diamond Hill discussed Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s future outlook in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Also among our bottom contributors were media and technology giant Alphabet, software and IT services provider Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and insurance company American International Group (AIG). Microsoft shares declined in Q3, along with other tech companies, as rising interest rates impacted the near-term outlook. We expect the business to continue to generate strong revenue growth and benefit from operating leverage. Microsoft’s cloud computing services business, Azure, is generating robust growth, confirming its competitive positioning.”9. Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) Value of Duquesne Capital‘s 13F Position: $47.9 Million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 32 Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) is the first of three stocks to make this list that were added to Duquesne Capital’s 13F portfolio during Q3. The fund bought 4.93 million shares during the quarter, giving it the third-largest position in the stock among the select group of funds tracked by Insider Monkey’s database. Hedge fund ownership of Vertiv has fallen by 50% over the last two years.Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) is one of the stocks that Druckenmiller appears to have fancied in the near term more than Microsoft, and so far the investment hasn’t disappointed, as VRT shares have gained 43% in Q4. The data center equipment provider grew sales by 21% to $1.48 billion in Q3, but its profitability suffered, as its profit margin slumped by 320 basis points to 1.4% and its net income fell 62% year-over-year to $21.2 million.The Baron Small Cap Fund was bullish on Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT)’s earnings potential in the second half of this year, as noted in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Vertiv Holdings, LLC, a leading provider of critical infrastructure for data centers, fell in the quarter. The market became concerned that capital spending for data centers might be slowing along with the economy, which could be the case. If you recall, shares of Vertiv were very weak when the company reported first quarter costs were not properly passed through to their customers, so margins would fall well short of projections.We believe that Vertiv is now ahead of the curve on this and will demonstrate robust earnings power in the back half of 2022 and into next year. We think it’s a very cheap stock, with strong management and board oversight, and remain hopeful that when the company reverts to form, the shares can appreciate significantly.”8. Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) Value of Duquesne Capital‘s 13F Position: $70.1 Million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 74 Druckenmiller was loading up on more shares of Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) during Q3, raising the size of his stake by 165% to 789,175 shares. There was an 11% drop in the number of funds long DDOG during Q3, though ownership of the stock is still up by 64% over the last two years. Kathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management and Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management sold off their DDOG stakes during the third quarter.Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG), which operates a cloud-monitoring software platform for clients, is poised for strong long-term growth given the secular tailwinds in the cloud space and the increasingly complicated nature and interaction of cloud setups, which elevates the need for optimization tools like the ones Datadog provides. That’s evident by the company’s strong customer retention rate of greater than 90%. Datadog has raised its sales guidance three times this year and all told, grew revenue by 71% to $1.2 billion during the first three quarters of 2022.Baron Funds is bullish on the long-term outlook for Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG), especially given its impressive retention rate, as the fund noted in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Similarly, we continued scaling up our investment in Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG), recognizing significant opportunities for the long term, while the majority of investors remain preoccupied with the here and now. While the company may see some short-term headwinds to growth (the company reported seeing some impact to its volume-driven logs and Application Performance Management modules), long-term prospects remain bright, in our view. Datadog reported a best-in-class gross retention rate in the “mid-to-high 90s%,” 74% year-over-year revenue growth, and 21% adjusted operating margins.”7. Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW) Value of Duquesne Capital‘s 13F Position: $73.3 Million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 44 Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW) is another new addition to Druckenmiller’s 13F portfolio, with his family office adding a 946,800-share position in the company to its portfolio. The number of funds long LW has risen by 38% over the last year. In the third quarter, Noam Gottesman’s GLG Partners and David Zorub’s Parsifal Capital Management added LW to their 13F portfolios.Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW) has been able to counter inflationary pressures to its input, manufacturing, and transportation costs by greatly improving its price/mix, which jumped by 19% during Q1 of the company’s 2023 fiscal year. Those efforts were particularly strong in the company’s retail segment, which surged its price/mix by 32%. The company believes it’s on track to deliver on the high-end of its FY23 guidance, which calls for $4.7 to $4.8 billion in sales and $2.45 to $2.85 in diluted EPS.Carillon Tower noted that strong pricing actions have helped Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW) through some recent challenges, as the fund pointed out in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW) supplies frozen potato products globally to the restaurant and food retail industries. Just as demand began to recover from pandemic shutdowns last year, an unusually small potato harvest exacerbated an inflationary cost environment. Pricing actions have been effective in recent quarters, driving margin recovery and boosting earnings.”6. KBR, Inc. (NYSE:KBR) Value of Duquesne Capital‘s 13F Position: $78.5 Million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 41 Closing out the first half of Stanley Druckenmiller’s top ten holdings is KBR, Inc. (NYSE:KBR), which the money manager raised his stake in by 40% during Q3, ending the quarter with 1.82 million shares. KBR hit an all-time high in hedge fund ownership during Q2 before that figure dipped slightly in Q3. Lauren Taylor Wolfe’s Impactive Capital and Matt Sirovich and Jeremy Mindich’s Scopia Capital are two of the stock’s biggest bulls.KBR, Inc. (NYSE:KBR), a Houston-based technology company, has been awarded two notable contracts in recent weeks, including a $157 million Department of Defense project to upgrade U.S. Army helicopters, which is one of at least three DoD contracts the company has been awarded this year. KBR expects its government solutions work to continue to be strong next year, citing comments from President Biden that defense spending would receive a boost in the 2023 budget.KBR, Inc. (NYSE:KBR) was also awarded a contract from CrossWind to provide engineering solutions for the joint venture’s Hollandse Kust wind farm off the coast of the Netherlands. Bank of America analyst Mariana Perez Mora is bullish on the transformation of KBR’s portfolio, including its growing defense exposure. The analyst has a ‘Buy’ rating and $65 price target on KBR shares.See where T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS), Coupang, Inc. (NYSE:CPNG), and Amazon.com, Inc.

It was the front page of the Boston Globe,"" said Dr. Taha Kass-Hout.He would know. Kass-Hout had just joined the CDC, mid-outbreak, as director of Health Informatics Solutions and Operations. He began building out a surveillance system, on Amazon (AMZN) Web Services, that still exists today.""It's the same system used as a front line for COVID,"" Kass-Hout, now chief medical officer of AWS, told Yahoo Finance in a recent interview.That same system now covers 93% of the U.S. population, compared to a system that only covered 8% back in 2009, he said. With some updates, of course.CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky explained the additional rapid build out to meet the pandemic demand in 2020.""When we began collecting data on Covid cases, only a handful of health facilities were capable — even capable — of sending electronic case reports,"" Walensky said at the Bloomberg American Health Summit.Now, more than 20,000 facilities can do so in almost real time. But that only represents 22% of all hospitals registered at the federal level.Kass-Hout, now in a leading role at the largest cloud computing company — with a third of market share, said what started during the Obama administration at the federal level to incorporate more technology in government is now also being seen at state and local levels too.Attendees walk through an expo hall at AWS re:Invent 2022, a conference hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS), in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S., November 30, 2022. Noah Berger/AWS/Handout via REUTERS REUTERS THIS IMAGE HAS BEEN SUPPLIED BY A THIRD PARTY. MANDATORY CREDITBoth the FDA and CDC rely on AWS, as does the U.K.'s National Health Service, according to Kass-Hout, who previously served as the FDA's chief technology officer and first chief health informatics officer in 2013.The Minnesota Health Department also built up a governor's COVID-19 notification system ""in a matter of weeks on AWS"" without having to invest in additional technologies, Kass-Hout said.Story continuesOn the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, COVID hit just as the U.K. was withdrawing from the European Union. Residents were anxious about their health coverage and how the National Health Services (NHS) would operate in a post-Brexit world.AWS was able to help buoy an overworked call center staff, struggling with labor shortages as more employees got sick with Covid, by building up an intelligent call center that could answer some of the most frequently asked questions about coverage and, later on, about vaccines and treatments, Kass-Hout explained.It's a few paces behind ChatGPT, the natural language bot which recently captured public attention, but the real use case brings back the potential for the technology after it soured in the years after IBM Watson's decline.Industry buy-inBut it wasn't just governments that benefitted this time. Moderna (MRNA) relied on a program built on AWS, to determine the right COVID vaccine candidate, and Pfizer (PFE) and AstraZeneca (AZN) have similarly been using AWS, according to Kass-Hout.And that trend is on the rise as more life sciences companies adapt to the cloud beyond simply storing data. In fact, early stage AI modules are already being deployed to help find new treatments.""The R&amp;D is a really healthy environment where they want to experiment more. They want to try to kind of go after new indication, understand the biology more,"" Kass-Hout said.Insurers, or payers, are another segment of the health industry interested in using cloud technology. Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield, which now operates as Elevance Health (ELV), is one example of that.""They have a lot of data accumulating on members for years on end. And a lot of this data is unstructured in nature,"" Kass-Hout said.""If you look at the benefits, 90% of the data is scanned PDFs and faxes or something,"" he said.It's an obstacle the industry has known about and discussed for some time. With AWS, the company can use a text extractor and save the information into a digital file — a process that is now almost 90% automated, Kass-Hout said.""Something that used to take weeks, now they can do it in a matter of hours,"" Kass-Hout said, noting this will also help speed up the billing process.""It's really great to see how innovation's happening where you don't have to be a technologist,"" and can still benefit from technology while serving patient populations, he said.The technology isn't new, but it hasn't been leveraged in appropriate ways and new projects often fall to the wayside, according to a 2021 McKinsey report.""Cloud capabilities have the potential to generate value of $100 billion to $170 billion in 2030 for healthcare companies. The major driver of this value lies in enabling them to more effectively innovate (for example, new use cases in analytics, IoT, and automation), digitize (for example, stakeholder journey transformation), and realize their strategic objectives,"" the report said.Kass-Hout says that health care has always been a target for the technology, as a nearly $8 trillion global industry.""I do believe in the next five to 10 years, almost every health care company will be in the cloud,"" he said.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

I'd like to turn the conference over to Vinnie Sinisi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.

Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly update forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gina.Virginia Drosos: Thank you, Vinny, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I want to begin by thanking the entire Signet team for a standout quarter in a challenging retail environment. Their passion for rising to every challenge and opportunity is inspiring. I'm particularly pleased that our Signet team was recognized this quarter by Fortune as one of the top 20 best workplaces in retail. This is a great reflection of the purpose, pride, and excellence, our team members bring to our customers every day. I'm proud to lead this exceptional team. There's one core message that I want you to take away from today's call. Signet is uniquely positioned to deliver consistent market share growth and value creation. Given our number one and growing leadership position in jewelry, an industry that tends to grow steadily from year to year and is more resilient to economic cycles than other parts of retail.Story continuesWe've established our strong position in this attractive industry over the past five years by making significant strategic pivots that are now creating a virtuous flywheel effect with compounding advantages that are accelerating positive momentum and grow. First, we've created a differentiated portfolio of banners that appeals to a broad, diverse and growing mix of customers. Second, we've established a connected commerce presence that is resetting customer expectations for the experience they want to have when shopping for buying and owning fine jewelry. Third, we've built a flexible operating model that gives us multiple levers to pull so we can deliver our commitments even when faced with challenging economic or market conditions. And fourth, we are executing a disciplined capital allocation strategy that is delivering meaningful value creation.It's focused first on expanding market share growing the top line and consistently delivering double-digit annual operating margin. Since the beginning of our transformation in fiscal 2019, we've invested nearly $700 million in capital and over $900 million in acquisitions, far beyond any company in the industry. On the strength of these investments, we've accelerated growth and returned more than $1.3 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We saw the benefits of this flywheel effect again in the third quarter. We beat expectations and are now raising full year guidance inclusive of Blue Nile. Revenue was nearly $1.6 billion, up 2.9% versus a year ago and up 33% compared to prepandemic levels. We generated non-GAAP operating income of $58 million, a strong result in a quarter that saw onetime COVID and supply chain induced benefits last year, but consistently lost money prior.In fact, Q3 fiscal 20 suffered operating losses of nearly $30 million. And we delivered non-GAAP operating margin ahead of expectations for the quarter. This improvement was largely driven by the positive impact of services, the health of our inventory and strategic assortment choices, including tiering up, value engineering and balanced pricing. We achieved this despite Blue Nile losses, which we anticipated and more than covered without impacting our core businesses or distracting us from disciplined execution. Now even in a challenging environment, we're heading into holiday with multiple points of strength. First, we're well stocked with significant newness and great value at all price points. And most importantly, we are not overstocked like much of retail.In fact, our inventory was down 2% in the quarter, excluding acquisitions, and with clearance at the lowest levels in recent history is healthier than it's been since our transformation began roughly 5 years ago. We've tiered up our assortment and nearly 30% of our assortment is new for holiday. Since Q3 fiscal 20, our inventory is down 17%, excluding acquisitions, with sell-down and clearance penetration down 13 points. In addition to being well stocked, we're well staffed. A key driver of our staffing strength is retention. At Kay, for example, staff turnover is 17% lower than it was last year. This ensures we have more experienced consultants on the floor, an important factor because consultants with at least 2 years of experience in our stores sell 2x more than consultants who've been with us for 6 months or less.And we're able to optimize labor costs by adjusting staffing plans dynamically in response to changing retail traffic. Using our proprietary store level data, we can flex to optimize coverage by hour when and where we need it, without being under or overstaffed. As a result, our sales per labor hour are up more than 70% versus fiscal 20. We're still facing macroeconomic headwinds and consumers' behaviors can be somewhat volatile, but we're compared to this. Our flexible operating model is designed to sustain our financial commitments even in the face of these challenges. We are ready for strong holiday execution. Now I'd like to provide perspective on where we're headed longer term, and why Signet is so well positioned to deliver consistent market share growth and value creation year-over-year.My confidence in our long-term growth is grounded in both the attractiveness of the jewelry industry itself and in Signet's strong leadership position within the industry. Jewelry is different from the rest of retail. For example, cyclical industries like apparel, are more sensitive to economic volatility. Carry inventory was a relatively low residual value and sell products that consumers see as more discretionary. Conversely, customers place to higher value on jewelry. They see jewel repurchases as less discretionary because they're tied to special occasions and people in their lives, and jewelry retains its value or appreciates over time. In addition, jewelry doesn't go out of style from season to season. This makes jewelry more resilient and as a result, more attractive than many other retail industries.It's an industry well designed for sustainable long-term growth. And Signet has an advantageous position in this attractive industry. Jewelry rewards the flywheel effect I described, which is a point of difference for Signet. Inventory is a good example. Over the past 5 years, we have transformed the way we plan, manage and optimize inventory. We operate today with a disciplined, tightly integrated approach. First, we leverage our vendor relationships and purchasing scale to ensure quality and availability while managing cash and protecting margins. Second, we consumer test our assortments with the most advanced AI and data analytics capability in the industry. We believe our proprietary product concept testing capability is improving our new product success rate, enabling us to bring bigger ideas to market with greater confidence in speed.Third, we provide unrivaled inventory depth and transparency to both customers and our jewelry consultants. Customers can work with our virtual and in-store consultants to find, see and purchase individual pieces across our multi-banner ecosystem. And finally, we provide a whole range of flexible fulfillment options, including buy online pick up in store, ship to store, curbside pickup, same-day delivery and now more than 25,000 secure consumer access clients. After launching the program just 2 years ago, customers are opting for a flexible fulfillment option in over 38% of online orders. These capabilities not only benefit our customers but also minimize stranded inventory across our fleet. Taken together, this holistic approach to inventory design, management and delivery is a significant competitive advantage.And it has driven significant inventory productivity gains with our core turns of 1.5x now nearly twice with a world we began our transformation. I'd like to turn now to progress we have made in the quarter on our four where to play focus areas. Let's start with winning in big businesses. A good illustration is how we are growing market share and winning in bridal. It's the most important segment in fine jewelry, not only because of its high relative value, but also because bridal is the point of market entry for jewelry lifetime value. It's the emotional and financial moment when long-term relationships are established between co'ples and with their jewelry consultants. 35% of new customers during Q3 made their first purchase of Signet through bridal.And over the past three years, roughly a third of bridal engagement customers have returned for subsequent non-engagement purchases, winning bands, fashion jewelry, statement pieces and gifts. This is a more than 40% higher repurchase rate versus non-bridal customers, and average transaction value of their second purchase has increased, up 23% compared to three years ago. We have also continued to widen our customer funnel with Diamond Direct and Blue Nile, to very strategic acquisitions that focus in bridal and have brought younger more affluent and more diverse customers to our business. The good news is that, overtime bridal is not cyclical. Engagements, weddings and anniversaries happen consistently year in and year out. COVID is presenting what is a first meaningful lift in engagement ring purchases in the past four decades.Calendar year 2021 represented a 40 year peak in engagements, which is being somewhat offset in 2022 and 2023, both expected to be down low double-digits. We anticipated this blip in consumer dynamics and positioned ourselves to increase our share of bridal and lean into fashion and gifting. As engagements return to more normalized levels, we will be especially well-positioned given that maximizing lifetime value is an ongoing priority for us and a playbook that we are running across our entire business. Accelerating services is our second strategic focus area. As we said, we see services as a $1 billion business over time, and we're continuing to make steady progress toward that goal. The success of our loyalty program, Vault Rewards is a good example.We already have 1 million Vault Rewards members in just the first year of the program. Our program is especially powerful, but if we're the only jewelry retailer that can offer this type of holistic loyalty approach across multiple banners and versus other specialty retail, we provide high value, given the very nature of what we sell, particularly for the engagement and bridal experience. Jared was the first to roll this out in the first half of fiscal '23, and now has more than 30% of sales coming from its loyalty members.  and sales followed with rollouts during the third quarter and are already seeing more than 25% of sales coming from loyalty members. In addition, loyalty members are spending 40% more per repeat purchase than non-royalty customers on average, and they are making second purchases 25% faster.In repair, we simplified our offerings with bundles that combine typical repair services. This improves both the customer and the employee experience by simplifying the offer and the operation. Earlier this year, bundles represented about 15% of our repair business. Today, 65% of paid repairs are part of a bundle. This is encouraging because bundles drive margin through AUR, which was up 18% versus a year ago. With this success, we have further opportunity for growth. Our research indicates that only 40% of people who shop in malls even know that our banners do repairs. We see upside potential and have doubled our marketing spend on services versus a year ago, which is helping drive growth and customer awareness. Our third, where to play strategy is to expand accessible luxury and value.Accessible luxury continues to grow in importance. This top end of our market now represents approximately 30% of our business up nearly 10 percentage points versus the pre pandemic period. The shift toward higher price products is being driven by a combination of factors, our database ability to attract higher income customers, the appeal of our high value assortment and ability to trade customers up the value chain, and our price architecture. We've also added Diamonds Direct and Blue Nile, both of which have a strong presence in accessible luxury contributing to the increase these factors are working. We're seeing spending at higher price points in all our categories, engagement, anniversary, and wedding bands and fashion. Overall, North America average transaction value increased 8% compared to last year and is up 27% versus pre pandemic.We're equally committed to serve customers at the value end of the market. This is the cohort that is most impacted by economic pressures, and we want to ensure we are providing them with superior value as part of our portfolio strategy. To do this, we continue to innovate within our assortment to cut costs customers don't see or care about, and to provide a breadth of financing options for every budget. Leading in digital is our fourth strategy. We are now delivering a digital data driven connected commerce experience that is unrivaled in jewelry. One of the biggest differences in Signet today versus five years ago is the mix of customers we serve. We've added 22.5 million new customers since fiscal '19. As a result, our customer base is significantly stronger today than it was five years ago.It's younger, more multicultural, more affluent, more digitally savvy, and more demanding in terms of total customer experience. No other jewelry company is as well positioned as Signet to meet these expectations. In recognition of this shift, we are continuing to enhance our digital capabilities and offerings. We introduce two-way SMS just over a year ago, for example, and it now represents 14% of our digital support contacts year-to-date. In Q3 alone, 23% of all contacts were through our SMS channel. This matters after texting with a jewelry expert. Conversion is more than 15x higher than a typical e-commerce purchase. Interestingly, 60% of these purchases are made online and 40% are made in store. We also know that net promoter scores are typically 15 points higher when a customer shops with one of our virtual consultants.We've enabled social selling by equipping our jewelry consultants to curate personalized digital style guides and use them as a way to reach out to customers with client  support driving both digital sales and store traffic. Customers can browse and buy directly from the file guides that connect directly via chat, SMS, or social platforms. We also know that virtual appointments booked online have more than doubled since last year, and sales attributed to virtual JCs have grown 150%. Customers who engage in a virtual appointment convert 12x more than those who don't, and AOV is nearly 3x more. We're also adding enhancements specifically focused on mobile conversion because 87% of our website traffic is now coming from mobile devices. We see digital as much more than a standalone e-commerce capability.The power of digital is the ability it gives us to create a seamless connected commerce capability that no one in jewelry can match. The final point I want to underscore is the strength of our financial position, which enables so much of the progress we're making. Disciplined cost management and our flexible operating model allow us to invest strategically in our core business and in acquisitions to expand market share, maintain appropriate levels of leverage, and return cash to shareholders through repurchases and dividends with a goal of becoming a dividend growth company. So to recap, jewelry is an attractive industry and we are in an advantageous position within this industry. It's analogous to being the best house in a great neighborhood, and given our compounding advantages, we're growing share and investing in growth well ahead of the industry, which positions us for sustainable value creation.As important as our financial health is, it's only part of our story. As I said at the outset, the most important part of our success and of my confidence in our future is our culture of innovation and agility, powered by rigorous executional discipline. Our team continues to rise to every challenge and to go after every opportunity to serve our customers, grow our business, and lead our industry. We have built many advantages that set us apart in the jewelry industry and in retail. But none is as important as the caliber of our people and the culture in which they are thriving. On that note, I'll turn it over to Joan.See also 13 Best Bear Market Stocks To Buy and 15 Biggest Bike Companies in the World.Joan Hilson: Thanks, Gina, and good morning, everyone. Our key message is that Signet is uniquely positioned among retailers to deliver consistent returns. We're doing this by growing market share, expanding margins and optimizing our balance sheet, all of which lead to long-term value creation. We are committed to delivering double-digit annual operating margin, which we're able to do with our flexible operating structure even when the top line environment is challenging. Beyond, we are continuing to take advantage of our balance sheet strength to consistently invest in our growth while returning cash to shareholders. Before turning to the quarter, I'd like to share some additional perspective on our recent acquisition of Blue Nile.This acquisition is a great example of our ability to be agile as market share growth opportunities emerge. Our balance sheet strength and our ability to generate cash enables us to step in at the right time for the right assets at the right price. We've now been working with the Blue Nile team for just over 90 days. We see significant opportunities to maximize value by bringing together Blue Nile and James Allen, our 2 digitally native banners. This combination is driving prior synergies that we anticipated at the time of acquisition. We also see top line and margin opportunity by leveraging assortment, price architecture, data analytics and the integration of our merchandising capability. Importantly, Blue Nile enables us to grow our share in bridal with a slightly higher price mix and a demographic that is different and additive to the top of our customer funnel.With all of this in mind, we are reaffirming our full year non-GAAP operating margin of 10.8%. Even with the dilutive impact of Blue Nile, which is offset by a greater line of sight into the efficiencies we see in our core business. Now turning to the quarter. We exceeded the high end of our revenue guidance, excluding Blue Nile, despite a more than $20 million drag on the top line from the sharp decline of the pound and the Canadian dollar. On the bottom line, we exceeded the high end of guidance even with the impact of Blue Nile, which operated at a loss during the quarter. We delivered profitability during a historically challenging quarter and despite a negative high single-digit comp. In the 2 years prior to the pandemic, we had losses in Q3.We've reset that trend. Our results are a meaningful shift from pre-pandemic levels and reflects the impact of our always-on marketing, rigorous cost discipline and even earlier preparation for holiday. For the quarter, we delivered total sales of $1.6 billion, up 2.9% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, we were up 4.2%. Same-store sales were down 7.6%, which was attributable to consumer behavior shifts and macroeconomic pressure. Roughly half of the comp decline was attributable to lower price points, including Banter, which was down roughly 30%. We saw our strongest performance at higher price points. Our average transaction value in North America was up 8% in Q3, which reflects our mix shift to higher price points as we broaden our reach into accessible luxury with more targeted customer acquisitions, tiered on assortment and price architecture.We also raised prices selectively as needed in response to inflationary pressures and we'll be closely with our vendors to ensure we can deliver the best pricing and value in the industry. Our fleet reflects our transitioning to higher price points as well. Sales for the quarter were up 33% compared to Q3 of FY 20 with roughly 450 fewer stores, which translates into a 45% increase in sales per square foot versus the pre-pandemic period. This is a result of a much stronger footprint we've established over the past few years. We have decreased our exposure to C malls by almost 20 points, and we've increased the off-mall stores to almost 40% of our fleet. Turning now to services. North America revenue in Q3 increased roughly 8% on a year-over-year basis and nearly 16% versus FY 20.This growth was driven by increased awareness of our services offering and the success of service bundle. As we continue to improve attachments on warranty and repair, we are seeing both meaningful margin contribution and an increase in return visits. Even better services margin is over 20% higher than merchandise margin. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 35.2% of sales, down 220 basis points on a year-over-year basis. This reflects the expected impact of Diamond's Direct and Blue Nile, both of which carry a lower relative margin due to the higher bio mix. Merchandise margin in our organic banners improved versus last year. This is a direct result of our disciplined inventory management, flexible fulfillment capabilities and higher-margin services partially offset by the deleverage of store fixed costs.Non-GAAP SG&amp;A in Q3 was roughly $500 million or 31.4% of sales, deleveraged 80 basis points compared to last year but 215 basis points better than Q3 FY 20. This was primarily driven by strategic investments in IT and digital, and our flexible oprating model enabled us to partially minimize the impact of a negative high single-digit comp on labor and other variable costs under our control. Non-GAAP operating income was $58 million or 3.7% of sales. We continue to demonstrate the positive impact of the structural changes in our business. Our Q3 non-GAAP operating margin is more than 600 basis points higher than it was during the third quarter of FY 20, and we had an operating loss of 2.5%. Now let's turn to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $330 million in cash and equivalents on hand.Since the end of Q2, we returned cash to shareholders through December 2, up $52 million in share repurchases or nearly 1 million shares, along with common dividend of $18 million, and we completed the cash purchase of Blue Nile. Further, our leverage ratio on a trailing 12-month basis currently stand at approximately 2x EBITDA, well below our previously stated goal of below 2.75x and down 50% from Q3 of FY 20. Our capital investments are also an important differentiator. As an example, since we began our transformation, we have spent more than $300 million in strategic, digital and technology investments, a significant part of the $700 million of capital that we've invested in total. We have also invested in standard differentiation through the continued expansion of foundry and the freshness of our fleet.Looking forward, we expect capital investments this year of up to $250 million, down from our previous expectations, reflecting the impact of external supply chain constraints. We continue to buy back shares and have $570 million remaining in our authorization as of December 2. This reflects our belief that Signet's stock is significantly undervalued. The resilience of the jewelry industry and the disciplined execution of our strategies give us confidence that the market will soon recognize our unique ability in the jewelry industry to generate consistent shareholder returns. I'll close with our financial guidance for fiscal 23, which reflects current business trends and the inclusion of Blue Nile. Black Friday weekend was encouraging and met our expectations with our biggest Cyber Monday in our history.We are seeing shifts in consumer purchasing talents that indicate many consumers are waiting until later in the season to complete their shopping. We anticipate the strength in our assortment units will persist. Customers will continue to purchase at higher price points, and our holiday readiness will enable us to be there for customers with the product fulfillment options and value they expect. At the same time, we know that economic pressures and concerns will continue to exist. Foreign currency is expected to remain a headwind and our digitally native brands are likely to continue seeing the consumer shift back to store through holiday. We're approaching Q4 with a healthy balance of confidence and conservatism. Confidence driven by our overperformance in Q3, the inclusion of Blue Nile, our readiness for holiday and the strength of our operating model, and in an appropriate level of conservatism that reflects consumer and macroeconomic variables beyond our control.Keeping this in mind and reflecting current business trends, we are raising fourth quarter revenue guidance in the range of $2.59 billion to $2.66 billion, partially offset by the expected headwind related to the sharp decline of the British pound and Canadian dollar. We expect non-GAAP operating income guidance for the quarter in the range of $363 million to $404 million. Our guidance does not include a worsening of macroeconomic factors. Compared to last year, Q4 guidance includes merchandise margin expansion, reflecting strength in our assortment architecture and inventory health. In addition, we continue to leverage efficient labor and advertising model, along with the flexibility to support further Q4 promotion. We are raising fiscal 23 diluted EPS guidance to $11.40 to $12 per share, including the Q3 beat and the impact of share repurchases through December 2.Quarter after quarter, I continue to be inspired not only by our team's dedication to customers but also by their strong sense of accountability to shareholders. They are both agile and discipline, which shows us time and again in our results that matter of the environment we're in. With that, we're happy to take your questions.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

65,04633cd2-3a8a-371f-8467-38147baa8742,ADM,2022-12-10,5 Top Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy Amid Volatility,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-top-dividend-growth-stocks-124412798.html,1670589852,STORY,['ADM'],"[The year 2022 has been marked by huge volatility and uncertainty as high inflation, the Fed’s policy tightening and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continue to weigh on investor sentiment. This has raised the appeal of dividend investing. Though the strategy doesn’t offer dramatic price appreciation, it is a major source of consistent income for investors in any type of market.In fact, stocks with a strong history of year-over-year dividend growth form a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those that have high yields. We have selected five dividend growth stocks — Archer-Daniels-Midland Company ADM, Deere &amp; Company DE, Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation BAH, Agilent Technologies A, and Boyd Gaming Corporation BYD — that could be compelling picks amid volatility.Inside Dividend Growth StrategyStocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a dividend increase is likely in the future.Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appears as a winning strategy when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenues.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3-5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&amp;P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&amp;P 500 over the past year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environments.Growth Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to just 21.Here are five of the 21 stocks that fit the bill:Illinois-based Archer-Daniels is one of the leading producers of food and beverage ingredients as well as goods made from various agricultural products. ADM has an expected earnings growth rate of 44.3% for this year and delivered an average earnings surprise of 26.22%.Archer-Daniels has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of A.

MNST.Industry: Soft DrinksLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2026628/5-soft-drink-stocks-gearing-up-to-grab-a-share-of-industry-boomThe Zacks Beverages – Soft Drinks industry is showing resilience on the recovery across markets, share gains in at-home and away-from-home channels, improved pricing and continued innovation. Accelerating digital investments also bode well. Companies are expected to gain from expansion into newer categories, including capturing market share in the Ready-to-Drink (RTD) category. Players like The Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo Inc., Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V., Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. and Monster Beverage Corp. are well-poised on robust innovation efforts.However, industry players are witnessing continued pressure from higher supply-chain costs, including transportation and commodity costs, particularly steel and aluminum. The companies’ actions, including price increases, reducing reliance on imported cans and moving production closer to markets, are poised to combat these headwinds. Elevated operating expenses related to increased spending on marketing and advertising to capture a share are likely to strain margins in the near term.About the IndustryThe Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry comprises companies that manufacture, source, develop, market and sell non-alcoholic beverages. Soft drinks mainly include sparkling drinks, natural juices, enhanced water, sports and energy drinks as well as dairy, RTD tea and coffee beverages. Notably, some industry players like PepsiCo produce and sell handy food with flavored snacks, which complement their beverage portfolio.The companies sell products through a network of wholesalers and retailers that include supermarkets, department stores, mass merchandisers, club stores and other retail outlets. Some also offer products via company-owned or controlled bottling, independent bottling partners and partner brand owners.Story continuesWhat's Shaping the Future of Beverages - Soft Drinks Industry?Evolving Trends: Companies in the soft drinks space have been gaining from improved demand trends, which are aiding volume growth. Market share gains in at-home and away-from-home channels, owing to recovery across markets, have been boosting sales. Implementing price increases to overcome the ongoing cost pressures has significantly lifted sales in recent quarters.The soft drinks industry has transformed as health consciousness, personal well-being, natural ingredients, varied flavors and better taste experiences are changing consumers’ consumption patterns. Companies in the industry are expected to benefit from the expansion into newer and adjacent categories, including capturing market share in the fast-growing RTD alcoholic beverage category through collaborations. RTD has emerged as the fastest-growing category since 2018. The industry players are also exploring CBD-infused drinks, which have been gaining popularity lately.Innovation &amp; Digital Growth: The soft drinks industry is poised to gain from innovations and accelerating digital investments. The companies have been optimizing their portfolio, focusing on core brands and investments in innovation to meet the evolving needs of consumers. The players remain committed to product launches and innovation to boost growth.Further, expansion into newer markets has been a key focus for soft drink makers to boost market share.

They have been expanding digital offerings and investing in loyalty programs and fintech platforms to capture online demand. The investments are likely to position soft drink companies for long-term growth.Raw Material Cost Inflation and Supply Constraints: The beverage industry is plagued with higher supply-chain costs, including higher commodity input costs and transportation expenses. Raw material cost inflation, particularly steel and aluminum, has increased packaging costs. The ongoing supply constraints in the aluminum can industry have been other headwinds.The companies are also witnessing delays in procuring certain ingredients, both domestically and internationally, leading to shortages of some goods. The industry players have been facing freight inefficiencies and significant increases in domestic and international freight costs. Logistic issues, higher input costs and freight inefficiencies have resulted in higher costs of sales and operating expenses, impacting gross and operating margins. Most players expect commodity cost inflation and higher transportation costs to persist in the near term.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Beverages - Soft Drinks industry is housed within the broader Consumer Staples sector.

(GS) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-group-inc-gs-140002158.html,1670594402,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD']","[Goldman Sachs (GS) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this investment bank have returned -5.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.5% change. The Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, to which Goldman belongs, has gained 0.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Goldman is expected to post earnings of $6.80 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -37.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.6%.The consensus earnings estimate of $33.53 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -43.6%. This estimate has changed +0.5% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $37.95 indicates a change of +13.2% from what Goldman is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Goldman is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for GS _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Goldman, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $11 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -13%. For the current and next fiscal years, $47.77 billion and $51.32 billion estimates indicate -19.5% and +7.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryGoldman reported revenues of $11.98 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -12%. EPS of $8.25 for the same period compares with $14.93 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.26 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.37%. The EPS surprise was +10.44%.Over the last four quarters, Goldman surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Goldman is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Goldman. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

On the Wells Fargo side, analyst Steve Cahall, he cited profitability should improve with the addition of the ad-supported tier. He upgraded shares from equal weight to overweight, also upped his price target to $400 a share from 300.In addition to that, we have that crackdown on password sharing. That should help aid revenue and be a catalyst for growth moving forward.

The company will explore high-potential locations across the country for renewables as part of the survey.Egypt has exceptional renewable energy assets. BP invested more than $35 billion in the country over the years. The company operates the West Nile Delta gas development. It also has a strong presence in the East Nile Delta through its Pharaonic Petroleum Company, joint venture and other partners’ operating assets. The company currently produces about 70% of Egypt’s gas.Hydrogen is considered one of BP’s five energy transition growth drivers. The company is engaged in a portfolio of options for developing green and blue hydrogen projects in advantaged markets globally. This includes potential developments in the U.K., the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, the Middle East, the United States and Australia.Green hydrogen is expected to play a key role in transitioning from hydrocarbons to more sustainable alternatives. It is produced by the electrolysis of water, powered by renewable energy.Expanding its business scope in Egypt validates BP’s long-term commitment to the country. The MoU depends on Egypt’s attempt to be a regional energy hub and support the country’s energy transition plans.Last month, BP signed another MoU with the government of Mauritania to explore the potential for green hydrogen production in the country.

Prosecutors said he placed deceptive orders for silver futures and lied about it to investigators.Jordan's attorney, James Benjamin, called the verdict disappointing and said Jordan is ""a good and honorable man who did his job in good faith.""Jordan was indicted in 2019 along with former JPMorgan global precious metals desk head Michael Nowak, precious metals trader Gregg Smith and salesperson Jeffrey Ruffo.The case was the U.S. Justice Department's most aggressive to date targeting spoofing, charging the four defendants with violating the racketeering statute, a law enacted in 1970 to take down the mafia.Nowak, Smith and Ruffo were acquitted of racketeering and conspiracy, though Nowak and Smith were convicted on multiple other charges at a jury trial in August. Prosecutors then dropped racketeering and conspiracy charges against Jordan.JPMorgan agreed in 2020 to pay more than $920 million and admitted to wrongdoing to settle with the Justice Department and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over its traders' conduct.

The real was last down 0.3%, after falling as much as 1.4% during the session. Lula, who is set to take office in January, also announced other cabinet picks after appointing former Sao Paulo Mayor Haddad, ending days of speculation about his ministerial appointments. The choice of Haddad was in line with expectations. Haddad can be portrayed as a pragmatic politician given his educational qualification and political experience, said Mauricio Une, head of South America macro strategy at Rabobank. ""I believe the market would now like to understand who Haddad will invite into his ministry and help him design economic policies."" The real's move helped it pare weekly losses to below 1%. It had jumped 3.6% last week. Data showed Brazil's consumer prices rose 0.41% in November, below market forecasts of 0.53%. ""Brazil is the world's #1 disinflation success story,"" said Natalia Gurushina, emerging markets fixed income economist at VanEck, in a note. Some other emerging market currencies fell, with South Africa's rand and Mexico's peso down about 0.9% each as the dollar cut losses after the U.S. Labor Department reported that producer prices rose more than expected last month on an annual basis. This increased hawkish anticipation for the Federal Reserve's much anticipated meeting next month where bets are that the Fed would opt for a smaller interest rate hike following four 75 basis point hikes. Mexico's peso is on course for a drop of nearly 2% on the week, in what could be its sharpest decline in four months. Top copper producer Chile's peso added 0.3% against the dollar, supported by firm copper prices as investors anticipated that China's easing of coronavirus restrictions will boost economic growth and metals demand. Peruvian markets were closed. President Dina Boluarte said she was willing to discuss early elections with the country's political and civil organizations, but ruled out kick-starting constitutional changes for the time being. Latam stocks fell 0.4% on Friday and were down 3.4% for the week, sharply underperforming their broader EM peers. However, Brazil's Bovespa jumped 0.6% with materials being the biggest boost.

While Canada is home of some the largest deposits of critical minerals, it can take anywhere between five and 25 years for a mining project to become operational, the document said.""We recognize that, although responsible regulations are vital, complex regulatory and permitting processes can hinder the economic competitiveness of the sector and increase investment risk for proponents,"" the document reads.As the world shifts to cleaner technologies, demand for critical minerals is expected to skyrocket. Many in the mining industry have said the bureaucracy is too slow and is holding up investment.Story continues""What has been the tendency over many years is that the requirements just keep ballooning and you end up with impact assessment reports (for new mines) that are thousands of pages long,"" said Pierre Gratton, president and chief executive of the Mining Association of Canada, adding that he welcomed a review of the permitting process.""We're not looking for yet another overhaul of the federal regime. We're looking at opportunities to implement existing requirements more expeditiously. ... There are definitely opportunities to speed things up,"" he said.China dominates the market for critical minerals used in EV batteries.Countries like the United States, Canada, Australia, India and Japan want to wean themselves from their dependence on authoritarian regimes for strategically important materials.'EVERYONE WANTS A PIECE OF CANADA'Canada signed a joint action plan with the United States in 2020 to advance secure supply chains for critical minerals. It has signed similar critical minerals cooperation agreements with Japan and the European Union.""I've talked to the Americans more in the last few years than I had ever talked to them in my entire career, and also Europeans,"" Gratton said. ""Everyone wants a piece of Canada right now, and they keep knocking on our door.""The new strategy lays out priorities along the entire critical-mineral value chain, from exploration and mining to recycling old batteries, and it also covers the need for new infrastructure in often remote corners of the country.Ottawa will seek ""regulatory harmonization"" with the United States on critical minerals, the document reads without elaborating.Ottawa's strategy prioritizes developing lithium, graphite, nickel, cobalt, copper and rare earth elements. At the same time, Canada is offering a 30% tax credit to spur exploration for nickel, lithium, cobalt, graphite, copper, rare earth elements, vanadium and uranium.

For the week, the index was down 2.6%, its biggest weekly decline since September.Wall Street also fell as investors awaited a potential 50-basis point interest rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve when it makes its policy decision on Wednesday.""You have this balancing act that the Fed and the Bank of Canada need to do, to bring down the economy slowly to bring down inflation, but don't bring it down too much where the whole country goes into a deep recession,"" said Allan Small, senior investment advisor of the Allan Small Financial Group with iA Private Wealth.The Bank of Canada will likely need to keep interest rates at or above 4% for most of 2023 to cool an overheated economy and tame high inflation, the International Monetary Fund said.The Toronto market's energy sector fell 0.7% as U.S. crude oil futures settled 0.6% lower at $71.02 a barrel. That took oil's losses for the week to roughly 11%.An outage at TC Energy's Keystone pipeline could affect inventories at a key U.S. storage hub and cut crude supplies to two oil-refining centers, analysts and traders said.TC Energy's shares ended 0.4% lower.Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd shares rose 0.9% as shareholders voted in favour of Rio Tinto's $3.3 billion bid to take the company private and gain direct control over a giant Mongolian copper mine.(Reporting by Fergal Smith; Additional reporting by Shashwat Chauhan in Bengaluru; Editing by Marguerita Choy)]"

This represents approximately 40% of the outstanding shares in Golden Tag. Per the deal, AG will also receive up to $13.5 million as three milestone payments in either cash or shares in Golden Tag.The first payment of $2.7 million in cash will be paid either 18 months following the closure of the transaction or, on the receipt of certain approvals in Mexico - whichever is earlier. The first deferred payment of $5.75 million in cash or shares will be payable upon receipt of a written resource estimate prepared by a qualified person, of 5 million ounces or more of silver equivalent reserves in La Parrilla, or 22 million ounces of silver equivalent measured and indicated resources on La Parrilla. The second deferred payment of $5.05 million in cash or shares will be paid on receipt of a written resource estimate prepared by a qualified person, of 12.5 million ounces of silver equivalent measured and indicated resources in a new zone on La Parrilla, in respect of which no mineral reserves or resources have been identifiedThe transaction will be closed after Golden Tag obtains the approval of the TSX Venture Exchange and other customary closing conditions are fulfilled.First Majestic currently owns four producing mines.

AG reported a loss per share of 7 cents for the third quarter of 2021. Revenues for the quarter were $160 million, up 28% from the prior-year comparable quarter’s level. Higher production at San Dimas and Santa Elena, partially offset by a decrease in the average price per silver equivalent ounce sold, drove revenues.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Currently, Assertio has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Zoetis has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that ASRT likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than ZTS has recently. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.ASRT currently has a forward P/E ratio of 6.61, while ZTS has a forward P/E of 31.49. We also note that ASRT has a PEG ratio of 0.66. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. ZTS currently has a PEG ratio of 2.91.Another notable valuation metric for ASRT is its P/B ratio of 1.32. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, ZTS has a P/B of 15.36.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to ASRT's Value grade of A and ZTS's Value grade of C.Story continuesASRT stands above ZTS thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that ASRT is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

102,5de19c34-f081-3be0-8e41-fb17cf595b7a,ZTS,2022-12-10,Why Is Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) Down 16.4% Since Last Earnings Report?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-ionis-pharmaceuticals-ions-down-163004640.html,1670603404,STORY,"['IONS', 'ZTS']","[It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS). Shares have lost about 16.4% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Ionis Pharmaceuticals due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Q3 Earnings &amp; Sales Beat EstimatesIonis reported a loss of 33 cents per share in third-quarter 2022, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 74 cents. In the year-ago quarter, the company incurred a loss of 58 cents per share.Reported earnings includes expenses related to the Akcea acquisition and restructured European and North American operations and other items. Excluding these non-recurring expenses, the loss per share was 16 cents versus 34 cents in the year-ago quarter.Ionis reported total revenues of $160 million in the second quarter, up 20% year over year due to higher R&amp;D revenues, which more than offset the lower commercial revenues. Sales also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $151.0 million.Quarter in DetailIonis earns commercial revenues, primarily royalty payments on net sales of Spinraza and R&amp;D revenues from partnered medicines.Commercial revenues were $73 million in the second quarter, down 15% year over year.Commercial revenues from Spinraza royalties were $62 million, down 7% year over, due to rising competition in international markets and currency headwinds.Revenues from Tegsedi and Waylivra from distribution fees were $6 million compared with $15 million in the year-ago quarter. License and royalty revenues were $5 million in the quarter compared with $3 million in the year-ago quarter.R&amp;D revenues of $87 million were higher than the year-ago revenues of $48 million, driven by significant partner payments Ionis earned across multiple partnered programs.Story continuesAdjusted operating costs were up 5.4% year over year to $195 million in the third quarter, mainly driven by higher R&amp;D costs as the company advanced its wholly-owned late-stage pipeline. Ionis’ phase III studies doubled throughout 2022 from three to six. The SG&amp;A expenses increased due to go-to-market activities for its late-stage pipeline candidates.2022 GuidanceIonis maintained its previously issued financial guidance for the year. The company expects total revenues to be more than $575 million in 2022 with commercial and R&amp;D revenue roughly split 50-50. Its adjusted net loss is expected to be less than $275 million.Adjusted operating expense is expected to be in the lower end of range of $825 million to $850 million. R&amp;D costs are expected to increase in the range of 25-30% in 2022 compared with 2021. SG&amp;A costs are expected to be in line with 2021.The company, however, raised its cash and investment guidance to approximately $2 billion from the previous guidance of $1.7 billion.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates review have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -10.27% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Ionis Pharmaceuticals has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with an A. However, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Ionis Pharmaceuticals has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerIonis Pharmaceuticals is part of the Zacks Medical - Drugs industry. Over the past month, Zoetis (ZTS), a stock from the same industry, has gained 7.8%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended September 2022 more than a month ago.Zoetis reported revenues of $2 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.21 for the same period compares with $1.25 a year ago.Zoetis is expected to post earnings of $1.15 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4%.The overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions translate into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Zoetis.

Data released today for September 2022 show that home price gains declined across the United States. More than 27 years of history are available for the data series and can be accessed in full by going to https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/index-family/indicators/sp-corelogic-case-shiller/.YEAR-OVER-YEARThe S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price NSA Index, covering all nine U.S. census divisions, reported a 10.6% annual gain in September, down from 12.9% in the previous month. The 10-City Composite annual increase came in at 9.7%, down from 12.1% in the previous month. The 20-City Composite posted a 10.4% year-over-year gain, down from 13.1% in the previous month.Miami, Tampa, and Charlotte reported the highest year-over-year gains among the 20 cities in September. Miami led the way with a 24.6% year-over-year price increase, followed by Tampa in second with a 23.8% increase, and Charlotte in third with a 17.8% increase. All 20 cities reported lower price increases in the year ending September 2022 versus the year ending August 2022.MONTH-OVER-MONTHBefore seasonal adjustment, the U.S. National Index posted a -1.0% month-over-month decrease in September, while the 10-City and 20-City Composites posted decreases of -1.4% and -1.5%, respectively.After seasonal adjustment, the U.S. National Index posted a month-over-month decrease of -0.8%, and the 10-City and 20-City Composites both posted decreases of -1.2%.In September, all 20 cities reported declines before and after seasonal adjustments.ANALYSIS""As has been the case for the past several months, our September 2022 report reflects short-term declines and medium-term deceleration in housing prices across the U.S.,"" says Craig J. Lazzara, Managing Director at S&amp;P DJI. ""For example, the National Composite Index fell -1.0% in September, and now stands 10.6% above its year-ago level. We see comparable patterns in our 10- and 20-City Composites, which declined -1.4% and -1.5%, respectively, bringing their year-over-year gains down to 9.7% and 10.4%. For all three composites, year-over-year gains, while still well above their historical medians, peaked roughly six months ago and have decelerated since then.Story continues""Despite considerable regional differences, all 20 cities in our September report reflect these trends of short-term decline and medium-term deceleration. Prices declined in every city in September, with a median change of -1.2%. Year-over-year price gains in all 20 cities were lower in September than they had been in August.""The three best-performing cities in August repeated their performance in September. On a year-over-year basis, Miami (+24.6%) edged Tampa (+23.8%) for the top spot, with Charlotte (+17.8%) beating Atlanta (+17.1%) for third place. The Southeast (+20.8%) and South (+19.9%) were the strongest regions by far, with gains more than double those of the Northeast, Midwest, and West; the two worst-performing cities were San Francisco (+2.3%) and Seattle (+6.2%).""As the Federal Reserve continues to move interest rates higher, mortgage financing continues to be more expensive and housing becomes less affordable. Given the continuing prospects for a challenging macroeconomic environment, home prices may well continue to weaken.""SUPPORTING DATATable 1 below shows the housing boom/bust peaks and troughs for the three composites along with the current levels and percentage changes from the peaks and troughs.2006 Peak2012 TroughCurrent Index Level Date Level DateFrom Peak (%) LevelFrom Trough (%)From Peak (%)National184.61Jul-06134.00Feb-12-27.4 %300.41124.2 %62.7 %20-City206.52Jul-06134.07Mar-12-35.1 %306.29128.5 %48.3 %10-City226.29Jun-06146.45Mar-12-35.3 %317.35116.7 %40.2 % Table 2 below summarizes the results for September 2022.

109,db27dd89-f4df-36cc-829a-2b9c1818e938,SPGI,2022-12-10,Qualys and International Flavor and Fragrances have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qualys-international-flavor-fragrances-highlighted-143202757.html,1670596322,STORY,"['QLYS', 'MPC', 'OXY', 'HES', 'SPGI', 'IFF']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – December 9, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares Qualys QLYS as the Bull of the Day and International Flavor and Fragrances IFF as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Occidental Petroleum OXY, Hess Corp. HES and Marathon Petroleum MPC.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:Qualys is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and it sports a F for Value and a B for Growth.  I love to see that sort of growth divergence where we have a weak value score and a strong growth score.  As a growth investor, that tells me right away that I am on the right path. This security company posted a beat in early November.  Let’s explore more about this company in this Bull of The Day article.DescriptionQualys, Inc. is a provider of cloud security and compliance solutions that enable organizations to identify security risks to their information technology infrastructures and help protect their IT systems and applications from cyber-attacks. The company's solutions are provided through its QualysGuard Cloud Platform. It offers products for vulnerability management, policy compliance, web application scanning, malware detection, and associated security products. Qualys, Inc. is headquartered in Redwood City, California.Earnings HistoryWhen I look at a stock, the first thing I do is look to see if the company is beating the number. This tells me right away where the market’s expectations have been for the company and how management has communicated to the market. A stock that consistently beats has management communicating expectations to Wall Street that can be achieved. That is what you want to see. For QLYS, I see four straight beats of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. That is great to see, but by itself that is not enough to make the company a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The average positive earnings surprise over the course of the last year works out to be 8.5%.Story continuesEarnings Estimates RevisionsThe Zacks Rank tells us which stocks are seeing earnings estimates move higher.Over the last 60 days, earning estimates have moved up for QLYS. This quarter has moved up from $0.90 to $0.91. Next quarter has increased from $0.94 to $0.95. The full fiscal year 2022 has increased from $3.54 to $3.62. Next fiscal year has seen the estimate move from $3.88 to $4.01. Positive movement in earnings stock is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).ValuationThe valuation for this name isn’t low, but there is solid growth. I see a forward PE of 31x which is very high, but the company is coming off a quarter that saw topline growth of more than 19%. The price to book multiple is 12x. A software name like this is an asset slim business so number is bound to be a little high. Price to sales comes in a 9x and that is a big number, but the growth is there to support it.Bear of the Day:International Flavor and Fragrances is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and recently beat earnings. Following the recent earnings beat, the stock has continued higher. This article will look at why this stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) as it is the Bear of the Day.DescriptionInternational Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. manufactures and sells cosmetic active and natural health ingredients for use in various consumer products. It operates through Nourish, Scent, Health &amp; Biosciences, and Pharma Solutions segments. The Nourish segment offers natural and plant-based specialty food ingredients. The Scent segment provides fragrance compounds. The Health &amp; Biosciences segment develops and produces enzymes, food cultures, probiotics, and specialty ingredients. The Pharma Solutions segment produces and sells cellulosics and seaweed-based pharma excipients. International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. was founded in 1833 and is headquartered in New York, New York.Earnings HistoryWhen I look at a stock, the first thing I do is look to see if the company is beating the number. This tells me right away where the market’s expectations have been for the company and how management has communicated to the market.  A stock that consistently beats has management communicating expectations to Wall Street that can be achieved. That is what you want to see.In the case of IFF, I four straight beats of the  Zacks Consensus Estimate. This alone does not make the stock a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and it doesn’t make it a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) either.The Zacks Rank does care about the earnings history, but it is much more heavily influenced by the movement of earnings estimates.Earnings EstimatesThe Zacks Rank tells us which stocks are seeing earnings estimates move higher or in this case lower. For IFF I see annual estimates moving higher of late.The current fiscal year consensus number moved lower from $5.38  to $5.60 over the last 60 days. There was a period of time that saw the estimate move lower to $5.30, but this stock will probably soon increase from a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The next year has moved from $5.97 to $5.82. That move lower is probably the biggest deciding factor for this stock to be a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Negative movement in earnings estimates like that is why this stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).It should be noted that a majority of stocks in the Zacks universe are seeing negative earnings estimate revisions. That means that the stocks that are seeing small but negative earnings estimate revisions are falling to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Additional content:U.S. Oil Prices Drop on Rising Gasoline Distillate SupplyU.S. oil prices moved down on Dec 7 after government data showed large weekly builds in gasoline and distillate supplies. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude futures fell $2.24 (or 3%) to settle at $72.01 a barrel yesterday.Despite this, the market has been kind to oil in 2022, with commodity trading considerably higher year to date and hitting $130 for the first time since 2008. Crude-related stocks like Occidental Petroleum, Hess Corp. and Marathon Petroleum.Before going into the overall macro environment for oil, let's dig deep into the Energy Information Administration’s (""EIA"") Weekly Petroleum Status Report for the holiday-shortened week ending Nov 25.Analyzing the Latest EIA ReportCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell 5.2 million barrels compared to expectations of a 2.6 million-barrel decrease per the analysts surveyed by S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights. The combination of lower imports and continued strength in refinery demand accounted for the bigger-than-expected stockpile draw with the world’s biggest oil consumer even as domestic production climbed to the highest since August.Total domestic stocks now stand at 413.9 million barrels — 4.4% less than the year-ago figure and 9% lower than the five-year average.The latest report also showed that supplies at the Cushing terminal (the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange) fell 373,000 barrels to 23.9 million barrels.Meanwhile, the crude supply cover decreased from 25.7 days in the previous week to 25.2 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 27.7 days.Let’s turn to the products now.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies increased for the fourth time in as many weeks. The 5.3 million-barrel rise was primarily attributable to lower exports. Analysts had forecast that gasoline inventories would rise 2.9 million barrels. At 219.1 million barrels, the current stock of the most widely used petroleum product is essentially in line with the year-earlier level, while it is 3% below the five-year average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) also increased for the fourth week in succession. The 6.2 million-barrel gain reflected higher production and a fall in demand. Meanwhile, the market looked for a supply build of some 1.9 million barrels. Despite last week’s addition, current inventories — at 118.8 million barrels — are 6.2% below the year-ago level and 9% lower than the five-year average.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization, at a more than three-year high of 95.5%, rose 0.3% from the prior week.Final WordEven as fears revolving around high inflation and slowing growth somewhat cloud the outlook for Oil/Energy, it has remained the best S&amp;P 500 sector this year. The space has generated a total return of more than 53% in 2022 against the S&amp;P 500’s loss of around 17.5%. Apart from a positive fundamental picture, the sector is enjoying support from geopolitical uncertainty amid Russia’s military operations in Ukraine. In March, crude prices surged to multi-year highs of $130 on concerns about supplies from Russia, which is one of the world's largest producers of the commodity.While oil has pulled back from those lofty levels, with the conflict showing no signs of a quick resolution, the risk of dwindling inventory and the influential oil exporters’ group OPEC sticking to a conservative production profile means that the commodity has got enough reasons to stay elevated in the near-to-medium term.Consequently, three of the top four gainers of the S&amp;P 500 this year are all energy-related names: Occidental Petroleum, Hess Corporation and Marathon Petroleum.Occidental Petroleum: OXY is the top-performing S&amp;P 500 stock in 2022, with a gain of 120.6%. Occidental Petroleum beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 12.7%, on average.OXY has a projected earnings growth rate of 282% for this year. Occidental Petroleum is valued at around $58.3 billion.Hess Corp.: Hess shares have appreciated 82.1% so far in 2022. HES has a projected earnings growth rate of 229.7% for this year.Hess, with a market capitalization of $41.8 billion, enjoys a Growth Score of A. HES beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters, the average being 8.1%.Marathon Petroleum: This stock is among the best performers on the S&amp;P 500 Index, with shares having appreciated 70.3% in 2022. MPC, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), has a projected earnings growth rate of 940.8% for this year.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Marathon Petroleum beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters.

110,98b3c2de-3a29-3a36-a102-ebc1f03f94d8,MA,2022-12-10,Estimating The Fair Value Of Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estimating-fair-value-mastercard-incorporated-120150522.html,1670673710,STORY,['MA'],"[How far off is Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for Mastercard The ModelWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$11.9bUS$13.8bUS$15.5bUS$17.8bUS$19.5bUS$21.0bUS$22.2bUS$23.2bUS$24.0bUS$24.8bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x8Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 9.58%Est @ 7.3%Est @ 5.7%Est @ 4.59%Est @ 3.8%Est @ 3.26% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.7% US$11.0kUS$11.9kUS$12.4kUS$13.3kUS$13.5kUS$13.5kUS$13.2kUS$12.8kUS$12.4kUS$11.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$126bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$25b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.7%– 2.0%) = US$446bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$446b÷ ( 1 + 7.7%)10= US$214bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$339b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$349, the company appears about fair value at a 1.2% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Mastercard as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.018. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For Mastercard, there are three relevant items you should assess:Risks: As an example, we've found 1 warning sign for Mastercard that you need to consider before investing here.Future Earnings: How does MA's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

Prosecutors said he placed deceptive orders for silver futures and lied about it to investigators.Jordan's attorney, James Benjamin, called the verdict disappointing and said Jordan is ""a good and honorable man who did his job in good faith.""Jordan was indicted in 2019 along with former JPMorgan global precious metals desk head Michael Nowak, precious metals trader Gregg Smith and salesperson Jeffrey Ruffo.The case was the U.S. Justice Department's most aggressive to date targeting spoofing, charging the four defendants with violating the racketeering statute, a law enacted in 1970 to take down the mafia.Nowak, Smith and Ruffo were acquitted of racketeering and conspiracy, though Nowak and Smith were convicted on multiple other charges at a jury trial in August. Prosecutors then dropped racketeering and conspiracy charges against Jordan.JPMorgan agreed in 2020 to pay more than $920 million and admitted to wrongdoing to settle with the Justice Department and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over its traders' conduct.

The real was last down 0.3%, after falling as much as 1.4% during the session. Lula, who is set to take office in January, also announced other cabinet picks after appointing former Sao Paulo Mayor Haddad, ending days of speculation about his ministerial appointments. The choice of Haddad was in line with expectations. Haddad can be portrayed as a pragmatic politician given his educational qualification and political experience, said Mauricio Une, head of South America macro strategy at Rabobank. ""I believe the market would now like to understand who Haddad will invite into his ministry and help him design economic policies."" The real's move helped it pare weekly losses to below 1%.

""Brazil is the world's #1 disinflation success story,"" said Natalia Gurushina, emerging markets fixed income economist at VanEck, in a note. Some other emerging market currencies fell, with South Africa's rand and Mexico's peso down about 0.9% each as the dollar cut losses after the U.S. Labor Department reported that producer prices rose more than expected last month on an annual basis. This increased hawkish anticipation for the Federal Reserve's much anticipated meeting next month where bets are that the Fed would opt for a smaller interest rate hike following four 75 basis point hikes. Mexico's peso is on course for a drop of nearly 2% on the week, in what could be its sharpest decline in four months. Top copper producer Chile's peso added 0.3% against the dollar, supported by firm copper prices as investors anticipated that China's easing of coronavirus restrictions will boost economic growth and metals demand. Peruvian markets were closed. President Dina Boluarte said she was willing to discuss early elections with the country's political and civil organizations, but ruled out kick-starting constitutional changes for the time being. Latam stocks fell 0.4% on Friday and were down 3.4% for the week, sharply underperforming their broader EM peers. However, Brazil's Bovespa jumped 0.6% with materials being the biggest boost.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this world's biggest maker of health care products have returned +1.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.5% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Johnson &amp; Johnson belongs, has gained 7.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to post earnings of $2.22 per share, indicating a change of +4.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.04 points to a change of +2.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.28 indicates a change of +2.4% from what Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Johnson &amp; Johnson.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for JNJ _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Johnson &amp; Johnson, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $23.79 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -4.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $95.02 billion and $98.28 billion estimates indicate +1.3% and +3.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryJohnson &amp; Johnson reported revenues of $23.79 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.9%. EPS of $2.55 for the same period compares with $2.60 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23.28 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.2%. The EPS surprise was +2.41%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Johnson &amp; Johnson is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Johnson &amp; Johnson. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Given recent dips in the share price, investors looking for strong growth potential might consider Medtronic to be an attractive option.Medtronic: Income Investor's Delight Available at a DiscountMedtronic reaches critical milestone in Sphere-9 ablation catheter trialOn Dec. 6, Medtronic announced the finalization of enrollment for an important clinical trial of its cardiac ablation and mapping catheter, Sphere-9. With the help of the medical device, the study's goal is to examine an innovative therapy for a common heart condition. The catheter will be used to treat atrial fibrillation, which causes highly irregular pulse rates because of abnormal electrical impulses in the atria, two important chambers in the human heart.Sphere 9 is being developed with the help of Affera, a company focusing on cardiac arrhythmia solutions that Medtronic acquired in August. The company's product portfolio is not yet available for sale.Atrial fibrillation devices have a growing market that was valued at $10.2 billion in 2021. According to a report from Transparency Market Research, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 6% through 2031 to $18.5 billion. The launch of Sphere-9 and the rest of Affera's product portfolio could prove to be a significant growth catalyst for Medtronic.Story continuesMedtronic posts disappointing earningsMedtronic reported its fiscal second-quarter 2023 results on Nov. 22. The company posted a year-over-year decline of 3.3% in revenue to $7.59 billion and missed analysts' estimates by $110 million. Even though the non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.30 outperformed expectations by 2 cents, they were still down 2% from the prior-year quarter. On top of that, GAAP earnings declined 67% year over year to 32 cents.The revenue decline was caused by the non-U.S. developed market, which fell 13% year over year to $2.15 billion. It represents 28% of the company's total revenue. Additionally, the U.S., which accounts for 54% of Medtronic's revenue, recorded a 2% increase to $4.06 billion. The Emerging Markets segment, generating 18% of the company's revenue, reported a 1% decrease inorganically but a 4% organic increase. Revenue for the division stood at $1.35 billion.Medtronic recently increased its revenue growth and earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2023. It expects organic revenue growth of 3.5% to 4% in the second half of the year. The company also projected full-year earnings per share to be between $5.25 and $5.30, including an 18-cent loss from foreign currency.The state of the markets today is causing a lot of uncertainty for many investors. While not all news is good news, Medtronic's recent earnings disappointment had a bigger impact than perhaps it would have in a more sturdy market climate. With the financial markets in such a bearish mood, it is essential to consider the state of affairs when analyzing news like this. Investors cannot forget that although this news may seem bad, taking into consideration the overall market conditions can provide them with more insight as to whether or not this truly reflects the company's performance.A history of significant shareholder returnsMedtronic is a delight for income investors. The dividend yield is an appealing 3.39%, and the company is only five years away from becoming a Dividend King as it has increased its dividend over the past 45 years.When it comes to shareholder returns, the company focuses more on dividends. However, it does not shy away from share repurchases either. The company has bought back $500 million worth of stock year to date after returning $5.5 billion to shareholders through buybacks in fiscal 2022.For Medtronic, offering dividends and share repurchases to its investors is a smart move, as it can help turn around any negative sentiment. When stock prices are low, having this extra incentive to remain invested can help inspire confidence that higher prices abound and increase investor morale. Furthermore, being able to invest in its operations is something shareholders greatly appreciate, especially during times of uncertainty. All in all, dividends and share repurchases are the perfect way for Medtronic to reward loyal investors.Key takeawayMedtronic's stock has been beaten down throughout the year and is now trading close to its 52-week low. This provides an attractive entry point for new investors. In addition, the company has a vast portfolio of medical devices, while its innovations and acquisitions related to cardiac treatment can evolve into significant money spinners for several years to come.The most attractive part of Medtronic is its focus on shareholder returns. The company's commitment to return 50% of its free cash flow to shareholders makes it a potentially good opportunity for those looking for passive or post-retirement income.Finally, Medtronic is a very attractive stock for value investors given its current multiples. The company has a strong product lineup and an excellent track record of innovations. From cardiovascular solutions to diabetes management devices and minimally invasive procedures, Medtronic is one of the leaders in advancing health care technologies that benefit patients around the world. Investors can be sure their investments will appreciate as the company continues to develop and implement new technology. With such a solid foundation for growth, Medtronic should remain an appealing option for most value investors.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Today's Research Daily features an update on the Q4 earnings season which got underway this week. We are also featuring the updated December Economic Outlook report, in addition to new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (MRK), Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY) and Deere &amp; Company (DE).

Next week's reports from the likes of Adobe, Orable, Accenture, Lennar and others will similarly count as part of the 2022 Q4 tally. Aggregate Q4 earnings for Costco and AutoZone are up +2.2% from the same period last year on +8.1% higher revenues, with only one of the two (AutoZone) beating EPS and revenue estimates. Looking at Q4 as a whole, total S&amp;P 500 earnings are expected to be down -5.9% from the same period last year on +4.3% higher revenues. Excluding contribution from the Energy sector whose earnings are expected to be up +56.9%, Q4 earnings for the rest of the index are expected to be down -10.3% from the same period last year. Estimates have been steadily coming down, with the current -5.9% decline down from +1.7% on October 5th. Today's Featured Analyst ReportsShares of Merck &amp; Co have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+52.7% vs. +19.3%) on the back of strong sales momentum from drugs like Keytruda and the Gardasil vaccine. With continued label expansion into new indications &amp; early-stage settings, Keytruda is expected to remain a key top-line driver.Animal health and vaccine products are core growth drivers. Its new COVID oral antiviral pill, Lagevrio has become a key top-line driver in 2022. Merck boasts a strong cancer pipeline, including Keytruda, which should help drive long-term growth.However, generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure, mainly on the diabetes franchise, will continue to be overhangs on the top line. There are concerns about Merck’s ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda’s loss of exclusivity later in the decade.(You can read the full research report on Merck &amp; Co here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the past year (+41.7% vs. -17.8%). Solid demand for the company’s blood thinner drug Eliquis and the label expansion of Opdivo are maintaining momentum for Bristol-Myers. Eliquis is the leading oral anticoagulant drug and continues to experience growth in its market share.The label expansion of Opdivo into indications for lung cancer, renal cancer and gastric cancer boosted sales. The recent approval of drugs like Opdualag, Breyanzi and Sotyktu will add a new stream of revenues. Our estimates for BMY’s top line suggest a CAGR of around 1% over the next three years, driven by solid demand for legacy drugs and the approval of new drugs.However, Revlimid, one of the top revenue generators, is facing generic competition and sales are being adversely impacted.(You can read the full research report on Bristol-Myers Squibb here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Deere &amp; Company shares have outperformed the Zacks Manufacturing - Farm Equipment industry over the past year (+23.6% vs. +21.7%). The company is poised well to gain on improving commodity prices, which will encourage farmers to spend more on farm equipment. Strong replacement demand will also continue to boost its top line.Demand for Construction equipment will likely benefit from anticipated growth in infrastructure investments. Higher material and labor costs will likely dent margins. However, we expect Deere’s adjusted earnings per share to grow 16% in fiscal 2023, led by strong demand and pricing. Product launches equipped with the latest technology to make farming automated will continue to provide it with an edge over its competitors.It will benefit in the long run from rapid growth in global population as well as the rising worldwide infrastructure needs. Our estimates for Deere’s bottom line suggest a CAGR of around 2% over the 2022-2025 forecast period.(You can read the full research report on Deere &amp; Company here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (BUD), Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc.

These are complementary indicators that rate stocks based on value, growth, and/or momentum characteristics.Why Investors Should Pay Attention to This Value StockDifferent than growth or momentum investors, value-focused investors are all about finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under what their true value is before the broader market catches on. The Value Style Score utilizes ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, and Price/Cash Flow to help pick out the most attractive and discounted stocks.Merck (MRK)Based in Kenilworth, NJ, Merck &amp; Co. boasts more than six blockbuster drugs in its portfolio with PD-L1 inhibitor, Keytruda, approved for several types of cancer, alone accounting for around 40% of its pharmaceutical sales. Keytruda has played an instrumental role in driving Merck’s steady revenue growth in the past few years. Though Keytruda may be Merck’s biggest strength and a solid reason to own the stock, it can also be argued that Merck is excessively dependent on the drug and should look for ways to diversify its product lineup.MRK is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, with a Value Style Score of A and VGM Score of A. Shares are currently trading at a forward P/E of 15X for the current fiscal year compared to the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry's P/E of 15.1X. Additionally, MRK has a PEG Ratio of 1.5 and a Price/Cash Flow ratio of 15.2X. Value investors should also note MRK's Price/Sales ratio of 4.8X.Value investors don't just pay attention to a company's valuation ratios; positive earnings play a crucial role, too. Five analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2022. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.01 to $7.38 per share.

This is brightening up the outlook for the Zacks Oil and Gas - Production &amp; Pipelines industry.Pipeline players are better off than upstream and downstream firms since the companies are generating stable fee-based revenues from their long-term contracts with shippers. Kinder Morgan, Inc. KMI, The Williams Companies Inc WMB and MPLX LP MPLX are among the frontrunners in the industry.About the IndustryThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Production &amp; Pipelines industry comprises companies that own and operate midstream energy infrastructure assets. The properties consist of extensive pipeline networks that transport crude oil, liquids and natural gas. The midstream energy players are also involved in the processing and storing of natural gas. The companies have interests in natural gas distribution utilities, serving millions of retail customers across North America. Some companies are ramping up investments in renewable energy and power transmission businesses. The firms invested in wind farms, solar energy operations, geothermal projects and hydroelectric facilities. Thus, with a diversified portfolio of renewable energy projects, the companies have room to generate extra cash flows in addition to stable fee-based revenues from the transportation assets.What's Shaping the Future of Oil &amp; Gas - Production and Pipelines Industry?Pipeline Demand to Improve: Oil price is trading at more than $70 per barrel. Crude price, which is still favorable, is helping explorers and producers to ramp up upstream activities, leading to higher production. This, in turn, is improving demand for crude transportation pipelines of the midstream players.Stable Fee-Based Revenues: Most pipeline and storage assets are being booked by shippers for the long term, making midstream businesses less vulnerable to volatility in commodity prices. Backed by long-term contracts, the companies belonging to the industry also have a minimal oil and gas volume risk. Owing to these factors, pipeline players will continue to generate stable fee-based revenues.Story continuesImpressive Project Backlog: Many pipeline companies in the industry have a huge backlog of growth projects worth billions of dollars. The projects will come online in a few years, securing additional cashflows for the pipeline players.Attractive Dividend Yield: Oil and gas pipeline stocks are paying attractive dividend yields. Compared to the overall energy sector, companies belonging to the industry have been rewarding shareholders with significantly higher dividend yields over the past few years, providing reassurance that the midstream business is relatively more stable than upstream and downstream operations.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Production &amp; Pipelines is a 13-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #67, which places it in the top 27% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates rosy near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries results from a positive earnings outlook for the constituent stocks in aggregate. Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider, let’s look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and its valuation picture.Industry Lags Sector, Outperforms S&amp;P 500The Zacks Oil and Gas - Production &amp; Pipelines industry has lagged the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector but outperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has risen 11.1% over this period compared with the 26.4% improvement of the broader sector and 17.3% decline of the S&amp;P 500.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationBased on the trailing 12-month enterprise value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), which is a commonly used multiple for valuing oil and gas production &amp; pipeline stocks, the industry is currently trading at 12.85X, higher than the S&amp;P 500’s 11.92X. It is also above the sector’s trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA of 3.21X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 19.01X, as low as 8.81X and at a median of 13.36X.Trailing 12-Month Enterprise Value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) Ratio3 Oil &amp; Gas Pipeline Stocks Leading the PackMPLX LP: MPLX generates stable cashflows and has lower exposure to commodity price volatility since it is the operator of midstream energy infrastructure and logistics assets.

128,f8860e18-fec3-3d0f-b607-d6d95f5d76d1,BA,2022-12-10,Bullish insiders at The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) loaded up on US$5.3m of stock earlier this year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bullish-insiders-boeing-company-nyse-110105360.html,1670670065,STORY,['BA'],"[Multiple insiders secured a larger position in The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) shares over the last 12 months. This is reassuring as this suggests that insiders have increased optimism about the company's prospects.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Boeing The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At BoeingIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when President David Calhoun bought US$4.0m worth of shares at a price of US$160 per share. Although we like to see insider buying, we note that this large purchase was at significantly below the recent price of US$180. While it does suggest insiders consider the stock undervalued at lower prices, this transaction doesn't tell us much about what they think of current prices.In the last twelve months Boeing insiders were buying shares, but not selling. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At Boeing Have Bought Stock RecentlyOver the last quarter, Boeing insiders have spent a meaningful amount on shares. In total, insiders bought US$4.2m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any sales whatsoever. This is a positive in our book as it implies some confidence.Does Boeing Boast High Insider Ownership?For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Boeing insiders own about US$61m worth of shares. That equates to 0.06% of the company. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Boeing Tell Us?It's certainly positive to see the recent insider purchases. We also take confidence from the longer term picture of insider transactions. However, we note that the company didn't make a profit over the last twelve months, which makes us cautious. Given that insiders also own a fair bit of Boeing we think they are probably pretty confident of a bright future. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with Boeing and understanding it should be part of your investment process.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

What are we seeing?JARED BLIKRE: That's right we're checking out Boeing first. It's up about one third of a percent right now, and the industrial giant getting a boost on news that Air India close to a deal to buy 150 737 MAX Jets with 50 of those to be delivered immediately up front. Though our aerospace board is mainly red today, Boeing supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, is also in the green, got a little bit of a boost off that number as well.Meanwhile, we got to check out the EV space. Now, we're seeing mostly green, but not in terms of some of these Chinese stocks. Those would be clustered over here. We're seeing, for instance, some of these stocks such as Li Auto down 13%, NIO down 5%, Lucid Motors down 2%. And that says we're not seeing any fundamental news right here. But Lucid Motors is at an all time low right now, and that's trading. All of these are up more than 50% from their highs, except Lucid.So let's take a look at that stock right now. If we check out a Max chart, you can see there it is, camping out below $10 per share. And I believe that deal came via a SPAC, so a little bit of luck there. We'll have to see what happens with that.And up next, we are going to check out the retailer space. And that's because retailer, Costco, reported earnings, earnings that came short of expectations, not only on the top line, but also on the bottom line. But you can see the stock is still up about half a percent there. The miss in gross margins pointing to a softening environment for the retailer. Meanwhile, Oppenheimer is saying that this was, quote, ""an essentially in line quarter for Costco, and that street estimates are too aggressive.""Now finally, in homebuilder news, well actually not homebuilder but home furnishing news, we want to check out RH, formerly Restoration Hardware. That stock is up 3% after earnings. Citi put it best. Here's a quote for you ""A modest beat and guidance raise was never so ominous."" And that's as the RH CEO, Gary Friedman himself, described a quote, ""complete collapse of the luxury housing market."" And this is amid near-term uncertainty as well.Story continuesSo Dave and Shawna, I think it becomes a question of, well, has RH seen the worst of times or the best of times. Gary Friedman likes to experiment, not a typical retailer here.- I'm glad you brought up that quote. I haven't seen this kind of drop since 2008, said Friedman, about the housing market. I was shocked to hear that. Very few real estate analysts across the country feel that way. But he obviously has a different look at it.- Yeah, and he was also saying it looks more like a crash landing to him, unpredictable right now given that macro uncertainty. The fact that the stock is still 3% higher today, I'm a little bit amazed by that. Because certainly if you take a look at his predictions, the guidance that we got from RH in terms of what we heard from the CEO, he certainly sees what could be a pretty rough time for the company over at least the coming quarters.JARED BLIKRE: Yeah. Well, they don't do any discounting. It's not like you're going to walk in a store and see a bunch of holiday stuff out there. He's doing it the old-fashioned way. And maybe it pans out, maybe it doesn't. But he's got his head to the grindstone. I will say that.- We will see how the slowdown in housing affects RH going forward. Jared Blikre, thanks so much.]"

This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Southern The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) -US$598.0mUS$850.5mUS$1.41bUS$2.62bUS$3.65bUS$4.68bUS$5.63bUS$6.46bUS$7.16bUS$7.76bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x2Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 39.29%Est @ 28.1%Est @ 20.26%Est @ 14.78%Est @ 10.94%Est @ 8.25% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.4% -US$562US$751US$1.2kUS$2.0kUS$2.7kUS$3.2kUS$3.6kUS$3.9kUS$4.1kUS$4.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$25bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$7.8b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.4%– 2.0%) = US$177bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$177b÷ ( 1 + 6.4%)10= US$95bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$120b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$68.4, the company appears quite undervalued at a 38% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Southern as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

One of Georgia’s subsidiaries will operate the new units on behalf of four co-owners — Georgia Power, Oglethorpe Power, MEAG Power and Dalton Utilities.Chris Womack, Georgia Power’s chairman, president and CEO, said that the team at the Vogtle 3 &amp; 4 site continues to make vital progress as the company moves closer to bringing online the first new nuclear units to be built in the United States in more than 30 years. “These units are a long-term investment for our state and essential to building the future of energy for Georgia,” he added.Founded in 1945, Southern Company is one of the largest utilities in the United States.

Despite that, many REITs that struggled in 2022 are showing overall strength and have shown improved Q3 operating results. But with so many real estate investment trusts (REITs) to choose from, how do investors know which REITs are the best buys?Here are two of the leading residential REITs, both similarly priced, compared by eight different measures to help determine which is the better one to buy.Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc. (NYSE: MAA) is a Germantown, Tennessee-based residential REIT that specializes in purchasing and leasing apartment complexes. It owns over 101,000 units in 296 communities across 16 states and Washington, D.C.

The edge goes to AvalonBay Communities in this category.Dividend Growth and StabilityOver the past five years, Mid-America has grown its quarterly dividend from $0.923 to $1.25, an increase of 35.4%. During that same time frame, AvalonBay has grown its quarterly dividend from $1.42 to $1.59, an increase of 11.9%.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: VICI Properties Inc. VICI, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. MAA and Regency Centers Corp. REG.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:3 REITs That Can Help Your Portfolio Weather a RecessionInflation concerns are refusing to abate and experts fear that the Federal Reserve’s efforts to tame inflationary pressure through rate hikes might push the economy toward a recession.A moderation in Consumer Price Index readings and an indication from the Fed about lowering the magnitude of the rate hike from December came as a relief. However, the recent employment report exhibited a strong labor market as well as higher-than-expected wage growth, suggesting that the inflation fight by the Fed might be tougher.Dividend-Paying Stocks Gain FocusAmid these uncertainties and increased volatility, the focus has now shifted to investing in quality companies with a consistent track of paying dividends. Obviously, this brings us to the REITs because solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for REIT investors as U.S. law requires REITs to distribute 90% of their annual taxable income in the form of dividends. This has enabled the industry to stand out and gain a footing over the last 15-20 years.Particularly, REITs like VICI Properties Inc., Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. and Regency Centers Corp. look poised to not only deliver better results but also reward shareholders simultaneously.Why REITs?According to the third-quarter data from the Nareit Total REIT Industry Tracker Series (T-Tracker®) report, even amid a period of high inflation as well as rising rates, REITs’ operational performance exhibited strength with 14.9% and 8.1% year-over-year increases in funds from operations (FFO) and net operating income (NOI), respectively.Story continuesWith REITs continuing to experience earnings growth, this special hybrid asset class remains well-positioned to deliver a decent stream of dividend income to investors.Now if REITs’ historical dependence on debt makes investors skeptical in a rising rate environment, then it needs to be noted that over the years, REITs have managed their balance sheets efficiently and are now well prepared for a rising rate environment. Instead of looking for debt to finance the portfolios, these companies have strategically resorted to equity capital over the past decade.Per the third-quarter 2022 NAREIT report, leverage ratios remained near historic lows, with debt-to-market assets at 34.5%, while interest coverage increased to six times. Moreover, net interest expense as a percent of NOI was near its historical low at 18.9%. Also, REITs have extended the maturity of their debt with the weighted average term to maturity of REIT debt now being more than seven years, or 84 months. As such, REITs remain well-positioned for ongoing economic uncertainty.What’s more encouraging is REITs’ characteristic of providing natural protection against inflation. Particularly, both rents and real estate values have a tendency to move north with prices increasing, thereby aiding dividend growth. In fact, the majority of leases are tied to inflation, which leads to rent increases as inflation goes up. Therefore, even amid the inflationary period, investment in the REIT industry can offer a steady stream of income.Here’s How We Selected These REITsHowever, not all REITs are equally capable of keeping up their dividend-paying momentum. Therefore, to pick the right dividend stocks, we have employed the Zacks Stocks Screener and have shortlisted the REITs with a dividend yield of more than 2% (this criterion includes companies with a dividend yield above the S&amp;P 500′s average dividend yield of roughly 2%). Apart from this, we have considered REITs that have five-year historical dividend growth of greater than or equal to 0.001 (including companies that have increased their dividend over the past five years).Moreover, these stocks have a sturdy business model, which protects them from market volatility, and are known for providing a steady stream of income. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Our ChoicesNew York, NY-based VICI Properties Inc. is an experiential REIT engaged in the business of owning, acquiring and developing gaming, hospitality and entertainment destinations.VICI Properties enjoys the ownership of three of the most iconic entertainment facilities on the Las Vegas Strip, namely Caesars Palace Las Vegas, MGM Grand and the Venetian Resort Las Vegas. The company has made concerted efforts to grow its portfolio and team up with the best-in-class tenants. Such efforts are likely to aid VICI’s performance in the coming quarters.Analysts seem bullish on this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 FFO per share has been revised 4.9% north over the past week to $1.92.VICI pays out a quarterly dividend of 39 cents per share ($1.56 annualized), which gives it a 4.63% yield at the current stock price.

143,45444b29-e7e3-3032-890f-1df232de30ab,NOC,2022-12-10,Northrop Grumman Corporation's (NYSE:NOC) institutional investors lost 3.1% last week but have benefitted from longer-term gains,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/northrop-grumman-corporations-nyse-noc-120228433.html,1670673748,STORY,['NOC'],"[A look at the shareholders of Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) can tell us which group is most powerful. With 85% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's market cap fell by US$2.6b last week. However, the 45% one-year returns may have helped alleviate their overall losses. But they would probably be wary of future losses.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Northrop Grumman, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Northrop Grumman ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Northrop Grumman?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Northrop Grumman. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Northrop Grumman's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Northrop Grumman. Capital Research and Management Company is currently the largest shareholder, with 10% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 9.3% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 7.9% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesWe did some more digging and found that 10 of the top shareholders account for roughly 51% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Northrop GrummanThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Northrop Grumman Corporation. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$148m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 15% stake in Northrop Grumman. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Northrop Grumman better, we need to consider many other factors.

The majority of work related to this deal will be executed in Fort Worth, TX.Importance of F-35 for LMTLockheed Martin enjoys a dominant position in the global military aircraft space with its F-35 fleet. The stealth aircraft boasts features that make it an ideal choice for many nations. Moreover, LMT’s constant efforts to modernize and upgrade the aircraft with advanced technologies and enhance its capabilities to meet current warfare needs boost demand significantly.The F-35 program remained the largest revenue generator for its Aeronautics business unit and accounted for 68% of Aeronautics’ net sales in 2021.Lockheed Martin has delivered 841 F-35 airplanes since the program's inception, with 271 jets in backlog till September 2022. This, along with the latest contract win, boosts sales expectations for the Aeronautics business segment.Lockheed expects to make deliveries of this stealth aircraft in the range of 147-153 jets per year in 2023 and 2024, and 156 in 2025 and beyond. This, in turn, should bolster LMT’s revenues significantly from the military aircraft arena.Story continuesGrowth ProspectsPer Mordor Intelligence projections, the global military aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of more than 4% during 2022-2031. Such projections indicate immense opportunities for Lockheed Martin to further reap the benefits of military aircraft market expansion.Prominent defense majors that are involved in the manufacturing of military aircraft are Northrop Grumman NOC, Airbus Group EADSY and Textron TXT.Since its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft.

146,61a557f6-fdcb-3a73-af6b-5c11cc8d4e43,NKE,2022-12-10,11 Best Fashion Stocks To Buy Now,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-best-fashion-stocks-buy-114356357.html,1670672636,STORY,"['ANF', 'NKE', 'HBI', 'GPS', 'RL', 'TLYS', 'GES', 'LULU']","[In this article we present the list of 11 Best Fashion Stocks To Buy Now. Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Best Fashion Stocks To Buy Now.If you’re in the market for fashion stocks, then NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU), and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. (NYSE:ANF) should be at the top of your list.It’s been a volatile few years for the apparel and fashion industry as a whole, and its companies’ share prices in particular. Sales at clothing and accessories stores sank by 26% year-over-year in 2020, as pandemic lockdowns across the globe shuttered stores and kept people lounging around in their sweats at home.After a year of barely updating their wardrobes, consumers went crazy catching up for lost time in 2021 as societies reopened and people began socializing again. Sales jumped by 60% during the first nine months of 2021 and continued to be strong through the first half of this year.Another slowdown for the industry appears to be underway now however, with inflation and depressed consumer sentiment driving fashion sales into negative territory in the second half of this year. McKinsey predicts that the industry will grow by about 2-3% during 2023, primarily due to solid sustained growth in the luxury fashion market, which is expected to grow between 5-10%.That’s not surprising given that luxury retailers and other sellers of high-priced goods tend to weather economic storms better thanks to their focus on the wealthy consumer, who isn’t as affected by economic downturns.The fashion market is expected to be strong in both China and the United States, growing by as much 6% or 7% in each country, while an energy crisis in Europe is expected to lead to a 1% to 4% downturn for the fashion market in that region next year.As cash-strapped consumers more carefully consider their clothing options, the rise of secondhand apparel is becoming apparent and represents another challenge for apparel brands and retailers. The secondhand market is expected to grow by 24% to $119 billion this year and to reach $218 billion in sales by 2026. Meanwhile, the broader apparel market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.6% through 2026, hitting $843 billion, and those projections might be somewhat optimistic.Story continuesThe secondhand trend is particularly pronounced in North America, where secondhand apparel has been outgrowing the broader apparel market by a staggering 700%. In response, some fashion brands are beginning to launch their own resale initiatives to bring some of that market back within their own ecosystem.All told, it could be a lean year or two for some or even many fashion companies and their corresponding shares, which makes pinpointing only the best fashion stocks to buy now a priority for investors interested in the space. We’ll do that in this article, using the smart money sentiment as our guide to which fashion stocks are likely to perform well in the years to come.11 Best Fashion Stocks To Buy NowOur MethodologyThe following fashion stocks are ranked based on hedge fund sentiment. We follow a select group of hedge funds because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q3 2022 reporting period.11 Best Fashion Stocks To Buy Now11. Tilly’s, Inc. (NYSE:TLYS)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 15 Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. (NYSE:ANF), NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), and Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU) rank among the top five best fashion stocks to buy right now. Just cracking the list in 11th is Tilly’s, Inc. (NYSE:TLYS), which sells apparel and accessories geared towards kids and teens.Hedge fund ownership of Tilly’s, Inc. (NYSE:TLYS) peaked in the third quarter of 2018 and has declined by 33% since. It did tick up during Q3 of this year however, as multiple funds opened small stakes in the company. Among them were Israel Englander’s Millennium Management and Frederick Disanto’s Ancora Advisors.Tilly’s, Inc. (NYSE:TLYS) was a big beneficiary of the pandemic, but has struggled to match up against those tougher comps in 2022. The third quarter wasn’t great, but the company did perform better than both it and the market expected, pulling in $178 million in revenue and $0.17 per share in earnings, both of which beat estimates. Comparable net sales in Q4 had declined by 18.5% through November 29 compared to the year-ago period.10. Guess’, Inc. (NYSE:GES)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 17 Hedge funds bailed on Guess’, Inc. (NYSE:GES) in droves during the first quarter, as there was a 41% decline in the number of smart money managers long the stock. There was a slight rebound in Q2 as Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies and Lee Ainslie’s Maverick Capital were among the funds to add GES to their 13F portfolios.Guess’, Inc. (NYSE:GES) has hung in there somewhat better than Tilly’s this year, growing Q3 sales by 10% year-over-year on a constant currency basis thanks to continued strong performance in Europe. The jeans and apparel maker’s operating margin stood at 8.6% in Q3, down from 14.1% a year earlier, though company expects that figure to rebound to 13.2% in Q4 on an adjusted basis.Guess’, Inc. (NYSE:GES) is undergoing several initiatives to improve its customer acquisition and retention efforts, as well as its marketing capabilities. Chief among them is the company’s Customer 360 platform, some of which has already been implemented in Europe with promising results. Guess has also been growing its digital business, including its data analytics capabilities.9. Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE:RL)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 22 There’s been a 29% drop in the number of hedge funds long Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE:RL) over the past two quarters, with the stock hitting a ten-year low in smart money ownership as a result. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates sold off its stake in RL during Q3, while Arrowstreet Capital, founded by Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke and John Campbell, held the largest long position, consisting of 801,348 shares.Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE:RL) could be poised for a good holiday season if demand trends for the high-end fashion retailer are strong, as the company significantly bolstered its inventory ahead of the fourth quarter to stave off any potential supply chain challenges. High-end retailers tend to perform better during economic downturns due to their wealthier clientele being less affected by the conditions of the day, which the company appears to be banking on.There are some troubling signs in the company’s recent results however, which may be why hedge funds have been bailing on the stock. Ralph Lauren grew sales by 13% in its Q1 of fiscal 2023, but sales growth slowed to 5% year-over-year in its fiscal Q2. Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE:RL)’s bottom line has also been getting pinched due to rising cost of goods sold, which jumped by 14% in fiscal Q2, dwarfing the company’s sales growth. That contributed to earnings falling to $2.23 per share compared to $2.62 a year earlier, despite the company having also bought back over 6 million shares, or about 8.4% of its outstanding float prior to those purchases.8. Victorias Secret &amp; Co. (NYSE:VSCO)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 24 Hedge funds showed noteworthy interest in Victorias Secret &amp; Co. (NYSE:VSCO) during its first quarter on the market as a publicly traded company following its separation from Bath &amp; Body Works, Inc. (NYSE:BBWI) in Q3 of 2021. That interest has waned considerably in the four quarters since however, as there’s been a drop in hedge fund ownership of VSCO during each of those quarters.The lingerie retailer was spun off in part so a new management team could take charge and help turn around the struggling company, which suffered a major sales drop during its fiscal 2020 year. Victorias Secret &amp; Co. (NYSE:VSCO)’s gross margins have trailed its peers by a wide margin (pardon the pun?), which is something management has been focused on improving, with some success, but more work remains to be done.Victorias Secret &amp; Co. (NYSE:VSCO)‘s Q3 comparable sales slumped by 11% year-over-year, with the company pulling in $1.32 billion in sales, in line with estimates. The retailer’s EPS of $0.29 topped estimates by a healthy $0.06 and also came in ahead of the company’s own guidance. Cowen analyst Jonna Kim has a $45 price target and ‘Outperform’ rating on VSCO shares. The analyst believes the company’s sales will remain pressured in the near-term, but that longer-term, it has a good opportunity to regain share in the U.S. and grow internationally.T-6. Hanesbrands Inc. (NYSE:HBI)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 25 Ownership of Hanesbrands Inc. (NYSE:HBI) among the select group of funds tracked by Insider Monkey sank to a nine-year low during the second quarter, but rebounded big time during Q3, shooting up by nearly 50%. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group and Andrew Kurita’s Kettle Hill Capital Management were two of the funds to add HBI to their 13F portfolios during Q3.Hanesbrands Inc. (NYSE:HBI) shares have trended down throughout the year, losing 63% of their value, which may have prompted some funds to go bargain hunting. The clothing and undergarments manufacturer has been facing several challenges in recent quarters, including tighter inventory management among retailers and rising costs. Sales slumped by 7% year-over-year in Q3, sliding to $1.67 billion, while adjusted net income fared far worse, tumbling by 46% to $102 million. The company’s guidance for the holiday season also came in well below estimates, with projections for as little as $1.4 billion in sales and $0.04 in adjusted EPS compared to $1.63 billion and $0.21 estimates respectively.Chartwell Investment Partners shared some of the challenges that Hanesbrands Inc. (NYSE:HBI) has faced of late in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“The three worst-performing stocks in the Dividend Equity accounts includes Hanesbrands (NYSE:HBI, 1.1%), down 30.1%. Hanesbrands’ management is executing well, but the challenging environment includes supply-chain headwinds, higher input costs and some post-Covid inventory build-up.”T-6. The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 25 Hedge funds were adding The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS) to their portfolio in the first year of the pandemic, but many unloaded the stock during the third quarter of 2021. Richard S. Pzena’s Pzena Investment Management owns the largest GPS position among the funds tracked by our database, while Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management built a large stake in the company during Q3.The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS) was another fashion stock trading at bargain bin prices heading into Q4, but the stock has enjoyed a nice resurgence this quarter, gaining 76%. As noted above, high-end products tend to perform better than their counterparts during economic slowdowns, and that’s been evident at The Gap. A strong performance from the company’s Banana Republic brand, which grew comparable sales by 10% during Q3, was driven in part by the brand’s wider range of premium items.The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS)’s core brand also swung to 4% comparable sales growth after two quarters of double digit declines. All told, The Gap grew sales by 2% to $4.04 billion during Q3, which beat estimates. It was also far more profitable than analysts expected, pulling in $0.71 per share on an adjusted basis against expectations of neutral earnings.One of Lululemon Athletica Inc.

Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferre has the details.INES FERRE: And Akiko, it's important to note that when we're talking about US companies and China, there are two aspects to this. The first is the Chinese consumer and the sales and services that these US companies provide to the China market.And we have seen US companies talking about their declining sales because of the COVID lockdowns in China. For example, you had Starbucks that talked about its revenue miss because of same store sales down in China. You also have Estee Lauder, which has lowered its profit guidance. And then you've got companies like Nike also talking about its revenue down in China.Now, on the other side of this, you have the manufacturing side of this because many US companies made big bets on China as being their main manufacturing hub. And so we saw during the pandemic, the supply chain issues. You had companies that were kind of rethinking their strategy. And now with the COVID lockdowns, those recent lockdowns have also accelerated those plans.And I will leave you with this. And this is the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai's latest survey of US companies. 19% of respondents said that they were going to plan cutting their investments in China in 2022. That's up from 10% last year. And mainly one of the top reasons, or the top reason, was this zero-COVID lockdown that had been happening in China.]"

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221208006011/en/Wells Fargo Investment Institute 2023 Outlook (Graphic: Wells Fargo)The report looks closely at three key drivers: inflation, interest rates, and corporate earnings. WFII believes that the decline of inflation will be a dominant theme in 2023, shaping the trajectory of economic growth and interest rates. Highlights of WFII’s forecast include:A recession and unwinding of inflationary shocks of the past 18 months could allow inflation to decline to under 3% on a year-over-year basis by year-end 2023.A moderate recession in the first half of 2023 may lead to a contraction for the year as a whole, marked by -1.3% U.S. GDP (gross domestic product) growth.Once investors begin to anticipate economic and earnings recovery, the S&amp;P 500 Index is forecasted to gain into year-end. S&amp;P 500 Index target range is 4,300 – 4,500 for year-end 2023.Federal funds rate forecast of 3.50% – 3.75% anticipates multiple policy interest-rate reductions after rates reach a peak above 4.50% early in 2023.""The unfavorable risk-reward balance in both equities and fixed income jolted portfolio performance in 2022 and tilted our guidance more defensively for most of the year,"" said Darrell Cronk, chief investment officer for Wells Fargo Wealth &amp; Investment Management. ""And while we expect an economic recovery after midyear, we anticipate 2023 will be a volatile and challenging year for investors as we transition from a recession to a recovery, yet we believe that it may create strong opportunities to reposition for growth and back into a more pro-risk stance as the next economic recovery and bull market emerges.""Story continuesThe report provides advice and guidance, economic and market forecasts, where WFII sees opportunity, and five portfolio ideas for the coming year.Investment and Insurance Products are:• Not Insured by the FDIC or Any Federal Government Agency• Not a Deposit or Other Obligation of, or Guaranteed by, the Bank or Any Bank Affiliate• Subject to Investment Risks, Including Possible Loss of the Principal Amount InvestedRisk DisclosureForecasts and targets are based on certain assumptions and on our current views of market and economic conditions, which are subject to change.The information contained herein constitutes general information and is not directed to, designed for, or individually tailored to, any particular investor or potential investor.

(NYSE:PFE) insiders sold US$7.2m worth of stock suggesting impending weakness.,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pfizer-inc-nyse-pfe-insiders-130035685.html,1670677235,STORY,['PFE'],"[Many Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Pfizer Pfizer Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, Mikael Dohlsten, sold US$3.2m worth of shares at a price of US$49.36 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$51.72, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. It is worth noting that this sale was only 16% of Mikael Dohlsten's holding.In the last year Pfizer insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Does Pfizer Boast High Insider Ownership?I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Pfizer insiders own about US$110m worth of shares (which is 0.04% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Pfizer Tell Us?The fact that there have been no Pfizer insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Pfizer insiders selling. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. At Simply Wall St, we found 1 warning sign for Pfizer that deserve your attention before buying any shares.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

It was the front page of the Boston Globe,"" said Dr. Taha Kass-Hout.He would know. Kass-Hout had just joined the CDC, mid-outbreak, as director of Health Informatics Solutions and Operations. He began building out a surveillance system, on Amazon (AMZN) Web Services, that still exists today.""It's the same system used as a front line for COVID,"" Kass-Hout, now chief medical officer of AWS, told Yahoo Finance in a recent interview.That same system now covers 93% of the U.S. population, compared to a system that only covered 8% back in 2009, he said. With some updates, of course.CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky explained the additional rapid build out to meet the pandemic demand in 2020.""When we began collecting data on Covid cases, only a handful of health facilities were capable — even capable — of sending electronic case reports,"" Walensky said at the Bloomberg American Health Summit.Now, more than 20,000 facilities can do so in almost real time. But that only represents 22% of all hospitals registered at the federal level.Kass-Hout, now in a leading role at the largest cloud computing company — with a third of market share, said what started during the Obama administration at the federal level to incorporate more technology in government is now also being seen at state and local levels too.Attendees walk through an expo hall at AWS re:Invent 2022, a conference hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS), in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S., November 30, 2022. Noah Berger/AWS/Handout via REUTERS REUTERS THIS IMAGE HAS BEEN SUPPLIED BY A THIRD PARTY. MANDATORY CREDITBoth the FDA and CDC rely on AWS, as does the U.K.'s National Health Service, according to Kass-Hout, who previously served as the FDA's chief technology officer and first chief health informatics officer in 2013.The Minnesota Health Department also built up a governor's COVID-19 notification system ""in a matter of weeks on AWS"" without having to invest in additional technologies, Kass-Hout said.Story continuesOn the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, COVID hit just as the U.K. was withdrawing from the European Union. Residents were anxious about their health coverage and how the National Health Services (NHS) would operate in a post-Brexit world.AWS was able to help buoy an overworked call center staff, struggling with labor shortages as more employees got sick with Covid, by building up an intelligent call center that could answer some of the most frequently asked questions about coverage and, later on, about vaccines and treatments, Kass-Hout explained.It's a few paces behind ChatGPT, the natural language bot which recently captured public attention, but the real use case brings back the potential for the technology after it soured in the years after IBM Watson's decline.Industry buy-inBut it wasn't just governments that benefitted this time. Moderna (MRNA) relied on a program built on AWS, to determine the right COVID vaccine candidate, and Pfizer (PFE) and AstraZeneca (AZN) have similarly been using AWS, according to Kass-Hout.And that trend is on the rise as more life sciences companies adapt to the cloud beyond simply storing data. In fact, early stage AI modules are already being deployed to help find new treatments.""The R&amp;D is a really healthy environment where they want to experiment more. They want to try to kind of go after new indication, understand the biology more,"" Kass-Hout said.Insurers, or payers, are another segment of the health industry interested in using cloud technology. Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield, which now operates as Elevance Health (ELV), is one example of that.""They have a lot of data accumulating on members for years on end. And a lot of this data is unstructured in nature,"" Kass-Hout said.""If you look at the benefits, 90% of the data is scanned PDFs and faxes or something,"" he said.It's an obstacle the industry has known about and discussed for some time. With AWS, the company can use a text extractor and save the information into a digital file — a process that is now almost 90% automated, Kass-Hout said.""Something that used to take weeks, now they can do it in a matter of hours,"" Kass-Hout said, noting this will also help speed up the billing process.""It's really great to see how innovation's happening where you don't have to be a technologist,"" and can still benefit from technology while serving patient populations, he said.The technology isn't new, but it hasn't been leveraged in appropriate ways and new projects often fall to the wayside, according to a 2021 McKinsey report.""Cloud capabilities have the potential to generate value of $100 billion to $170 billion in 2030 for healthcare companies. The major driver of this value lies in enabling them to more effectively innovate (for example, new use cases in analytics, IoT, and automation), digitize (for example, stakeholder journey transformation), and realize their strategic objectives,"" the report said.Kass-Hout says that health care has always been a target for the technology, as a nearly $8 trillion global industry.""I do believe in the next five to 10 years, almost every health care company will be in the cloud,"" he said.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

The children in this age group who have already completed their primary regimen with Pfizer/BioNTech’s monovalent vaccine are not yet eligible to receive the bivalent vaccine dose. The data supporting the label expansion for Pfizer/BioNTech’s bivalent vaccine as a booster dose is expected in the next month.Per the FDA, the bivalent vaccines are expected to provide increased protection against COVID-19 infections. As coronavirus continues to evolve, people need to vaccinate themselves as immunity from previously-administered COVID vaccines wanes over time. Though using monovalent vaccines as booster doses have restored these antibodies to their previous levels, this protection also weakens over time. As a result, there is a huge need for booster doses, which provide protection against the new emerging subvariants and thereby prevent serious outcomes caused by the disease.Story continuesThese bivalent vaccines have also elicited a greater increase in neutralizing antibody titers against newer Omicron sub-lineages, like BQ.1.1, than the original vaccines.The bivalent vaccines contain an mRNA encoding the spike protein in the original/monovalent vaccine and an mRNA encoding the spike protein common in the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 variants.The authorization granted to Moderna is based on clinical studies on their bivalent Omicron BA.1-adapted vaccines and pre-clinical data from studies on their Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccines. The authorization to Pfizer/BioNTech is supported by data from clinical studies which evaluated their bivalent vaccine and post-authorization experience observed in individuals aged five years and older who have received the bivalent vaccine as a booster dose.Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna’s Omicron BA.4/BA.5 bivalent vaccines are already authorized for use in individuals aged five years and older.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Pfizer/BioNTech received FDA’s emergency approval for Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted COVID vaccine for kinds under five years of age. Pfizer and AbbVie ABBV announced research collaborations with private biotechs. Novartis’ NVS pipeline candidate, iptacopan provided clinically meaningful increases in hemoglobin levels in complement-inhibitor-naïve patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesU.S. Court Dismisses Zantac Lawsuit, Relief to GSK, SNY, PFE: A Multi-District Litigation (MDL) court of Southern Florida dismissed all lawsuits alleging that heartburn drug Zantac (ranitidine) causes cancer.In the MDL, plaintiffs identified five different types of cancers (liver, bladder, pancreatic, esophageal, and stomach). There were around 50,000 claims in the MDL. The court has dismissed all MDL cases alleging the five cancers.The U.S. district court verdict brought relief to companies like GSK, Sanofi and Pfizer, which marketed prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) Zantac (ranitidine) medicines. If the claims in the MDL had been proved, the liabilities of these drugmakers could have been in billions. Several personal injury cases were filed in federal and state courts, alleging that Zantac (ranitidine) medicines cause cancer. However, GSK, Pfizer, Sanofi, all denied that Zantac causes cancer, citing scientific consensus. Though several thousands of cases remain pending in various U.S. state courts and the MDL ruling can still be appealed, it meaningfully reduces the companies’ liabilities and removes a major overhang.Novartis’ PNH Candidate Meets Goal in Phase III Study: Novartis’ phase III study (APPOINT-PNH) evaluating investigational oral monotherapy iptacopan in complement-inhibitor-naïve patients with PNH met the primary endpoint. Top-line data from the study showed that a significantly greater proportion of patients who were given iptacopan (200 mg twice daily) experienced clinically meaningful increases of 2 g/dL or more in hemoglobin-level from baseline without the need for blood transfusions. APPOINT-PNH is the second study on iptacopan in PNH. The first pivotal study, APPLY-PNH, also met its two primary endpoints. Top-line results for the pivotal APPLY-PNH were announced in October. In the study, iptacopan demonstrated clinically meaningful superiority over anti-C5 treatments. Novartis will include APPOINT-PNH data in the regulatory filings of  iptacopan in 2023.Story continuesNovartis’ pivotal phase III PSMAfore study evaluating Pluvicto for treating patients with PSMA–positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have been treated with androgen-receptor pathway inhibitor therapy met its primary endpoint. In the study, Pluvicto demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in radiographic progression-free survival. This is the second phase III study on Pluvicto that has met the primary endpoint. Earlier, the phase III VISION study showed that patients with PSMA–positive mCRPC who received Pluvicto plus standard of care after being treated with other anticancer treatments like ARPI and taxane-based chemotherapy experienced statistically significant reduction in risk of death. Novartis will discuss PSMAfore phase III data with the FDA next year to seek label expansion approval. Pluvicto was approved to treat PSMA–positive mCRPC who have been treated with ARPI and taxane-based chemotherapy in the United States in March based on data from the VISION study.Pfizer Gets FDA Nod for Omicron Jab in Kids Under 5: The FDA granted emergency approval to Pfizer/BioNTech’s Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine as the third dose (3-µg) in its three-dose primary series for children under five years of age. The approval for the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 jab in this age group is not as a booster but as part of the primary series. Children in this age group get three doses as their primary series. With the emergency approval of the Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted vaccine, kids in the six months through four years age group would get two 3-µg doses of the original Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine followed by a third 3-µg dose of the Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccine as part of their three-dose primary series Pfizer is ready to ship the doses immediately once the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (""CDC"") recommends their use.Pfizer/BioNTech’s Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccine is authorized as a booster shot for people five years and above in the United States and European Union (EU).The FDA accepted and granted priority review to Pfizer’s biologics license application (BLA) seeking approval for its bivalent respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine candidate, RSVpreF for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in older adults (aged 60 and above). The FDA’s decision is expected in May 2023.Pfizer formed a research collaboration with Clear Creek Bio to develop a papain-like protease (PLpro) inhibitor, a new class of oral antivirals for treating COVID-19. Once the companies identify a PLpro candidate, Pfizer will take care of further development and commercialization activities.AbbVie’s New Collaboration and Option Deal: AbbVie announced a strategic worldwide collaboration and option to license deal with HotSpot Therapeutics for its discovery-stage, small molecule IRF5 inhibitor for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. For the deal, AbbVie will pay HotSpot an upfront cash payment of $40 million, with the latter also being entitled to up to $295 million in option fees and research and development milestones and potential commercial milestone payments.The NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index rose 0.56% in the last five trading sessions.Here’s how the eight major stocks performed in the last five trading sessions.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the last five trading sessions, AbbVie rose the most (2.7%), while Roche declined the most (1.6%).In the past six months, all the stocks were in the green, with Merck gaining the most (27.2%).(See the last pharma stock roundup here: PFE &amp; AZN Ink New M&amp;A Deals, LLY Meets Alzheimer’s Study Goal)What's Next in the Pharma World?Watch out for regular pipeline and regulatory updates next week.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Internet-Software Industry is currently in the top 24% of over 250 Zacks Industries.  Chegg CHGG Chegg (CHGG) is a meaningful investment on most fronts. Many investors are putting money aside for their children/grandchildren's future education or even trying to finish up a higher level of schooling themselves and are familiar with Chegg’s social education platform.Chegg is a popular option for students and learners to study and understand their course material. The company rents and sells textbooks, and provides eTextbooks in addition to homework help and college admissions and scholarship services.  CHGG currently lands a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with earnings estimates on the rise for FY22 and FY23.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCHGG earnings are now expected to decline -1% in 2022 to $1.28 per share but this is up 14% from $1.12 a share 90 days ago. FiY23 earnings are projected to climb 7% to $1.38 per share with earnings estimates also going up over the last quarter.Sales are forecasted to be down -1% this year but rise 7% in FY23 to $816.84 million. FY23 sales are on pace to grow an impressive 199% over the last five years.Chegg stock is down -9% YTD Vs. The S&amp;P 500’s -18%. This has also outperformed the Nasdaq’s -29%. Since going public almost, a decade ago, CHGG is up +205% to also beat the broader indexes.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTrading around $27 per share, Chegg shares trade at 21.9X forward earnings. This is nicely below the Internet-Software industry average of 45.4X. Even better, this is well below its decade high of 501X and a 79% discount from its decade median of 106.2X.Story continuesPayPal PYPL  Another popular Internet-Software stock that looks attractive at current levels is PayPal (PYPL). PayPal has become one of the largest online payment solutions providers following its independent spinoff from eBay EBAY in 2015.PayPal is responsible for making payment solutions much easier for consumers during the rise of the internet as the frequent use of the checkbook became outdated and incompatible with online purchases.PayPal’s stock may have reached oversold territory. Wall Street questioned the premium paid for PYPL earlier in the year amid rising inflation but the stock looks attractive at current levels. PYPL currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Trading around $73 per share and roughly 62% from its 52-week highs PYPL has a P/E of 23.7X. This is well below the Internet-Software industry average of 45.4X. PYPL trades 170% beneath its five-year high of 87.8X and at a 50% discount to the median of 48.1X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition to this, earnings estimates have gone higher. Earnings are now projected to decline -11% to $4.08 per share in 2022 but this is up from EPS estimates of $3.93 a share 90 days ago. Fiscal 2023 EPS is expected to rebound and pop 17% to $4.78 a share. This is also up from estimates of $4.70 a share last quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOn the top line, sales are forecasted to rise 8% this year and another 8% in FY23 to $29.88 billion. Fiscal 2023 sales would represent 68% growth from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $17.77 billion.With solid growth still expected, this year’s drop in the stock is looking more and more like a buying opportunity. PYPL is down -60% YTD to underperform the benchmark and the Nasdaq.However, since its spinoff from eBay eight years ago, PYPL is still up +100% to beat the benchmark and slightly trail the Nasdaq. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineTrading attractively relative to their past, Chegg and PayPal could see their stocks rise as we head into 2023. These popular tech companies have businesses that are well-known, beneficial, and helpful to consumers. The rising earnings estimate revisions and top line growth indicate this should continue.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Paypal (PYPL).Paypal currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.53, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 30 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.53 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 30 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 21 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 70% and 6.7% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for PYPLBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for PYPLCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Paypal here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Paypal, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is PYPL a Good Investment?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Paypal, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.9% over the past month to $4.08.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Paypal. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Paypal may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It was the front page of the Boston Globe,"" said Dr. Taha Kass-Hout.He would know. Kass-Hout had just joined the CDC, mid-outbreak, as director of Health Informatics Solutions and Operations. He began building out a surveillance system, on Amazon (AMZN) Web Services, that still exists today.""It's the same system used as a front line for COVID,"" Kass-Hout, now chief medical officer of AWS, told Yahoo Finance in a recent interview.That same system now covers 93% of the U.S. population, compared to a system that only covered 8% back in 2009, he said. With some updates, of course.CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky explained the additional rapid build out to meet the pandemic demand in 2020.""When we began collecting data on Covid cases, only a handful of health facilities were capable — even capable — of sending electronic case reports,"" Walensky said at the Bloomberg American Health Summit.Now, more than 20,000 facilities can do so in almost real time. But that only represents 22% of all hospitals registered at the federal level.Kass-Hout, now in a leading role at the largest cloud computing company — with a third of market share, said what started during the Obama administration at the federal level to incorporate more technology in government is now also being seen at state and local levels too.Attendees walk through an expo hall at AWS re:Invent 2022, a conference hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS), in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S., November 30, 2022.

MANDATORY CREDITBoth the FDA and CDC rely on AWS, as does the U.K.'s National Health Service, according to Kass-Hout, who previously served as the FDA's chief technology officer and first chief health informatics officer in 2013.The Minnesota Health Department also built up a governor's COVID-19 notification system ""in a matter of weeks on AWS"" without having to invest in additional technologies, Kass-Hout said.Story continuesOn the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, COVID hit just as the U.K. was withdrawing from the European Union. Residents were anxious about their health coverage and how the National Health Services (NHS) would operate in a post-Brexit world.AWS was able to help buoy an overworked call center staff, struggling with labor shortages as more employees got sick with Covid, by building up an intelligent call center that could answer some of the most frequently asked questions about coverage and, later on, about vaccines and treatments, Kass-Hout explained.It's a few paces behind ChatGPT, the natural language bot which recently captured public attention, but the real use case brings back the potential for the technology after it soured in the years after IBM Watson's decline.Industry buy-inBut it wasn't just governments that benefitted this time. Moderna (MRNA) relied on a program built on AWS, to determine the right COVID vaccine candidate, and Pfizer (PFE) and AstraZeneca (AZN) have similarly been using AWS, according to Kass-Hout.And that trend is on the rise as more life sciences companies adapt to the cloud beyond simply storing data. In fact, early stage AI modules are already being deployed to help find new treatments.""The R&amp;D is a really healthy environment where they want to experiment more. They want to try to kind of go after new indication, understand the biology more,"" Kass-Hout said.Insurers, or payers, are another segment of the health industry interested in using cloud technology. Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield, which now operates as Elevance Health (ELV), is one example of that.""They have a lot of data accumulating on members for years on end. And a lot of this data is unstructured in nature,"" Kass-Hout said.""If you look at the benefits, 90% of the data is scanned PDFs and faxes or something,"" he said.It's an obstacle the industry has known about and discussed for some time. With AWS, the company can use a text extractor and save the information into a digital file — a process that is now almost 90% automated, Kass-Hout said.""Something that used to take weeks, now they can do it in a matter of hours,"" Kass-Hout said, noting this will also help speed up the billing process.""It's really great to see how innovation's happening where you don't have to be a technologist,"" and can still benefit from technology while serving patient populations, he said.The technology isn't new, but it hasn't been leveraged in appropriate ways and new projects often fall to the wayside, according to a 2021 McKinsey report.""Cloud capabilities have the potential to generate value of $100 billion to $170 billion in 2030 for healthcare companies. The major driver of this value lies in enabling them to more effectively innovate (for example, new use cases in analytics, IoT, and automation), digitize (for example, stakeholder journey transformation), and realize their strategic objectives,"" the report said.Kass-Hout says that health care has always been a target for the technology, as a nearly $8 trillion global industry.""I do believe in the next five to 10 years, almost every health care company will be in the cloud,"" he said.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

But it's less well-known that some of today's latest technologies are being used for the same purpose, at scale.IBM, Friday, December 9, 2022, Press release pictureAccording to a 2022 UN report, progress in energy efficiency needs to speed up to achieve global climate goals. Not only is energy consumption a contributor to climate change if not procured from a renewable source, it's also becoming increasingly expensive to source and consume energy. Technology companies, which have a hand in designing the infrastructure that powers our global economy, can help.Hybrid cloud and AI technology can help organizations improve energy efficiencyEnergy efficiency across industries contributes to Sustainable Development Goal 12, which is a UN goal to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns. Many companies know the time to act is now to implement sustainable practices, but progress is hindered by a lack of expertise or not knowing where to start. Their challenge is to make it a true business driver while delivering ROI.One example of the energy consumption that can account for a large portion of an organization's use includes data centers and IT infrastructure. With businesses increasingly running more modern applications which can draw more power, reducing energy consumption across the data center becomes even more important with emerging technologies like AI.At IBM, we believe that hybrid cloud and AI technologies are critical enablers to meet ESG targets both internally and externally. To help clients align sustainability goals to business objectives, while complying with increasing regulatory demands, IBM offers a comprehensive portfolio of consulting and technology capabilities, including IBM LinuxONE.Watch the webinar, Harnessing AI to manage climate risk, to learn more about IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite (EIS), a modernized foundation toolkit that leverages advances in AI and data sciences to help organizations manage risk of the climate crisis.Story continuesReducing IT infrastructure energy consumptionIBM LinuxONE can help optimize the data center for energy efficiency. LinuxONE is an IT infrastructure platform that is designed to scale up and scale out, enabling clients to run hundreds of workloads on a single system, reducing the physical space needed in the data center. For example, consolidating Linux workloads on five IBM LinuxONE Emperor 4 systems instead of running them on compared x86 servers under similar conditions can reduce energy consumption by 75%, space by 50%, and the CO2e footprint by over 850 metric tons annually.[1]Further enhancing its energy-saving capabilities, LinuxONE includes the IBM Telum processor, an integrated on-chip AI accelerator that that is designed to offer clients the ability to run AI inferencing at scale. This allows for more efficiency, enabling businesses to leverage AI applications while still supporting their sustainability goals.In support of IBM LinuxONE, IBM Instana Observability provides observability dashboards of key metrics including environmental data and power consumption data to understand power consumption, temperature, humidity, and heat loads of LinuxONE hardware. Instana software brings the power of data to help clients as they work to meet sustainability targets. Take a look at this AI for Good webcast for more insight into these solutions.Meeting one of the biggest challenges of our lifetime requires utilizing the latest technologies at scale, some of which I've described. Whether it's those or others, it takes a village to make it work. Together, let's turn sustainability ambition into action.

168,db27dd89-f4df-36cc-829a-2b9c1818e938,MPC,2022-12-10,Qualys and International Flavor and Fragrances have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qualys-international-flavor-fragrances-highlighted-143202757.html,1670596322,STORY,"['QLYS', 'MPC', 'OXY', 'HES', 'SPGI', 'IFF']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – December 9, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares Qualys QLYS as the Bull of the Day and International Flavor and Fragrances IFF as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Occidental Petroleum OXY, Hess Corp. HES and Marathon Petroleum MPC.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:Qualys is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and it sports a F for Value and a B for Growth.  I love to see that sort of growth divergence where we have a weak value score and a strong growth score.  As a growth investor, that tells me right away that I am on the right path. This security company posted a beat in early November.  Let’s explore more about this company in this Bull of The Day article.DescriptionQualys, Inc. is a provider of cloud security and compliance solutions that enable organizations to identify security risks to their information technology infrastructures and help protect their IT systems and applications from cyber-attacks. The company's solutions are provided through its QualysGuard Cloud Platform. It offers products for vulnerability management, policy compliance, web application scanning, malware detection, and associated security products. Qualys, Inc. is headquartered in Redwood City, California.Earnings HistoryWhen I look at a stock, the first thing I do is look to see if the company is beating the number. This tells me right away where the market’s expectations have been for the company and how management has communicated to the market. A stock that consistently beats has management communicating expectations to Wall Street that can be achieved. That is what you want to see. For QLYS, I see four straight beats of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. That is great to see, but by itself that is not enough to make the company a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The average positive earnings surprise over the course of the last year works out to be 8.5%.Story continuesEarnings Estimates RevisionsThe Zacks Rank tells us which stocks are seeing earnings estimates move higher.Over the last 60 days, earning estimates have moved up for QLYS. This quarter has moved up from $0.90 to $0.91. Next quarter has increased from $0.94 to $0.95. The full fiscal year 2022 has increased from $3.54 to $3.62. Next fiscal year has seen the estimate move from $3.88 to $4.01. Positive movement in earnings stock is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).ValuationThe valuation for this name isn’t low, but there is solid growth. I see a forward PE of 31x which is very high, but the company is coming off a quarter that saw topline growth of more than 19%. The price to book multiple is 12x. A software name like this is an asset slim business so number is bound to be a little high. Price to sales comes in a 9x and that is a big number, but the growth is there to support it.Bear of the Day:International Flavor and Fragrances is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and recently beat earnings. Following the recent earnings beat, the stock has continued higher. This article will look at why this stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) as it is the Bear of the Day.DescriptionInternational Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. manufactures and sells cosmetic active and natural health ingredients for use in various consumer products. It operates through Nourish, Scent, Health &amp; Biosciences, and Pharma Solutions segments. The Nourish segment offers natural and plant-based specialty food ingredients. The Scent segment provides fragrance compounds. The Health &amp; Biosciences segment develops and produces enzymes, food cultures, probiotics, and specialty ingredients. The Pharma Solutions segment produces and sells cellulosics and seaweed-based pharma excipients. International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. was founded in 1833 and is headquartered in New York, New York.Earnings HistoryWhen I look at a stock, the first thing I do is look to see if the company is beating the number. This tells me right away where the market’s expectations have been for the company and how management has communicated to the market.  A stock that consistently beats has management communicating expectations to Wall Street that can be achieved. That is what you want to see.In the case of IFF, I four straight beats of the  Zacks Consensus Estimate. This alone does not make the stock a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and it doesn’t make it a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) either.The Zacks Rank does care about the earnings history, but it is much more heavily influenced by the movement of earnings estimates.Earnings EstimatesThe Zacks Rank tells us which stocks are seeing earnings estimates move higher or in this case lower. For IFF I see annual estimates moving higher of late.The current fiscal year consensus number moved lower from $5.38  to $5.60 over the last 60 days. There was a period of time that saw the estimate move lower to $5.30, but this stock will probably soon increase from a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The next year has moved from $5.97 to $5.82. That move lower is probably the biggest deciding factor for this stock to be a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Negative movement in earnings estimates like that is why this stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).It should be noted that a majority of stocks in the Zacks universe are seeing negative earnings estimate revisions. That means that the stocks that are seeing small but negative earnings estimate revisions are falling to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Additional content:U.S. Oil Prices Drop on Rising Gasoline Distillate SupplyU.S. oil prices moved down on Dec 7 after government data showed large weekly builds in gasoline and distillate supplies. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude futures fell $2.24 (or 3%) to settle at $72.01 a barrel yesterday.Despite this, the market has been kind to oil in 2022, with commodity trading considerably higher year to date and hitting $130 for the first time since 2008. Crude-related stocks like Occidental Petroleum, Hess Corp. and Marathon Petroleum.Before going into the overall macro environment for oil, let's dig deep into the Energy Information Administration’s (""EIA"") Weekly Petroleum Status Report for the holiday-shortened week ending Nov 25.Analyzing the Latest EIA ReportCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell 5.2 million barrels compared to expectations of a 2.6 million-barrel decrease per the analysts surveyed by S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights. The combination of lower imports and continued strength in refinery demand accounted for the bigger-than-expected stockpile draw with the world’s biggest oil consumer even as domestic production climbed to the highest since August.Total domestic stocks now stand at 413.9 million barrels — 4.4% less than the year-ago figure and 9% lower than the five-year average.The latest report also showed that supplies at the Cushing terminal (the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange) fell 373,000 barrels to 23.9 million barrels.Meanwhile, the crude supply cover decreased from 25.7 days in the previous week to 25.2 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 27.7 days.Let’s turn to the products now.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies increased for the fourth time in as many weeks. The 5.3 million-barrel rise was primarily attributable to lower exports. Analysts had forecast that gasoline inventories would rise 2.9 million barrels. At 219.1 million barrels, the current stock of the most widely used petroleum product is essentially in line with the year-earlier level, while it is 3% below the five-year average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) also increased for the fourth week in succession. The 6.2 million-barrel gain reflected higher production and a fall in demand. Meanwhile, the market looked for a supply build of some 1.9 million barrels. Despite last week’s addition, current inventories — at 118.8 million barrels — are 6.2% below the year-ago level and 9% lower than the five-year average.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization, at a more than three-year high of 95.5%, rose 0.3% from the prior week.Final WordEven as fears revolving around high inflation and slowing growth somewhat cloud the outlook for Oil/Energy, it has remained the best S&amp;P 500 sector this year. The space has generated a total return of more than 53% in 2022 against the S&amp;P 500’s loss of around 17.5%. Apart from a positive fundamental picture, the sector is enjoying support from geopolitical uncertainty amid Russia’s military operations in Ukraine. In March, crude prices surged to multi-year highs of $130 on concerns about supplies from Russia, which is one of the world's largest producers of the commodity.While oil has pulled back from those lofty levels, with the conflict showing no signs of a quick resolution, the risk of dwindling inventory and the influential oil exporters’ group OPEC sticking to a conservative production profile means that the commodity has got enough reasons to stay elevated in the near-to-medium term.Consequently, three of the top four gainers of the S&amp;P 500 this year are all energy-related names: Occidental Petroleum, Hess Corporation and Marathon Petroleum.Occidental Petroleum: OXY is the top-performing S&amp;P 500 stock in 2022, with a gain of 120.6%. Occidental Petroleum beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 12.7%, on average.OXY has a projected earnings growth rate of 282% for this year. Occidental Petroleum is valued at around $58.3 billion.Hess Corp.: Hess shares have appreciated 82.1% so far in 2022. HES has a projected earnings growth rate of 229.7% for this year.Hess, with a market capitalization of $41.8 billion, enjoys a Growth Score of A. HES beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters, the average being 8.1%.Marathon Petroleum: This stock is among the best performers on the S&amp;P 500 Index, with shares having appreciated 70.3% in 2022.

For 2022 and 2023, the partnership is likely to see earnings growth of 17.6% and 1.3%, respectively.Factors Working in FavorEnterprise Products, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has a stable business model and is not significantly exposed to the volatility in oil and gas prices. It generates stable fee-based revenues from its extensive pipeline network that spreads across more than 50,000 miles, transporting natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGLs), crude oil petrochemicals and refined products.The midstream infrastructure provider also has storage assets that can store more than 260 million barrels of NGL, petrochemical, refined products and crude oil. These assets can also hold 14 billion cubic feet of natural gas. Moreover, Enterprise Products has $5.5 billion of major capital projects under construction that are likely to provide incremental fee-based revenues.The partnership’s balance sheet has lower debt exposure than the composite stocks belonging to the industry. Its debt-to-capitalization ratio of 0.52 is lower than the industry’s 0.53. In fact, the ratio has persistently been lower than the stocks in the industry in the past few years. The liquidity profile of Enterprise Products is impressive, as EPD reported its consolidated liquidity at $3.3 billion, which incorporates unrestricted cash along with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facilities.RisksEnterprise Products has several assets that have been providing midstream services for many years. This has raised the possibility of investing massive maintenance capital to maintain those infrastructures. Thus, in the future, Enterprise Products could increase maintenance or repair expenses.A slowdown in drilling activities, as upstream players mainly focus on stockholder returns rather than boosting output, is hurting production. This is affecting the demand for transportation and storage demand to some extent.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked players in the energy space include Marathon Petroleum Corporation MPC, Precision Drilling Corporation PDS and NexTier Oilfield Solutions Inc.

China has the largest auto market in the world and sells by far and away the most EVs of any country.COVID-related disruptions — such as lockdowns of entire cities or plant closures — have been major disruptors for the auto industry. Just last week a major plant for Volkswagen in Chengdu was shut down, though it reopened a few days ago.“It has been a nightmare,” Wedbush senior analyst Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance regarding COVID's impact on automakers in China. “I think you're starting to see cracks in the armor for the first time in many years and obviously competition is increasing in the EV land, and I almost call it a 'Game of Thrones' going on between Tesla and others, and I think that's the heart and lungs of the EV story — there is pressure on the automakers and it is a storm to navigate.”Tesla (TSLA), which is extremely levered to its China operations for both domestic and international market supply, has had its share of issues in the past year in China. In addition to COVID-related shutdowns in the spring, now the automaker is facing demand-related issues, leading to reported plant output cuts, price cuts of its vehicles in China, and even the addition of insurance subsidies.“You're starting to see some demand cracks,” Ives said about Tesla. “I don't believe the longer term story in China is thrown out the window, I just think they're navigating now some really, for the first time in years, some growth challenges, they're cutting prices, ... some supply chain reductions, and now, we got to see not just in Q4, but 2023, 2 million units, that's the line in the sand globally.”Story continuesThat two million figure would be the goal for Tesla deliveries in 2023, representing a 50% CAGR (compound annual growth rate) that Tesla internally targets.Another big U.S. operator in China is General Motors (GM). Unlike Tesla, which operates independently, GM has had to set up various joint ventures with Chinese companies, selling under the Cadillac, Buick, Chevrolet, Wuling, and Baojun brands.“I think right now, the most underestimated story across automotive is GM,” Ives said, fresh off a visit with GM management in Detroit.“I think the transformation that [GM CEO] Mary [Barra] and the team are building on EVs, a lot of skepticism, but I believe we’re going to see two or three years from now and view it as a pivotal chapter for the company, because they ultimately own that food chain,” Ives said. “You start to do some math, I believe this could be a stock that gets significantly re-rated, and even if China for them is insignificant, in terms of what the conversion opportunity for GM is - there is a renaissance in the 313 area code between GM as well as Ford.”GM’s crosstown rival Ford (F) does operate in China, though its sales in the region of 624,000 vehicles in 2021 pale in comparison to GM’s 2.9 million sold last year.While GM, Tesla, Ford and domestic automakers like Nio (NIO) and BYD duke it out in China, Ives believes the pie is big enough for all the automakers to eat. That’s how big the China market opportunity is, with its over 1.4 billion citizens.“It is not a zero sum game and I think that's important,” Ives said. “You will see a lot of vendors continue to benefit; you still have conversion in terms of overall EVs, and the opportunity for multiple, different competitors.”—Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

This is ""What Just Happened."" I'm Pras Subramanian. Let's talk about China's auto sector. From Detroit's Big Three to Volkswagen, building market share in the nation has been a critical goal for decades. COVID put a wrench in that plan, to say the least. VW Group, one of the many taking a hit from COVID-related stoppages, though a major plant in Chengdu just reopened a few days ago.Tesla, meanwhile, suffering from ongoing demand issues, leading it to cut prices and reportedly slashing output at Shanghai Gigafactory. For more on that, let's bring in Dan Ives, senior analyst at Wedbush, who joins me now in studio. Dan, thanks for joining us. Let's talk about overall, big picture in China. What's your take on what's happening there with all the COVID-related stuff, with regards to automakers?DAN IVES: Look, it's been a nightmare. I mean, I think you're starting to see cracks in the armor for the first time in years. And obviously, competition is increasing in the EV landscape. You've seen that. I almost call it a ""Game of Thrones"" going on between Tesla and NIO, XPeng, and others. And I think that's the hearts and lungs of the overall EV bull story. So I think that you've seen a lot of pressure on these automakers. And it's a storm they need to navigate.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: You know, you mentioned Tesla. You know, we've seen reports of production cuts. They've had to cut prices as well, and actually adding some sort of insurance incentives. Are you kind of worried about Q4 for Tesla?DAN IVES: Look, I think, after the Cinderella ride for the last 3 to 4 years, they're hitting some hurdles. And I think you've seen that. And even though a lot it was-- we'll call it production or supply-chain driven, you're starting to see some demand cracks. Now, look, I don't believe the longer-term story in China is thrown out the window. I just think they're navigating, now, some really-- for the first time in years, some growth challenges. They're cutting price. You've seen some-- I'd say supply chain reductions. And now we got to see-- not just in Q4 but 2023-- 2 million units. That's the line in the sand, globally.Story continuesPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: So you think that with the sort of production-- the COVID restrictions going away, that Tesla might actually have some kind of runway here?DAN IVES: Look, I feel like that's going to-- similar to Apple, right? I think that's going to give them a little more flexibility. Because right now you got consumers locked in their apartments or houses. They're not focused on iPhones and Teslas, right, or lululemon pants. And I think that's part of the problem is that now, what's a normalized environment look like in China? Recession's clearly hit, but now I think the street's starting to look past this. And what is 2023 look like? I think that's really the focus right now, not just for Tesla, for NIO, xPeng, BYD, and others.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: So GM also, a lot of operations in China, a bunch of joint ventures there. They've also came out with their newest, like, EV game plan, an updated game plan where they're seeing profits kind of push forward a bit from those types of vehicles. Is GM kind of better positioned in China than Tesla?DAN IVES: Look, I mean, and I was there in Detroit this week, spending time at the headquarters. I think right now, the most underestimated story across automotive is GM. I think the transformation that Mary and the team are building on EV is, while I have skepticism, I believe we're going to sit here two or three years from now and view this as a really pivotal chapter for the company because of the Ultium, because they ultimately own that food chain.You start to do some math. I believe this could be a stock that gets significantly rerated. And even if China, for them, is insignificant in terms of what the conversion opportunity for GM, there's a renaissance in the 313 area code between GM as well as Ford.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: And that Dearborn rivalry, that crosstown rivalry. Back to China again, we're talking about the world's biggest car market, the biggest EV market by far and away. We talked about GM and Tesla sort of battling it out. Maybe one of those guys will be on top. But could it be BYD? I mean, they really knock it out of the park with EV and hybrid sales. Are they sort of the sleeping giant there?DAN IVES: I think they are. I think that's one-- you know, everyone knows them. But I think, under the covers, that's sort of probably one of the biggest opportunities for them, in terms of in the China market. Now, look, the golden child continues to be NIO, you know, in terms of what they're obviously doing.Look, it's not a zero-sum game, and I think that's the one that's important. You're going to see a lot of vendors continue to benefit.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: United Airlines Holdings, Inc. UAL, Ryder System, Inc. R and Air Transport Services Group, Inc. ATSG.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:3 Transportations Stocks That Might Overtake the Market in 2023The Zacks Transportation sector has been unfavorably affected by headwinds like increasing fuel costs and supply-chain woes. With oil price moving north, fuel costs flared up significantly, hurting the bottom-line performance of transportation stocks. This is because fuel expenses represent one of the major input costs for transportation players.Supply-chain woes have also resulted in elevated costs. Also, staff shortages led to multiple flight cancellations, affecting profitability in turn.Due to the abovementioned headwinds, the sector has declined 16.5% year to date.However, we would like to remind investors that despite the challenges there are multiple reasons to continue investing in the transportation sector.How Will 2023 Shape Up for Transportation Companies?The transportation sector, being widely diversified in nature, includes airlines, railroads, package delivery companies and truckers to name a few. Relaxation of COVID-19 travel restrictions and re-opening of the global economy have benefited transportation companies this year and are expected to do so in 2023 also.Airline stocks are benefiting from a solid recovery in air-travel demand as people are again booking flights, leading to higher passenger revenues, which contribute to the bulk of most airlines’ top lines.Given the upside in economic activities, freight demand continues to be strong despite minor hiccups. This supports the growth of railroad operators and transportation service providers. The Cass Freight shipments Index improved 2.9% year over year in October. The overall improving trend is evident from the fact that the measure has improved year over year in six (February, March, July, August, September and October) of the 10 months reported so far this year. We expect this trend to continue in 2023.Story continuesOnline shopping continues to gain despite the reopening of the normal market. This continued strength in e-commerce demand bodes well for packaging companies in the sector.Due to increased demand, the financial health of transportation companies has improved this year. As a result, we have seen many companies in the space hiking dividends. Dividend stocks are safe bets for creating wealth, as the payouts generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty. Investors are always on the lookout for dividend stocks as these provide a steady source of income and a cushion against market uncertainty, as is the current scenario.Considering these aforementioned favorable factors to continue in 2023 also, we believe investing in stocks like United Airlines Holdings, Inc., Ryder System, Inc. and Air Transport Services Group, Inc. seems a prudent move.3 Transportation Stocks Set to Fly High Next YearWe have picked three transportation stocks, which are set to perform well in 2023 and are backed by a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of A. These stocks have a market capitalization of more than $1 billion and are witnessing positive revisions. Additionally, these have a strong trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise history.

Because Alcoa AA is usually the first sizable company to report earnings each quarter, earnings season informally starts when Alcoa reports.Whether it is earnings season or not, savvy investors understand that it is worthwhile to follow earnings reports at any time of the year. Not only do earnings and the stock’s subsequent reactions provide clues into the company itself, but the report can also give investors an early view into essential industry trends and how the general market is absorbing earnings. Despite the dismal performance in the market this week, several companies reported stellar earnings reports and reacted accordingly. Below are some recent EPS winners and losers: Winners: Software MongoDB Inc MDB provides a general-purpose database platform. The company serves financial services, government, healthcare, media and entertainment, retail, technology, and telecommunications industries. Tuesday, MongoDB reported total revenue of $333.6 million, up 47% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $18.7 million or $0.23 per share versus $.03 per share last year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: MDB revenue estimates look favorable moving foward.While MongoDB’s fell in recent months with other tech stocks, the quarter was a potential turning point. According to Zacks Consensus Revenue Estimates for next year, the company’s growth will continue next year. One possible driver for the software firm is its burgeoning partnership with the undisputed king of software, Microsoft MSFT. The two software leaders have partnered to integrate MongoDB’s Atlas software into the Microsoft Azure Marketplace. Azure has the scale to provide MDB with a growth runway for years.Story continuesIndustry View: After a nasty correction in the software space, leading software stocks are showing that the poor macroeconomic backdrop of the past year was merely a bump in the road rather than a destination. Last week, Splunk (SPLK). Splunk develops software that enables organizations to gain insights into their business by accessing, managing, and analyzing data in real time. The software firm smashed Zacks Consensus Estimates by 97% and raised revenue and margin guidance. Box Inc BOX, a software platform that allows companies to manage internal and external data, content, and store files in the cloud, swung to a profit. Unlike most of its peers, Box is above its 200-day moving average, indicating strong relative strength. The Internet-Software Group is a top-tier group, ranking 60 out of the 251 groups tracked by Zacks.Is the post-EPS drop in Salesforce a gift for investors?Salesforce Inc CRM, the leading customer relationship platform in the world, is one of the few software stocks to fall after reporting earnings this quarter. Several high-level executives have left the company including the President and the Co-CEO in recent weeks. The founder and CEO of Slack, a key acquisition of Salesforce, also parted ways with the cloud giant. Though the recent departures are disheartening for CRM investors, the short-term weakness in the stock may spell an opportunity for longer-term value investors.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: CRM's valuation is slated to shrink over the next 12 months.Despite the drama, Salesforce remains a juggernaut in the software space and is highly profitable. Revenue, which equates to approximately $26.5 billion in FY22, grew 25% year-over-year. Both EPS and revenue grew at a double-digit pace in Q3. Moving forward, the company anticipates revenue to continue to grow at a healthy clip of 17% for 2023. The most attractive part about CRM’s stock is the shrinking valuation (pictured above). As the stock approaches levels not seen since the heat of the Covid crash, value investors may be looking to CRM stock as a late black Friday sale.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: CRM's stock price is approaching levels not seen since the Covid crash. Losers: Select RetailThis week,Lululemon Athletica LULU, the company behind a wildly popular yoga and athletic brand, was a rare post-EPS underperformer. The stock dropped by more than 10% Friday after announcing its third-quarter results. The results were strong. The company saw revenue increase 28% while EPS grew 23%. While the current results were solid, the stocks’ reaction underscores the importance of paying attention to what’s going on “under the hood” in an earnings report. According to the quarterly report, LULU’s inventory levels show $1.7 billion worth of unsold apparel, a whopping 85% increase versus last year. The Textile-Apparel Group, which LULU belongs to, ranks in the bottom 28% of all industry groups tracked by Zacks. Outside of a bounce play, LULU’s stock is an avoid at this juncture.Discount RetailDiscount retail-giant Target TGT was among the more disappointing earnings reports recently. On December 16th, the stock sliced lower by 13% after Target reported that Q3 EPS growth dropped by 49%. The disappointing news is the third straight quarter of double-digit negative EPS growth. Even though Target is a discount retailer, the company blamed weakening profit trends on inflation rates, rising interest rates, and economic uncertainty. To make matters worse, management lowered topline and bottom-line expectations for the fourth quarter.Costco Wholesale Corp COST, a company famous for providing its members discounted prices on goods when purchased in bulk, announced lackluster earnings. The company’s sales grew by 8% while EPS grew by a dull 4%. Friday, the COST reversed early losses to finish slightly higher. Though COST’s earnings were not devasting, they did not generate excitement like those in the software space. COST has been stuck in a choppy, frustrating range for the better part of a year:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: Costco stock has been stuck in a frustrating choppy period.Industry Overview:The recent earnings trends in many retail stocks have been concerning. Specifically, in the past few weeks, companies like the ones mentioned above have delivered forward-looking statements filled with uncertainty about the economic climate and the underlying businesses.

Brooks reiterated a Buy rating on the shares of Westrock Coffee Co (NASDAQ: WEST) with a $15.00 price target.In the Q3 release, the analyst highlighted two strategic actions that the company is undertaking to further accelerate the company’s growth profile, including the decision to accelerate the provisioning of Phase 2 of the new Conway FE&amp;I facility and the acquisition of Kohana Coffee.The analyst is impressed that Westrock is using the incremental ~$50 million in proceeds from the recent business combination with Riverview Acquisition to accelerate the CAPEX needed to provision Phase 2 of the Conway facility (~$100 million) to now open this phase by early FY25.The analyst added that the acquisition of Kohana Coffee provides the company with an extract and ready-to drink focused production company based in California, which will give the company an enhanced FE&amp;I production presence on the West Coast.Westrock is planning to invest $3 million to $5 million in CAPEX over the next nine months to provision a specialty canning line at the Kohana facility that should allow it to triple the unit capacity of the facility.With the acceleration of Phase 2 of the Conway facility being provisioned by the end of FY24, there is now visibility to an incremental ~$45 million of EBITDA being added to West’s earnings power annually between FY24 and FY27, noted the analyst.The analyst believes the company’s superior and highly visible growth profile deserves a premium valuation to the peer group.Price Action: WEST shares are trading lower by 1.21% at $13.90 on the last check Friday.See more from BenzingaGeneral Electric's Healthcare Spinoff On Track, Says AnalystChewy's Conservative Guidance Appropriate Amid Macro Economic Volatility, Analyst SaysTrump Received Payment In Gold Bars Wheeled To His Apartment, Among Revelations In Best-Selling BookDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

182,c5e7e762-94b6-3ccc-b0b2-86df9a214560,CSX,2022-12-10,CSX Corporation's (NASDAQ:CSX) Price Is Out Of Tune With Earnings,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/csx-corporations-nasdaq-csx-price-110109868.html,1670670069,STORY,['CSX'],"[When close to half the companies in the United States have price-to-earnings ratios (or ""P/E's"") below 14x, you may consider CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) as a stock to potentially avoid with its 16.5x P/E ratio. However, the P/E might be high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.Recent times have been advantageous for CSX as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. View our latest analysis for CSX peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on CSX.How Is CSX's Growth Trending?In order to justify its P/E ratio, CSX would need to produce impressive growth in excess of the market.Retrospectively, the last year delivered an exceptional 19% gain to the company's bottom line. Pleasingly, EPS has also lifted 36% in aggregate from three years ago, thanks to the last 12 months of growth. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been superb for the company.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 5.3% per annum over the next three years. That's shaping up to be materially lower than the 9.0% per year growth forecast for the broader market.With this information, we find it concerning that CSX is trading at a P/E higher than the market. It seems most investors are hoping for a turnaround in the company's business prospects, but the analyst cohort is not so confident this will happen. There's a good chance these shareholders are setting themselves up for future disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.The Key TakeawayTypically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.Story continuesOur examination of CSX's analyst forecasts revealed that its inferior earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E anywhere near as much as we would have predicted.

The holiday season might just prove to be the stepping stone toward this recovery as sales skyrocketed despite concerns over rising prices.E-commerce, which helped the retail sector from a total collapse during the peak of the pandemic, is once again proving to be a key player in driving sales. Given this scenario, stocks with a strong online presence, like Chico's FAS, Inc. CHS, Citi Trends, Inc. CTRN, Urban Outfitters, Inc. URBN, PC Connection, Inc. CNXN and Ross Stores, Inc. ROSTare expected to benefit in the near term.Holiday Season Driving Retail SalesAccording to the latest Mastercard SpendingPulse, the holiday season started on a high, with retail sales, excluding auto, jumping 10.9% year over year during the Thanksgiving weekend. Both in-store and online sales were robust.In-store sales rose 10.5% year over year during this period, while online sales climbed a solid 12.5% year over year for the weekend beginning Nov 24 (Thanksgiving Day) through Nov 27.Sales were primarily driven by higher purchases of apparel, electronic items and at restaurants. Sales at restaurants increased 23.3% year over year, while apparel and electronic items sales rose 14.4% and 2%, respectively.People have been compelled to spend cautiously owing to rising prices. As a result, retail sales slowed down over the following months. However, increased consumer demand has kept the retail industry from giving in to inflationary pressure. Additionally, the retail industry has been improving steadily, with sales up an impressive 1.3% in October.Retail Sales ReboundA separate report from Adobe Analytics shows that online sales on Cyber Monday were $11.3 billion, up 5.8% from the previous year. In 2021 and 2020, Cyber Monday sales totaled $10.7 billion and $10.8 billion, respectively. This year’s sales figures hit a new record after declining 1.4% in 2021.Story continuesOver the course of the weekend, retail sales increased dramatically on several days, not just Cyber Monday. Black Friday online sales hit a record high of $9.12 billion. On Black Friday, overall e-commerce sales increased 2.3% from the previous year. Black Friday sales totaled $9.03 billion in 2020.Although online sales were growing, the pandemic worked miracles for e-commerce as millions shopped online out of fear of getting the COVID-19 virus. The trend has continued since then as people have realized the convenience of shopping online.E-commerce will continue to be very important during the holidays and in the months to come. According to the Department of Commerce, Internet sales in the United States surpassed $1 trillion for the first time in the last 12 months, totaling $1.02 trillion.The initial forecast for e-commerce spending was for it to reach $1 trillion in 2024 but the market has already outperformed the prediction this year, proving its enormous potential.Additionally, during the next two months, total retail sales are anticipated to reach $210 billion.The holiday season is an important sales period for retailers. Sales have already hit record highs over the Thanksgiving weekend and with the holiday season continuing into the first week of January, the retail sector is expected to begin 2023 on a high.Our ChoicesGiven this scenario, it would be wise to invest in these four stocks with a strong online presence.

188,30f4b5ea-eec3-3e0b-9df2-c6435a99a11b,ADI,2022-12-10,3 Long-Term Picks from the Semiconductor Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-long-term-picks-semiconductor-205008027.html,1670619008,STORY,"['ADI', 'MCHP', 'MTSI', '^GSPC']","[The strong demand environment of the last few months has allowed several semiconductor players to enter into long-term, preferred-supplier or other special relationships with customers. This has improved visibility for players and stabilized revenue streams. However, the industry remains supply constrained, which is a limiting factor. Growth prospects over the next 5-10 years are excellent, because of the adoption of new technologies like AI-ML, EVs, smart cities, IoT, etc. While the longer-term outlook is extremely bright, near-term concerns related to the Fed-engineered economic slowdown and supply challenges remain. The most likely result will be increased caution at customers, who could order closer to consumption, thus reducing visibility. But this should not be a deterrent considering that valuations are supportive.  Our current picks are Analog Devices, MACOM Technology and Microchip.About the IndustryThe electronic gadgets we use to accurately read our commands, and record, store, retrieve and process the information we throw at them run on semiconductor technology, whether analog (enabling the recording and measurement of real-world information), digital (processing information available in machine-readable language) or mixed signal (enabling conversion of analog signals to digital or digital to analog among other things). Most electronic gadgets use a combination of these components, whether in consumer, industrial, auto, medical, communications, or IoT and other markets.The industry is cyclical and prices are elastic. Players usually serve multiple markets that offset their individual seasonality, or focus on certain core markets for which they have highly differentiated technology and relationships.Major Themes Driving the IndustryMost companies in this industry are positioned for strong growth this year followed by difficult comps and weaker demand in the next. It is the net effect of these companies being still somewhat behind schedule in delivering to the post-pandemic rush in demand. This in turn is because of supply chain disruption (which continues for most), driven by the pandemic, geopolitical tensions and the more recent COVID shutdowns in China. Supply constraints also impact profitability as it may be necessary to idle capacity despite demand being out there. Going into 2023, some segments are seeing orders slow down or get rescheduled, which along with the slight uptick in cancellations, points to increasing caution at customers. But many of these companies have long term agreements stretching well into 2023, which means that any softness could take longer to show up in the results.Story continues The increasing use of electronics in vehicles, airplanes and defense equipment; increased factory automation; greater penetration of smartphones, tablets, notebooks, PCs and all manner of personal computing and other personal devices and smart household appliances; communications infrastructure moving to 5G; greater reliance on cloud infrastructure; the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), more advanced medical devices, EVs, self-driving cars etc continue to expand the addressable market for semiconductor chips. The constantly expanding addressable market makes this a very attractive industry for long-term investment. This is particularly true because the industry is capacity constrained based on today’s level of digitization, but this digitization is expected to increase manifold over the next decade because of the adoption of AI, EV and other emerging technologies. Additionally, the breadth of  markets and applications ensure that even if some segments (like consumer/computing) see demand pullbacks, emerging areas like AI, EV, IoT, etc. balance them out.  The post-pandemic hybrid model, where more people move out of their homes more often but not all the time, is leading to an expansion of the overall electronic footprint of the consumer/computing segment. Near-term challenges here are related to strong uptake in the last couple of years. But there are other opportunities, including the metaverse and consumer devices incorporating newer technologies to enable more experiences. The number of semiconductors per device and their complexities also continue to increase, thus supporting demand. The adoption of 5G communications technology, enabling 10X the data rate as 4G, is another boost to analog-mixed signal sales both in base stations and end devices. Because of the multiple input (MI) and multiple output (MO) streams the technology enables in base stations, demand for sensors and power management analog including envelope tracking chips (to manage excess power flow and thus reduce heating), as well as gallium nitride (GaN) materials are increasing. Moreover, since 5G is only involved in short range signals, it is not totally replacing 4G but supplementing it, thus adding to component demand. Industry consolidation is important because the cost and complications of making chips rises in an environment where the adoption of semiconductors in devices of varying value requires prices to decline. Acquisitions are also driven by the need to expand R&amp;D capabilities and to acquire key talent. U.S. government officials worry that none of the most advanced chips are currently manufactured in the country. This is considered to be a national security concern given that semiconductors are playing an increasingly larger role in AI-driven electronic weaponry and surveillance mechanisms. So the government is trying to incentivize companies to build in the U.S. TSM, the main supplier to the U.S. is setting up in the country but the plan is to have this on a much larger scale. How exactly this situation will play out for the industry is unknown. Increasing capacity would depress prices. And U.S. production would increase cost. So much depends on the government’s contribution (perhaps through the CHIPS Act). In the meantime, the U.S. has ordered restrictions on trading with China, which is also a near-term headwind for players.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Uncertain ProspectsThe Zacks Semiconductor – Analog and Mixed industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #204, which places it in the bottom 18% of more than 250 Zacks-classified industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates uncertain near-term prospects.

This is also stretching out lead times and forcing the company to idle capacity, which hurts its profitability.Investors would also be interested to know that its strong cash flows have enabled the company to pay down a substantial portion of its debt over the last few years and also pay a consistent dividend.

According to the survey, six in 10 (59%) people are confident they could cover regular and expected medical costs like co-pays and deductibles. Nearly the same number (56%) feel similarly about unexpected medical costs like out-of-network charges and prescriptions.Despite this, the survey finds many people are not able to cover medical bills when they are due. Two in five people have experienced an unexpected medical event in the last year and, among those, seven in 10 found it difficult to pay for it. Younger respondents were among the most likely to have trouble paying.Additionally, more than one in three people (35%) have medical debt, and an overwhelming majority (82%) are struggling to resolve it. Among those with medical debt, seven in 10 respondents had debt that is either overdue or in collections. Women and those with household incomes lower than $100,000 were most likely to carry this debt, according to the survey.Further, medical expenses and debt are taking a toll on peoples' savings. Due to the cost of medical bills in the last year, nearly one-quarter of Americans has either used all their savings to cover the expenses or has been contacted by a collection agency due to medical bills.Results also show there are knowledge gaps when it comes to options for tackling medical debt. Approximately half of respondents (54%) do not know how to obtain debt relief for medical bills, use a health savings account or flexible spending account to cover costs (49%) or negotiate a medical bill (48%).Story continues""Medical events can be traumatic and unpredictable - and the resulting debt can add greater stress to the healing process. Being prepared beforehand and knowing how to address medical debt can make a significant difference to staying on track with your finances,"" said Joye Hehn, Next Step financial education manager for Regions Bank. ""Regions is committed to providing resources and information that can help families manage health care-related expenses and keep their financial goals within reach during a medical hardship.""Additional key findings of the survey include:One in three Americans has delayed going to the doctor or scheduling a procedure because of money concerns related to an unexpected medical event. Another one in five has skipped a recommended medical test or treatment altogether.For those with medical debt, 75% said daily expenses, such as food, clothing and transportation, were the greatest barriers to repayment. Other barriers included:Housing payments (53%)The financial impact of the pandemic (42%)When asked how they would cover an emergency medical expense around $1,000, 20% said emergency savings. Another 21% said credit card, and another 19% said cash.Regions Bank is highlighting free resources that are available year-round to help people prepare and stay in control of their finances when medical costs arise. This includes a series of medical financial hardship courses available in the expanded Next Step library of resources. These courses provide tips for negotiating medical bills, preventing bankruptcy, managing out-of-pocket health care costs and obtaining debt relief.""During the pandemic, many Americans found themselves without work or insurance coverage, putting a strain on their ability to pay off old medical debt or manage new expenses. Even as the pandemic eases, many still struggle with this debt,"" said Wendi Boyen, community advocacy and financial wellness manager for Regions Bank. ""At Regions, our commitment is to provide resources and financial education people need to successfully manage whatever comes their way. I'm proud of the work the team at Regions has done to raise awareness and provide valuable resources to address this critical issue impacting our communities.""Regions Next Step also recommends the following tips:Negotiate expenses with medical providers. When expenses are not covered by insurance, negotiate with the health care provider for a lower fee or longer payment timeframe. Providers may settle the debt for less than the amount owed if a lump-sum payment if made. Alternatively, providers may set up an interest-free payment plan. Learn more tips about medical payments in this article.Look for ways to keep medical costs down. Thoroughly review medical bills for errors or overcharges before paying because finding and disputing errors can potentially save money. Additionally, prices can vary across providers and insurers, so shop around for the best rates and options. Some employers offer a Flexible Savings Account (FSA) or Health Savings Account (HSA), so consider enrolling in this benefit. Both types of accounts allow people with health insurance to set aside money to help cover ""qualified medical expenses,"" which may include deductibles, copays and prescription costs. Learn more about these strategies and other tips for managing out-of-pocket healthcare costs by taking this Next Step Course.Build or maintain an emergency savings fund. Build an emergency savings fund with a goal of six months of living expenses to help offset a medical emergency expense. Calculate how much you need to save to reach it and start setting aside that money each month or paycheck. Once funds are used, be sure to replenish it. Check out this article for more tips on building your emergency savings.Create a debt payment plan. Getting debt under control takes planning and discipline. Start by determining how much is owed and create an accurate, realistic budget. Decide how much income can be put toward debt each month and commit to making those payments. Try to pay more than the minimum payment each month, and pay on time to avoid late fees. Use this Regions calculator to create a debt payoff plan.Explore debt relief options. Research debt relief services and decide what may be the best fit. Explore requirements to qualify, associated fees and tax implications. Consider debt management programs, debt settlement, transferring debt or debt consolidation loans.

Prosecutors said he placed deceptive orders for silver futures and lied about it to investigators.Jordan's attorney, James Benjamin, called the verdict disappointing and said Jordan is ""a good and honorable man who did his job in good faith.""Jordan was indicted in 2019 along with former JPMorgan global precious metals desk head Michael Nowak, precious metals trader Gregg Smith and salesperson Jeffrey Ruffo.The case was the U.S. Justice Department's most aggressive to date targeting spoofing, charging the four defendants with violating the racketeering statute, a law enacted in 1970 to take down the mafia.Nowak, Smith and Ruffo were acquitted of racketeering and conspiracy, though Nowak and Smith were convicted on multiple other charges at a jury trial in August. Prosecutors then dropped racketeering and conspiracy charges against Jordan.JPMorgan agreed in 2020 to pay more than $920 million and admitted to wrongdoing to settle with the Justice Department and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over its traders' conduct.

The real was last down 0.3%, after falling as much as 1.4% during the session. Lula, who is set to take office in January, also announced other cabinet picks after appointing former Sao Paulo Mayor Haddad, ending days of speculation about his ministerial appointments. The choice of Haddad was in line with expectations. Haddad can be portrayed as a pragmatic politician given his educational qualification and political experience, said Mauricio Une, head of South America macro strategy at Rabobank. ""I believe the market would now like to understand who Haddad will invite into his ministry and help him design economic policies."" The real's move helped it pare weekly losses to below 1%. It had jumped 3.6% last week. Data showed Brazil's consumer prices rose 0.41% in November, below market forecasts of 0.53%. ""Brazil is the world's #1 disinflation success story,"" said Natalia Gurushina, emerging markets fixed income economist at VanEck, in a note. Some other emerging market currencies fell, with South Africa's rand and Mexico's peso down about 0.9% each as the dollar cut losses after the U.S. Labor Department reported that producer prices rose more than expected last month on an annual basis. This increased hawkish anticipation for the Federal Reserve's much anticipated meeting next month where bets are that the Fed would opt for a smaller interest rate hike following four 75 basis point hikes. Mexico's peso is on course for a drop of nearly 2% on the week, in what could be its sharpest decline in four months. Top copper producer Chile's peso added 0.3% against the dollar, supported by firm copper prices as investors anticipated that China's easing of coronavirus restrictions will boost economic growth and metals demand. Peruvian markets were closed. President Dina Boluarte said she was willing to discuss early elections with the country's political and civil organizations, but ruled out kick-starting constitutional changes for the time being. Latam stocks fell 0.4% on Friday and were down 3.4% for the week, sharply underperforming their broader EM peers. However, Brazil's Bovespa jumped 0.6% with materials being the biggest boost.

It did not say when the review would be completed.The plan focuses on expanding the critical minerals sector and ""moving things forward expeditiously,"" Canada's Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said at a news conference in Vancouver.Wilkinson said the strategy, backed by nearly C$4 billion ($2.95 billion) allocated in the 2022 budget, ""is a roadmap for the creation of wealth and sustainable jobs throughout the value chain in every region of this country.""Under the strategy, companies will be offered help in applying for permits and for federal support through the Critical Minerals Centre of Excellence. The office is already operating with a team of about 15 people, said a senior government source.Critical minerals are key elements in EV batteries, electronics and solar panels and play a crucial role in the transition to the green economy. While Canada is home of some the largest deposits of critical minerals, it can take anywhere between five and 25 years for a mining project to become operational, the document said.""We recognize that, although responsible regulations are vital, complex regulatory and permitting processes can hinder the economic competitiveness of the sector and increase investment risk for proponents,"" the document reads.As the world shifts to cleaner technologies, demand for critical minerals is expected to skyrocket. Many in the mining industry have said the bureaucracy is too slow and is holding up investment.Story continues""What has been the tendency over many years is that the requirements just keep ballooning and you end up with impact assessment reports (for new mines) that are thousands of pages long,"" said Pierre Gratton, president and chief executive of the Mining Association of Canada, adding that he welcomed a review of the permitting process.""We're not looking for yet another overhaul of the federal regime. We're looking at opportunities to implement existing requirements more expeditiously. ... There are definitely opportunities to speed things up,"" he said.China dominates the market for critical minerals used in EV batteries.Countries like the United States, Canada, Australia, India and Japan want to wean themselves from their dependence on authoritarian regimes for strategically important materials.'EVERYONE WANTS A PIECE OF CANADA'Canada signed a joint action plan with the United States in 2020 to advance secure supply chains for critical minerals. It has signed similar critical minerals cooperation agreements with Japan and the European Union.""I've talked to the Americans more in the last few years than I had ever talked to them in my entire career, and also Europeans,"" Gratton said. ""Everyone wants a piece of Canada right now, and they keep knocking on our door.""The new strategy lays out priorities along the entire critical-mineral value chain, from exploration and mining to recycling old batteries, and it also covers the need for new infrastructure in often remote corners of the country.Ottawa will seek ""regulatory harmonization"" with the United States on critical minerals, the document reads without elaborating.Ottawa's strategy prioritizes developing lithium, graphite, nickel, cobalt, copper and rare earth elements. At the same time, Canada is offering a 30% tax credit to spur exploration for nickel, lithium, cobalt, graphite, copper, rare earth elements, vanadium and uranium.

While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Verizon Communications Tell Us?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much.

Instead of backing down from challenges, these CEOs faced them head-on, implementing cutting-edge business skills and insights from Verizon Small Business Digital Ready to help ramp up their marketing plans, fix their finances, and bounce back from Covid.Here, 10 inspiring entrepreneurs we met in 2022 share their stories about how Digital Ready helped transform their companies.Marketing makeovers: Using new techniques to increase reach1. Shari Raymond, CEO of Milton &amp; Goose , Stamford, CT. When demand soared during Covid for my company's heirloom-quality play kitchens, I decided to open my own manufacturing facility in my home state of Connecticut. I was so focused on product development that I hadn't placed as much attention on my marketing strategy.The Selling with Storytelling course at Verizon Small Business Digital Ready made me realize I was missing a key opportunity to market my business by sharing my journey with my customers. Starting my own factory has been rough, but being able to share this journey with others has meant everything. I began utilizing what I learned about narrative storytelling. For my company's fifth birthday, I created a short write-up about how far the company has come, weaving together the idea of raising a company and children simultaneously. Incorporating personal story and other techniques, Milton &amp; Goose saw an 18% increase in newsletter subscribers, tripled our sales performance on the birthday sale, and gained a 10% follower increase on social media.2. Janie Flores, founder of Buena Vida Media , Miami, FL. I started my public relations business 10 years ago to help small business owners and non-profits position themselves in the market and elevate their brands. But when the pandemic hit, 80% of my clientele was gone overnight. One thing I was able to keep was my radio show, Janie Flores Live. I started it five years ago and have since interviewed over 400 multi-cultural thought leaders across the southeast and the country. To support the show and purchase better broadcasting equipment, I applied for the $10,000 grant from Verizon Small Business Digital Ready. I didn't get the grant, but the learnings from the courses inspired me to get better at YouTube and use all the platforms available to connect my audience with the information they need. As a result, I launched my YouTube channel in February and have been consistently creating content and brushing up on my digital media skills ever since.Story continues3. Yudy Carrera, CEO of Events by Yudy , Bronx, NY. My mother raised us cooking and selling fish in the Dominican Republic. I moved to the United States at age 20 and worked for over 17 years, cooking and managing sales for catering companies. Today, I own my own catering company, Events by Yudy; my mother is the heart of the company. The traditional recipes of the business are from her. In 2020, I heard about the Verizon Small Business Digital Ready program and excitedly registered. I was surprised by my reaction to the courses. I was very emotional. You start a business with a dream and then you see how complicated it is. The How to Spread the Digital Word: Communications Strategy course helped me tremendously with branding, retaining current customers and attracting new ones. I have hired a social media expert and upgraded my website to drive more sales.4. Denny Rivas, founder of The Original Cap Magnet , Los Angeles, CA: One day while playing golf, I invented The Original Cap Magnet, a small magnetized patch that fits inside a hat to conveniently hold a golf ball marker. We now sell them directly to consumers from our website. But after an initial push to the market, we struggled with sales. My fiancée, Gia, heard about the Digital Ready courses through the Local Initiatives Support Corporation and jumped at the chance to get the support. We gained a tremendous amount of insight from a targeted 1:1 session with a retired Verizon employee who had years of experience in marketing. Afterward, we implemented website revisions and have since seen a 20% uptick in sales.Resilience building: Getting help and inspiration in order to take new strides5. Donna Oti of 3C Communication and Culture , Huntsville, AL. When my business partner passed away, I found myself running our brainchild, 3C Communication and Culture, an organizational development firm, on my own. My strong academic background needed a complement of business savvy, so I turned to Verizon Small Business Digital Ready courses earlier this year. The courses and 1:1 sessions pushed me to seek outside guidance on finances, change the way I market the firm, and create workflow processes. The impact has been tremendous. I have secured two new contracts that increased the company's revenue tenfold, snagged a keynote speaking role, and saved thousands of dollars by applying new money management skills. The marketing courses and group discussions led me to redo my website, which in turn has led to a big increase in traffic. But the best part of my experience with Digital Ready has been networking at the virtual Community Connect event. I get to talk with my peers who are experiencing what I am experiencing. It's a no-judgment zone.6. Ronda Stone, co-Founder of Ghot Wingz , East Nashville, TN. In 2008, my husband James and I took a leap of faith and started our restaurant Ghot Wingz. Due to our great location and delicious wing flavors, Ghot Wingz survived the financial crisis as well as the pandemic. Still, with the wholesale cost of wings skyrocketing, I applied for and received the $10,000 grant available at Digital Ready. With the funds, we've been able to offset the cost of wings and continue to offer our customers affordable prices. The information in the Digital Ready courses has also been vital; it inspired us to cut out a third-party vendor and use different money management techniques, which has resulted in us saving a nice amount of money. We are now making plans to open our second location.7. Martu Freeman-Parker, CEO of M.E.F Productions , Fort Lauderdale, FL. The pandemic altered everything for me. While M.E.F Productions has always offered fashion-design coaching and workshops as part of its business, my product went from one-on-one and in-person, to me doing workshops and boot camps online. I signed up for Verizon Small Business Digital Ready to boost my business acumen. Through the courses, I realized I had a new demographic to market to, and that I needed to implement Search Engine Optimization (SEO) to reach target audiences. I took the Selling With Storytelling course, which inspired me to upgrade the content on my website; it has helped me continue to grow my business on a global scale.Scaling the business: Getting keener on business skills to reach bigger markets8. Jevon Wooden, CEO of Live Not Loathe , Houston, TX. I typically advise my business coaching clients to look inside before they start revamping their work lives. Recently, I took a look at my own business strategies while taking courses through Verizon Small Business Digital Ready. I learned to really plan and delegate. I hired an executive assistant to handle client research, PowerPoint slides and graphics. Just relinquishing control has been awesome. I can now focus on the big picture: going global. This year, I accepted a coaching contract in Europe. Next, is Africa.9. Margo Clayson, founder of The Mighty Microgreen , Inksom, ID. I had been growing and selling microgreens for the past four years - as well as educating more than 2,000 customers about these seedling forms of edible plants - when I decided to pivot my business, The Mighty Microgreen. Instead of only selling the freshly harvested microgreens, I wanted to develop a product: an educational kit to inspire children to grow and eat microgreens. With no formal business background, I sought support from Verizon Small Business Digital Ready. After taking several courses and 1:1 coaching sessions, I evolved my product-and website-towards being a one-stop educational resource for growing microgreens sustainably. Every Verizon course and session I've taken I have found useful. My new website is live and going great!10. Samantha Sinclair, CEO of Pathway to Purpose in Brooklyn, NY. Pathway to Purpose is an education innovation company that makes college prep fun. During Covid, as our client load dropped, we decided to focus on developing our Prep-On-Demand software product; our goal is to roll it out to 1 million people over the next five years. I opted to take courses from Verizon Small Business Digital Ready to brush up on my business skills. I took the Winning Contracts and Selling with Storytelling courses, which optimized my proposal grant writing and helped me create the perfect business pitch. We are now ready to pitch to anyone and deliver our product nationally.Verizon Small Business Digital Ready provides free personalized courses, live coaching, networking, micro mentorship, and grant opportunities for eligible small businesses.

Integrated with the Verizon Connect fleet management system, the all-in-one ELD solution now provides customers with the reliability and flexibility needed to simplify compliance with the new hours of service (HOS) regulations in Canada.According to Transport Canada, approximately 30,000 trucks cross the Canada-U.S. border on an average day, employing thousands of workers and carrying more than $1 billion in trade—including critical supplies of food and medicine, as well as goods produced at some of the largest manufacturing plants in both countries. As fleet managers gear up for the busy holiday season, as well as the January 1, 2023 enforcement deadline of the Canadian ELD mandate requiring motor carriers to equip each operating commercial vehicle with a compliant ELD, choosing a reliable ELD provider will be paramount for business growth and safety. “Road and driver safety and security should always be the number one priority,” said Erin Cave, Director, Product Management, Verizon Connect. “Obtaining the Canadian ELD Certification for Fleet is just another example of Verizon Connect’s commitment to our customers who are traveling across borders every day to keep the world connected.” The ELD certification program involves a rigorous process that determines whether an ELD is compliant with the Technical Standard for Electronic Logging Devices and is based on the ELD Test Procedure developed by the National Research Council of Canada. Verizon Connect’s certified ELD solution helps make Transport Canada compliance less of a burden with fleet management system integration and 24/7 mobile app support for commercial drivers. Verizon Connect continues to be recognized for product innovation. In 2022, Verizon Connect has earned more than eight industry awards. Most recently, Verizon Connect was named #1 in innovation by ABI Research in its 2022 Commercial Telematics Vendors competitive ranking report for providing more than just vehicle and asset tracking data. Other recent awards include: IoT Breakthrough Awards’ M2M Vehicle Telematics Solution of the Year, New Product or Service of the Year: Automotive, Transportation, Storage, and Logistics for the 6th Annual American Best in Business Awards and TechRadar's Best GPS Tracking Solutions of 2022.Story continuesLearn more about Verizon Connect’s commitment to guiding a safe, connected world on the go through ELD and Compliance.Verizon Communications Inc.

202,687d8dc8-1673-3a69-93e6-d6aed80b3ee7,TPR,2022-12-10,Why Is Inter Parfums (IPAR) Up 18.1% Since Last Earnings Report?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-inter-parfums-ipar-18-163004726.html,1670603404,STORY,"['IPAR', 'TPR', 'EL']","[It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Inter Parfums (IPAR). Shares have added about 18.1% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Inter Parfums due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Inter Parfums Q3 Earnings Beat Estimates, 2022 View UpInter Parfums delivered impressive third-quarter 2022 results, with the top and the bottom line increasing year over year. Quarterly earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Management raised its 2022 guidance.Results in DetailInter Parfums’ third-quarter earnings came in at $1.30 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 99 cents. The metric increased 8% from $1.20 per share reported in the year-ago quarter.Quarterly net sales increased 7% to $280 million compared with $263 million reported in the year-ago quarter.In an earlier press release, management highlighted that third-quarter net sales rose 12% at comparable foreign currency rates. Inter Parfums’ Europe-based product sales came in at $198 million, down 4% from 2021 levels. U.S.-based product sales amounted to $82 million, surging 45% from third-quarter 2021. In the company’s U.S. operations, new brands like Ferragamo, Donna Karan and DKNY generated 41% of the gains. Apart from this, organic growth from established brands like GUESS?, Oscar de la Renta, Hollister, and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch also contributed to the upside. Management highlighted that sales of its European operations increased 12% in euro, with the three largest brands Montblanc, Jimmy Choo and Coach, outperforming by 11%, 32% and 3% year over year, respectively. Several mid-sized brands, namely Kate Spade, Rochas, Boucheron, Van Cleef &amp; Arpels and Karl Lagerfeld also witnessed comparable quarter sales growth. That being said, a 17% decline in the average euro-to-dollar exchange rate masked such an upside resulting in a 4% drop in the quarterly European-based product sales in dollars. Inter Parfums stated that it witnessed modest growth in the third quarter compared with the year-ago quarter. The company continued to face some supply chain-related issues, which pushed the delivery of some holiday gift sets into the next quarter. That said, the company’s Italian operations are running, with Ferragamo on track to become the second-largest brand under the U.S. operations banner during the year. Inter Parfums continues to see solid momentum in its travel retail business. The company’s travel amenities operation has started to experience growth.Inter Parfums’ third-quarter gross profit margin was 64.9%, up 120 basis points from 63.7% reported in the year-ago quarter. For European-based operations, the gross profit margin was 69.5%, up from 66.6% posted in the year-ago quarter. The upside can be attributed to a stronger U.S. dollar during 2022 and a favorable impact from mix and pricing actions. However, higher transportation and component costs were a concern for the metric. For U.S. operations, the gross margin stood at 53.8%, up from 53.1% reported in the year-ago quarter. Gains from scale, pricing actions and favorable brand and giftset mix contributed to the upside.SG&amp;A expenses amounted to $117.4 million, up from $99.8 million reported in the year-ago quarter. For European operations, SG&amp;A expenses increased to 42.1% of net sales from 38.8% reported in the year-ago quarter. The rise in such costs can largely be attributed to a return to promotional and advertising levels commensurate with sales. For U.S. operations, SG&amp;A, as a percent of net sales, rose to 41.4% from 35.1% reported in the year-ago quarter. Apart from the abovementioned reason, rising salaries and benefits to expand the organization to support the startup of new brands were a downside.Story continuesOther Financial AspectsInter Parfums ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $41.3 million, long-term debt (excluding the current portion) of $107.9 million and total equity of $730.1 million. Inter Parfums announced a quarterly dividend of 50 cents per share, payable on Dec 30, 2022, to shareholders of record as of Dec 15, 2022.Other UpdatesDuring 2022, the company introduced several scents, namely Montblanc Legend Red, CoachWild Rose, Coach Dreams Sunset, Coach Open Road, GUESS Uomo, Kate Spade Sparkle, Jimmy Choo ManAqua, Jimmy Choo I Want Choo Forever, Lanvin Mon Éclat and Boucheron Singulier. The company also launched brand extensions and flankers for several brands. In addition, the company unveiled Moncler’s debut scents at the beginning of 2022. For the next year, the company’s new product pipeline for U.S. brands consists of new pillars for the Hollister and MCM brands. Moreover, the product pipeline is dominated by brand extensions and flankers. Management is on track with major launches for Ferragamo, Donna Karan and DKNY brands for 2024. In European operations, the company will launch a new fragrance for Kate Spade in 2023.GuidanceThe company continues to battle inflation, supply chain disruptions, COVID-19 restrictions in China, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and fears of recession worldwide. Despite that, management is raising its 2022 guidance considering solid year-to-date performance and robust projections for the rest of the year. The company is optimistic about its business prospects and continues to invest to keep gaining market share and long-term growth. Management now expects 2022 net sales of $1.025 billion, up from previous guidance of $1 billion. EPS are anticipated to come in at $3.40, higher than the earlier guidance of $3.25. The company expects to spend 21% of annual net sales on advertising and promotion in 2022. The guidance is based on the assumption of no major resurgence in coronavirus cases and the current level of the average dollar/euro exchange rate.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.The consensus estimate has shifted -55.18% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Inter Parfums has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the bottom 20% quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Inter Parfums has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerInter Parfums is part of the Zacks Cosmetics industry. Over the past month, Estee Lauder (EL), a stock from the same industry, has gained 10.8%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended September 2022 more than a month ago.Estee Lauder reported revenues of $3.93 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -10.5%. EPS of $1.37 for the same period compares with $1.89 a year ago.Estee Lauder is expected to post earnings of $1.29 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -57.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions translate into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Estee Lauder.

Part of the planning process includes considering the dates of your visit. Should you try to time your visit to a Disney park during a specific season or holiday for the best possible experience?See: What Is the Highest Rated Luxury Cruise Line?Learn: 3 Ways Smart People Save Money When Filing Their TaxesHere are some of the best times of year, and when to skip making a visit, for enjoying and getting your money’s worth from the parks. Plan Your Visit During the ‘Shoulder Seasons’It’s not a secret the parks are so popular. “No matter which time of the year you go, Disney parks are generally busy year-round,” said Keri Baugh, a travel writer at the family travel blog Bon Voyage With Kids and a former Disney parks cast member.Families planning a visit, however, should schedule their trips in the shoulder seasons. These include around September, November (excluding Veteran’s Day and Thanksgiving weekends) and late January to early February. Visits made during the shoulder seasons afford families with more room and fewer crowds.Take Our Poll: How Big of a Sign-Up Bonus Would It Take for You To Change Banks?Late January/Early FebruaryIt may feel somewhat of a bummer to visit Disney parks after the holidays and in the late January to early February months, but it’s actually a win.“What I tell people is, particularly in January, you may find more ‘pardon our pixie dust’ signs with rides and areas under renovation, as the crew takes advantage of the less crowded times to spruce up the parks,” Baugh said. “With fewer crowds, it is easier to access more rides, get more coveted reservations and rooms at desired hotels.”When To Avoid Visiting Disney ParksThe best time of year to avoid visiting Disney parks, whether you’re traveling with family or with friends, are the holiday weekends. Baugh said, “these include President’s Day, Veteran’s Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas (as well as Christmas through New Year’s), Easter, spring break, Memorial and Labor Days.”Story continuesThe simple reason to avoid the parks during these times? Crowds, which can become more of a financial issue than many realize.“When I worked there, these holidays were so crowded, the Parks would be closed due to reaching capacity each day. Some people don’t realize this and are extremely disappointed,” Baugh said.Spring break is another busy time of year for visitors heading to Disney parks. However, savvy visitors and their families can still make it work to their financial advantage. Baugh recommends doing a lot of thoughtful and advanced planning. This includes taking advantage of Early Theme Park hours (for guests of the Disney Resort Hotels), Disney Genie+ and the Lightning Lane Pass to enjoy the rides, dining and have a full trip.How To Get Your Money’s Worth in the Shoulder SeasonsLet’s say your family does plan to visit Disney parks during the recommended times Baugh mentioned above: September, November, late January or early February. What can you do to get your money’s worth from the trip?Plan early: Baugh recommends booking Advance Dining Reservations 60 days out. Visitors may also take advantage of Early Theme Park Entry, Genie+ and Lightning Lane Passes to help you maximize your money.Buy Disney Gift Cards: Head to somewhere like Costco or Target with your RedCard. Baugh said you can get up to 5% off the price of a Disney gift card, but get full value to pay for the cost of your trip. “You can use them to pay for your trip, and if you get enough, the discount can save you quite a bit of money, further maximizing your dollar for your Disney vacation.”More From GOBankingRates6 Types of Retirement Income That Aren't TaxableDo You Have a Tax Question?

REUTERS/Mike BlakeThe rise in its popularity, Piacenza said, is indicative of the success it's having in rebranding itself, along with ""an increased awareness and interest"" in the metaverse. More companies have shown interest in investing in the virtual reality space.""You can't think of the metaverse without speaking about Meta,"" she said.American footwear company Crocs (CROX), which took the second spot on the list, is another company seeing a renewed interest among consumers.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.The company reported record revenue in 2022, topping $985 million in its most recent quarterly results. In under a year, Crocs' revenue has grown by over 50%.""They've had a really successful year of not alienating their core audience, who are just as concerned with comfort and affordability, and also chasing after trends,"" Piacenza said. ""Staying trendy with their different accessories, that balance is really benefiting Crocs.""The inflation effectInflation appeared to have an impact on Morning Consult's overall findings as many consumers pulled back on discretionary spending.Story continuesFor example, subscription-based businesses like Paramount+ (PARA), HBO Max (WBD), and Peacock (CMCSA) were among the top-growing brands in 2021 but didn't make the cut this time around.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.“Average purchasing considerations for 2022 declined this year,"" Piacenza said. ""That's different from the past three years, [and] that includes the really traumatic COVID years that had better purchasing consideration among brands. What that means for consumers is they're not buying more of their favorite brands, and I think really importantly for new and emerging brands, they're not necessarily trying out new brands on the market.""Consequently, newer brands on the Morning Consult list include several cost-saving alternatives.Breeze Airways, a Utah-based budget airline, and Roku (ROKU) — a digital streamer that uses a low-cost, ad-based subscription model — were among the top 10 fastest-growing brands for Gen Zers. Travel and hotel brands also appeared on the Gen Z list.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.“Gen Z really missed out on a lot of the travel excursions that a lot of us experience as we enter adulthood,"" Piacenza said. ""That's because a lot of them were entering adulthood and coming into more discretionary funds as COVID was hitting. So they are experiencing a lot of these hotel brands, travel brands, and airline brands really for the first time this year.""However, things are less exciting for millennials in terms of financial wellness, which is less than stellar, she noted. They have very low average purchasing considerations compared to other generations.“This is the generation that is struggling to purchase a home,"" Piacenza said. ""This is a generation that has young kids. Child care costs, that adds up. They're not a generation that's going to be going after new brands, spending a lot of money — something for these consumer-facing brands to keep in mind.""—Tanya is a data reporter at Yahoo Finance.

J won a four-year U.K.'s nuclear regulator contract to provide specialist engineering and technical support services to the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR). The framework includes the ONR's activities in new construction, power generation, decommissioning and defense.For more than 20 years, Jacobs has supported the regulator with technical safety advice and assessment. The new contract reflects J’s successful track record and technical experience.Jacobs’ Energy, Security &amp; Technology’s senior vice president, Karen Wiemelt, said, ""Our understanding of existing power plants and close involvement with new developments in fission and fusion power is especially valuable to the regulator while the nuclear industry is expanding to deliver energy independence and security, furthering the U.K.'s aim to become a net-zero carbon economy by 2050.""Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAlthough on Dec 8, J’s shares slipped 0.67%, it has outperformed the Zacks Engineering - R and D Services industry in the past three months. Earnings estimates for fiscal 2023 suggest 6.9% year-over-year growth.Solid Project Execution to Drive GrowthJacobs is witnessing a rising demand for infrastructure, water, environment, space, broadband, cybersecurity and life sciences consulting services. Recently, it received an energy contract from the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) to support its fusion energy research program. J has been appointed to all lots of the new Plant Maintenance and Operational Support Services (PMOSS) framework.Over the decades, it has supported the UKAEA-managed Joint European Torus and ITER. Growth in fusion research is creating new opportunities for Jacobs' engineers in various disciplines, including electrical, control and instrumentation, process plants, mechanical, chemical and nuclear and for scientists specializing in chemistry, physics and materials.Efficient project execution has been a primary factor driving Jacobs’ performance over the last few quarters. The company’s solid backlog level is a testimony to this fact. At the end of the fiscal fourth quarter, J reported a backlog of $27.9 billion, up 5% year over year. This reflects the persistent and solid demand for Jacobs' consulting services.Of this backlog, Critical Mission Solutions (CMS) accounted for $10.56 billion, slightly down from a year-ago figure. Despite a slight decrease in backlog, the segment benefits from well-funded government programs as well as cyber, U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), mission-IT, space, nuclear and 5G-related projects.People &amp; Places Solutions’ (P&amp;PS) backlog at fiscal third quarter-end was $17 billion, up from $15.74 billion a year ago. The P&amp;PS segment’s overall sales pipeline has increased as both life sciences and electronics customers have moved forward with previously paused projects.Jacobs’ Focus 2023 initiative entails more than $200 million in benefits versus fiscal 2020. Jacobs expects that by 2023, its transformative initiative, which will provide Jacobs with the flexibility to materially invest in the business, will drive growth through technology-enabled solutions.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Key Construction PicksCurrently, Jacobs carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

The top and bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This marks the company’s 20th consecutive quarter of earnings beat.However, on a year-over-year basis, earnings and revenues declined. RH expects continued softness in business trends due to weakness in the housing market that will likely persist over the next several quarters and the Federal Reserve’s anticipated interest rate hikes.Earnings, Revenues &amp; Margin DiscussionAdjusted earnings of $5.67 per share topped the consensus mark of $4.72 by 20.1% but decreased 19.3% from the year-ago figure of $7.03.RH Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise RH Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseRH price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | RH Quote Adjusted net revenues of $869.1 million surpassed the consensus mark of $839.1 million by 3.6% but fell 13.7% on a year-over-year basis. Yet, revenues outpaced its revised guidance, backed by its solid promotional moves and long-term investments.Adjusted gross margin contracted 50 basis points (bps) to 49.7% for the quarter. The decline was due to fixed occupancy deleverage.Adjusted selling, general &amp; administrative expenses rose 640 bps to 28.9% of total revenues. Adjusted operating margin contracted 690 bps year over year to 20.8%. Adjusted EBITDA declined 30.4% year over year to $216.2 million for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin also contracted 600 bps year over year to 24.9%.Store Update &amp; Balance SheetAs of Oct 29, there were 67 RH Galleries, 39 outlet stores, one Guesthouse and 14 Waterworks showrooms operational.In the fiscal third-quarter end, RH’s cash and cash equivalents were $2,154.3 million compared with $2,177.9 million in the fiscal 2021 end (ended Jan 29, 2022). The company ended the fiscal third quarter with merchandise inventories worth $819.3 million compared with $734.3 million at the end of fiscal 2021. RH ended the quarter with net debt of $375.2 million.Net cash provided by operating activities was $336 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2022 compared with $533.7 million in the comparable year-ago period. Adjusted free cash flow totaled $101.7 million in the third quarter fiscal end versus $145.3 million a year ago.For the trailing 12-month period, total net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 0.4. Adjusted capital expenditures for the reported period were $59.2 million compared with $78.6 million a year ago.Story continuesTepid ViewBased on the current market conditions, RH now expects net revenues to decline 3.5-4.5% compared with 3.5-5.5% expected earlier. The latest projected figure indicates a decline from the 32% growth reported in fiscal 2021.For the entire year, RH now expects an adjusted operating margin within 21.5-22% (compared with 21-21.5% of earlier projection).

Let’s take a closer look at each one.MicrosoftWe’re all familiar with Microsoft, the mega-cap titan that’s one of the largest broad-based technology providers in the world. Currently, MSFT is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The company’s annual dividend currently yields 1.1%, a tick above its Zacks Computer and Technology sector average.Impressively, MSFT has upped its dividend payout five times over the last five years, translating to a nearly 10% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMicrosoft is one of the biggest cash-generating machines in the S&amp;P 500; in its latest release (2023 Q1), the company reported free cash flow of a sizable $16.9 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTexas Instruments Inc.Texas Instruments is an original equipment manufacturer of analog, mixed-signal, and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits. Currently, TXN carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).TXN’s annual dividend currently yields a solid 2.8% paired with a payout ratio sitting sustainability at 49% of its earnings. As we can see, the company’s current yield handily surpasses its Zacks sector average.Story continuesTXN’s payout has grown by an inspiring 15% over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, the company has been on a strong earnings streak as of late, exceeding earnings and revenue estimates in four consecutive quarters.In TXN’s latest print (2022 Q3), the company registered a 3.4% bottom-line beat paired with a 2.7% sales surprise. Below is a chart illustrating the company's revenue on a quarterly basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOracleOracle is one of the largest enterprise-grade database, middleware, and application software providers, offering cloud solutions and services that can be used to build and manage various cloud deployment models.ORCL has witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions over the last several months, helping land the stock into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).As it stands, ORCL’s annual dividend yield comes in at 1.6%, nicely above its Zacks sector average. In addition, Oracle has increasingly rewarded its shareholders, carrying a 14% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOracle’s growth profile is also solid; earnings are forecasted to climb a modest 1.2% in its current fiscal year (FY23) and a further 11% in FY24. The projected earnings upticks come paired with forecasted Y/Y revenue growth of 17% in FY23 and 6.8% in FY24.Like MSFT, it’s hard to ignore the company’s cash-generating abilities; in its latest earnings release (2023 Q1), Oracle reported free cash flow of $4.6 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineTechnology isn’t a typical sector that income-focused investors flock to.

Each of the four tech companies is guaranteed at least $100,000 under the contract.We note that the latest Pentagon decision has taken the cloud computing game to another level among the abovementioned tech giants.Deal Bodes Well, Cloud ProspectsThe latest contract bodes well for the companies’ prospects in the booming cloud computing space.Our world’s fast-paced, data-driven nature has made cloud technology almost indispensable to businesses globally.Growing adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and big data within the cloud infrastructure remain the key catalysts in the infrastructure as a service (IaaS) market.According to the Fortune Business Insights report, the global cloud market is expected to hit $480.04 billion in 2022 and reach $1.7 trillion by 2029 by witnessing a CAGR of 19.9% between 2022 and 2029.According to a Facts and Factors report, the market is likely to hit $1.025 trillion by 2028 at a CAGR of 15.8% between 2022 and 2028.Per Grand View Research data, the underlined market is likely to experience a CAGR of 15.7% over the period of 2022-2030.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT &amp; ORCL Placed WellThe latest win and these tech giants’ constant efforts place them well to capitalize on the immense growth prospects in the cloud computing market.Moreover, the Pentagon contract highlights the robustness and reliability of the cloud computing platforms of these tech giants.Amazon, the dominant player in this market, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is continuously riding on its well-performing cloud platform — Amazon Web Services (“AWS”). The platform has been helping the company maintain its leading position on the back of its growing adoption, popularity and strong services portfolio.It recently unveiled many news services like Amazon DataZone, Amazon Security Lake, AWS SimSpace Weaver, AWS Supply Chain and AWS Clean Rooms, among others.Apart from portfolio strength, the company’s increasing number of regions and availability zones remains noteworthy. Currently, AWS is operating 90 availability zones across 28 geographic regions.These endeavors are likely to continue aiding AWS’ dominance in the cloud computing market and drive the top line in the days ahead.In third-quarter 2022, AWS generated revenues of $20.5 billion (16% of total sales), which grew 27% year over year. In the same quarter, AWS accounted for 32% of the global cloud spending, maintaining its leading position in the cloud market, per the Canalys report.Microsoft, carrying a Zacks Rank #3, is currently riding on the robust adoption of Azure cloud offerings. Azure's increasing number of availability zones and regions globally and strength in its consumption-based business will likely continue driving Microsoft's cloud momentum in the near term.In the recently reported first-quarter fiscal 2023, Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud segment, including Azure cloud services and server and enterprise products, generated $20.3 billion (40.6% to total revenues). The metric increased 20.2% year over year.

Shares have added about 8.9% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Wendy's due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Wendy's Q2 Earnings Beat Estimates, Revenues MissWendy's reported mixed second-quarter fiscal 2022 results, with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues missing the same. The top line rose year over year, while the bottom line declined on a year-over-year basis.Q2 Earnings &amp; RevenuesDuring the fiscal second quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings of 24 cents per share. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 22 cents. However, the bottom line fell 11.1% year over year from adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 27 cents reported in the prior-year quarter.Quarterly revenues of $537.8 million fell short of the consensus mark of $541 million. However, the top line increased 9% on a year-over-year basis. The upside was primarily driven by higher sales at company-operated restaurants (which benefited from the acquisition of 93 franchise-operated restaurants in Florida in fourth-quarter 2021) and higher same-restaurant sales. Also, a rise in franchise royalty revenue and advertising funds revenue added to the upside.During the quarter under review, same-restaurant sales at International restaurants (excluding Venezuela and Argentina) rose 15.2% year over year compared with growth of 31.4% in the year-ago quarter. Comps at Global restaurants rose 3.7% year over year compared with a 17.4% increase reported in the prior-year quarter. Comps in the United States witnessed an improvement of 2.3% year over year compared with an increase of 16.1% in the prior-year quarter.Story continuesIn the quarter under review, Wendy’s inaugurated 47 restaurants globally, reflecting an increase of 24 net new units.System-Wide Sales DiscussionDuring the fiscal second quarter, global system-wide sales — including company-operated and franchise restaurants — were nearly $3.4 million, up 5.2% year over year. During the quarter under review, system-wide sales in the U.S. and the International segments were approximately $3 million and $0.4 million, up 3.6% and 18.4% year over year, respectively.Operating HighlightsDuring the fiscal second quarter, the company-operated restaurant margin came in at 14.5%, compared with 20.3% in the year-ago quarter. The downside was primarily due to higher commodity and labor costs, a decline in customer counts and increased investments (to support the entry into the United Kingdom market). However, this was partially offset by a higher average check.General and administrative expenses in the quarter were $61.6 million compared with $63.1 million reported in the prior-year quarter. This was primarily on account of a lower incentive compensation accrual.Quarterly operating profit amounted to $96.3 million, down 24% from the year-ago quarter. The decline was primarily due to lower system optimization gains (driven by lapping the sale of the New York market in the prior year quarter) and a decrease in company-operated restaurant margin. However, this was partially offset by a rise in franchise royalty revenue.Net income during the fiscal second quarter was $48.2 million, down 26.7% from $65.7 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The downside was primarily due to a decrease in operating profit and higher interest expense (owing to the company's debt raise in the first quarter of fiscal 2022).Adjusted EBITDA during the quarter totaled $132.9 million, up 1.4% from $131.1 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The upside was primarily backed by higher franchise royalty revenue and lower general and administrative expenses. However, this was partially offset by a decline in company-operated restaurant margin.Balance SheetCash and cash equivalents as of Jul 3, 2022, totaled $700.8 million compared with $741.2 million on Apr 3, 2022. Inventories at the end of the fiscal second quarter amounted to $6.5 million compared with $5.9 million reported in the previous quarter. As of Jul 3, 2022, long-term debt was $2,832.8 million compared with $2,836.8 million at the end of Apr 3, 2022.The company declared a quarterly dividend of 12.5 cents per share. The dividend will be paid out on Sep 15, 2022, to shareholders on record as of Sep 1, 2022. In the fiscal second quarter, the company repurchased 2.8 million shares.2022 OutlookFor 2022, the company continues to expect global system-wide sales growth to be 6-8%. Adjusted EBITDA is projected in the band of $490-$505 million. Adjusted EPS for 2022 is anticipated to be 84-88 cents, up from the prior estimate of 82-96 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings is pegged at 82 cents. The company anticipates cash flow from operations in the band of $305-$325 million, while capital expenditures are projected between $90 million and $100 million. Free cash flow is anticipated to be $215-$225 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.The consensus estimate has shifted -7.17% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Wendy's has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Wendy's has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerWendy's is part of the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry. Over the past month, Yum Brands (YUM), a stock from the same industry, has gained 4.6%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended September 2022 more than a month ago.Yum reported revenues of $1.64 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.1%. EPS of $1.09 for the same period compares with $1.22 a year ago.For the current quarter, Yum is expected to post earnings of $1.21 per share, indicating a change of +18.6% from the year-ago quarter.

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 69% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of McDonald's, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for McDonald's ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About McDonald's?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.McDonald's already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see McDonald's' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in McDonald's. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.2%. With 6.8% and 4.7% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of McDonald'sThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of McDonald's Corporation. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$186m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 31% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Based on this payment, the dividend yield for the company will be 1.5%, which is fairly typical for the industry. View our latest analysis for PACCAR PACCAR's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWe like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. Before making this announcement, PACCAR was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 16.5% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 51%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityAlthough the company has a long dividend history, it has been cut at least once in the last 10 years. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $1.50 in 2012, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $1.48. Dividend payments have shrunk at a rate of less than 1% per annum over this time frame. A company that decreases its dividend over time generally isn't what we are looking for.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowGiven that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. PACCAR has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 14% per annum. A low payout ratio and decent growth suggests that the company is reinvesting well, and it also has plenty of room to increase the dividend over time.PACCAR Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that PACCAR is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 1 warning sign for PACCAR that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at PPL’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for PPL What Is PPL Worth?According to my valuation model, PPL seems to be fairly priced at around 15.21% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy PPL today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $25.13, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. In addition to this, PPL has a low beta, which suggests its share price is less volatile than the wider market.What does the future of PPL look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. PPL's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 84%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? PPL’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on PPL, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing PPL at this point in time.

That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Mondelez International. See our latest analysis for Mondelez International ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Mondelez International?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Mondelez International does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Mondelez International, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Mondelez International. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.9% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.0% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.4% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing.

However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Mondelez International, Inc.. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$107m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 21% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 4 warning signs for Mondelez International (1 is a bit concerning!) that you should be aware of before investing here.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do.

He’s one of the most widely-followed individuals in the realm for a good reason – he’s achieved stellar returns. Buffett is a philanthropist and businessman. He’s the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), a diversified holding company whose subsidiaries engage in insurance, freight rail transportation, energy generation and distribution, manufacturing, and others.To put it simply, investors closely monitor each of his moves.And in 2022, Buffett has gone on the offensive, undoubtedly taking advantage of the massive market recalibration.Three stocks – Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing TSM, Occidental Petroleum OXY, and Citigroup C – have all seen buying activity from the Oracle of Omaha in 2022.Below is a chart illustrating the year-to-date performance of all three of these buys, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs we can see, OXY has been a big-time winner, whereas Citigroup and Taiwan Semiconductor have lagged behind the general market. Let’s take a deeper dive into each one.Occidental Petroleum Undoubtedly Buffett’s most famous buy of 2022, Occidental Petroleum, is an integrated oil and gas company with significant exploration and production exposure.Like many stocks in the Zacks Oils and Energy sector, OXY’s growth trajectory is impressive; the company’s earnings are forecasted to soar more than 280% year-over-year in its current fiscal year (FY22) on top of revenue growth of 42.7%.Still, the growth is projected to cool off in FY23, with estimates calling for a 23% year-over-year drop in earnings and a 9.6% pullback in revenue. This is shown in the chart below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company does pay a dividend, currently yielding a modest 0.8%, below its Zacks Oils and Energy sector average by a fair margin. OXY pays out just 6% of its earnings.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTaiwan Semiconductor ManufacturingExcluding OXY, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing has been one of the more exciting names Buffett has dipped into in 2022.TSM is engaged in the manufacturing and sale of integrated circuits and wafer semiconductor devices.In addition, the company is responsible for supplying chips to many tech titans, including Apple AAPL, Advanced Micro Devices AMD, and NVIDIA NVDA. Clearly, the company is of mass importance.For those with an appetite for income, TSM has that covered; the company’s annual dividend currently yields 1.7%, nicely above its Zacks Computer and Technology sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSimilar to OXY, Taiwan Semiconductor has a strong growth profile for its current fiscal year (FY22); earnings estimates suggest an improvement of more than 50% year-over-year, paired with forecasted revenue growth of 27.3%.The earnings growth slows down in FY23, with estimates indicating a 9% pullback. Still, revenue is forecasted to grow 6.9% Y/Y.CitigroupCitigroup, a globally diversified financial services holding company, provides various financial products and services to consumers, corporations, governments, and institutions.A significant perk of Citigroup shares is the dividend, currently yielding a rock-solid 4.5% paired with a 9% five-year annualized growth rate. As we can see, the current annual yield handily beats the Zacks Finance sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company has consistently posted better-than-expected quarterly results as of late, exceeding earnings and revenue estimates in three consecutive quarters.In its latest release, Citigroup registered a 2.7% bottom-line beat paired with a marginal 0.7% sales surprise. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineBuffett has gone on the offensive with the market pulling back significantly year-to-date, scooping up shares at a discount.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing TSM, Occidental Petroleum OXY, and Citigroup C have all seen buying activity from the Oracle of Omaha in 2022.For those seeking to invest like Buffett, all three precisely fit the criteria.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

251,db27dd89-f4df-36cc-829a-2b9c1818e938,OXY,2022-12-10,Qualys and International Flavor and Fragrances have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qualys-international-flavor-fragrances-highlighted-143202757.html,1670596322,STORY,"['QLYS', 'MPC', 'OXY', 'HES', 'SPGI', 'IFF']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – December 9, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares Qualys QLYS as the Bull of the Day and International Flavor and Fragrances IFF as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Occidental Petroleum OXY, Hess Corp. HES and Marathon Petroleum MPC.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:Qualys is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and it sports a F for Value and a B for Growth.  I love to see that sort of growth divergence where we have a weak value score and a strong growth score.  As a growth investor, that tells me right away that I am on the right path. This security company posted a beat in early November.  Let’s explore more about this company in this Bull of The Day article.DescriptionQualys, Inc. is a provider of cloud security and compliance solutions that enable organizations to identify security risks to their information technology infrastructures and help protect their IT systems and applications from cyber-attacks. The company's solutions are provided through its QualysGuard Cloud Platform. It offers products for vulnerability management, policy compliance, web application scanning, malware detection, and associated security products. Qualys, Inc. is headquartered in Redwood City, California.Earnings HistoryWhen I look at a stock, the first thing I do is look to see if the company is beating the number. This tells me right away where the market’s expectations have been for the company and how management has communicated to the market. A stock that consistently beats has management communicating expectations to Wall Street that can be achieved. That is what you want to see. For QLYS, I see four straight beats of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. That is great to see, but by itself that is not enough to make the company a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The average positive earnings surprise over the course of the last year works out to be 8.5%.Story continuesEarnings Estimates RevisionsThe Zacks Rank tells us which stocks are seeing earnings estimates move higher.Over the last 60 days, earning estimates have moved up for QLYS. This quarter has moved up from $0.90 to $0.91. Next quarter has increased from $0.94 to $0.95. The full fiscal year 2022 has increased from $3.54 to $3.62. Next fiscal year has seen the estimate move from $3.88 to $4.01. Positive movement in earnings stock is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).ValuationThe valuation for this name isn’t low, but there is solid growth. I see a forward PE of 31x which is very high, but the company is coming off a quarter that saw topline growth of more than 19%. The price to book multiple is 12x. A software name like this is an asset slim business so number is bound to be a little high. Price to sales comes in a 9x and that is a big number, but the growth is there to support it.Bear of the Day:International Flavor and Fragrances is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and recently beat earnings. Following the recent earnings beat, the stock has continued higher. This article will look at why this stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) as it is the Bear of the Day.DescriptionInternational Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. manufactures and sells cosmetic active and natural health ingredients for use in various consumer products. It operates through Nourish, Scent, Health &amp; Biosciences, and Pharma Solutions segments. The Nourish segment offers natural and plant-based specialty food ingredients. The Scent segment provides fragrance compounds. The Health &amp; Biosciences segment develops and produces enzymes, food cultures, probiotics, and specialty ingredients. The Pharma Solutions segment produces and sells cellulosics and seaweed-based pharma excipients. International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. was founded in 1833 and is headquartered in New York, New York.Earnings HistoryWhen I look at a stock, the first thing I do is look to see if the company is beating the number. This tells me right away where the market’s expectations have been for the company and how management has communicated to the market.  A stock that consistently beats has management communicating expectations to Wall Street that can be achieved. That is what you want to see.In the case of IFF, I four straight beats of the  Zacks Consensus Estimate. This alone does not make the stock a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and it doesn’t make it a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) either.The Zacks Rank does care about the earnings history, but it is much more heavily influenced by the movement of earnings estimates.Earnings EstimatesThe Zacks Rank tells us which stocks are seeing earnings estimates move higher or in this case lower. For IFF I see annual estimates moving higher of late.The current fiscal year consensus number moved lower from $5.38  to $5.60 over the last 60 days. There was a period of time that saw the estimate move lower to $5.30, but this stock will probably soon increase from a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The next year has moved from $5.97 to $5.82. That move lower is probably the biggest deciding factor for this stock to be a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Negative movement in earnings estimates like that is why this stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).It should be noted that a majority of stocks in the Zacks universe are seeing negative earnings estimate revisions. That means that the stocks that are seeing small but negative earnings estimate revisions are falling to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Additional content:U.S. Oil Prices Drop on Rising Gasoline Distillate SupplyU.S. oil prices moved down on Dec 7 after government data showed large weekly builds in gasoline and distillate supplies. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude futures fell $2.24 (or 3%) to settle at $72.01 a barrel yesterday.Despite this, the market has been kind to oil in 2022, with commodity trading considerably higher year to date and hitting $130 for the first time since 2008. Crude-related stocks like Occidental Petroleum, Hess Corp. and Marathon Petroleum.Before going into the overall macro environment for oil, let's dig deep into the Energy Information Administration’s (""EIA"") Weekly Petroleum Status Report for the holiday-shortened week ending Nov 25.Analyzing the Latest EIA ReportCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell 5.2 million barrels compared to expectations of a 2.6 million-barrel decrease per the analysts surveyed by S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights. The combination of lower imports and continued strength in refinery demand accounted for the bigger-than-expected stockpile draw with the world’s biggest oil consumer even as domestic production climbed to the highest since August.Total domestic stocks now stand at 413.9 million barrels — 4.4% less than the year-ago figure and 9% lower than the five-year average.The latest report also showed that supplies at the Cushing terminal (the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange) fell 373,000 barrels to 23.9 million barrels.Meanwhile, the crude supply cover decreased from 25.7 days in the previous week to 25.2 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 27.7 days.Let’s turn to the products now.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies increased for the fourth time in as many weeks. The 5.3 million-barrel rise was primarily attributable to lower exports. Analysts had forecast that gasoline inventories would rise 2.9 million barrels. At 219.1 million barrels, the current stock of the most widely used petroleum product is essentially in line with the year-earlier level, while it is 3% below the five-year average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) also increased for the fourth week in succession. The 6.2 million-barrel gain reflected higher production and a fall in demand. Meanwhile, the market looked for a supply build of some 1.9 million barrels. Despite last week’s addition, current inventories — at 118.8 million barrels — are 6.2% below the year-ago level and 9% lower than the five-year average.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization, at a more than three-year high of 95.5%, rose 0.3% from the prior week.Final WordEven as fears revolving around high inflation and slowing growth somewhat cloud the outlook for Oil/Energy, it has remained the best S&amp;P 500 sector this year. The space has generated a total return of more than 53% in 2022 against the S&amp;P 500’s loss of around 17.5%. Apart from a positive fundamental picture, the sector is enjoying support from geopolitical uncertainty amid Russia’s military operations in Ukraine. In March, crude prices surged to multi-year highs of $130 on concerns about supplies from Russia, which is one of the world's largest producers of the commodity.While oil has pulled back from those lofty levels, with the conflict showing no signs of a quick resolution, the risk of dwindling inventory and the influential oil exporters’ group OPEC sticking to a conservative production profile means that the commodity has got enough reasons to stay elevated in the near-to-medium term.Consequently, three of the top four gainers of the S&amp;P 500 this year are all energy-related names: Occidental Petroleum, Hess Corporation and Marathon Petroleum.Occidental Petroleum: OXY is the top-performing S&amp;P 500 stock in 2022, with a gain of 120.6%. Occidental Petroleum beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 12.7%, on average.OXY has a projected earnings growth rate of 282% for this year. Occidental Petroleum is valued at around $58.3 billion.Hess Corp.: Hess shares have appreciated 82.1% so far in 2022. HES has a projected earnings growth rate of 229.7% for this year.Hess, with a market capitalization of $41.8 billion, enjoys a Growth Score of A. HES beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters, the average being 8.1%.Marathon Petroleum: This stock is among the best performers on the S&amp;P 500 Index, with shares having appreciated 70.3% in 2022. MPC, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), has a projected earnings growth rate of 940.8% for this year.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Marathon Petroleum beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters. MPC has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 60.1%, on average.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

That is because the Jan 20, 2023 $10 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Occidental Petroleum shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Occidental Petroleum is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry that ranks in the Top 39% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimate for the current quarter, while four analysts have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $2.22 per share to $1.98 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Occidental Petroleum right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

""We remain on track to complete submission of the first ever CRISPR-based therapy in the EU and U.K. this year, and we have initiated our rolling submission in the U.S., which we plan to complete in Q1 2023. We are working with urgency to bring forward this potential therapy to patients who are waiting.""Vertex will have the following presentations at ASH this year.Oral presentation, abstract #12 combined with abstract #2137, in partnership with CRISPR Therapeutics, entitled ""Efficacy and Safety of a Single Dose of Exagamglogene Autotemcel for Transfusion-Dependent Beta-Thalassemia and Severe Sickle Cell Disease,"" will be presented on Saturday, December 10 at 10:45 a.m CST. The presentation will include encore data as presented at the European Hematology Association Congress in June 2022 on patients with SCD or TDT who received the investigational therapy exa-cel in the CLIMB-111 or CLIMB-121 study and were followed in CLIMB-131, a long-term follow-up study.Oral presentation, abstract #577, entitled ""Health-Related Quality of Life, Disease Impacts, and Health Equity Concerns in Adults with Sickle Cell Disease with Recurrent Vaso-Occlusive Crises: Preliminary Results from a Global Longitudinal Survey,"" will be presented on Sunday, December 11 at 12:00 p.m. CST.

The study quantifies the symptoms, quality of life and work impacts of living with TDT. This presentation represents preliminary results from an ongoing longitudinal study.Story continuesThe accepted abstracts are available online on the ASH website.About exagamglogene autotemcel (exa-cel)Exa-cel, formerly known as CTX001™, is an investigational, autologous, ex vivo CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited therapy that is being evaluated for patients with SCD or TDT, in which a patient’s own hematopoietic stem cells are edited to produce high levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF; hemoglobin F) in red blood cells. HbF is the form of the oxygen-carrying hemoglobin that is naturally present during fetal development, which then switches to the adult form of hemoglobin after birth. The elevation of HbF by exa-cel has the potential to reduce or eliminate painful and debilitating VOCs for patients with SCD and alleviate transfusion requirements for patients with TDT. Earlier results from these ongoing trials were published in The New England Journal of Medicine in January of 2021 and presented at the European Hematology Association Congress in June 2022.Based on progress in this program to date, exa-cel has been granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT), Fast Track, Orphan Drug, and Rare Pediatric Disease designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for both SCD and TDT. Exa-cel has also been granted Orphan Drug Designation from the European Commission, as well as Priority Medicines (PRIME) designation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA), for both SCD and TDT.The companies have begun the rolling Biologics License Application (BLA) submission for exa-cel to the U.S. FDA and plan to complete the BLA by the end of the first quarter 2023 and remain on track to submit exa-cel to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in the U.K. and the EMA in the European Union by the end of the year.About CLIMB‑111 and CLIMB‑121The ongoing Phase 1/2/3 open-label trials, CLIMB‑111 and CLIMB‑121, are designed to assess the safety and efficacy of a single dose of exa-cel in patients ages 12 to 35 years with TDT or with SCD, characterized by recurrent VOCs, respectively. The trials are now closed for enrollment. Patients will be followed for approximately two years after exa-cel infusion. Each patient will be asked to participate in CLIMB‑131, a long-term follow-up trial.About CLIMB-131The ongoing long-term, open-label trial, CLIMB-131, is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of exa-cel in patients who received exa-cel in CLIMB‑111, CLIMB‑121, CLIMB‑141, CLIMB‑151 or CLIMB-161. The trial is designed to follow participants for up to 15 years after exa-cel infusion.About CLIMB‑141 and CLIMB‑151The ongoing Phase 3 open-label trials, CLIMB‑141 and CLIMB‑151, are designed to assess the safety and efficacy of a single dose of exa-cel in patients ages 2 to 11 years with TDT or with SCD, characterized by recurrent VOCs, respectively. The trials are now open for enrollment and currently enrolling patients ages 5 to 11 years and will plan to extend to ages 2 to less than 5 years at a later date. Each trial will enroll approximately 12 patients. Patients will be followed for approximately two years after infusion. Each patient will be asked to participate in CLIMB-131, a long-term follow-up trial.About CLIMB-161The ongoing Phase 3b study, CLIMB-161, is to support expansion of our manufacturing footprint after initial potential approval and launch. This study will enroll approximately 12 patients with either SCD or TDT ages 12 to 35 years. Patients will be followed for approximately one year after infusion. Each patient will be asked to participate in CLIMB-131, a long-term follow-up trial.About the Gene-Editing Process in These TrialsPatients who enroll in these trials will have their own hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells collected from peripheral blood. The patient’s cells will be edited using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The edited cells, exa-cel, will then be infused back into the patient as part of an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), a process which involves a patient being treated with myeloablative busulfan conditioning. Patients undergoing HSCT may also encounter side effects (ranging from mild to severe) that are unrelated to the administration of exa-cel. Patients will initially be monitored to determine when the edited cells begin to produce mature blood cells, a process known as engraftment. After engraftment, patients will continue to be monitored to track the impact of exa-cel on multiple measures of disease and for safety.About the Vertex and CRISPR CollaborationVertex and CRISPR Therapeutics entered into a strategic research collaboration in 2015 focused on the use of CRISPR/Cas9 to discover and develop potential new treatments aimed at the underlying genetic causes of human disease.

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Coca-Cola Coca-Cola Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the President &amp; CFO, John Murphy, sold US$3.3m worth of shares at a price of US$62.29 per share. That means that even when the share price was slightly below the current price of US$63.14, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. This single sale was just 28% of John Murphy's stake.Over the last year we saw more insider selling of Coca-Cola shares, than buying. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeI will like Coca-Cola better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insiders At Coca-Cola Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Coca-Cola. In total, Senior VP &amp; Chief Technical and Innovation Officer Nancy Quan sold US$840k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of Coca-ColaMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Coca-Cola insiders own 0.6% of the company, worth about US$1.7b. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Coca-Cola Tell Us?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. On the plus side, Coca-Cola makes money, and is growing profits. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Coca-Cola. At Simply Wall St, we found 2 warning signs for Coca-Cola that deserve your attention before buying any shares.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

260,d3d81214-5bf6-329f-98a5-072fad37b977,KO,2022-12-10,Wall Street Analysts Look Bullish on Coke (KO): Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-analysts-look-bullish-144402226.html,1670597042,STORY,['KO'],"[When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Coca-Cola (KO).Coke currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.50, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 12 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.50 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 12 recommendations that derive the current ABR, nine are Strong Buy, representing 75% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for KOBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for KOCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Coke here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Coke, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is KO a Good Investment?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Coke, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $2.48.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Coke. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Coke.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

MNST.Industry: Soft DrinksLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2026628/5-soft-drink-stocks-gearing-up-to-grab-a-share-of-industry-boomThe Zacks Beverages – Soft Drinks industry is showing resilience on the recovery across markets, share gains in at-home and away-from-home channels, improved pricing and continued innovation. Accelerating digital investments also bode well. Companies are expected to gain from expansion into newer categories, including capturing market share in the Ready-to-Drink (RTD) category. Players like The Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo Inc., Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V., Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. and Monster Beverage Corp. are well-poised on robust innovation efforts.However, industry players are witnessing continued pressure from higher supply-chain costs, including transportation and commodity costs, particularly steel and aluminum. The companies’ actions, including price increases, reducing reliance on imported cans and moving production closer to markets, are poised to combat these headwinds. Elevated operating expenses related to increased spending on marketing and advertising to capture a share are likely to strain margins in the near term.About the IndustryThe Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry comprises companies that manufacture, source, develop, market and sell non-alcoholic beverages. Soft drinks mainly include sparkling drinks, natural juices, enhanced water, sports and energy drinks as well as dairy, RTD tea and coffee beverages. Notably, some industry players like PepsiCo produce and sell handy food with flavored snacks, which complement their beverage portfolio.The companies sell products through a network of wholesalers and retailers that include supermarkets, department stores, mass merchandisers, club stores and other retail outlets. Some also offer products via company-owned or controlled bottling, independent bottling partners and partner brand owners.Story continuesWhat's Shaping the Future of Beverages - Soft Drinks Industry?Evolving Trends: Companies in the soft drinks space have been gaining from improved demand trends, which are aiding volume growth. Market share gains in at-home and away-from-home channels, owing to recovery across markets, have been boosting sales. Implementing price increases to overcome the ongoing cost pressures has significantly lifted sales in recent quarters.The soft drinks industry has transformed as health consciousness, personal well-being, natural ingredients, varied flavors and better taste experiences are changing consumers’ consumption patterns. Companies in the industry are expected to benefit from the expansion into newer and adjacent categories, including capturing market share in the fast-growing RTD alcoholic beverage category through collaborations. RTD has emerged as the fastest-growing category since 2018. The industry players are also exploring CBD-infused drinks, which have been gaining popularity lately.Innovation &amp; Digital Growth: The soft drinks industry is poised to gain from innovations and accelerating digital investments. The companies have been optimizing their portfolio, focusing on core brands and investments in innovation to meet the evolving needs of consumers. The players remain committed to product launches and innovation to boost growth.Further, expansion into newer markets has been a key focus for soft drink makers to boost market share. Moreover, the companies are expected to reap the benefits of digital and technology-driven investments based on the shift in consumer preference for online shopping.Companies in the industry have been accelerating investments to build strong digital capabilities by piloting numerous digital-enabled fulfillment options. They have been expanding digital offerings and investing in loyalty programs and fintech platforms to capture online demand. The investments are likely to position soft drink companies for long-term growth.Raw Material Cost Inflation and Supply Constraints: The beverage industry is plagued with higher supply-chain costs, including higher commodity input costs and transportation expenses. Raw material cost inflation, particularly steel and aluminum, has increased packaging costs. The ongoing supply constraints in the aluminum can industry have been other headwinds.The companies are also witnessing delays in procuring certain ingredients, both domestically and internationally, leading to shortages of some goods. The industry players have been facing freight inefficiencies and significant increases in domestic and international freight costs. Logistic issues, higher input costs and freight inefficiencies have resulted in higher costs of sales and operating expenses, impacting gross and operating margins. Most players expect commodity cost inflation and higher transportation costs to persist in the near term.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Beverages - Soft Drinks industry is housed within the broader Consumer Staples sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #61, which places it in the top 24% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

262,694b0e72-714d-3e18-8a17-587ad80b238c,SYK,2022-12-10,Stryker's (NYSE:SYK) Shareholders Will Receive A Bigger Dividend Than Last Year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/strykers-nyse-syk-shareholders-receive-123017256.html,1670675417,STORY,['SYK'],"[The board of Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) has announced that the dividend on 31st of January will be increased to $0.75, which will be 7.9% higher than last year's payment of $0.695 which covered the same period. Although the dividend is now higher, the yield is only 1.1%, which is below the industry average. Check out our latest analysis for Stryker Stryker's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsEven a low dividend yield can be attractive if it is sustained for years on end. The last dividend was quite easily covered by Stryker's earnings. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 44.4%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 33% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendStryker Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2012, the dividend has gone from $0.85 total annually to $2.78. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 13% a year over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.Stryker Could Grow Its DividendInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Stryker has impressed us by growing EPS at 6.4% per year over the past five years. Earnings are on the uptrend, and it is only paying a small portion of those earnings to shareholders.Stryker Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 2 warning signs for Stryker that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

It anticipates an adjusted EBIT margin of high teens to 20% over the same time. Free cash flow conversion is estimated to be more than 85% in the medium term.General Electric’s HealthCare unit is set to spin off into a separate public company on Jan 3, 2023. The spun off company will begin public trading the following day under the ticker symbol GEHC. GE HealthCare will cater to Imaging, Ultrasound, Patient Care Solutions and Pharmaceutical Diagnostics services.General Electric Company PriceGeneral Electric Company PriceGeneral Electric Company price | General Electric Company QuoteGE HealthCare expects to drive revenues and growth through innovation, business optimization and organic investment. GE chairman and CEO H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. said, “In this next chapter as a standalone company, GE HealthCare will be even better positioned to advance its mission of precision care, while driving growth, and margin expansion.”As a standalone company, GE HealthCare’s increased focus and agility are expected to enhance its growth and generate solid free cash flow, per a statement released by General Electric.The spin-off of the healthcare business is part of General Electric’s plan to split its business into three independent companies — comprising GE Healthcare, GE Aviation (to be renamed GE Aerospace) and the combined operations of GE Digital, Renewable Energy and GE Power (to be named GE Vernova).The spin-off of GE Digital, Renewable Energy and GE Power businesses is expected to be completed in early 2024. Following the completion of these transactions, GE plans to operate as an aviation-focused company starting in early 2024. GE’s separation into three public companies is expected to help each business to flourish through better operational focus, capital allocation policies and financial flexibility.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksGeneral Electric currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks worth considering are as follows:Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc.

268,dac92b2d-776f-3315-8c14-269b81e95d79,GE,2022-12-10,GE is splitting into three parts. The CFO of its Healthcare unit outlines his strategy for 2023,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ge-splitting-three-parts-cfo-113946268.html,1670585986,STORY,['GE'],"[Good morning,“I've been with GE Healthcare now for two years,” CFO Helmut Zodl tells me. “And really my motivation to come here was to prepare the company and do the spinoff.” So attending GE Healthcare’s first investor day conference in New York City on Thursday felt like “being in the Super Bowl or the World Cup finals,” he says.Originally from Austria, Zodl has worked globally in finance for the past 25 years. His vast experience includes various finance and divisional CFO roles at both Lenovo and IBM over the course of 15 years, he says. Now, he’s finance chief of the health care spinoff of the industrial conglomerate General Electric and navigating it into a new era.GE Healthcare, which produces medical imaging equipment and tech devices, is expected to begin trading on Nasdaq on Jan. 4, under the ticker GEHC. Last month, the board of directors approved the spinoff, and a distribution to GE shareholders of at least 80.1% of the outstanding shares of GE Healthcare. For every three shares of GE stock an individual currently owns, they will receive one share of GE Healthcare.In 2021, GE had a total revenue of $72.4 billion. The health care spinoff is the first step of GE’s plans to separate into three public companies. It plans to combine its renewable [hotlink ignore=true]energy, power, and digital into one business, in early 2024. And then GE will become “an aviation-focused company shaping the future of flight,” according to the company.I asked Zodl if going it alone in this macroenvironment is a concern.Looking back at the 2000 dot com crash, or the recession in 2008, “our industry is quite stable, even during economic downturns” he says. “We are still seeing strong demand with our customers,” he explains. The long-term trends GE Healthcare sees include an aging population in a growing middle class with the need for better care and new types of medicines coming to the market, he says. “People still have to go to emergency rooms,” Zodl says. ""People still have to do procedures.""Story continuesHowever, Zodl does have a recession playbook, which includes optimizing cost structure to fulfill customer demand, and ensuring there’s enough liquidity. “We're going to be spinning off with strong liquidity—$1.8 billion cash on the balance sheet and a $3.5 billion facility that really will help us in case there will be a slowdown.”Four areas—imaging, ultrasound, patient care solutions, and pharmaceutical diagnostics—make up the company’s about $18 billion in annual revenue.“The imaging business, which is anything from a CT, MRI, and X-ray, is the biggest business—$9 to $10 billion,” Zodl says. GE Healthcare serves 1 billion patients every year with more than 2 billion procedures through services and devices, he says.For the next three to five years, the company’s looking at organic mid-single-digit revenue growth, Zodl says. And margin expansion from the mid-to-high teens to 20% and free cash flow conversion of around 85% as an organization, he explains. “We’ll have a disciplined capital allocation framework to pay down debt, invest in the business, and strategic M&amp;A, where it makes sense,” he says.“The digital layer is becoming more and more important in our industry,” says Zodl, who has the IT division report to him. He recently hired Jahid Khandaker as the new chief information officer. Khandaker joins GE Healthcare from Western Digital, a data storage solutions company.“You need to think about digital in two ways—on the device or in the cloud where it helps drive better clinical outcomes with A.I. enablement,"" Zodl explains. This could be something like a measurement of a heart valve, or the measurement of a baby still in the womb, he says.The other use for digital is to help productivity for clinicians. “A lot of challenges that our customers are facing are really around having staff shortages and having to do more with less stuff,” Zodl says.He continues, “I spend a lot of time building the finance, IT, and strategy organizations. But I also spend a lot of time with [GE Healthcare CEO Peter Arduini] on building the overall organization as a team.”I asked Zodl about his own leadership style. “I would call it servant leadership,” he says. “I’m here to help the teams, not the teams helping me.”Have a good weekend.Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.comThis story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune:  Rishi Sunak’s old hedge fund boss paid himself $1.9 million a day this year Meet the 29-year-old teacher with four degrees who wants to join the Great Resignation How much money you need to earn to buy a $400,000 home Elon Musk ‘wanted to punch’ Kanye West after deeming the rapper’s swastika tweet an ‘incitement to violence’ ]"
269,41e69fbf-cd15-315d-93e5-8b29d3e05a6d,PGR,2022-12-10,The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) insiders sold US$3.7m worth of stock suggesting impending weakness.,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/progressive-corporation-nyse-pgr-insiders-130030302.html,1670677230,STORY,['PGR'],"[In the last year, many The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Progressive Progressive Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the President of Personal Lines, Patrick Callahan, for US$2.4m worth of shares, at about US$126 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$129). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. This single sale was 59% of Patrick Callahan's stake.Insiders in Progressive didn't buy any shares in the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Progressive Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Progressive shares. In total, President of Personal Lines Patrick Callahan sold US$2.4m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of ProgressiveAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Progressive insiders own 0.3% of the company, currently worth about US$236m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Progressive Tell Us?An insider sold Progressive shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. While conducting our analysis, we found that Progressive has 2 warning signs and it would be unwise to ignore them.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

271,75fe39db-d768-32ee-8f84-2e1d561bd4c6,VLO,2022-12-10,Valero Energy Corporation (VLO) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/valero-energy-corporation-vlo-trending-140002974.html,1670594402,STORY,['VLO'],"[Valero Energy (VLO) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this oil refiner have returned -11.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.5% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, to which Valero Energy belongs, has lost 2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Valero Energy is expected to post earnings of $7.10 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +187.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +3.7%.The consensus earnings estimate of $27.95 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +894.7%. This estimate has changed +0.7% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $19.83 indicates a change of -29.1% from what Valero Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +5.4%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Valero Energy.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VLO _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Valero Energy, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $40.13 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +11.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $174.22 billion and $143.86 billion estimates indicate +52.9% and -17.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryValero Energy reported revenues of $44.45 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +50.6%. EPS of $7.14 for the same period compares with $1.22 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $39.01 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +13.94%. The EPS surprise was +2%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Valero Energy is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Valero Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Such contract wins also contribute to the membership growth of the health insurer.An array of buyouts undertaken over the years, such as those of Family Physicians Group, onehome, Curo and Inclusa, has expanded the capabilities, diversified income streams and bolstered the nationwide presence of Humana.

273,ec89f8b6-a569-3561-a894-97bb6eb1c54d,EL,2022-12-10,Are The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) Investors Paying Above The Intrinsic Value?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/est-e-lauder-companies-inc-110124858.html,1670670084,STORY,['EL'],"[Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies Is Estée Lauder Companies Fairly Valued?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.88bUS$2.45bUS$3.01bUS$3.91bUS$4.21bUS$4.43bUS$4.62bUS$4.79bUS$4.94bUS$5.08bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x10Analyst x10Analyst x8Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 5.36%Est @ 4.35%Est @ 3.64%Est @ 3.14%Est @ 2.79% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.6% US$1.7kUS$2.1kUS$2.4kUS$2.9kUS$2.9kUS$2.9kUS$2.8kUS$2.7kUS$2.6kUS$2.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$25bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.1b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.6%– 2.0%) = US$92bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$92b÷ ( 1 + 7.6%)10= US$44bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$70b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$240, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Estée Lauder Companies as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.008. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price exceeding the intrinsic value?

275,687d8dc8-1673-3a69-93e6-d6aed80b3ee7,EL,2022-12-10,Why Is Inter Parfums (IPAR) Up 18.1% Since Last Earnings Report?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-inter-parfums-ipar-18-163004726.html,1670603404,STORY,"['IPAR', 'TPR', 'EL']","[It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Inter Parfums (IPAR). Shares have added about 18.1% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Inter Parfums due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Inter Parfums Q3 Earnings Beat Estimates, 2022 View UpInter Parfums delivered impressive third-quarter 2022 results, with the top and the bottom line increasing year over year. Quarterly earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Management raised its 2022 guidance.Results in DetailInter Parfums’ third-quarter earnings came in at $1.30 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 99 cents. The metric increased 8% from $1.20 per share reported in the year-ago quarter.Quarterly net sales increased 7% to $280 million compared with $263 million reported in the year-ago quarter.In an earlier press release, management highlighted that third-quarter net sales rose 12% at comparable foreign currency rates. Inter Parfums’ Europe-based product sales came in at $198 million, down 4% from 2021 levels. U.S.-based product sales amounted to $82 million, surging 45% from third-quarter 2021. In the company’s U.S. operations, new brands like Ferragamo, Donna Karan and DKNY generated 41% of the gains. Apart from this, organic growth from established brands like GUESS?, Oscar de la Renta, Hollister, and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch also contributed to the upside. Management highlighted that sales of its European operations increased 12% in euro, with the three largest brands Montblanc, Jimmy Choo and Coach, outperforming by 11%, 32% and 3% year over year, respectively. Several mid-sized brands, namely Kate Spade, Rochas, Boucheron, Van Cleef &amp; Arpels and Karl Lagerfeld also witnessed comparable quarter sales growth. That being said, a 17% decline in the average euro-to-dollar exchange rate masked such an upside resulting in a 4% drop in the quarterly European-based product sales in dollars. Inter Parfums stated that it witnessed modest growth in the third quarter compared with the year-ago quarter. The company continued to face some supply chain-related issues, which pushed the delivery of some holiday gift sets into the next quarter. That said, the company’s Italian operations are running, with Ferragamo on track to become the second-largest brand under the U.S. operations banner during the year. Inter Parfums continues to see solid momentum in its travel retail business. The company’s travel amenities operation has started to experience growth.Inter Parfums’ third-quarter gross profit margin was 64.9%, up 120 basis points from 63.7% reported in the year-ago quarter. For European-based operations, the gross profit margin was 69.5%, up from 66.6% posted in the year-ago quarter. The upside can be attributed to a stronger U.S. dollar during 2022 and a favorable impact from mix and pricing actions. However, higher transportation and component costs were a concern for the metric. For U.S. operations, the gross margin stood at 53.8%, up from 53.1% reported in the year-ago quarter. Gains from scale, pricing actions and favorable brand and giftset mix contributed to the upside.SG&amp;A expenses amounted to $117.4 million, up from $99.8 million reported in the year-ago quarter. For European operations, SG&amp;A expenses increased to 42.1% of net sales from 38.8% reported in the year-ago quarter. The rise in such costs can largely be attributed to a return to promotional and advertising levels commensurate with sales. For U.S. operations, SG&amp;A, as a percent of net sales, rose to 41.4% from 35.1% reported in the year-ago quarter. Apart from the abovementioned reason, rising salaries and benefits to expand the organization to support the startup of new brands were a downside.Story continuesOther Financial AspectsInter Parfums ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $41.3 million, long-term debt (excluding the current portion) of $107.9 million and total equity of $730.1 million. Inter Parfums announced a quarterly dividend of 50 cents per share, payable on Dec 30, 2022, to shareholders of record as of Dec 15, 2022.Other UpdatesDuring 2022, the company introduced several scents, namely Montblanc Legend Red, CoachWild Rose, Coach Dreams Sunset, Coach Open Road, GUESS Uomo, Kate Spade Sparkle, Jimmy Choo ManAqua, Jimmy Choo I Want Choo Forever, Lanvin Mon Éclat and Boucheron Singulier. The company also launched brand extensions and flankers for several brands. In addition, the company unveiled Moncler’s debut scents at the beginning of 2022. For the next year, the company’s new product pipeline for U.S. brands consists of new pillars for the Hollister and MCM brands. Moreover, the product pipeline is dominated by brand extensions and flankers. Management is on track with major launches for Ferragamo, Donna Karan and DKNY brands for 2024. In European operations, the company will launch a new fragrance for Kate Spade in 2023.GuidanceThe company continues to battle inflation, supply chain disruptions, COVID-19 restrictions in China, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and fears of recession worldwide. Despite that, management is raising its 2022 guidance considering solid year-to-date performance and robust projections for the rest of the year. The company is optimistic about its business prospects and continues to invest to keep gaining market share and long-term growth. Management now expects 2022 net sales of $1.025 billion, up from previous guidance of $1 billion. EPS are anticipated to come in at $3.40, higher than the earlier guidance of $3.25. The company expects to spend 21% of annual net sales on advertising and promotion in 2022. The guidance is based on the assumption of no major resurgence in coronavirus cases and the current level of the average dollar/euro exchange rate.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.The consensus estimate has shifted -55.18% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Inter Parfums has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the bottom 20% quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Inter Parfums has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerInter Parfums is part of the Zacks Cosmetics industry.

The companys business model, size and scale have positioned it to be able to successfully grow its dividend, along with its results, for a long period of time.Lets dig deeper to see why I believe investors should see the dividend increase as a positive sign for the company and its stock.Takeaways from recent earnings resultsAutomatic Data Processing reported fiscal first-quarter 2023 results on Oct. 26. Revenue grew 10% to $4.22 billion, which was $53 million more than the market had expected. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.86 were higher by 21 cents, or 12.7%, from the prior year and 7 cents more than anticipated.Looking closer at the two segments of the company, revenue for Employer Services, which provides payroll and other administrative services, grew 9% in constant currency to $2.79 billion. This segment was powered by average client funds balances growth of 9%, with interest revenue seeing a tailwind from the rising interest rate environment.Employer Services also saw its U.S. pays under control grow 6% year over year. The segment benefited from the addition of new clients as well as an increase in the number of transactions with existing customers. Revenue retention reached a new record for the quarter, while the segment margin expanded 50 basis points to 30.9%.Story continuesPEO Services, which offers a suite of human resources outsourcing solutions, grew 13% to $1.43 billion. Average worksite employees increased 12% to 704,000, a continuation of the high growth rates seen over the past few quarters. This metric is likely to continue to rise as bookings have been very strong. Segment margins expanded 80 basis points to 16.1%.Following earnings results, Automatic Data Processing updated its guidance for fiscal year 2023. Revenue is now projected to increase 8% to 9%, up from 7% to 9% previously, while adjusted earnings per share are expected to grow 15% to 17%, up from 13% to 16%.Impressive growth rates have long been the norm for the company. Consider revenue and net income growth over the past decade:Automatic Data Processing: Quality Comes at a PriceFrom 2013 onward, you can see that revenue has improved almost at regular intervals. Same for net income.Yes, this growth has come primarily during an economic expansion. And some might argu the companys business results would falter during a recession as employers cut positions, but this has not been the case.Automatic Data Processing saw earnings per share grow almost 31% from 2007 to 2009. More recently, earnings per share gained 8.8% in 2020 even as Covid-19 negatively impacted the economy.Some of this improvement is due to Automatic Data Processings aggressive share repurchases, but net income still improved more than 22% from 2007 to 2009 and nearly 8% in 2020. Clearly, a difficult labor market has not made that much of a dent on the companys revenue and earnings per share results.The last 10 fiscal years have seen revenue grow by 4.3% annually. Earnings per share have a compound annual growth rate of 10.7%, driven in part by share repurchases and a 580-basis point expansion in net margin to 17.9%.Results like these over the long term is why Automatic Data Processing has a GF Score of 91 out of 100, which implies the likelihood of outperformance going forward. The companys high score is due to perfect or near-perfect rankings for growth, profitability and momentum. Automatic Data Processing does receive a middling score on financial strength and a low score for value.Automatic Data Processing: Quality Comes at a PriceValuation and dividend analysisOne reason the stock might be trading with a premium multiple is that Automatic Data Processing has performed well over the last year, with the stock returning more than 11% during this period of time.Automatic Data Processing: Quality Comes at a PriceThis compares favorably to the 16% drop in the S&amp;P 500 Index and especially well to the 41.5% decline in the information technology industry.The low score for value is due to the premium multiple that Automatic Data Processing currently trades with. Using the midpoint of earnings guidance, the company expects to earn $8.12 per share in fiscal year 2023. With the stock trading at $258 today, the forward multiple is nearly 32 times earnings.Given the business success and dividend growth streak, I firmly believe a premium multiple is warranted. That said, the forward multiple is elevated against the five- and 10-year price-earnings ratios of 29.2 and 27.5.Automatic Data Processing is trading above its GF Value as well.Automatic Data Processing: Quality Comes at a PriceWith a GF Value of $230.34, Automatic Data Processing has a price-to-GF Value ratio of 1.12, earning the stock a rating of modestly overvalued from GuruFocus based on its historical ratios, past financial performance and analysts' future earnings projections.Final thoughtsAutomatic Data Processing has a lengthy history of growth, both during economic expansions and contractions. The most recent quarter speaks to the strength of the company, as does the revised guidance for the fiscal year.As a result of long-term success, Automatic Data Processing has a very long dividend growth streak and is now just two years away from becoming a member of the Dividend Kings.The recent dividend increase of more than 20% is twice the 10-year compound annual growth rate of 10% and is reflective of the companys highly successful business model.Shares are not cheap, but Automatic Data Processings history of earnings and dividend growth have warranted the premium valuation in my opinion. Investors looking for a company with proven track record of revenue, earnings and dividend growth should consider adding Automatic Data Processing to their watchlist.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Horton due for a pullback?

Horton (DHI) Q4 Earnings &amp; Revenues MissD.R. Horton, Inc.’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 earnings and revenues missed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.Nonetheless, D.R. Horton’s fiscal 2022 results were highlighted by 42% improvement in pre-tax income, 350 basis point (bps) expansion in pre-tax profit margin and 21% increase in revenues.

It hits us in the gut when we see fellow investors suffer a loss. Spare a thought for those who held American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) for five whole years - as the share price tanked 73%. We also note that the stock has performed poorly over the last year, with the share price down 25%.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for American Airlines Group American Airlines Group wasn't profitable in the last twelve months, it is unlikely we'll see a strong correlation between its share price and its earnings per share (EPS). Arguably revenue is our next best option. When a company doesn't make profits, we'd generally expect to see good revenue growth. As you can imagine, fast revenue growth, when maintained, often leads to fast profit growth.Over half a decade American Airlines Group reduced its trailing twelve month revenue by 9.4% for each year. That's definitely a weaker result than most pre-profit companies report. So it's not that strange that the share price dropped 12% per year in that period. This kind of price performance makes us very wary, especially when combined with falling revenue. Ironically, that behavior could create an opportunity for the contrarian investor - but only if there are good reasons to predict a brighter future.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. If you are thinking of buying or selling American Airlines Group stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 18% in the twelve months, American Airlines Group shareholders did even worse, losing 25%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 11% over the last half decade. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance.

Aflac Incorporated AFL, Unum Group UNM, Trupanion TRUP, Employers Holdings EIG and AMERISAFE AMSF should continue benefiting from prudent underwriting standards. However, a rise in claims frequency could weigh on the positives.The industry has been witnessing soft pricing over the past several quarters, which is not expected to change any time soon. Nonetheless, a rise in claims, with business activities returning to normal levels, is likely to increase pricing for this industry in the coming days. Also, the increasing adoption of technology in operations will help in the smooth functioning of the industry amid coronavirus-induced challenges.About the IndustryThe Zacks Accident and Health Insurance industry comprises companies that provide workers’ compensation insurance, largely to employers operating in hazardous industries. These players offer group, individual or voluntary supplemental insurance products. Workers' compensation is a form of accident insurance paid by employers without affecting employees’ pay. Claims are generally met by insurance companies or state-run workers’ compensation fund, benefiting both employers and employees. While it boosts employees’ morale, thus, productivity, employers stand to benefit from lower claims costs. As awareness about the benefits of having such coverage rises, the future of these insurers seems bright. Per reports published in IBISWorld, the U.S. workers' compensation insurance industry is estimated to grow 3% to $48.3 billion in 2022 based on revenues.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Accident &amp; Health Insurance IndustryPricing Pressure to Continue: The worker compensation industry has been witnessing pricing pressure over the past several quarters. Given this soft pricing, efforts to retain market share will again induce pricing pressure, which might curb top-line growth. Per Willis Towers Watson’s Commercial Lines Insurance Pricing Survey, workers’ compensation witnessed a slight price reduction in 2021. Per the survey, pricing at workers' compensation could be down 2% to up 4% in 2022.  With commercial and industrial activities back on track, the demand for insurance coverage is likely to be on the rise. SpendEdge estimates workers compensation insurance pricing to increase at a five-year (2022-2026) CAGR of 5.25%.Claims Frequency Might Rise: The accident and health insurance space has witnessed growth over the years, primarily driven by an increase in benefits offered by employers. The right kind of workers’ compensation policy translates into personal care for injured workers, increased productivity, higher employee morale, lower turnover, reduced claims costs and less financial worry amid rising medical costs. Increasing underwriting exposure, sustained decrease in claims frequency rates attributable to a better working environment and conservative reserve levels have been boosting the industry’s performance. Per The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data in an AmTrust Financial report, workers over the age of 55 will increase to about 25% in 2024 from 21.7% in 2014. Thus, claims could rise based on the magnitude of severity, the report states. Also, with business activities getting normal, claims may rise.Increasing Adoption of Technology: The industry is witnessing accelerated adoption of technology in operations. Telemedicine has gained pace amid the pandemic. Carriers started selling policies online that appealed to the tech-savvy population. Given the current pandemic, several organizations are working remotely to comply with social distancing norms. Electronic applications, e-signatures, electronic policy delivery, cloud computing and blockchain should help insurers gain a competitive edge. Nonetheless, higher spending on technological advancements will result in escalated expense ratios.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects. The Zacks Accident and Health Insurance industry, housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #19, which places it in the top 8% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

Elevated operating expenses related to increased spending on marketing and advertising to capture a share are likely to strain margins in the near term.About the IndustryThe Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry comprises companies that manufacture, source, develop, market and sell non-alcoholic beverages.

303,61a557f6-fdcb-3a73-af6b-5c11cc8d4e43,GPS,2022-12-10,11 Best Fashion Stocks To Buy Now,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-best-fashion-stocks-buy-114356357.html,1670672636,STORY,"['ANF', 'NKE', 'HBI', 'GPS', 'RL', 'TLYS', 'GES', 'LULU']","[In this article we present the list of 11 Best Fashion Stocks To Buy Now. Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Best Fashion Stocks To Buy Now.If you’re in the market for fashion stocks, then NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU), and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. (NYSE:ANF) should be at the top of your list.It’s been a volatile few years for the apparel and fashion industry as a whole, and its companies’ share prices in particular. Sales at clothing and accessories stores sank by 26% year-over-year in 2020, as pandemic lockdowns across the globe shuttered stores and kept people lounging around in their sweats at home.After a year of barely updating their wardrobes, consumers went crazy catching up for lost time in 2021 as societies reopened and people began socializing again. Sales jumped by 60% during the first nine months of 2021 and continued to be strong through the first half of this year.Another slowdown for the industry appears to be underway now however, with inflation and depressed consumer sentiment driving fashion sales into negative territory in the second half of this year. McKinsey predicts that the industry will grow by about 2-3% during 2023, primarily due to solid sustained growth in the luxury fashion market, which is expected to grow between 5-10%.That’s not surprising given that luxury retailers and other sellers of high-priced goods tend to weather economic storms better thanks to their focus on the wealthy consumer, who isn’t as affected by economic downturns.The fashion market is expected to be strong in both China and the United States, growing by as much 6% or 7% in each country, while an energy crisis in Europe is expected to lead to a 1% to 4% downturn for the fashion market in that region next year.As cash-strapped consumers more carefully consider their clothing options, the rise of secondhand apparel is becoming apparent and represents another challenge for apparel brands and retailers. The secondhand market is expected to grow by 24% to $119 billion this year and to reach $218 billion in sales by 2026. Meanwhile, the broader apparel market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.6% through 2026, hitting $843 billion, and those projections might be somewhat optimistic.Story continuesThe secondhand trend is particularly pronounced in North America, where secondhand apparel has been outgrowing the broader apparel market by a staggering 700%. In response, some fashion brands are beginning to launch their own resale initiatives to bring some of that market back within their own ecosystem.All told, it could be a lean year or two for some or even many fashion companies and their corresponding shares, which makes pinpointing only the best fashion stocks to buy now a priority for investors interested in the space. We’ll do that in this article, using the smart money sentiment as our guide to which fashion stocks are likely to perform well in the years to come.11 Best Fashion Stocks To Buy NowOur MethodologyThe following fashion stocks are ranked based on hedge fund sentiment. We follow a select group of hedge funds because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q3 2022 reporting period.11 Best Fashion Stocks To Buy Now11. Tilly’s, Inc. (NYSE:TLYS)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 15 Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. (NYSE:ANF), NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), and Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU) rank among the top five best fashion stocks to buy right now. Just cracking the list in 11th is Tilly’s, Inc. (NYSE:TLYS), which sells apparel and accessories geared towards kids and teens.Hedge fund ownership of Tilly’s, Inc. (NYSE:TLYS) peaked in the third quarter of 2018 and has declined by 33% since. It did tick up during Q3 of this year however, as multiple funds opened small stakes in the company. Among them were Israel Englander’s Millennium Management and Frederick Disanto’s Ancora Advisors.Tilly’s, Inc. (NYSE:TLYS) was a big beneficiary of the pandemic, but has struggled to match up against those tougher comps in 2022. The third quarter wasn’t great, but the company did perform better than both it and the market expected, pulling in $178 million in revenue and $0.17 per share in earnings, both of which beat estimates. Comparable net sales in Q4 had declined by 18.5% through November 29 compared to the year-ago period.10. Guess’, Inc. (NYSE:GES)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 17 Hedge funds bailed on Guess’, Inc. (NYSE:GES) in droves during the first quarter, as there was a 41% decline in the number of smart money managers long the stock. There was a slight rebound in Q2 as Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies and Lee Ainslie’s Maverick Capital were among the funds to add GES to their 13F portfolios.Guess’, Inc. (NYSE:GES) has hung in there somewhat better than Tilly’s this year, growing Q3 sales by 10% year-over-year on a constant currency basis thanks to continued strong performance in Europe. The jeans and apparel maker’s operating margin stood at 8.6% in Q3, down from 14.1% a year earlier, though company expects that figure to rebound to 13.2% in Q4 on an adjusted basis.Guess’, Inc. (NYSE:GES) is undergoing several initiatives to improve its customer acquisition and retention efforts, as well as its marketing capabilities. Chief among them is the company’s Customer 360 platform, some of which has already been implemented in Europe with promising results. Guess has also been growing its digital business, including its data analytics capabilities.9. Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE:RL)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 22 There’s been a 29% drop in the number of hedge funds long Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE:RL) over the past two quarters, with the stock hitting a ten-year low in smart money ownership as a result. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates sold off its stake in RL during Q3, while Arrowstreet Capital, founded by Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke and John Campbell, held the largest long position, consisting of 801,348 shares.Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE:RL) could be poised for a good holiday season if demand trends for the high-end fashion retailer are strong, as the company significantly bolstered its inventory ahead of the fourth quarter to stave off any potential supply chain challenges. High-end retailers tend to perform better during economic downturns due to their wealthier clientele being less affected by the conditions of the day, which the company appears to be banking on.There are some troubling signs in the company’s recent results however, which may be why hedge funds have been bailing on the stock. Ralph Lauren grew sales by 13% in its Q1 of fiscal 2023, but sales growth slowed to 5% year-over-year in its fiscal Q2. Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE:RL)’s bottom line has also been getting pinched due to rising cost of goods sold, which jumped by 14% in fiscal Q2, dwarfing the company’s sales growth. That contributed to earnings falling to $2.23 per share compared to $2.62 a year earlier, despite the company having also bought back over 6 million shares, or about 8.4% of its outstanding float prior to those purchases.8. Victorias Secret &amp; Co. (NYSE:VSCO)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 24 Hedge funds showed noteworthy interest in Victorias Secret &amp; Co. (NYSE:VSCO) during its first quarter on the market as a publicly traded company following its separation from Bath &amp; Body Works, Inc. (NYSE:BBWI) in Q3 of 2021. That interest has waned considerably in the four quarters since however, as there’s been a drop in hedge fund ownership of VSCO during each of those quarters.The lingerie retailer was spun off in part so a new management team could take charge and help turn around the struggling company, which suffered a major sales drop during its fiscal 2020 year. Victorias Secret &amp; Co. (NYSE:VSCO)’s gross margins have trailed its peers by a wide margin (pardon the pun?), which is something management has been focused on improving, with some success, but more work remains to be done.Victorias Secret &amp; Co. (NYSE:VSCO)‘s Q3 comparable sales slumped by 11% year-over-year, with the company pulling in $1.32 billion in sales, in line with estimates. The retailer’s EPS of $0.29 topped estimates by a healthy $0.06 and also came in ahead of the company’s own guidance. Cowen analyst Jonna Kim has a $45 price target and ‘Outperform’ rating on VSCO shares. The analyst believes the company’s sales will remain pressured in the near-term, but that longer-term, it has a good opportunity to regain share in the U.S. and grow internationally.T-6. Hanesbrands Inc. (NYSE:HBI)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 25 Ownership of Hanesbrands Inc. (NYSE:HBI) among the select group of funds tracked by Insider Monkey sank to a nine-year low during the second quarter, but rebounded big time during Q3, shooting up by nearly 50%. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group and Andrew Kurita’s Kettle Hill Capital Management were two of the funds to add HBI to their 13F portfolios during Q3.Hanesbrands Inc. (NYSE:HBI) shares have trended down throughout the year, losing 63% of their value, which may have prompted some funds to go bargain hunting. The clothing and undergarments manufacturer has been facing several challenges in recent quarters, including tighter inventory management among retailers and rising costs. Sales slumped by 7% year-over-year in Q3, sliding to $1.67 billion, while adjusted net income fared far worse, tumbling by 46% to $102 million. The company’s guidance for the holiday season also came in well below estimates, with projections for as little as $1.4 billion in sales and $0.04 in adjusted EPS compared to $1.63 billion and $0.21 estimates respectively.Chartwell Investment Partners shared some of the challenges that Hanesbrands Inc. (NYSE:HBI) has faced of late in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“The three worst-performing stocks in the Dividend Equity accounts includes Hanesbrands (NYSE:HBI, 1.1%), down 30.1%.
