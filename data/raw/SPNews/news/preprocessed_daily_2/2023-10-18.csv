While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 24. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis chipmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.81 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -26.1%.Revenues are expected to be $4.57 billion, down 12.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.99% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Texas Instruments?For Texas Instruments, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.59%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Texas Instruments will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Texas Instruments would post earnings of $1.76 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.87, delivering a surprise of +6.25%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Texas Instruments doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

VIST is set to release third-quarter results on Oct 24. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of $1.16 per share on revenues of $314.8 million.Let’s delve into the factors that might have influenced the Mexico-based energy firm’s results in the September quarter. But it’s worth taking a look at Vista’s previous-quarter performance first.Highlights of Q2 Earnings &amp; Surprise HistoryIn the last reported quarter, the Argentina-focused company missed the consensus mark due to weaker oil sales volumes and lower crude prices. Vista had reported adjusted earnings per share of 61 cents, which came in below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 64 cents. Revenues of $231 million generated by the firm had also come in 8% below the consensus mark.VIST missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings thrice in the last four quarters and beat in the other, resulting in an earnings surprise of (0.1%), on average. This is depicted in the graph below:Vista Oil &amp; Gas, S.A.B. de C.V. Sponsored ADR Price and EPS SurpriseVista Oil &amp; Gas, S.A.B. de C.V. Sponsored ADR Price and EPS SurpriseVista Oil &amp; Gas, S.A.B. de C.V. Sponsored ADR price-eps-surprise | Vista Oil &amp; Gas, S.A.B. de C.V. Sponsored ADR Quote Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third-quarter bottom line has been revised 0.9% downward in the past seven days. The estimated figure indicates a 26.1% improvement year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues, however, suggests a 5.6% decrease from the year-ago period.Factors to ConsiderVista is expected to have reaped the reward of higher production during the quarter. VIST continues to churn out an impressive output from its assets in southwest Argentina’s Vaca Muerta basin, where it focuses on growth through a combination of acquisitions and active drilling. In the previous quarter, VIST’s total output was up 4% year over year over year. The uptick is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter on the back of higher productivity from the company’s flagship Bajada del Palo Oeste region.Vista is also likely to have reaped the reward of lower costs. The company’s rising costs in the April-June period fell around 38% year over year to $4.8 per barrel of oil equivalent. The downward cost trajectory is likely to have continued in the third quarter of 2023 due to VIST’s focus to concentrate on shale operations. This is expected to have had a positive effect on the company’s to-be-reported earnings.On a somewhat bearish note, lower year-over-year oil realizations might have dampened some of the positive impacts. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, in July, August and September of 2023, the average monthly WTI crude price was $76.03, $81.32 and $89.43 per barrel, respectively, which turns out to be $82.26 for the quarter. In 2022, average prices were $99.39 in July, $91.48 in August and $83.80 in September, or $91.56 for the quarter. This price drop is likely to have pullwn the revenues and cash flows of Vista.Story continuesWhat Does Our Model Say?The proven Zacks model does not conclusively show that Vista is likely to beat estimates in the third quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates. But that’s not the case here.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: Vista Oil &amp; Gas has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.16 per share each.Zacks Rank: VIST currently carries a Zacks Rank #1, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult this earnings season.Stocks to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for Vista, here are some firms from the energy space that you may want to consider on the basis of our model:Matador Resources Company MTDR has an Earnings ESP of +6.38% and a Zacks Rank #1.

But it’s worth taking a look at HLX’s previous-quarter performance first.Highlights of Q2 Earnings &amp; Surprise HistoryIn the last reported quarter, the  Houston, TX-based provider of specialty services to offshore energy companies beat the consensus mark on strength in its Well Intervention and Robotics segments. HLX had reported adjusted earnings per share of 11 cents, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 4 cents. Revenues of $308.8 million generated by the firm also came in 12.4% below the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Helix Energy Solutions beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in two of the last four quarters, met in one and missed in the other, resulting in an earnings surprise of (30.6%), on average.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues, meanwhile, suggests a 30.8% increase from the year-ago period.Factors to ConsiderHLX is expected to have benefited from favorable market conditions in its Robotics segment. In the second quarter of 2023, the company’s profits for the unit amounted to $17.5 million. This compared to the year-ago income of $9.7 million. The uptick is most likely to have continued in the third quarter on the back of robust utilization and rates stemming from an uptick in activity.Helix Energy Solutions’ decommissioning presence in the Gulf of Mexico shelf is also expected to have provided a positive backdrop to its upcoming report. Being the only firm to offer full field shallow water abandonment following the ‘Alliance Companies’ acquisition in July 2022, HLX is likely to have reaped the reward of the demand increases for such service. As such, Helix Energy’s segment income is expected to have increased from the 19.8 million recorded in the second quarter.On a somewhat bearish note, a higher expense structure might have dampened some of the positive impacts. Helix Energy’s operating cost of sales in the second quarter increased some 54.6% year over year to $253.5 million.

11,02be9b10-dff8-3125-be9a-b607ef5a3c90,NUE,2023-10-18,Will Weaker Steel Prices Dent Nucor's (NUE) Earnings in Q3?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weaker-steel-prices-dent-nucors-104800874.html,1697626080,STORY,"['NUE', 'X', 'KGC']","[Nucor Corporation NUE is set to release third-quarter 2023 results ahead of the bell on Oct 24.The U.S. steel giant surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 9.6%, on average. It posted an earnings surprise of 3.9% in the last reported quarter. Weaker performance in the steel mills unit and lower selling prices are likely to have impacted Nucor’s third-quarter results.Nucor’s shares are up 22.7% over a year, compared with the industry’s 35.3% rise.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement. What do the Estimates Say?Nucor, last month, issued its earnings guidance for the third quarter. It anticipates third-quarter earnings in the range of $4.10-$4.20 per share, which indicates a decline on both sequential and year-over-year basis.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter consolidated revenues for Nucor is currently pegged at $8,534 million, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 18.7%.A Few Factors to WatchLower profitability in the company’s steel mills segment is expected to have hurt its performance in the quarter to be reported. Nucor, in September, said that it sees lower earnings performance in the steel mills segment in the third quarter compared with the previous quarter due to lower pricing and, to a lesser extent, reduced volumes. The sheet mills within the segment are expected to have experienced the most significant impact on earnings.Our estimate for sales tons to outside customers for steel mills is pegged at 4,705,000 tons for the third quarter, suggesting a decline from 4,774,000 tons reported in the prior quarter.Nucor also expects sequentially lower earnings in the steel products segment in the third quarter due to lower realized prices and reduced volumes. It also sees lower profitability in the raw materials segment mainly due to margin compression at its DRI facilities and scrap processing operations.Meanwhile, U.S. steel prices have witnessed a sharp downward correction. The benchmark hot-rolled coil (HRC) prices have retracted from their April 2023 peak of around $1,200 per short ton. Prices have fallen more than 40% from the highs hit in April, currently hovering around $700 per short ton. The downward drift partly reflects shorter lead times. The United Auto Workers strike against General Motors, Ford and Stellantis also weighed on HRC prices of late.Weaker selling prices are likely to have impacted Nucor’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Our estimate for third-quarter average sales price per ton for the company’s steel mills unit stands at $1,038, suggesting a 19.9% year-over-year decline and an 11.1% sequential decrease.Story continues Nucor Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Nucor Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseNucor Corporation price-eps-surprise | Nucor Corporation Quote Zacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Nucor this season.

12,da5e8317-01c5-3d1e-8b3f-e729d4748313,NUE,2023-10-18,Earnings Preview: Nucor (NUE) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-nucor-nue-q3-140103817.html,1697551263,STORY,['NUE'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Nucor (NUE) reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 24. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis steel company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $4.18 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -35.7%.Revenues are expected to be $8.53 billion, down 18.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4.54% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Nucor?For Nucor, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Nucor will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Nucor would post earnings of $5.59 per share when it actually produced earnings of $5.81, delivering a surprise of +3.94%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Nucor doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

RMR has acquired all the Cincinnati-based Iron &amp; Metal assets of Garden Street. This acquisition includes one feeder and shredder yard, effectively increasing RMR's total number of recycling facilities to 19.This strategic move aligns with Nucor's raw materials strategy and underscores its commitment to expanding regional recycling platforms that support the company's steel mills. This key strategic acquisition will enable the company to enhance its supply of sustainable raw materials, vital for its growing regional steelmaking capacity.The 43 employees of Garden Street have been extended offers to join RMR, ensuring a smooth transition. Following the acquisition, RMR will implement its industry-leading equipment, operational procedures, and safety standards at the facility, which will subsequently be rebranded under the RMR name. RMR takes pride in carrying forward the legacy of Garden Street, which has been a part of the Cincinnati community since 1958 and is dedicated to being a vital component of the sustainable steel supply chain.This move follows a previous acquisition in December 2021 when another Nucor scrap recycling affiliate, Trademark Metals, purchased Garden Street's recycling facilities in Fort Myers, FL.Nucor has gained 19.7% in the past year, compared with the industry's 32.4% rise in the same period.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the third quarter of 2023, Nucor anticipates earnings to be within the range of $4.10 to $4.20 per share, which indicates a decline on both sequential and year-over-year basis. This decline is mainly driven by reduced profitability in the steel mills segment, which is anticipated to be impacted by lower pricing and reduced volumes to a lesser extent. Additionally, the steel products segment is expected to experience a decline in earnings in the third quarter from the second quarter. Furthermore, the raw materials segment is projected to witness decreased earnings due to margin compression at the company's DRI facilities and scrap processing operations.Story continuesNucor Corporation Price and Consensus Nucor Corporation Price and ConsensusNucor Corporation price-consensus-chart | Nucor Corporation Quote Zacks Rank &amp; Other Key PicksNucor currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the Basic Materials space are WestRock Company WRK and The Andersons Inc.

14,0749edc6-9d79-3bab-9174-e38ae515adfa,NUE,2023-10-18,Nucor Corporation (NUE) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nucor-corporation-nue-attracting-investor-130007184.html,1697547607,STORY,['NUE'],"[Nucor (NUE) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this steel company have returned -3.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.6% change. The Zacks Steel - Producers industry, to which Nucor belongs, has lost 6.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Nucor is expected to post earnings of $4.18 per share, indicating a change of -35.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -4.5% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $17.79 points to a change of -38.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.9%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.99 indicates a change of -32.6% from what Nucor is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.7%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Nucor.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Nucor, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $8.53 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -18.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $34.49 billion and $31.29 billion estimates indicate -16.9% and -9.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNucor reported revenues of $9.52 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -19.3%. EPS of $5.81 for the same period compares with $9.67 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.73 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.16%. The EPS surprise was +3.94%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nucor is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nucor. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

15,6ba219e3-f0f1-3df7-a120-91f352efbc51,ARE,2023-10-18,Alexandria (ARE) to Post Q3 Earnings: What's in the Cards?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alexandria-post-q3-earnings-whats-145700952.html,1697554620,STORY,"['ARE', 'AMT']","[Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc. ARE is scheduled to release third-quarter 2023 results on Oct 23 after the closing bell. Its quarterly results are likely to reflect growth in revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share.In the last reported quarter, this Pasadena, CA-based life science real estate investment trust (REIT), focusing on collaborative life science, agtech and technology campuses in AAA innovation cluster locations, delivered a surprise of 1.82% in terms of adjusted FFO per share. ARE’s performance in the quarter was mainly driven by decent leasing activity and rental rate growth.Alexandria has a decent surprise history. Over the preceding four quarters, its adjusted FFO per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on each occasion, the average beat being 1.16%. This is depicted in the graph below:Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAlexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAlexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayIn the third quarter, with the demand for life-science assets booming due to the increasing need for drug research and innovation, ARE is expected to have benefited from its emphasis on the development of Class A/A+ properties strategically located within AAA innovation cluster regions. These locations are highly appealing to life science, agtech and technology companies seeking tenancy. As a result, ARE is expected to have witnessed healthy demand for its life science assets in the third quarter, driving healthy leasing and re-leasing activity.In addition to the advantageous locations of the company’s properties, these locations are characterized by high barriers to entry for new landlords, high barriers to exit for tenants and a limited supply of available space. This is likely to have aided occupancy levels to remain high at Alexandria’s properties. For the quarter to be reported, we expect same-store occupancy at 94.2%.Alexandria’s diverse and creditworthy tenant base, which includes many industry bellwethers, is anticipated to have led to impressive rent collections in the to-be-reported quarter. We estimate ARE’s rental income to grow 7.7% year over year for the third quarter.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Alexandria’s quarterly revenues currently stands at $720.9 million, suggesting an increase of 9.25% from the prior-year period’s reported figure.However, ARE’s substantial active development and redevelopment pipeline, although encouraging for long-term growth, exposes it to the risk of rising construction costs and lease-up concerns amid a macroeconomic slowdown. As of Jun 30, 2023, the company had 5.3 million RSF of Class A/A+ properties undergoing construction. Moreover, it had 9.4 million RSF of near-term and intermediate-term development and redevelopment projects and 19.1 million SF of future development projects.Moreover, a high interest rate environment is a concern for Alexandria. Elevated rates imply high borrowing costs for the company, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate. The company has a substantial debt burden, and its total debt as of Jun 30, 2023 was approximately $11.2 billion.Alexandria’s activities in the to-be-reported quarter were inadequate to garner analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly FFO per share has been revised a cent downward to $2.24 over the past week. However, the figure suggests a 5.16% increase from the year-ago quarter’s tally.Here Is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively predict a surprise in terms of FFO per share for Alexandria this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an FFO beat, which is not the case here.Alexandria currently carries a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) and has an Earnings ESP of -0.31%.

EXR and Cousins Properties Incorporated CUZ — you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a surprise this quarter.American Tower Corporation is slated to report quarterly numbers on Oct 26.

16,d9b7721a-d8e5-3f01-88fd-239dcc7c1d34,UNM,2023-10-18,Unum Group (NYSE:UNM) shareholders have earned a 45% CAGR over the last three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unum-group-nyse-unm-shareholders-180813217.html,1697566093,STORY,['UNM'],"[The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. To wit, the Unum Group (NYSE:UNM) share price has flown 172% in the last three years. Most would be happy with that. In the last week the share price is up 1.3%.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for Unum Group To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During three years of share price growth, Unum Group achieved compound earnings per share growth of 17% per year. In comparison, the 40% per year gain in the share price outpaces the EPS growth. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did three years ago. It's not unusual to see the market 're-rate' a stock, after a few years of growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Unum Group's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Unum Group's TSR for the last 3 years was 207%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Unum Group shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 22% over one year. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 12% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because State Street is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for STT in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently higher than the broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.77 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for STT, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.31% heading into earnings season.State Street Corporation Price and EPS Surprise State Street Corporation price-eps-surprise | State Street Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that STT has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for State Street, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

There are a number of investment styles to cater to investors looking for the best value stocks.Among them, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is an easy-to-use tool for identifying low-priced stocks, which have high-growth prospects.The P/B ratio is used to calculate how much an investor needs to pay for each dollar of book value of a stock. It is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the latest quarter's book value per share.P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equity.The P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks that have high growth prospects. Select Medical Holdings Corporation SEM, PVH Corp. PVH, KB Home KBH, Paysafe Limited (PSFE) and HF Sinclair Corporation (DINO) are some such stocks.Now, let us understand the concept of book value.What is Book Value?There are several ways by which book value can be defined. Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value or the stock is undervalued and, therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.Story continuesFor example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses — like finance, investments, insurance, and banking or manufacturing companies — with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&amp;D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median:A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median:The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share — a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are five of the 11 picks that qualified the screening:Mechanicsburg, PA-based Select Medical is a healthcare company, which owns long-term acute care and inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, as well as occupational health and physical therapy clinics.

Analysts had expected a profit of $1.02 per share, according to LSEG data.But even though lenders have reaped a windfall from interest income, the 'higher-for-longer' interest rate environment has soured the outlook for the economy as consumers feel the burn of higher credit costs and lower household budgets.USB set aside $515 million as provisions anticipating more loan defaults, compared with $362 million a year earlier.Deposits at banks have been relatively stable in recent months after a sector-wide crisis of confidence earlier this year saw clients pull cash from banks.Average total deposits at USB were up 3% at $512 billion in the third quarter from a year earlier.

That means it faces less costly and time-consuming regulations.The promises to shrink itself came after the lender, which had $665 billion in assets as of Sept. 30, spent months preparing to comply with the rules associated with becoming a so-called Category II bank, a designation given to lenders with more than $700 billion in assets.“U.S. Bancorp represents that it anticipates taking further actions to reduce its projected risk profile, including further net reductions in assets and increases in regulatory capital,” Ann Misback, secretary for the Federal Reserve Board, said in a letter to U.S. Bancorp’s lawyer. Based on the fact’s the company presented, she said, the board “has approved U.S. Bancorp’s request for complete relief from the commitments.”A spokesman for U.S. Bancorp declined to comment on the letter. Shares of the Minneapolis-based lender surged 7% to close Tuesday at $34.89, the biggest gain since March.A Category II designation would have brought stricter liquidity requirements, an annual rather than biennial company-run stress test, and a more complex methodology for determining its capital requirements.‘Very Positive’U.S. Bancorp has already taken steps to decrease risk, according to the Fed. That includes reducing its investment portfolio by about $30 billion and completing loan sales and securitizations worth roughly $7 billion, while reducing short-term borrowing on its balance sheet, the Fed said.Story continuesIn its decision, the central bank also cited a series of proposals it has made that will tighten rules for Category III lenders, such as one that will require such lenders to include unrealized losses on their balance sheet investments in their capital ratios.U.S. Bancorp agreed to submit to a stricter regulatory regime as part of its deal for Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group’s Union Bank. It has previously said it would be able to comply with the more stringent rules by the end of 2024.“The regulatory change is very positive for U.S. Bancorp,” Gerard Cassidy, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note to clients. “It will give the company greater flexibility in managing its balance sheet over the next two years.”--With assistance from Jenny Surane.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe New Middle East Is an All-Too-Familiar NightmareWall Street’s Surprising Quest for Ways to Finance Coal AgainAd-Free Versions of Facebook and Instagram Have One Audience in Mind: RegulatorsBiden’s FCC Revives the Longest-Running Policy Fight in TechThe K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTS©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Astronauts. Space centers.For most of us, these are the subjects of a sci-fi thriller. For Adam Sanders, they were the thrill of daily work. In 2006, the college grad launched his career as an engineer with General Motors, which quickly led to his selection to participate in a partnership with NASA for more than six years.Adam Sanders in front of the patent wall outside the Dexterous Robotics Laboratory at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. Sanders was awarded 11 patents while working at NASA.""Have you ever seen the movie Armageddon? There was a scene where they tested the rover in this huge vacuum chamber in the Johnson Space Center,"" Sanders said. ""That was the building that I worked in.""Sanders' cosmos didn't coincide with Ben Affleck or Bruce Willis during his tenure as a roboticist, but he did make a name for himself in the space of engineering - racking up 11 patents (connected to the Robonaut technology) and the title of inventor for his resume.""I was fresh out of college, so this was absolutely astounding,"" he said. ""There's no other word to describe it. It was a wonderful experience. I was working with some of the smartest people in the world.""Now a principal engineer with U.S. Bank, Sanders was among a group of inventors and former colleagues recently recognized by NASA with the Commercial Invention of the Year award for Robo-Glove, a wearable robotic technology Sanders helped build during his time at the NASA Johnson Space Center.""In assembly plants, one of the common injuries is from repetitive strain,"" Sanders said. ""With Robo-Glove you can pick something up, actuate the Robo-Glove so it relieves pressure on your hand, and it helps reduce fatigue and tendon strain ergonomically.""The technology, inspired by NASA's Robonaut humanoid robot, was patented in 2010 and 2011, and has since been bought and rebranded for commercial use, which landed it the award for Commercial Invention of the Year in 2020. Covid delayed the recognition ceremony until this year.Story continues""At NASA, we believe technology drives exploration, and our talented innovators are key to our continued leadership in space and technology,"" Douglas Terrier, NASA's chief technologist, said in an announcement about the awards. ""Each year, we evaluate our inventions based on how they've benefitted NASA and other industries and recognize the great people behind the technologies. The technologies we recognize with these awards will have lasting impacts on the way we transport goods, build cars and space stations, and enable audacious missions to accomplish NASA's most ambitious goals.""From builder of robots to transformer of bankingLanding a career in banking after building robots with NASA may seem like an unusual path, but Sanders said the two industries are fewer light years away than you may think.""In robotics, we deal with a lot of real-time data,"" Sanders said. ""You say ‘Hey, robot, try to do these steps on your own but work with a human for direction.' That's a surprisingly close synergy with what we do in capital markets.""At U.S. Bank, Sanders works on foreign exchange technology for Global Capital Markets.""We use information from the market and environment in real time,"" he said. ""What's the market doing, the pricing, what's going on in the news, in the world, where do we think things are going. There's more overlap than you would expect.""In both banking and robotics, Sanders said technology is created that allows humans to interact with it, interpret what's occurring because of it and use the information to adjust as needed to help drive a business's goals and strategic direction.Prior to joining U.S. Bank in 2022, Sanders spent 10 years in the financial sector and led a team of engineers. And he's impressed with what U.S. Bank is doing with technology.""One of the things I think is great about U.S. Bank is they give you the tools and let you explore. I really appreciate the emphasis and support driven by leadership in upskilling,"" Sanders said. ""We're investing in our people and investing in them in a way that makes sense for the people. Paying for tools for us to learn about new technologies - it's a particularly important thing that I'm most proud of working here.""In his current role at the bank, Sanders is supporting the migration of foreign exchange technology to the cloud as part of the bank's ongoing technology transformation. The new, modern platform replaces vendor systems that have a collective 50-year history in the bank.""What we're now using at the bank is at the forefront of tech modernization. It's built using some of the latest technology. It allows us to adapt and scale with the business in unparalleled ways,"" Sanders said.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from U.S. Bank on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: U.S. BankWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/us-bank Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: U.S. BankView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/793709/us-bank-engineer-recognized-by-nasa-for-commercial-invention-of-the-year-award]"

However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. In this article, we decided to focus on Edwards Lifesciences'  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Edwards Lifesciences How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Edwards Lifesciences is:22% = US$1.4b ÷ US$6.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.22 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of Edwards Lifesciences' Earnings Growth And 22% ROETo begin with, Edwards Lifesciences seems to have a respectable ROE. Especially when compared to the industry average of 9.3% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. This certainly adds some context to Edwards Lifesciences' decent 18% net income growth seen over the past five years.Story continuesWe then compared Edwards Lifesciences' net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 8.1% in the same 5-year period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for EW? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Edwards Lifesciences Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Edwards Lifesciences doesn't pay any dividend currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This definitely contributes to the decent earnings growth number that we discussed above.SummaryIn total, we are pretty happy with Edwards Lifesciences' performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

In the second quarter of 2023, Surgical Structural Heart sales growth was driven by the adoption of Edwards' premium products and strength in valve surgery procedures, led by the improvement in healthcare staffing. The strong adoption of the SAPIEN family of valves continues to drive TAVR (Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement) sales growth.Meanwhile, elevated expenses are adversely affecting EW’s margins. Further, competitive pressure may adversely affect the company’s performance.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has decreased 17.3% compared with the 1.9% fall of the industry and a 16.8% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned global medical device company has a market capitalization of $43.03 billion. Edward Lifesciences’ earnings surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, delivering an average surprise of 1.62%.Let’s delve deeper.UpsidesSolid Potential in Critical Care Business: This is Edwards Lifesciences’ one of the rapidly growing businesses. The company is a leading player, particularly in advanced hemodynamic monitoring systems used to measure a patient's heart function and fluid status in surgical and intensive care settings.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEdwards Lifesciences is currently driving the adoption of its Smart Recovery Technologies and Acumen IQ sensor. The company’s state-of-the-art HemoSphere monitoring platform continued its sales momentum in the second quarter of 2023, coupled with a healthy pipeline of future opportunities.Bright Prospects of Surgical Structural Heart Business: The growth of this business is driven by the increased penetration of Edwards Lifesciences’ premium RESILIA products across all regions. As hospital staffing levels gradually improve, advanced tissue technology continues to be prioritized for aortic and mitral surgical valve replacement procedures.Story continuesThe company is growing a large body of RESILIA evidence with the MOMENTIS clinical study to demonstrate the durability of the RESILIA tissue in the mitral position. As bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement (AVR) extends to younger patients, tissue durability is becoming of paramount importance. The latest seven-year data from the COMMENCE aortic trial is expected to support the adoption of EW’s RESILIA family of products.TAVR Holds Potential: Across the product group, Edwards Lifesciences’ sales growth continues to be driven by its leading SAPIEN platform. In the second quarter, TAVR sales in the United States were particularly aided by improved hospital staffing levels and the continued SAPIEN 3Ultra RESILIA launch.The company recently noted that it would begin enrollment for the ALLIANCE pivotal trial, designed to study the next-generation TAVR technology, SAPIEN X4. Further, the ongoing launch of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA in Japan is likely to augment growth. In Europe, Edwards Lifesciences’ sales growth continues to be broad-based by country, led by the demand for the SAPIEN platform.DownsidesEscalated Expenses: Edwards Lifesciences has been grappling with escalated expenses for a while. In the second quarter of 2023, high SG&amp;A expenses were driven by performance-based compensations and investments in transcatheter field-based personnel in support of EW’s growth strategy.In addition, the gross and adjusted operating margins declined in the quarter, raising our concern. Competitive Risks: The company faces substantial competition and competes with many technologies and companies of all sizes based on cost-effectiveness, technological innovations, product performance, brand name recognition, breadth of product offerings, product advantages, pricing and availability and rate of reimbursement. Without the timely innovation and development of products, EW stands at the risk of its products becoming obsolete or less competitive because of the introduction of its competitor’s newer technologies or changing customer preferences.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Edwards Lifesciences’ 2023 earnings per share (EPS) has remained constant at $2.55 in the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $6.01 billion. This suggests an 11.7% rise from the year-ago reported number.Other Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Haemonetics HAE, Align Technology ALGN and Cardinal Health CAH.Haemonetics has an estimated earnings growth rate of 26.1% for fiscal 2024 compared with the industry’s 18.7%.

To skip our detailed analysis of current US market news, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold According to Bill Gates' Portfolio.A Businessman And Philanthropist Many Look Up ToBill Gates has been an asset to the American economy for decades, and his contributions to the tech and environmental awareness areas have been significant for as long as he has been involved in them. At present, Gates has a net worth of $109.3 billion, according to Forbes.Considering the immense amount of influence Gates has today, many starting investors, and even more seasoned ones, are interested in the secret behind the management of his wealth. The answer to this question lies in the creation and continued operation of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust, managed by Michael Larson on behalf of Gates. The trust has about $36 billion in assets under management and has a diverse range of holdings ranging from companies in the technology and financial sectors to those in the industrial goods, services, and consumer goods sectors, among more. Interestingly, the holdings also include waste management companies, indicating Gates' general interest in environmental action, which is translated into his trust's investments. The key reason behind the maintenance of Gates' wealth is Larson's work to keep his wealth steady while also multiplying it to ensure the billionaire has enough to go around for his countless philanthropic endeavors.Fighting The Greatest Inequities In The WorldOn the subject of Gates' philanthropic work, records from the end of 2022 show that the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust gave out 1,960 grants in the year, while its total charitable support amounted to about $7 billion. The foundation has been working tirelessly over the past 20 years to fight ""the greatest inequities in the world,"" making it a prime focus for the Gates family to actively engage in charitable and philanthropic work. An example of Gates' work for the global community at large is his creation of Breakthrough Energy, a climate investment firm that aims to accelerate innovation in sustainable energy and other technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This move, alongside Gates' donations of billions of dollars to a range of charitable causes, make him one of the biggest philanthropists in the US today.Story continuesAll in all, Gates is an inspirational figure for many, making his business and investment moves open to observation by the world at large. A significant portion of his wealth can be attributed to Larson's money management skills, but at the end of the day, the biggest contributors are the companies he holds significant stakes in. These include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE), among others. Considering the above, we have taken a look at Bill Gates' investment portfolio for 2023 to pick 12 stocks he considers to be the best to buy and hold.

Today's Research Daily features a real-time update on the Q3 earnings season and new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Walmart Inc. (WMT), NIKE, Inc. (NKE) and The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Q3 Earnings Season Scorecard Including this morning's earnings reports, we now have Q3 results from 39 S&amp;P 500 members that combined account for 11.4% of the index's market capitalization. Total earnings for these 39 index members are up +7.1% from the same period last year on +7% higher revenues, with 89.7% beating EPS estimates and 69.2% beating revenue estimates. While the beats percentages are about in-line with the preceding 20-quarter average for this group of 39 index members, the earnings growth rate represents a modest improvement over other recent quarters. For the Finance sector, which has dominated this initial reporting cycle, we now have Q3 results from 31.2% of the sector's total market capitalization in the S&amp;P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance companies are up +9.7% from the same period last year on +9.3% higher revenues, with 100% of the companies beating EPS estimates and 72.7% beating revenue estimates. While the revenue beats percentage for this group of Finance sector companies is about in-line with other recent quarters, the EPS beats percentage is the highest for this group since the second quarter of 2021. Hard to draw any firm conclusions from this relatively small sample of results at this stage, but it is nevertheless a positive start to the Q3 earnings season. Looking at Q3 as a whole, combining the actual results for the 39 index members that have reported with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total earnings for the quarter are now expected to be down -1.1% on +0.8% higher revenues.

49,63f6c243-bcaa-32fb-a848-efe7c288be6e,HBAN,2023-10-18,Earnings Preview: Heartland BancCorp. (HLAN) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-heartland-banccorp-hlan-140057344.html,1697551257,STORY,['HBAN'],"[The market expects Heartland BancCorp. (HLAN) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis bank holding company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.27 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -9.2%.Revenues are expected to be $18.2 million, up 2.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Heartland BancCorp.For Heartland BancCorp.The Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.76%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Heartland BancCorp. Will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Heartland BancCorp. Would post earnings of $2.07 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.39, delivering a surprise of +15.46%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Heartland BancCorp. Doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsHuntington Bancshares (HBAN), another stock in the Zacks Banks - Midwest industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.32 for the quarter ended September 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -18%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.82 billion, down 4.6% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Huntington Bancshares has been revised 0.7% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.71%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that Huntington Bancshares will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the healthcare industry and its developments, go ahead and click on the 5 Best Health Insurance Stocks to Buy.Amidst a backdrop of economic uncertainty worldwide, the healthcare industry has shown impressive resilience. Over time, the demand for healthcare goods and services has proven to be relatively stable. This resilience of the healthcare sector was particularly evident during the equity downturn of 2022, where, for example, the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund greatly outperformed the Nasdaq, S&amp;P 500, and Dow Jones. BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK)'s data indicates that healthcare stocks exhibited 23% less volatility compared to the overall market in the past year. Additionally, throughout the last seven recessions, the healthcare sector consistently outperformed the broader market by an average margin of 10%. Moreover, during the past six recessions, the industry experienced an average earnings growth of 21%.The healthcare sector stands as a robust sanctuary during economic downturns, given that personal well-being is a non-negotiable priority for most individuals, irrespective of financial constraints. The demand for healthcare remains steadfast, evidenced by the fact that as of 2023, one in three adults globally grapple with chronic conditions such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. Concurrently, approximately one in four individuals is projected to encounter a form of mental health disorder during their lifetime. Deloitte, in this regard, estimates an economic loss of $16.3 trillion over a 20-year period due to mental health issues, underscoring the significant impact on the global economy.Rising healthcare expenses in the nation have rendered it nearly impossible to bear the costs independently, highlighting the vital role of health insurance. In 2021, private health insurance accounted for a substantial portion of the $4.26 trillion spent on healthcare, surpassing Medicare and Medicaid, with a coverage worth $1.21 trillion. Out-of-pocket payments for healthcare amounted to just $433 billion. Across the board, over 300 million Americans had some degree of health insurance coverage in 2022, marking a 40% rise since 1990. As of 2023, the US health insurance exchanges, established under the Affordable Care Act in 2014, are celebrating their tenth year of operation. Over this decade, the individual market has remained dynamic, witnessing shifts in insurer involvement, pricing, and plan offerings on an annual basis. Global research and consultancy firm McKinsey states that consumer engagement notably surged by 25% between 2020 and 2022, reaching around 16 million participants. This increase aligned with the elongated enrollment periods and improved subsidies introduced by the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, later prolonged through 2025 by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.Story continuesThe global health insurance industry stands to experience substantial growth in the future. Projections indicate that the global health insurance market is anticipated to achieve a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 9.9% from 2022 to 2030, as outlined by Straits Research. By 2030, this growth is expected to propel the market to a value of $5.28 trillion. In that same vein, some of the best health insurance stocks in the industry include UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), and Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV), among others listed below.Best Health Insurance Stocks to BuyPhoto by martha-dominguez-de-gouveia on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo compile our list of the best health insurance stocks to buy, we scoured through Insider Monkey's Q2 2023 database to identify the leaders in the health insurance industry based on hedge fund sentiment. The following companies, ranked according to the number of hedge funds that hold their shares, all offer health insurance services within the United States, and/or internationally.12. Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL) is a financial services company headquartered in Texas, offering a range of insurance coverage options. The company specializes in supplemental health insurance products, including cancer insurance, ICU insurance, critical illness coverage, and hospital insurance. Notably, Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL) provides Medicare supplemental insurance plans that assist in covering expenses like deductibles, co-insurance, co-payments, and cost-sharing for outpatient hospital services.In a bid to expand its healthcare business, Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL) completed its acquisition of Evry Health, a business-to-business health insurance company based in Dallas, Texas, on October 16.Cumulatively, 29 of the 910 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey’s Q2 2023 database had invested in Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL), up from 24 in the previous quarter.Much like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), and Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV), Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL) ranks as one of the best health insurance stocks to invest in.11. Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:MOH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:MOH) is a managed care company based in Long Beach, California, United States. The company offers health insurance to individuals through government programs like Medicaid and Medicare.Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:MOH) announced its GAAP earnings per diluted share of $5.35 and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $5.65 for the second quarter of 2023.

(NYSE:MOH) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here is what it said:“Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:MOH) also performed well as sentiment toward health maintenance organizations improved, both as a relatively defensive investment during uncertain times, and as the bear case on the stock was partially debunked with an extension of expanded enrollment for government health insurance programs.”10. MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, better known as MetLife Inc. (NYSE:MET), is among the largest global providers of insurance, annuities, and employee benefit programs, with more than 90 million customers in over 60 countries.On October 10, MetLife Inc.

The company’s dividend yield on October 16 stood at 3.28%.As of Q2 2023, 40 hedge funds were long MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) with collective stakes of $1.17 billion in the insurance giant. Richard S. Pzena’s Pzena Investment Management is MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET)’s largest investor, owning a $261.9 million stake through 4.63 million shares.9. Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50Chubb Limited (NYSE: CB) is a multinational insurance corporation providing a diverse array of insurance and reinsurance offerings to individuals, businesses, and various entities worldwide. On August 10, the company announced a quarterly dividend of $0.86 per share, maintaining its consistent dividend track record. The company has steadily increased its dividends for the past three decades. As of October 16, the stock boasts a dividend yield of 1.61%.Insider Monkey’s database of Q2 2023 indicated that 50 funds owned stakes in Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB) in Q2 2023, growing from 45 in the previous quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is over $1.73 billion. With over 1.5 million shares, Millennium Management was the company’s leading stakeholder in Q2.8. Centene Corporation (NYSE:CNC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57Centene Corporation (NYSE:CNC), headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, is a publicly traded managed care firm serving as an intermediary for both government-sponsored and privately insured healthcare programs. The company primarily focuses on the Medicaid market, with a significant proportion of its membership consisting of traditional participants, including those in programs like Children’s Health Insurance Program and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, who require regular monitoring. Medicaid plans account for nearly two-thirds of Centene Corporation (NYSE:CNC)’s total revenue, making it a vital revenue stream. However, the company is experiencing even faster revenue growth in its Medicare segment.On July 28, Centene Corporation (NYSE:CNC) revealed its Q2 non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.10 and reported a revenue of $37.61 billion. The revenue surpassed market estimates by $1.07 billion, demonstrating robust performance, and the earnings outperformed Street expectations by $0.05.According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 57 hedge funds were bullish on Centene Corporation (NYSE:CNC). This number was 61 in the previous quarter. Quentin Koffey’s Politan Capital had the largest position in the stock, with 12.13 million shares worth $818.65 million.Oakmark Funds made the following comment about Centene Corporation (NYSE:CNC) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“Centene Corporation (NYSE:CNC) is one of the largest health insurers in the U.S. The company specializes in three major government-sponsored programs: Medicaid, Marketplace and Medicare Advantage. Each of these benefits from long-term secular tailwinds. In Medicaid, states are steadily outsourcing their programs to managed care companies, like Centene, as it helps states reduce costs and improve care quality. Indeed, Managed Medicaid penetration has increased from 25% of total Medicaid spend in 2010 to 60% today, and we expect further gains over time. In Marketplace, growth is driven by the trend toward more individuals buying health insurance. Centene holds the #1 market share in both of these programs and is well positioned to capitalize on their continued growth. The stock trades for 10x consensus 2024 EPS, but this doesn’t tell the whole story. Past missteps in Centene’s Medicare business will result in that segment losing $0.80 per share next year. We believe Centene can turn Medicare around and generate positive earnings in the next few years. This could increase EPS by more than $1 per share and reduce the P/E ratio to just 8.5x. We think that’s good value for a business that generates healthy returns on capital and is capable of growing EPS at a low double-digit rate.”7. The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) is a prominent American insurance company that offers automobile and health insurance solutions. By the latter part of 2022, Progressive had achieved the status of being the largest motor insurance carrier in the United States. The company's origins trace back to 1937 when it was co-founded by Jack Green and Joseph M. Lewis. Its headquarters are located in Mayfield Village, Ohio.During July of 2023, The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) experienced a stock price surge after J.P. Morgan analyst Jimmy Bhullar upgraded the rating from Neutral to Overweight. This upgrade happened despite The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) reporting recent disappointing financial results. Bhullar emphasized that despite subpar margins over the past two years, he holds an optimistic long-term outlook for the personal auto market, considering it a structurally superior business compared to commercial lines or reinsurance.As of the end of the first quarter of 2023, 64 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR).The London Company Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) – PGR underperformed during Q2 due to concerns about additional price hikes needed to maintain its targeted profitability ratio. PGR continues to increase auto policies in force, but recent costs were higher than expected. To combat weaker than expected margins, PGR is reducing advertising spending and increasing prices on insurance. Looking ahead, we believe PGR remains well positioned reflecting its more flexible pricing platform and tech solutions that monitor and price for distracted driving. While near-term costs were higher than expected, PGR has a great track record of profitability and conservative underwriting philosophy.”6. Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) is a company focused on health and well-being, providing healthcare benefits to medical and specialty members. The range of services includes fully-insured medical and specialty health insurance benefits such as vision, dental, supplemental health benefits, and administrative services only (ASO products) for individuals and employer groups. The company also offers healthcare services catering to retired and active duty military personnel and their dependents. These services encompass pharmacy solutions, clinical care services, provider services, as well as predictive modeling and informatics services.On August 8, after an as-expected quarter and an upward revision in guidance, Bernstein chose to increase its price target for Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) from $568 per share to $599 per share. This adjustment highlights Bernstein's optimistic reevaluation of Humana Inc.'s potential stock value, indicating a more positive outlook for the company's market performance. While raising the price target, Bernstein retains its “Market Perform” rating.By the end of this year’s second quarter, 70 among the 910 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey’s research had bought Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM)’s shares. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is its biggest stakeholder since it owns $1.3 billion worth of shares.Vltava Fund made the following comment about Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“A new position in the portfolio is the US health insurer Elevance Health. This sector is quite familiar to us. In fact, we also have shares of another health insurer, Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), in our portfolio, which we first bought in 2009. The sector has been very attractive over the long term and its structure favours big players, which both Humana and Elevance Health are. Because each of these two companies also has some specific risk, we decided to increase our investment in the sector by acquiring this second position. Both companies are high-growth in terms of profitability and we expect their above-average growth to continue for quite some time.""Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) joins the ranks of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), and Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV) as one of the best health insurance stocks investors should keep on their radars. Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Health Insurance Stocks to Buy. Suggested articles:12 Best Upwork Alternatives for Freelancers and EmployersTop 20 Countries With Most Natural Resources in the World23 High-Paying Trade and Vocational Jobs in 2023Disclosure: None. 12 Best Health Insurance Stocks to Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

""To successfully lead digital transformation initiatives, CIOs must co-own efforts with business leaders to place the design, delivery and management of digital capabilities with teams closest to the point where value is created.""Gartner analysts presented the survey findings during Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo, taking place here through Thursday. The 2024 Gartner CIO and Technology Executive Survey gathered data from 2,457 CIO respondents in 84 countries and all major industries, representing approximately $12.5 trillion in revenue/public-sector budgets and $163 billion in IT spending.CIOs Continue to Democratize Digital Delivery with GenAICIOs have already been laying the foundation for democratized digital delivery with technologies such as low-code platforms, which 64% of CIOs said they have deployed or plan to deploy in the next 24 months. Generative AI (GenAI), which 70% of CIOs say is a game-changing technology, will also rapidly advance the democratization of digital delivery beyond the IT function. While only 9% of CIOs have already deployed GenAI technologies, over half (55%) say they will deploy generative AI over the next 24 months.The survey revealed that CIOs’ top areas of future investment in 2024 include cybersecurity, data analytics and cloud platforms.According to the survey, CIOs and IT leaders cited excelling in customer or citizen experience, improving operating margins and generating revenue as the most critical outcomes from digital technology investments.Story continues""Today’s CIO has ambitions well beyond IT delivery,"" said Bishop. ""In fact, 42% of CIOs reported that they want to grow within the current scope of their role and 43% hope to expand their scope with additional leadership responsibilities. CIOs must be at the top of their game in delivering business outcomes to reach the next level.""CIOs Can Empower and Equip Business-Led Digital Delivery Teams Through FranchisingThe survey uncovered three distinct CIO profiles that encompass how CIOs accelerate and scale digital delivery:55% of CIOs polled embrace an operator mindset, where the CIO retains digital delivery responsibility and partners with CxOs as sponsors of business area digital initiatives.33% of CIOs surveyed represent explorers. These CIOs have begun to involve CxOs’ and business area staff in digital delivery activities.12% of CIOs Gartner categorizes as franchisers. These CIOs co-lead, co-deliver and co-govern digital initiatives with their CxO peers. Delivery responsibility is shared by IT and business staff working together in multidisciplinary fusion teams.Franchiser CIOs are more likely than their operator and explorer counterparts to meet or exceed expectations for digital outcomes. Specifically, 63% of digital initiatives enterprise-wide meet or exceed outcome targets when CIOs adopt a franchise model. This is compared with 43% of digital initiatives that succeed when CIOs remain within a traditional operator model. Furthermore, franchisers also perform significantly better at general IT management activities, such as executive leadership development and digital business strategy.""The ongoing democratization of digital delivery represents an effort to drive business innovation, speed to market and agility,"" said Janelle Hill, Distinguished VP Analyst, Gartner. ""As CIOs are expected by their CEO to orchestrate a range of enterprise outcomes, CIOs must integrate and align the digital initiatives led by their CxO counterparts. CIO and CXO co-ownership of digital delivery is an indivisible part of enterprise – not just functional – outcome attainment.""In a franchise design, CIOs and CxOs also share responsibility for technology governance. Nearly half of franchiser CIOs (47%) agree that the business should share responsibility for compliance and risk, compared with just 19% of operators.""Franchisers who develop a co-governance mindset work alongside CxOs to manage cybersecurity and data privacy – two areas that have traditionally been part of the CIO’s oversight,"" added Hill.

This move sent shockwaves through the industry and raised questions about the project's future.Let’s delve into the details of this termination, its potential implications and the context surrounding it.Background of the ContractOriginally awarded in 2020, the contract signified a substantial commitment by Shell to revamp its pipeline infrastructure in Singapore. The project aimed to repair a nearshore pipeline and single-buoy mooring system at Shell's Bukom refinery in the country. It was a crucial part of Shell's efforts to ensure efficient and safe offloading of crude oil, a cornerstone of the company’s operations.The TerminationIn a filing to Malaysia's stock exchange Bursa, Sapura Energy revealed that the termination of the contract followed a letter dated 20 Sep, from a Shell subsidiary and a meeting between the companies on 5 Oct. According to a statement by Sapura Offshore Sdn Bhd (SOSB), Shell decided to terminate the contract without admission of liability, reserving all of SOSB's rights.Legal RamificationsIn response to the termination, SOSB sought legal advice from external counsel, suggesting that this decision may not be taken lightly. The termination of such a significant contract could lead to legal disputes and financial problems for both parties. While the exact nature of these consequences is yet to be seen, they could have far-reaching effects on both Shell and Sapura Energy.Project RescopingBefore the termination, Sapura Energy had been in negotiations regarding the rescoping of its EPCI contract for the second phase of Shell's pipeline rejuvenation project. This suggests that there might have been issues or disagreements regarding the project's scope, timeline, or other critical aspects. While the exact reasons behind the termination are not explicitly stated, it's clear that this project was facing challenges that led to its dissolution.Story continuesIndustry SpeculationAs news of this termination spread throughout the industry, speculations regarding the broader implications for the oil and gas sector sparked. This raised questions about the stability of EPCI contracts in the current economic and geopolitical landscape. The oil industry, in particular, is subject to fluctuations in supply and demand, and the termination of major contracts can have a ripple effect on oil businesses and the market as a whole.ConclusionThe termination of the Shell-Sapura Energy contract for the pipeline rejuvenation project in Singapore has raised eyebrows and sparked debate within the industry. While the exact reasons behind this decision remain undisclosed, it is clear that the project faced significant challenges. The legal ramifications and potential consequences for both parties are yet to be determined.Zacks Rank and Key PicksCurrently, SHEL has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the energy sector are CVR Energy CVI and USA Compression Partners USAC, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and Harbour Energy HBRIY, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

Two-year Treasury yields hit their highest since 2006 on Tuesday at 5.24% and held most of those gains overnight - while 20-year yields are hovering around 5.2% as well.Adding to the inflation anxiety worldwide, Britain reported that its headline inflation failed to fall as expected last month and at 6.7% remains far above the Bank of England's 2% target - sending UK government bond yields surging again too.Against all that, Wall St stocks remained remarkably resilient as they parse the torrent of incoming earnings - ending only marginally in the red on Tuesday and with futures down a fraction ahead of the bell today.Stocks in Asia and Europe mostly held the line too, with China's bourses underperforming against a backdrop of property worries and new U.S. restrictions on investment in its chip sector.The dollar held steady on Wednesday for the most part.In domestic politics, attention turned to Congress and the absence of a House speaker ahead of another possible shutdown of U.S. government operations next month.Right-wing Republican Jim Jordan on Tuesday sought more time to build support for his bid for the speaker's role after coming up short in a first vote, raising questions about his prospects for winning the job.Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Wednesday: * U.S. corporate earnings: Tesla, Procter &amp; Gamble, Netflix, Abbott Laboratories, Morgan Stanley, Northern Trust, Nasdaq, Travelers, M&amp;T, Citizens Financial, US Bancorp, Zions Bancorp, Discover Financial, Lam Research, Alcoa, POPG, Steel Dynamics, Crown Castle, Equifax, Kinder Morgan, Elevance * U.S. President Joe Biden visits Israel * U.S. Sept housing starts and permits, Federal Reserve releases Beige Book of economic conditions, Aug TIC Treasury flows data * Federal Reserve board governors Christopher Waller, Lisa Cook and Michelle Bowman all speak, New York Fed President John Williams and Philadelphia Fed chief Patrick Harker also speak * U.S. Treasury auctions 20-year bonds(By Mike Dolan; Editing by Toby Chopra mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com.

We morn the innocent lives lost, and our thoughts remain with all those personally impacted. Turning to our results. Organic growth was 3.3% for the quarter, which is in line with our expectations. Operating income margin was 15.7%. And diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.86, up 5.1% versus the comparable period in 2022. Our results for the quarter keep us on pace to maintain our full year organic growth target of 3.5% to 5% and our operating margin target of 15% to 15.4%. Phil will cover our results in more detail during his remarks. Our cash flow continues to support our primary uses of cash, dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases, and our liquidity and our balance sheet remain very strong. During the quarter, we continued to make solid progress on our key strategic priorities to position Omnicom for sustainable and profitable long-term growth. Starting on the talent front, we made several key leadership changes as part of our succession planning. Alex Lubar was named Global CEO of DDB Worldwide. Alex served as the Global President and Chief Operating Officer of DDB and succeeds Marty O'Halloran, who will become Chairman. In addition, Glenn Lomas, currently CEO of DDB EMEA, has been elevated to Global President and Chief Operating Officer, in partnership with Alex. Nancy Reyes is moving from her post as CEO of TBWA New York to become CEO of the Americas at BBDO. Nancy succeeds St. John Walsh, who has been with BBDO for 27 years. Guy Marks, previously Omnicom Media Group's CEO of EMEA was named the CEO of PHD worldwide. Guy succeeds Philippa Brown, who is leaving the media industry after nearly 4 decades. Dan Clays, who led Omnicom's Media Group U.K. as CEO, will fill the CEO of OMG EMEA's position. I want to congratulate Alex, Glenn, Nancy, Guy and Dan and extend my gratitude to Marty, St. John and Philippa for their many years of service to Omnicom. This series of announcements is a testament to our emphasis on succession planning and ensuring our networks and practice areas have the right teams to lead them into the future. During the quarter, we continued building our generative AI capabilities with the rollout of Omni Assist, our proprietary version of ChatGPT that enhances every test within Omni. Omni Assist is just one example of how we are improving our capabilities and efficiency through generative AI. We continue assessing how generative AI will affect the way we work across the organization and preparing ourselves for the future. We've broadened our capabilities through strategic acquisitions in high-growth areas in the quarter. In July, Omnicom Media Group acquired Outpromo and Global Shopper, 2 of Brazil's leading connected commerce and retail media agencies. These acquisitions create a dedicated end-to-end e-commerce and retail media performance agency in the Brazilian market for Omnicom Media Group. OPRG strengthened its services through the acquisition of PLUS Communications, a top public affairs firm; and FP1 strategies, a leading political consultancy. The Beltway based acquisitions further solidified OPRG's leadership position and portfolio in public affairs and crisis communications, particularly into health care and technology. We recently announced the formation of Omnicom Advertising Services India, comprised of Omnicom's creative agencies located in India, BBDO, DDB and TBWA. Omnicom Advertising Services will be able to offer the best creative capabilities and talent for our clients across the group. The formation of Omnicom Advertising Services India follows the launch of our global delivery services and centers of excellence in India, which we announced earlier this year. Today, we have over 4,000 people in global centers of excellence in 4 major cities, supporting our clients and agencies around the world. We are rapidly scaling the operations and expect to triple the size over the next 24 to 36 months. Our centers of excellence are helping our company transform from within, improving our client offerings and providing operating efficiencies. While we position Omnicom for the long term, we're driving growth through significant new business wins. Some of these wins this quarter include: Omnicom Media Group won the global media business for Uber and HSBC; Beiersdorf selected OMD as its media agency of record for Europe and North America; on the creative front, adam&amp;eveDDB picked up Amazon's creative business in Europe; Omnicom Health Group and our advertising collective also continued to grow their relationship with Novartis, expanding in oncology and winning significantly in pharma, including their renal portfolio; finally, TBWA was awarded the creative duties for Telstra, Australia's largest mobile network. Overall, we are pleased with our financial results and our progress on our key strategic initiatives. While we remain optimistic entering the fourth quarter, as in past years, our performance in the fourth quarter will be impacted by the amount of year-end project spend that our clients execute and their agencies are successfully capturing. We continue to plan cautiously given the uncertainties in the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, including higher interest rates, oil prices, instability due to the wars in Ukraine and Israel, and the continuing risk of a recession in the United States. I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at our financial results. Phil?Philip J. AngelastroThanks, John. As John said, our business is solid, despite the challenges of the current macroeconomic environment. Before we open the call up for questions and answers, let's go through our third quarter results in more detail, starting with the summary income statement for the second quarter on Slide 3. Reported revenue increased by 3.9% and organic growth was 3.3%. Reported operating income increased by 2.7% to $560.8 million, and the related margin was 15.7%. Net interest expense was $38.3 million for the quarter, an increase of $9.2 million compared to the third quarter of 2022, due in part to lower interest income on cash and short-term investments. In Q4, we expect that, compared to the prior year, net interest expense will experience a similar increase. Our reported income tax rate was 26%. This is lower than our 27% estimate from July due to a reduction in tax expense resulting from the vesting of share-based compensation. For the fourth quarter, we estimate our tax rate will be 27%. Reported net income in Q3 increased by 2%, and diluted earnings per share was up 5.1% driven by both higher net income and by lower shares outstanding, resulting from share repurchases. Let's turn to revenue on Slide 4. As mentioned, organic growth in the third quarter was 3.3%. The impact from foreign currency translation reversed course in the third quarter, increasing reported revenue by 1.7%. If rates stay where they are currently, we estimate the impact of foreign currency translation will be a benefit of approximately 0.5% for Q4 and a reduction of approximately 0.5% for the year. The impact of acquisition and disposition revenue was negative 1.1%, primarily reflecting the sale in Q2 of our research businesses. We expect a reduction of 75 basis points for the fourth quarter and expect that the recent acquisitions will result in an increase in reported acquisition and disposition revenue next year. As John discussed, our organic growth outlook for the year remains unchanged at 3.5% with a stretch target of 5%, which still factors in some uncertainty about the level of year-end incremental marketing spend and project work that we expect our agencies will be successfully capturing in the fourth quarter. Now let's turn to Slide 5 to review our organic revenue growth by discipline. During the quarter, Advertising &amp; Media posted 6.1% growth, its strongest this year, driven by continued strength in our media business globally. Precision Marketing grew 4.3%, a solid performance given the comparison to the 16.2% growth it experienced in Q3 of '22 and the challenging backdrop of certain of their technology and telecom clients that we discussed last quarter. Commerce &amp; Brandon declined by 1.7% driven by reductions at our shopper marketing agencies. Experiential grew 9.2% led by Asia, Europe and the U.K., which offset negative growth in the U.S. and the Middle East. Execution &amp; Support declined 3.6% due primarily to declines in our merchandising business. Public Relations was down 5.5%, reflecting difficult comps against the 12.6% growth we delivered in Q3 of 2022. Approximately half of the reduction relates to less revenue connected to the 2022 election cycle, and the balance was due to the slowing of project spend in the quarter. We expect a similar headwind related to a reduction in revenue in Q4 compared to the benefit from the election cycle in Q4 of 2022. Finally, Healthcare grew 3.8% with good momentum at several large clients. Turning to Slide 6. We saw growth across our larger regions, offset by a decline in Canada as well as a decline in the Middle East and Africa, which grew by 12.2% in Q3 of 2022, caused in part by the cyclicality in Experiential. Looking at the year-to-date revenue by industry sector on Slide 7. Compared to the third quarter of last year, we had higher relative weights in 2 of our larger categories, food and beverage and automotive and, as expected, a lower relative weight in technology and a reduction, although smaller, in telecom. Now let's turn to Slide 8 where you can see good progress on our expenses year-over-year. Salary and related service costs were down as a percentage of revenue year-over-year driven by our repositioning actions and through changes in our global employee mix. Third-party service costs increased in connection with growth in our revenues. These costs include third-party supplier costs when we act as principal in providing services to our clients. They are an integral part of our service offering to our clients, and we generate profit on them. Third-party incidental costs increased due to an increase in client-related travel and incidental out-of-pocket costs that have bill declines directly at our cost at no profit. Occupancy and other costs were helped by reductions in our real estate portfolio in the first quarter of 2023. Reductions in rent expense were offset partially by an increase in operating expenses from higher levels of in-office work globally. SG&amp;A expenses were up a bit, primarily due to higher professional fees related to the acquisitions we recently completed. Turning to Slide 9. Operating income in Q3 was up 2.7% on a reported basis, and the related margin was 15.7%, down slightly as expected from 15.9% in the third quarter of 2022. For the full year, we remain comfortable with the expected operating margin range of between 15% and 15.4%. On a 9-month year-to-date non-GAAP adjusted basis, as presented here on Slide 9, operating income margin was 14.8% compared to 14.9% in 2022. Our EBITDA margin in Q3 was 16.2%, also down slightly from 16.4% in the third quarter of 2022. On a 9-month year-to-date non-GAAP adjusted basis, our EBITDA margin was 15.3% compared to 15.5% in 2022. Slide 10 is our cash flow performance for the first 9 months of the year. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, excluding changes in working capital. Free cash flow for the third quarter of 2023 was $1.3 billion, an increase of 9.4% from last year. We continue to expect changes in working capital to be close to flat for the year as it usually is. Regarding our uses of cash, we used $424 million of cash to pay dividends to common shareholders and another $47 million for dividends to noncontrolling interest shareholders. Our capital expenditures were $64 million, similar to last year. Total acquisition payments were $202 million. And our stock repurchase activity, net of proceeds from stock plans, was $530 million year-to-date. Most of this took place in the first half of the year. Slide 11 is a summary of our credit, liquidity and debt maturities. At the end of the third quarter of 2023, the book value of our outstanding debt was $5.6 billion. There were no changes in outstanding balances during the quarter other than foreign exchange translations. Our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, which backstops our $2 billion U.S. commercial paper program, remains undrawn. And our cash equivalents and short-term investments were $2.8 billion. Our next debt maturity is not until November of 2024. Slide 12 presents our historical returns on two important performance metrics for the 12 months ended September 30, 2023. Omnicom's return on invested capital was 23%, and return on equity was 47%. These metrics continue to be an excellent indicator of our conservative capital structure and the health of our business. In closing, despite a challenging macro environment, we're pleased with our financial results and our year-to-date organic growth of 4%. We believe we are positioned very well for strong growth in the future when the caution on the macro environment clears. Operator, please open the lines up for questions and answers. Thank you.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Benjamin Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.Benjamin Daniel SwinburneJohn, I guess I'll ask you the standard fourth quarter question around the macro and just trying to parse your words a little bit and understanding whether you're feeling that the caution that you guys referenced today has increased from earlier this year. Obviously, there's a lot of things happening in the world that would necessarily explain that. But I'm just wondering if you could add a little more color on how clients are feeling about Q4 and looking into next year. And then I'll just ask my follow-up, maybe for Phil, if Phil wants to take it. Is it fair to call the tech sector a clear and sort of different headwind to sort of the overall business for Omnicom? I noticed, I think year-to-date, that vertical was down 300 basis points year-to-year. It's been a big theme across the industry sort of the year of efficiency. I'm just wondering if you think that's a fair way to think about what we're seeing in the business in 2023.John D. WrenI do believe -- I can probably go back 21 years where, at this point in the year, I'm saying it's very similar, if not the same thing. A very large part of the project work that occurs, which adds to our growth or doesn't provide our growth, comes from project spend and clients doing things that they've hesitated to do or pushed back throughout the year. At this point, it's not a lot different than in past years in that we won't have clarity until probably Thanksgiving or thereabouts. And you're correct in what you said, there seems to be a lot more going on as we're entering this quarter, as we're going through it. We were already facing Hollywood strike; the auto strike, although that doesn't really impact us as much as it may others; and now what's going on in the Middle East, and Ukraine continues as well. So none of these are great signs. And it depends on what the headlines are in the newspapers every day, which dictate some of the spend that occurs or doesn't occur. So our people are very experienced at this. In those 20-plus years, we've only had 2 years where a significant part of the spend didn't actually come through. And both of those were around recessions in the 2008 and 2001 time frames. The rest of the times, it's eked out. Although some years, you feel a little bit more confident about it because there aren't all these macroeconomic and geopolitical issues occurring. So we're -- having said that, and you're certainly aware of it, as I look past the quarter and pass this project work to next year, with all the new business wins we've recently had and some of the signals that we're getting, I'm very confident -- I'll say, confident -- about our performance for '24 because I think we have the right products and we certainly have expanded who our clients are. So some of those wins that I announced, we will not enjoy really any revenue in the fourth quarter. That revenue principally start January 1, but it's a good tailwind to have.Philip J. AngelastroYes. I'd certainly echo John's comments as far as the Q4 outlook and the very typical process we go through to capture as much of that project spend as we can in the fourth quarter, agency by agency, all across the world. Regarding your tech question, Ben, I think from our perspective, given relative comps, we don't really see the tech headwinds as significantly different than the broader macro at this point in time, now that we're through 9 months of 2023. Maybe they close out the year not as strong as they did last year as far as spending, but at some point in the near future, we don't see this as a permanent decline. We think they're going to come back and invest in their brands and begin to spend at a higher level at some point in the near future.John D. WrenYes. The only point I would add to Phil's comments were is most of that decline is a decline with existing clients. So it's not because of client loss. So as their products get released into the marketplace and they get through whatever problems they've adjusted to during 2023, we're still very confident about this sector.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo.Steven Lee CahallSo John, when you think about the trends this year, it seems like tech and telco had been a headwind and maybe the overall macro and geopolitical environment that you talked about have cast some additional uncertainty, more recently. And then I think you have new business and maybe M&amp;A as tailwinds. So heading into next year where a lot of your clients are probably in their budget cycles now, do you feel like it's setting up for a more challenging industry backdrop? Or do you think that those tailwinds you have or the AI investments that you've been making can lead you to have some acceleration as you move into next year? That's the first one. And then second, maybe for John or for Phil, I think you last raised the dividend in February 2021. Your dividend then was pretty competitive versus the rate environment. Obviously, the rate environment has changed a lot since then. So when you think about recommendations to the Board about capital allocation, how are you thinking about what the right level of the dividend should be and whether this is an environment that you feel comfortable growing it?John D. WrenTo answer your first question, we're not quite ready to give you guidance for '24 just yet because our people are out doing a bottoms-up plan, which they won't present to us for another 6 or 7 weeks, and then that gets tweaked throughout the balance of the year. But with the experiences that we've had, with the new business wins that we've enjoyed and the places where we faced headwinds this year, we're set up very well to have a very successful 2024. And that's what I anticipate to see when we actually get that bottoms-up review back from our companies. So I'm confident and I don't see any significant adjustments that we have to make to our portfolio, which, in and of itself, is very flexible, to service those client needs and enjoy the growth that's associated with it. Do you want to take the second question? Or I can do the dividend, too.Philip J. AngelastroYes, go ahead.John D. WrenThe dividend is really a Board matter, and it will come up in the Board meetings that come between now and, say, February. We'll have more to say as those meetings occur.Philip J. AngelastroYes. I wouldn't take it, the fact that we haven't raised the dividend in 2023, as a lack of confidence in the business at all. Given the broader macro, I think we've always approached it, and the Board has always approached it, with a level of conservatism and really continuing to keep the flexibility we have in the capital structure right now given the broader macro. But it's certainly something that's on the agenda, and I would not view it as a function of a lack of confidence in the business at all.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Tim Nollen with Macquarie.Timothy Wilson NollenI'd like to pick up on one actual word that you used in your last comment, John, and that is flexibility. I saw this WFA survey recently talking about clients, I guess, coming up with more reasons why they want their agencies to do more. And I'm sure this is an age-old discussion that you have. But you've done a lot of work to reposition the business, reinvesting in data and technology and things over the years, divested assets. You just ran in your prepared remarks through a number of management changes internally that you've done recently. We saw today WPP just merged a couple of its big agencies. I just wondered, John, if you could maybe expound a little bit on what this WFA report means and how Omnicom feels positioned given that commentary.John D. WrenSure. I have to admit to not reading the report that you're referring to. But in terms of our portfolio, yes, there's been a significant expansion in our media business, and that is growing. There's been quite a bit of success in that. If you look at the conversions -- I probably said that wrong, report. When you take media wins versus media losses, we continue to come out on top, and I'm confident that, that is going to hold. There's a few opportunities, which we expect to be asked to participate in reviewing which are offensive opportunities where we're not defending existing business other than in some statutory audit reviews. And our CRM business, which grew very strongly and hit a couple of road bumps in the beginning of this year, has come out of it very strong and just won a few very large and significant clients that are going to help us next year. It becomes an increasing part of our portfolio as well. Our PR unit, even though it's suffering a little bit because of the comparables of not being in an election year, next year is an election year, so that same group will be benefited as a result of that. So the portfolio has been tweaked. We've gotten rid of, in a very sensible way, assets in the past. And I think going forward, I don't know if Phil commented on it or not, I think where we were showing net divestitures for probably the last 3 years, we're now with the acquisition activity we had adding to the portfolio. From a net perspective, we're growing those areas, and we're buying into those areas to support our companies where we see the greatest growth.Timothy Wilson NollenYes. Great. No, I think that answers it. The survey was basically talking about advertising clients looking for more flexibility and streamlined services from the agencies. It sounds very much like that's what you've been doing. And even your comments today about some of the changes you've made seem to support that.John D. WrenThe only thing I would add to that is I get more people back into the offices, which we continue to have success with, but there's still work to do. I think that will further support our growth.Timothy Wilson NollenCollaboration is easier in person.John D. WrenYes, sir.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of David Karnovsky from JPMorgan.David KarnovskyJohn, we saw the uptick in precision marketing in the quarter. I wanted to see if you could provide more color there. Is that just comps? Or are you starting to see some movement on projects that maybe were paused previously? And then for Phil, on principal costs, it looks like -- or sorry, third-party service costs, it looks like growth accelerated there a touch in the quarter. Can you parse that out between maybe principal trading and other areas like events? And then just with principal trading generally, I don't know how much you're willing to quantify in terms of organic revenue contribution, but maybe you could discuss the business at a high level what the reception is from clients to the offer.John D. WrenSure. Handling your first question, some of the declines and challenges in the telecommunication and tech sector were probably more impactful to that practice area, in the precision marketing practice area. And as Phil mentioned earlier, we think that -- the good news is we didn't lose clients, we continue to win clients in that area. And we think those companies have gone through their adjustments the latter part of last year and the early part of this year. So we're ascending. This quarter was better than the last, which was probably the toughest comparison we had. And with some of the new business wins that they've had very recently, 2024 sets up to be a very good year. I can't really comment on how many projects we're going to get in CRM in the next 90 days. But in terms of the business itself, its leadership and the products that we're offering to our clients, I'm very confident in our performance in that area.Philip J. AngelastroSure. Regarding the second question and third-party service costs, we don't really parse the number in the way that you've suggested. But we had strong growth, as we said in our prepared remarks, in the media business, no question, as well as experiential. Both of those businesses do come with those third-party service costs as part of the business. Certainly, a reference back to Tim's question regarding clients and the flexibility that they're looking for, they're certainly looking for a full suite of products from a media perspective and a wide range of marketing services that they'll avail themselves of. And our service offering can cover all of those things that they're looking for. So some of that growth certainly is in media, experiential, field marketing as well, but we had strong growth through most of our disciplines in the quarter, and we're certainly happy with those results.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson.Michael Brian NathansonI have two for you, John. One is, as you've referenced before, you've had a very strong year in the media business. You've taken a lot of big wins. Can you talk a bit about what's changed for the positioning of that business? What do you think are the factors driving some of these big wins that you've had versus your competitors? And secondly, I have you asked in the past about acquisition opportunities. Given now maybe the fall in kind of the pressures in venture capital land and the higher rates, talk a bit about the pipeline opportunity you see to kind of buy more companies in '24 and then kind of your willingness to do that in '24.John D. WrenSure. I think the success of the media operation is down, one, to management of that specific operation. We've expanded the suite of services that we make available to clients in the media area. It is, of all of our services, probably one of the most measurable in terms of when we utilize the data and the amount of data that we have, we're able to optimize for the benefit of the client how they spend their money, improve it. So there's a great deal of analytics that are there today that weren't even possible 4 or 5 years ago. And I think -- well, I do know this to be true. We have a reputation of delivering on what we promised when we're pitching for business. And I dare say we have the best reputation in the industry of delivering what we promise. And that has benefited us through this process.Philip J. AngelastroDo you want to comment first on M&amp;A? And then I'll add.John D. WrenSure. Yes, we've always had -- the M&amp;A pipeline remains very strong for us. We have a team that's constantly looking at opportunities. They have to meet all of our internal criteria. It would have to typically be something that's additive to the portfolio of services that we offer our clients. If it's something that we can build and is expensive, we've steered away from it in the past, and we've been pretty consistent about that in the last -- at least the 26 years that I've been the CEO. But there are opportunities, and some of them are in areas that we've had on our list for a very long period of time that looked more reasonable than they did when the interest rate was 0.Philip J. AngelastroYes. I think that what we've seen certainly is that sellers' expectations have kind of adjusted to the marketplace and to the macro environment that we're dealing with. So strategically, there are some opportunities out there that we've been looking at, some of which we completed in the third quarter, that have been more attractive than they certainly were not that long ago.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.Craig Anthony HuberI've got a few questions. I'll maybe just go one at a time to make it easier. Can you just talk a little bit further about the tone of conversations with your clients as they say what their thoughts are on a preliminary basis for 2024, at this stage, maybe versus what the conversations were like roughly 6 months ago?John D. WrenI think, well, there's still a lot of uncertainty in the marketplace because of all the things we talked about and in previous answers in our prepared remarks. Having said that, clients are pretty sophisticated, and they know that, no matter what the difficulties are, they have to continue to support their brands because if they don't, when the good times return, they'll have a much more difficult time regaining or maintaining their market share. So as we look at clients in '24 -- '23 was a tough year for many sectors. That's why we referenced a couple of times earlier the tech sector. I would say, in my opinion, '23 was the first time in the tech sector had to face readjusting its business. And people, earlier in the year, went through massive layoffs and cutbacks of their own staffing, which they hadn't had any experience in their history of even needing to do. It was pure growth prior to this year. That's behind them now. They're a lot more experienced than they once were as we look forward. So clients aren't -- they know we're not through all the hurdles that exist out there, but they're confident that their brands and their positioning from their companies, they've taken a lot of pain and they're positioned well to go into the future.Philip J. AngelastroCertainly, a lot's -- it's been an odd year. Certainly, a lot has changed, especially if you compare things to the last 6 months. But as we were going into '23, about a year ago, most of the conversations were about was there a recession coming, was it likely. And I think 12 months ago, it was more likely to happen in the first half, then it changed to more likely to happen in the second half. It's kind of been happening in slow motion. So the recent events in the Middle East certainly have changed things versus 6 months ago. But yes, I would echo John's comments in terms of our view on '24 and client sentiment, they know they need to continue to invest in their brands. And I think that's been proven certainly throughout the cohort period.John D. WrenAnd you can't forget that, if you go back a year, interest rates were quite different for everyone. And sure, there's been a lot of sudden changes as the Fed has increased rates, and it takes people a bit of time to adjust what they're doing to those changing environments. But I think at this point, everyone thinks -- they don't know when it's going to reverse itself, but they're adjusting to the current environment, and they don't think they're facing the same headwind in areas like that going forward. So again, it just adds to the confidence.Craig Anthony HuberMy second question, if I could, on a pricing, apples-to-apples pricing, for your clients, just in aggregate for your company for this year. How do you sort of think about it, your 3.5% to 5% organic growth target for the year, with 5% being a stretch target? How much should we think about that pricing in terms of maybe basis points as adding to that? Is it roughly 100 basis points from pricing on apples-to-apples basis, not just upselling but pricing on apples-to-apples basis, that you're increasing prices in your contracts and stuff? And where that number is roughly for this year, at a 3.5% to 5% target for this year, how does that compare to prior years? I'm trying to get at this because it's obviously a higher inflation environment.John D. WrenSure. I don't think we've recovered completely the inflation that we faced. When you look at this, from Western Europe, U.S. and then emerging markets, inflation has been more severe. We haven't had some pricing flexibility but not to the extent of how fast inflation has risen. Now we're hoping that inflation has stabilized, and we'll start to enjoy the benefits of that. The other thing which impacts our business is actually an account the day you win it, the next 90 days is probably the least profitable time that you'll have that account because you're ramping up staff and you're changing organizations in order to accommodate and not drop any balls as the business has passed from one of our competitors to us. So that has some kind -- that has an impact not on unit pricing but on the overall costs that we face as we adjust and staff up for these events. More precise than that, I can't really be. I don't have any hard data which supports specific areas in the company. One of the reasons, though, that we've been able to expand our base in offshore and nearshore markets for more of the functions that we have to fulfill in order to complete our job, we've gotten better at that. We've grown the staff from -- we've doubled it in this past year. And I think in my comments we've said that we expect that to grow 2 to 3x over the next 24 months because we have the infrastructure now to accommodate that growth. That gives us a bit of relief on the inflation that we haven't been able to pass on to our clients, so by doing things differently.Craig Anthony HuberAnd my final question, if I could, just because everybody has questions on this project-related work in the fourth quarter. Historically, maybe the range is $200 million to $250 million in the fourth quarter. I'm curious, embedded in your 3.5% to 5% organic growth number for the year target, what are you guys assuming for project-related work in the fourth quarter versus the year-ago number? Is that roughly flat, on the bottom end of your 3.5% to 5% number? How should we think about that?Philip J. AngelastroWe don't really have a number, Craig. I think certainly, every one of our businesses has some expectations regarding project work in the fourth quarter. The key for us is, when we meet with them, ensuring they're not keeping staff on hand hoping to get new business as we head into the fourth quarter and then the cost structure is out of whack with their expected revenues. They need to have some historical analysis, and we've got plenty of that in order for our agencies to have certain amounts of project spend in their forecast. But typically, they're incentivized to benefit from capturing that year-end project spend. And our clients, by and large, want to spend the rest of their budget and grow their businesses through the end of the year. So those factors typically help us and help our clients to get to the point where we can capture a significant amount of that spend. But we don't have a hard and fast number. Blank percent of the $200 million to $250 million is in the forecast, but certainly, some of it in the forecast. But we're pretty conservative about how much our agencies can put in their forecasts because the last thing we want is people to be hiring ahead of the revenue or keeping people around that don't necessarily have anything to do if the revenue doesn't come through. That's a pretty consistent practice we followed for quite some time.OperatorAnd with that, that does conclude our conference for today.

The impact of these issues on our business will vary by geographic market and discipline. We closely monitor economic conditions, client revenue levels and other factors. In response to reductions in revenue, we can take actions to align our cost structure with changes in client demand and manage our working capital. However, there can be no assurance as to the effectiveness of our efforts to mitigate any impact of the current and future adverse economic conditions, reductions in client revenue, changes in client creditworthiness, and other developments.Definitions - Components of Revenue ChangeWe use certain terms in describing the components of the change in revenue above.Foreign exchange rate impact: calculated by translating the current period's local currency revenue using the prior period average exchange rates to derive current period constant currency revenue. The foreign exchange rate impact is the difference between the current period revenue in U.S. Dollars and the current period constant currency revenue.Acquisition revenue, net of disposition revenue: Acquisition revenue is calculated as if the acquisition occurred twelve months prior to the acquisition date by aggregating the comparable prior period revenue of acquisitions through the acquisition date. As a result, acquisition revenue excludes the positive or negative difference between our current period revenue subsequent to the acquisition date and the comparable prior period revenue and the positive or negative growth after the acquisition date is attributed to organic growth. Disposition revenue is calculated as if the disposition occurred twelve months prior to the disposition date by aggregating the comparable prior period revenue of disposals through the disposition date. The acquisition revenue and disposition revenue amounts are netted in the description above.Organic growth: calculated by subtracting the foreign exchange rate impact component and the acquisition revenue, net of disposition revenue component from total revenue growth.Conference CallOmnicom will host a conference call to review its financial results on Tuesday, October 17, 2023 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

We use EBITA and EBITA margin as additional operating performance measures, which exclude the non-cash amortization expense of intangible assets (primarily consisting of amortization arising from acquisitions). We also use Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income Margin, Adjusted EBITA, Adjusted EBITA Margin, Adjusted Income Tax Expense, Adjusted Net Income – Omnicom Group Inc. and Adjusted Net Income per diluted share – Omnicom Group Inc. as additional operating performance measures. We believe these measures are useful in evaluating the impact of certain items on operating performance and allow for comparability between reporting periods.

Non-GAAP financial measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies.Forward-Looking StatementsCertain statements in this press release constitute forward-looking statements, including statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

77,59d27f6e-d7ab-3028-b4ad-78d41d229608,CRM,2023-10-18,20 States that Drink the Least Alcohol per Capita,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-states-drink-least-alcohol-090951270.html,1697620108,STORY,"['NVO', 'CRM']","[In this article, we are going to discuss the 20 states that drink the least alcohol per capita. You can skip our detailed analysis of the economic cost of excessive drinking, a new pharmaceutical breakthrough that could help reduce alcohol abuse, and a company promoting sobriety as part of its workplace culture, and go directly to 5 States that Drink the Least Alcohol per Capita. There is a substantial amount of evidence that suggests that any alcohol consumption, however moderate, can have negative health consequences. Even low levels of drinking can increase the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, and even certain types of cancer. Understanding that there is no such thing as risk-free drinking, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines moderate drinking as 2 drinks or less per day for men, and no more than one drink per day for women. Still, despite the well-publicized health risks, more than two-thirds of adult drinkers regularly exceed those levels. The Economic Cost of Excessive Drinking: The top 10% of American drinkers, which equates to around 24 million people, consume an average of 74 alcoholic drinks each week. If you break that number out, that means they consume a little more than 10 drinks each day.As we mentioned in our article – 30 Drunkest Cities in America in 2023 – excessive use of alcohol costs the U.S. economy almost $250 billion per year. The federal government picks up roughly $100 billion of the tab, largely through Medicare and Medicaid payments. Several evidence-based strategies can help reduce excessive drinking, including increasing alcohol excise taxes, limiting alcohol outlet density, and commercial host liability. Pharmaceutical Breakthrough: Ozempic and Wegovy are two drugs developed by Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) that have recently become uber-popular in the U.S. The drugs are once-weekly injectables of a medication called semaglutide, prescribed for Type 2 diabetes and weight loss. However, doctors and patients have begun to notice a striking side effect of these drugs – they appear to reduce people's cravings for alcohol, nicotine, and opioids. Story continuesAs it turns out, these drugs don't just work on blood sugar, but also on the brain. The mechanism in the brain that regulates overeating overlaps with those responsible for the development and maintenance of addiction, including alcohol disorder, according to Dr. Lorenzo Leggio, clinical director of the National Institute of Drug Abuse.In the past year, prescriptions for both Ozempic and Wegovy have skyrocketed, despite the fact that each costs about $1,000 a month and some health insurers recently stopped covering them. Their increasing popularity has boosted Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) to new heights, and the Danish pharmaceutical giant is now the Most Valuable Company in Europe by market cap, with currently $452.24 billion of it. Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) is also part of the Jim Simons Stock Portfolio. Sober Workplace Culture: According to the Institute for Work &amp; Health, employees at companies that most discouraged social drinking were 45% less likely to be heavy drinkers than those in workplaces with the most liberal attitudes to drinking, after taking into account other factors that influence drinking levels. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a company that famously banned alcohol from in-office events back in 2016. Soberforce is an employee-led resource group within the cloud-based software company that was started with the goal to provide a community and connection for sober employees, support people with addiction issues, and destigmatize addiction. Soberforce holds regular virtual meetings and leads conversation threads on Slack, which is made available to all of 75,000 global employees of Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). Shares of CRM were held by 122 hedge funds in the Insider Monkey database at the end of Q2 2023. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) sits among Jim Cramer’s 10 Best AI Stocks. With that said, here are the Most Sober States in America. 20 States that Drink the Least Alcohol per Capitaracorn/Shutterstock.comMethodology: To collect data for this article,, we have referred to the 2023 Surveillance Report by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, looking for the States that Drink the Least Alcohol. Findings in this report are based on alcoholic beverage sales data collected by the Alcohol Epidemiologic Data System (AEDS) from the states or from the National Alcohol Beverage Control Association. The following states have been ranked by their per capita ethanol consumption in gallons, based on population ages 14 and older. The data collected in this report is for the year 2021.If you also wish to read about the top drinking states, here are the States that Consume the Most Alcohol per Capita. 20. South DakotaEthanol Consumption per Capita: 2.33 gallonsSouth Dakota has taken a number of initiatives to control excessive drinking. The state’s innovative 24/7 Sobriety Program requires those arrested for or convicted of alcohol-involved offenses to take twice-a-day breathalyzer tests or wear a continuous alcohol monitoring bracelet. 19. New MexicoEthanol Consumption per Capita: 2.33 gallonsThe New Mexico Department of Health launched its CSTE alcohol surveillance system in 2017, which brings together information (alcohol consumption behaviors and associated morbidity, mortality, and policy-related measures) necessary to show a clear picture of the alcohol effects in the state. This information yields usable, timely data from which the state officials can monitor trends and develop interventions to reduce the prevalence of alcohol-attributable morbidity and mortality.18. IndianaEthanol Consumption per Capita: 2.32 gallonsWhile Indiana ranks among the Least Drinking States in the U.S., the detrimental outcomes of alcohol abuse are still prevalent and continuously rising within The Hoosier State. Indiana also faced a high prevalence of frequent mental distress in 2021, which may account for the increase in alcoholism within the state. The Indiana Coalition to Reduce Underage Drinking (ICRUD) works to reduce youth access to alcohol through awareness, advocacy, and policy change.17. ArizonaEthanol Consumption per Capita: 2.32 gallonsEarlier this year, Governor Katie Hobbs proclaimed the month of April to be Arizona Alcohol Awareness Month, to raise awareness of the most commonly used addictive substance in the United States, and to call upon all citizens, parents, governmental agencies, public and private institutions, businesses, hospitals, schools, and colleges in the Grand Canyon State to support efforts that will provide early education about alcoholism and addiction that will increase support for individuals and families coping with alcoholism. 16. WashingtonEthanol Consumption per Capita: 2.27 gallonsWashington has the highest alcohol tax rate on distilled spirits in America, at $36.55 per gallon. Such a high levy helps keep excessive drinking in control and brings in revenue for various public services and initiatives. However, critics argue that such high taxes may lead to increased cross-border shopping and the resultant negative effects on local businesses.15. Virginia Ethanol Consumption per Capita: 2.26 gallonsAs one of America’s 17 control states, where the state government manages the sale and distribution of distilled spirits, Virginia sells distilled spirits exclusively in ABC stores operated by the Commonwealth of Virginia. This limits alcohol outlet density, which has been proven to keep excessive drinking in control. 14. New YorkEthanol Consumption per Capita: 2.26 gallonsThe New York State Alcohol Surveillance and Epidemiology Program (ASEP) was established in September 2021 through a cooperative agreement with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct public health surveillance on excessive alcohol use and its related harms in the Empire State.13. KentuckyEthanol Consumption per Capita: 2.24 gallonsAlthough Kentucky is home to the country’s burgeoning Bourbon industry, the Bluegrass State has the 17th lowest share of adults who report excessive drinking at 17.3%, compared to 19% nationwide. 12. MarylandEthanol Consumption per Capita: 2.21 gallonsMaryland’s 2011 tax on the price of an alcoholic drink was the state’s first increase in alcohol taxes in decades. After the sales tax took effect, statewide alcohol sales decreased by 3.8% compared to what trends predicted. Moreover, the Old Line State raised about $70 million in additional tax revenue that year, which helped fund education programs and services for people with disabilities.11. KansasEthanol Consumption per Capita: 2.18 gallonsKansas has some of the strictest alcohol restrictions in the country. The state prohibited all alcohol from 1881 to 1948, and continued to prohibit on-premises sales of alcohol from 1949 to 1987. Even today, 29 counties in the Sunflower State do not permit the on-premises sale of booze. Aside from that, motorists who transport open containers of alcohol can also face severe penalties in the state, even if they’re not drinking.10. South CarolinaEthanol Consumption per Capita: 2.14 gallonsSouth Carolina also follows the pattern of low alcohol consumption exhibited by the Deep South states. A major reason for this could be that these states have large evangelical Christian populations, many of whom abstain from alcohol.South Carolina ranks among the Top 10 States with the Lowest Alcohol Consumption per Capita. 9. OhioEthanol Consumption per Capita: 2.13 gallonsThe average Ohioan drank 689 alcoholic drinks in 2021, an 11% decrease from 776 the previous year, according to a survey by DrugAbuse.com. A possible reason for this welcomed drop in drinking could be a change in routines for individuals, as restrictions eased in the pandemic’s second year and more people returned to out-of-home jobs.8. NebraskaEthanol Consumption per Capita: 2.13 gallonsAs more and more people turn towards a healthier lifestyle, sober bars and an alcohol-free lifestyle have grown in popularity in recent years across the United States, including Nebraska. Dry Spokes, a leader in the non-alcoholic bar movement in Nebraska, recently established its presence in downtown Omaha.7. AlabamaEthanol Consumption per Capita: 2.06 gallonsAlabama is one of the many states with strict laws related to virtually all aspects of alcohol. That includes manufacturing, distributing, selling, and even consuming. In Alabama, just 16% of adults reported excessive drinking, which is less than the national average of 19%.6. IdahoEthanol Consumption per Capita: 2 gallonsAlthough Idaho ranks among the Least Alcoholic States, Idahoans set a new record for the highest spending on liquor in the last financial year, which ended on June 30th 2023. The state’s residents spend just under $320 million on liquor during the year, with Tito’s vodka dominating the market in the Gem State. Click to continue reading and see the 5 States that Drink the Least Alcohol per Capita.Suggested Articles:20 Most Consumed Alcohols in the World20 Countries that Drink the Least Beer per Capita10 Best Cocktails for People Who Don’t Like Taste of AlcoholDisclosure: None. 20 States that Drink the Least Alcohol per Capita is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

This move is part of a larger trend for the insider, who over the past year has sold a total of 227,537 shares and purchased none.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with CRM.Salesforce Inc is a leading company in the field of cloud-based software services. It provides a comprehensive suite of enterprise applications focused on customer service, marketing automation, analytics, and application development. With a market cap of $204.17 billion, Salesforce Inc is a significant player in the technology sector.The insider's recent sell has raised questions about the relationship between insider trading and the stock price. Over the past year, there have been 263 insider sells and no insider buys for Salesforce Inc. This trend is illustrated in the following image:Insider Sell: Salesforce Inc's President and Chief Engineering Officer Srinivas Tallapragada Sells 10,000 SharesDespite the insider's sell, Salesforce Inc's stock was trading at $205.72 per share on the day of the transaction, giving the company a market cap of $204.17 billion. The price-earnings ratio stands at 131.97, higher than the industry median of 26.19 but lower than the companys historical median price-earnings ratio.According to the GuruFocus Value, which is an intrinsic value estimate based on historical multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates, Salesforce Inc's stock is modestly undervalued. With a price of $205.72 and a GuruFocus Value of $266.20, the stock has a price-to-GF-Value ratio of 0.77. This valuation is depicted in the following image:Insider Sell: Salesforce Inc's President and Chief Engineering Officer Srinivas Tallapragada Sells 10,000 SharesThe insider's sell, coupled with the company's valuation, suggests that the stock may be undervalued. However, investors should always conduct their own research and consider other factors before making investment decisions.It's also worth noting that the insider's sell does not necessarily indicate a negative outlook for the company.

80,2f857d27-736c-35e3-a0e4-a41025978576,CRM,2023-10-18,Jim Cramer’s 10 Best AI Stocks,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-10-best-ai-155132343.html,1697557892,STORY,"['AMD', 'ORCL', 'MSFT', 'AVGO', 'NVDA', 'CRM', 'ADBE', 'GOOGL']","[In this article, we will take a look at Jim Cramer's 10 best AI stocks. To see more such companies, go directly to Jim Cramer's 5 Best AI Stocks.Jim Cramer made some important comments earlier this year when he talked about the importance of investing in individual stocks. There has been a rise popularity of investing in index funds over the past few years. Beginner investors often get advised that investing in individual names is too risky and they are far better off investing in broader market funds. Cramer said in his program that while he recommends investing in index funds, he also urges investors to invest in individual stocks if they really want to make money in the stock market. But Cramer said investing in individual stocks requires care and deep study. In the same program Jim Cramer talked about the importance of investing in AI stocks and named some big companies working on AI products, including Meta Platforms.AI's GoPro Moment?Jim Cramer is also deeply aware of the hype around AI and how companies are excessively using the AI buzzword to boost their stock prices and rally investors. About a month ago, Jim Cramer on his program wondered whether AI was about to have its “GoPro moment,” drawing a comparison between the hype GoPro enjoyed during its early days and the AI boom of today. Cramer said that there was a time when GoPro stock touched high $90s before tumbling and plunging to new lows and today the stock is trading in single digits ($2.82 as of October 16, to be exact). Cramer said that “I have to find out” when companies would stop rolling out AI stories to boost their stock prices.Our MethodologyFor this article we went through several programs of Jim Cramer and picked AI stocks he’s bullish on. With each stock we have linked to the video in which Cramer talked about the company in question. Some top names Cramer likes include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).Story continuesJim Cramer's Best AI StocksJim Cramer's 10 Best AI Stocks10. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72Jim Cramer in a program earlier this year said Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) has got the “mojo” when it comes to AI. Cramer specifically likes Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)’s partnership with Google to provide AI chips. However, a report from The Information in September, citing sources familiar with the matter, said Google wants to cut its reliance on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) for AI-accelerating TPU chips as early as 2027.Jim Cramer also said that Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is “not an expensive stock.” He also referred to price target upgrades and bullish ratings on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) from BMO, JPMorgan and Evercore.ClearBridge Multi Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“While the ClearBridge Multi Cap Growth Strategy has limited mega cap exposure, which has been a recent headwind to relative performance, we own several companies that stand to benefit from the explosive growth in generative AI. These holdings play key roles in building out the necessary infrastructure and helping customers leverage capabilities enabled by this emerging technology.Semiconductor and software solutions provider Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), for example, is an important supplier of networking chips that power ethernet switches and routers for connectivity between AI servers. The company sees quarterly revenue from this part of their business exceeding $1 billion in their fiscal third quarter, on a trajectory toward doubling over the course of the year.”9. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 84In the “Lightning Round” on his program on CNBC, Jim Cramer, a couple of months ago, answering a question about Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), recommended investors to buy more ORCL stock. Cramer pointed to Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)’s quarterly earnings earlier this year and the stock’s relative underperformance after that. Cramer at the time said that “right here” is when you should buy Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL). Cramer said by right here he meant $113, $112, $110. As of October 16 Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is trading at $108. Cramer also believes Oracle is the “star of the show” in AI.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 84 hedge funds out of the 910 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) during this period was Jean-Marie Eveillard’s First Eagle Investment Management which owns a $2.2 billion stake in the company.Like ORCL, Cramer also loves Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)’s CTO Larry Ellison in an earnings call earlier this year talked about AI opportunities for Oracle and said:“Well, you can’t build any of these AI models without enormous amounts of training data. So if anything, what AI — generative AI has shown that the big issue about training one of these models is just getting that — this vast amount of data ingested into your GPU supercluster. It is a huge data problem in the sense you need so much data. To train — OpenAI to train ChatGPT 3.5, they read the entire public Internet, they read all of Wikipedia, they read everything, they ingested everything. And to specialize, and you take something like ChatGPT 4.0 and you want to specialize it, you need specialized training data from electronic health records to help doctors diagnose and treat cancer, let’s say, and we are partners.Imaging for example, that is ingesting huge amounts of image data to train their AI models. We have our own — another partner of ours in AI, ingesting huge amounts of electronic health records to train their models. AI doesn’t work without getting access to and ingesting enormous amounts of data. So in terms of a shift away from data or a change in gravities at AI, AI is utterly dependent upon vast amounts of training data. Trillions of elements went into building ChatGPT 3.5, multiple times that for ChatGPT 4.0 because you have to deal with all the image data and ingest all of that to train image recognition. So we think this is very good for our database business, and Oracle’s new Vector database will contain highly-specialized training data like electronic health records, while keeping that data anonymized and private, yet still training the specialized models that can help doctors improve their diagnostic capability and their treatment prescriptions for cancer and heart disease and all sorts of other diseases.""Read the full earnings call transcript here.Oakmark Global Fund made the following comment about Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) (U.S.), a global software company, was the Fund’s top contributor for the fiscal year, with its share price rising primarily after reporting its fiscal fourth-quarter results. More recently, Oracle announced fiscal first-quarter results, which were in line with consensus expectations. The drivers of the core business are performing well, in our view, and management expressed confidence that annual revenue growth will accelerate as planned based on demand trajectory and its strong bookings trends. For the quarter, total revenue increased 8% in constant currency (9% reported), and operating income grew 12% with margins showing improvement. Cloud and support revenue grew 11% in constant currency, powered by Fusion +20% and Netsuite +21%. The “strategic back office cloud” is now up to $6.9 billion in run-rate revenue. Infrastructure cloud and support revenue grew 14% in constant currency, powered by infrastructure cloud services +72% ex-legacy hosting services to $5.6 billion in run-rate revenue. Momentum is continuing to build as Oracle signed several deals for its cloud business greater than $1 billion in total value during the quarter and booked an additional $1.5 billion in the first week of the second quarter. We continue to believe Oracle is an attractive holding and undervalued due to our perception of its intrinsic value.”8. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 109Jim Cramer said in a program that Adobe is using the best use of AI and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is more responsive than any other company when it comes to AI.Analysts are praising Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)’s AI features across the board. Baird recently said it is “incrementally positive” on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)’s artificial intelligence strategy and leadership position.“We expect the product roadmap to continually evolve over time with additional GenAI announcements, Baird’s Rob Oliver and Patrick Schulz, who have a $540 price target on Adobe, said.7. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112Earlier this year Jim Cramer said that he’s been recommending Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) since the stock was trading at $5. Cramer praised Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)’s latest AI chips announcements and said that it was bad news for China since Chinese semiconductor companies seem to be struggling to keep up with innovation and American companies won’t be allowed to export AI chips to China.In May 2023, Cramer also talked about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)’s partnership with Microsoft for AI chips and said the deal could have major implications.In May, Bloomberg reported that Microsoft was joining hands with Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) to help the semiconductor firm expand into AI, where Nvidia currently dominates.Artisan Global Opportunities Fund made the following comment about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Among our top contributors were Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), NU Holdings and Netflix. AMD’s data center CPUs are used in the cloud service provider (CSP) servers. In addition to the broader secular tailwind from cloud adoption, the company has a performance and pricing advantage over Intel, which we believe will enable it to continue capturing market share. However, the recent stock price rally was due to growing excitement around the company’s AI exposure. It will launch its new MI300 graphics processing unit (GPU) chip later this year to compete against the dominant market leader NVIDIA. Similar to its approach that won market share from Intel within the CPU market, AMD’s product will aim to provide similar performance at a more attractive price. AMD is already working with Microsoft and Meta, while Amazon publicly stated that it is evaluating AMD’s inferencing chips. Using assumptions around the total GPU market size, potential market share gains and price points, our research indicates this could be a $20 billion opportunity for AMD. That would nearly double its revenue. While the company has not historically missed many deadlines, there is execution risk as it works to manufacture and distribute these complex chips at scale, which, combined with an elevated valuation after the stock’s strong performance run, led us to trim the position.”6. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 122Jim Cramer in September interviewed Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)’s CEO Marc Benioff at Salesforce’s Dreamforce, where the company revealed several AI offerings. Benioff highlighted the role of Slack, which Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) acquired for about $27.7 billion, when it comes to AI.“The big news is Slack is really starting to wake up with its own AI. It holds so much data for our customers. I think Slack is going to be the promise of AI for a lot of our most important customers. If you go talk to any of these great, new AI companies they are all Slack-first companies; they all built their product with Slack.”Cramer is bullish on Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). His charitable trust has a position in Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). Cramer recently said during his program that Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) will have a “dynamite” 2024.Harding Loevner Global Equity Strategy made the following comment about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), a company we’ve owned since 2019, recently added ChatGPT-like capabilities onto its existing Al module, Einstein, to support its internal sales efforts and customer-facing software. For example, Einstein GPT can help generate marketing emails tailored to specific clients by using Salesforce’s customer database and past email correspondence to learn the most effective approach for each client. Einstein GPT is also different from off-the-shelf LLMS in three important ways: It keeps personal identifiable information private and secure, compared with external tools that retain anything a user enters. It employs the latest data in Salesforce’s system, as opposed to the sometimes-stale public data that train generic models. And generative Al capabilities can be integrated with other Salesforce offerings; the company has already introduced Slack GPT and Tableau GPT, Al-equipped versions of its workplace collaboration and analytics tools.”Some other stocks Cramer likes because of their AI potential include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Click to continue reading and see Jim Cramer's 5 Best AI Stocks. Suggested articles:12 Best Upwork Alternatives for Freelancers and EmployersTop 20 Countries With Most Natural Resources in the World23 High-Paying Trade and Vocational Jobs in 2023Disclosure: None.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Adobe ADBE, Salesforce, Inc. CRM, Workday WDAY and Technology Select Sector SPDR XLK.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:3 Enterprise Software Stocks to Bet On Amid GenAI-Driven RallyEnterprise software stocks such as Adobe, Salesforce, Inc. and Workday have made a remarkable comeback year to date (YTD) after a massive sell-off in 2022 on recession concerns, inflationary pressure, increased oil prices and higher interest rates. YTD, Adobe, Salesforce and Workday stocks have rallied 63%, 54.3% and 28.4%, respectively.The aforementioned stocks have also outperformed the broader equity market. Major U.S. stock market indexes, the Nasdaq Composite, The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500, have risen 28.1%, 1.6% and 12.7%, respectively, YTD.Additionally, Adobe and Salesforce stocks have handily surpassed Technology Select Sector SPDR’s, the most important component of the broad market index, YTD gain of 36.4%. However, Workday’s YTD increase is lower than XLK’s gain.What’s Behind This Rally?With persistent inflationary pressure and softening demand, the fears of recession have not subsided yet. However, enterprise software companies have been focusing on cost-cutting measures to improve profitability and stay afloat amid these turbulent times. The strategies have boosted investors’ confidence, thereby enhancing their share prices.Additionally, the success of OpenAI’s ChatGPT has demonstrated the AI technology’s potential to improve operations in almost every industry. Though AI has been around for years, the meteoric rise of OpenAI’s ChatGPT has captivated the world’s attention on the power of generative AI to augment human capability, suggesting that the AI boom may just get started.Story continuesGenerative AI is a type of AI technology that can produce various types of content, including text, imagery, audio and synthetic data. The long-term growth prospect attached to this technology has led to a sharp rise in the share prices of AI-related technology and solutions providing mega-cap companies.Enterprise Software Stocks to ConsiderConsidering the probable new demand for enterprise software integrated with generative AI features and a possible improvement in profitability due to cost-cutting initiatives, we believe there is still significant upward potential left in ADBE, CRM and WDAY stocks. Therefore, investors should invest in stocks that are fundamentally strong and can sustain market jitters and ensure solid portfolio returns.We ran the Zacks Stock Screener to identify the aforementioned enterprise software stocks that have a favorable combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy).The Growth Style Score condenses all the essential metrics from a company’s financial statements to get a true sense of the quality and sustainability of its growth. Additionally, per Zacks’ proprietary methodology, stocks with a combination of a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 and a Growth Score of A or B offer solid investment opportunities.The abovementioned enterprise software stocks look promising based on their encouraging growth prospects, Zacks Rank and Growth Score. Let’s discuss the tech stocks in detail:Adobe has aggressively expanded its footprint in the generative AI space through partnerships and new solutions. Through its partnership with NVIDIA, Adobe is developing a generation of advanced generative AI models, with a focus on deep integration into applications. Adobe and Google also partnered to bring Firefly to Bard. Adobe Firefly is the most differentiated generative AI service that generates commercially viable, professional quality content.Adobe has expanded its offerings powered by Adobe Sensei GenAI. It has unveiled Generative Fill in Photoshop, bringing Adobe Firefly generative AI capabilities directly to design workflows.On the cost-cutting front, Adobe laid off about 100 employees in December 2022. Though it is a very small number compared with massive layoffs announced by other tech giants, the move reflects that Adobe has kept its operating expenses under check.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of B at present. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ADBE’s fiscal 2023 earnings is pegged at $15.93 per share, up by 58 cents over the past 30 days. This indicates year-over-year growth of 16.2%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Adobe Inc. price-consensus-chart | Adobe Inc. QuoteSalesforce has been benefiting from the strong adoption of its cloud-based products and solutions as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation in the ongoing hybrid work environment. Its ability to provide an integrated solution for customers’ business problems is the key driver.Salesforce is currently focusing on incorporating generative AI tools across its products as it looks to keep its business ahead of rivals. The company forayed into the generative AI space with the launch of Einstein GPT in March 2023. Upping its ante in the space, last month, Salesforce launched its AI Cloud service, which the company claims is a one-stop AI-powered solution for enterprises looking to enhance productivity.Furthermore, the company is cutting costs and raising product prices to improve profitability. To cut costs, Salesforce announced a broader restructuring plan in early January 2023. Under the plan, it intends to lay off approximately 10% of its total global workforce, exit real estate and shut down office spaces in certain markets.Additionally, CRM hiked prices across its core products — Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Industries and Tableau — by an average of 9%, effective from August 2023. We believe that the price hike will strengthen the company’s profitability.Currently, Salesforce carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a Growth Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Salesforce’s fiscal 2024 earnings has been revised upward by 4 cents to $8.06 per share over the past 30 days, implying a year-over-year increase of approximately 53.8%.Salesforce Inc. price-consensus-chart | Salesforce Inc. QuoteWorkday is a leading provider of enterprise-level software solutions for financial management and human resource domains. The company’s cloud-based platform combines finance and HR in a single system that makes it easier for organizations to provide analytical insights and decision support. Apart from Financial Management and Human Capital Management (“HCM”) solutions, the company offers applications related to Payroll, Time Tracking, Recruiting, Learning, Planning, Professional Services Automation and Student.Workday’s revenues continue to be aided by the high demand for its HCM and financial management solutions. The company’s cloud-based business model and expanding product portfolio have been the primary growth drivers.Additionally, Workday is putting a strong focus on integrating advanced AI and machine learning capabilities. The ongoing AI-powered product development emphasizes natural language generation, content search, summarization, content augmentation and document understanding. This augurs well for the long-term growth of the company.In late September 2023, the company introduced state-of-the-art AI-powered features to enhance the capability of the Workday Adaptive Planning solution. The newly introduced generative AI capability enables planners to validate unlimited scenarios with ease before implementing them into the operational workflow. Leveraging machine learning models, its predictive forecaster rapidly generates demand forecasts within a user-friendly interface.Furthermore, in January 2023, Workday announced that it intends to lay off approximately 3% of its global workforce in response to a challenging global economic environment. We believe the decision would boost the company’s margins in the near term.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of B at present. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WDAY’s fiscal 2024 earnings is pegged at $5.58 per share, up by 27 cents over the past 60 days.

RL is demonstrating commendable performance, driven by its brand strength, strong demand and expansion across various sales channels. The company's Average Unit Retail (“AUR”) has consistently increased in double digits, marking the 25th consecutive rise, supported by factors like product mix improvement, lower freight costs and a favorable channel mix.Additionally, the company's focus on creating engaging selling environments and authentic brand messaging is helping it build brand desirability and drive sales.Ralph Lauren is making strides in expanding its digital and omni-channel capabilities through investments in mobile, omni-channel solutions and fulfillment. Digital sales have been robust in the international markets. Regionally, digital sales were up 8% in Europe and 11% in Asia in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research For fiscal 2024, Ralph Lauren is planning to focus on rich digital content and enhanced customer personalization.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in PG&amp;E (NYSE:PCG). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. See our latest analysis for PG&amp;E How Fast Is PG&amp;E Growing Its Earnings Per Share?Strong earnings per share (EPS) results are an indicator of a company achieving solid profits, which investors look upon favourably and so the share price tends to reflect great EPS performance. So a growing EPS generally brings attention to a company in the eyes of prospective investors. It's an outstanding feat for PG&amp;E to have grown EPS from US$0.11 to US$0.97 in just one year. While it's difficult to sustain growth at that level, it bodes well for the company's outlook for the future.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. On the one hand, PG&amp;E's EBIT margins fell over the last year, but on the other hand, revenue grew. So if EBIT margins can stabilize, this top-line growth should pay off for shareholders.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for PG&amp;E's future EPS 100% free.Story continuesAre PG&amp;E Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since PG&amp;E has a market capitalisation of US$33b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. As a matter of fact, their holding is valued at US$44m. This considerable investment should help drive long-term value in the business. Despite being just 0.1% of the company, the value of that investment is enough to show insiders have plenty riding on the venture.Should You Add PG&amp;E To Your Watchlist?PG&amp;E's earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. Based on the sum of its parts, we definitely think its worth watching PG&amp;E very closely. Before you take the next step you should know about the 3 warning signs for PG&amp;E (2 can't be ignored!) that we have uncovered.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want. But if you prefer to focus on stocks that have demonstrated insider buying, here is a list of companies with insider buying in the last three months.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

Even when using conservative assumptions, News Corp has an opportunity to create significant shareholder value through a separation of certain assets.”Shares in News Corp rose 2pc to just over $22, giving the company a market capitalisation of roughly $12.8bn. Starboard did not disclose the size of its holding.The activist assault comes a month after Mr Murdoch announced he was standing down as chairman of both News Corp and Fox, handing over the reins to son Lachlan. The media mogul has taken up the role of chairman emeritus of both companies.The Murdoch family trust still controls around 40pc of News Corp voting shares, making it hard for any activist to push through change.The Murdochs have previously clashed with investors over News Corp’s value. In January, the family called off a troubled effort to merge News Corp and Fox following a backlash from shareholders, who said the enlarged group would be undervalued.Story continuesRupert and Lachlan Murdoch acknowledged that the deal, which would have reunited the media empire a decade after it was split, was “not optimal for shareholders”.In a further blow the following month, News Corp also abandoned a deal to sell real estate business Move Inc to CoStar Group in a reported $3bn deal.Mr Smith, dubbed the “most feared man in corporate America”, is known for activist campaigns at software companies including Salesforce and GoDaddy. In June, Starboard took a stake in Cambridge-based biotech firm Abcam.A spokesman for News Corp said the company had “always maintained an active and engaged dialogue with our investors and are committed to driving shareholder value”.He added: “We remain focused on executing our strategic plan, which has helped us set records in profitability over the past three years. We are proud of our rapid digital transformation and bright prospects for long-term growth and value creation.”Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the News Corporation (NASDAQ:NWSA) share price is up 67% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 53% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 36% in the last year , including dividends .Since it's been a strong week for News shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals. View our latest analysis for News There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During the five years of share price growth, News moved from a loss to profitability. That would generally be considered a positive, so we'd expect the share price to be up.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that News has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? Take a more thorough look at News' financial health with this free report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for News the TSR over the last 5 years was 78%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that News has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 36% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 12% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand News better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - News has   3 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.But note: News may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with past earnings growth (and further growth forecast).Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

The deal, effective from Jan 1, 2024, covers a portion of the equity natural gas produced in the Alba Field in Equatorial Guinea (E.G.).Under the agreement, the pricing structure is closely tied to the Dutch Title Transfer Facility index, with a fixed transportation fee. Per the company, this move provides it with a substantial foothold in the European LNG market.Additionally, Houston-based MRO is set to optimize its integrated gas operations in E.G. for 2024. This includes redirecting a portion of the Alba Unit's natural gas, where Marathon holds a 64% working interest, from the local methanol facility (where it holds a 45% working interest) to the LNG facility, where it has a 56% interest.Marathon's chairman, president and CEO Lee Tillman expressed his optimism regarding the deal's financial implications. He stated that the company expects to realize an approximate year-on-year EBITDA increase of more than $300 million next year across E.G. integrated gas business at the recent forward curve pricing.Tillman highlighted the advantageous timing of this agreement, citing E.G. LNG's reliable operational history and the facility's proximity to Europe as major contributing factors fueled high demand and fostered a highly competitive process.However, specific financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed. The agreement is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.Zacks Rank &amp; Other Key PicksCurrently, Marathon carries a Zack Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the energy sector are Matador Resources Company MTDR and Pioneer Natural Resources Company PXD, each currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and Diamondback Energy Inc.

To skip our detailed analysis of current US market news, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold According to Bill Gates' Portfolio.A Businessman And Philanthropist Many Look Up ToBill Gates has been an asset to the American economy for decades, and his contributions to the tech and environmental awareness areas have been significant for as long as he has been involved in them. At present, Gates has a net worth of $109.3 billion, according to Forbes.Considering the immense amount of influence Gates has today, many starting investors, and even more seasoned ones, are interested in the secret behind the management of his wealth. The answer to this question lies in the creation and continued operation of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust, managed by Michael Larson on behalf of Gates. The trust has about $36 billion in assets under management and has a diverse range of holdings ranging from companies in the technology and financial sectors to those in the industrial goods, services, and consumer goods sectors, among more. Interestingly, the holdings also include waste management companies, indicating Gates' general interest in environmental action, which is translated into his trust's investments. The key reason behind the maintenance of Gates' wealth is Larson's work to keep his wealth steady while also multiplying it to ensure the billionaire has enough to go around for his countless philanthropic endeavors.Fighting The Greatest Inequities In The WorldOn the subject of Gates' philanthropic work, records from the end of 2022 show that the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust gave out 1,960 grants in the year, while its total charitable support amounted to about $7 billion. The foundation has been working tirelessly over the past 20 years to fight ""the greatest inequities in the world,"" making it a prime focus for the Gates family to actively engage in charitable and philanthropic work. An example of Gates' work for the global community at large is his creation of Breakthrough Energy, a climate investment firm that aims to accelerate innovation in sustainable energy and other technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This move, alongside Gates' donations of billions of dollars to a range of charitable causes, make him one of the biggest philanthropists in the US today.Story continuesAll in all, Gates is an inspirational figure for many, making his business and investment moves open to observation by the world at large. A significant portion of his wealth can be attributed to Larson's money management skills, but at the end of the day, the biggest contributors are the companies he holds significant stakes in. These include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE), among others. Considering the above, we have taken a look at Bill Gates' investment portfolio for 2023 to pick 12 stocks he considers to be the best to buy and hold.

What started as a tool to hyper-charge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth used by more than 92% of Fortune 500 companies for more wide-ranging needs.While there is a more…nefarious side to ChatGPT, it’s clear that AI tools are not going away anytime soon. Since its initial launch nearly a year ago, ChatGPT has hit 100 million weekly active users, and OpenAI is heavily investing in it.On November 6, OpenAI held its first developer conference: OpenAI DevDay. During the conference, it announced a slew of updates coming to GPT, including GPT-4 Turbo (super-charged versions of GPT-4, its latest language-writing model), a multimodal API and a GPT store where users can create and monetize their own custom versions of GPT.GPT-4, which can write more naturally and fluently than previous models, remains largely exclusive to paying ChatGPT users. But you can access GPT-4 for free through Microsoft’s Bing Chat in Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome and Safari web browsers. Beyond GPT-4 and OpenAI DevDay announcements, OpenAI recently connected ChatGPT to the internet for all users. And with the integration of DALL-E 3, users are also able to generate both text prompts and images right in ChatGPT. Here’s a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we’ve been updating throughout the year. And if you have any other questions, check out our ChatGPT FAQ here.Timeline of the most recent ChatGPT updatesNovember 6OpenAI debuts GPT-4 TurboOpenAI unveiled GPT-4 Turbo at its first-ever OpenAI DevDay conference. GPT-4 Turbo comes in two versions: one that’s strictly text-analyzing and another that understands the context of both text and images.GPT-4 gets a fine-tuningAs opposed to the fine-tuning program for GPT-3.5, the GPT-4 program will involve more oversight and guidance from OpenAI teams, the company says — largely due to technical hurdles.Story continuesOpenAI’s GPT Store lets you build (and monetize) your own GPTUsers and developers will soon be able to make their own GPT, with no coding experience required. Anyone building their own GPT will also be able to list it on OpenAI’s marketplace and monetize it in the future.ChatGPT has 100 million weekly active usersAfter being released nearly a year ago, ChatGPT has 100 million weekly active users. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also revealed that over two million developers use the platform, including more than 92% of Fortune 500 companies.OpenAI launches DALL-E 3 API, new text-to-speech modelsDALL-E 3, OpenAI’s text-to-image model, is now available via an API after first coming to ChatGPT-4 and Bing Chat. OpenAI’s newly released text-to-speech API, Audio API, offers six preset voices to choose from and two generative AI model variants.OpenAI promises to defend business customers against copyright claimsBowing to peer pressure, OpenAI it will pay legal costs incurred by customers who face lawsuits over IP claims against work generated by an OpenAI tool. The protections seemingly don’t extend to all OpenAI products, like the free and Plus tiers of ChatGPT.As OpenAI’s multimodal API launches broadly, research shows it’s still flawedOpenAI announced that GPT-4 with vision will become available alongside the upcoming launch of GPT-4 Turbo API. But some researchers found that the model remains flawed in several significant and problematic ways.OpenAI launches API, letting developers build ‘assistants’ into their appsAt its OpenAI DevDay, OpenAI announced the Assistants API to help developers build “agent-like experiences” within their apps. Use cases range from a natural language-based data analysis app to a coding assistant or even an AI-powered vacation planner.—October 30ChatGPT app revenue shows no signs of slowing, but it’s not #1OpenAI’s chatbot app far outpaces all others on mobile devices in terms of downloads, but it’s surprisingly not the top AI app by revenue. Several other AI chatbots, like “Chat &amp; Ask AI” and “ChatOn — AI Chat Bot Assistant”, are actually making more money than ChatGPT.October 29ChatGPT tests the ability to upload and analyze files for Plus usersSubscribers to ChatGPT’s Enterprise Plan have reported new beta features, including the ability to upload PDFs to analyze and and ask questions about them directly. The new rollout also makes it so users no longer have to manually select a mode like DALL-E and browsing when using ChatGPT. Instead, users will automatically be switched to models based on the prompt.October 18ChatGPT officially gets web searchOpenAI has formally launched its internet-browsing feature to ChatGPT, some three weeks after re-introducing the feature in beta after several months in hiatus. The AI chatbot that has historically been limited to data up to September, 2021.October 18OpenAI integrates DALL-E 3 into ChatGPTThe integration means users don’t have to think so carefully about their text-prompts when asking DALL-E to create an image. Users will also now be able to receive images as part of their text-based queries without having to switch between apps.October 17Microsoft-affiliated research finds flaws in GPT-4A Microsoft-affiliated scientific paper looked at the “trustworthiness” — and toxicity — of LLMs, including GPT-4. Because GPT-4 is more likely to follow the instructions of “jailbreaking” prompts, the co-authors claim that GPT-4 can be more easily prompted than other LLMs to spout toxic, biased text.October 9ChatGPT’s mobile app hits record $4.58M in revenue in SeptemberOpenAI amassed 15.6 million downloads and nearly $4.6 million in gross revenue across its iOS and Android apps worldwide in September. But revenue growth has now begun to slow, according to new data from market intelligence firm Appfigures — dropping from 30% to 20% in September.September 27ChatGPT can now browse the internet (again)OpenAI posted on Twitter/X that ChatGPT can now browse the internet and is no longer limited to data before September 2021. The chatbot had a web browsing capability for Plus subscribers back in July, but the feature was taken away after users exploited it to get around paywalls.ChatGPT can now browse the internet to provide you with current and authoritative information, complete with direct links to sources. It is no longer limited to data before September 2021. pic.twitter.com/pyj8a9HWkB— OpenAI (@OpenAI) September 27, 2023https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.jsSeptember 25, 2023ChatGPT now has a voiceOpenAI announced that it's adding a new voice for verbal conversations and image-based smarts to the AI-powered chatbot.September 21, 2023Poland opens an investigation against OpenAIThe Polish authority publically announced it has opened an investigation regarding ChatGPT — accusing the company of a string of breaches of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).September 20, 2023OpenAI unveils DALL-E 3The upgraded text-to-image tool, DALL-E 3, uses ChatGPT to help fill in prompts. Subscribers to OpenAI’s premium ChatGPT plans, ChatGPT Plus and ChatGPT Enterprise, can type in a request for an image and hone it through conversations with the chatbot — receiving the results directly within the chat app.September 7, 2023Opera GX integrates ChatGPT-powered AIPowered by OpenAI’s ChatGPT, the AI browser Aria launched on Opera in May to give users an easier way to search, ask questions and write code. Today, the company announced it is bringing Aria to Opera GX, a version of the flagship Opera browser that is built for gamers.The new feature allows Opera GX users to interact directly with a browser AI to find the latest gaming news and tips.August 31, 2023OpenAI releases a guide for teachers using ChatGPT in the classroomOpenAI wants to rehabilitate the system’s image a bit when it comes to education, as ChatGPT has been controversial in the classroom due to plagiarism. OpenAI has offered up a selection of ways to put the chatbot to work in the classroom.August 28, 2023OpenAI launches ChatGPT EnterpriseChatGPT Enterprise can perform the same tasks as ChatGPT, such as writing emails, drafting essays and debugging computer code. However, the new offering also adds ""enterprise-grade"" privacy and data analysis capabilities on top of the vanilla ChatGPT, as well as enhanced performance and customization options.Survey finds relatively few American actually use ChatGPTRecent Pew polling suggests the language model isn’t quite as popular or threatening as some would have you think. Ongoing polling by Pew Research shows that although ChatGPT is gaining mindshare, only about 18% of Americans have ever actually used it.August 22, 2023OpenAI brings fine-tuning to GPT-3.5 TurboWith fine-tuning, companies using GPT-3.5 Turbo through the company's API can make the model better follow specific instructions. For example, having the model always respond in a given language. Or improving the model’s ability to consistently format responses, as well as hone the “feel” of the model’s output, like its tone, so that it better fits a brand or voice. Most notably, fine-tuning enables OpenAI customers to shorten text prompts to speed up API calls and cut costs.OpenAI is partnering with Scale AI to allow companies to fine-tune GPT-3.5. However, it is unclear whether OpenAI is developing an in-house tuning tool that is meant to complement platforms like Scale AI or serve a different purpose altogether.Fine-tuning costs:Training: $0.008 / 1K tokensUsage input: $0.012 / 1K tokensUsage output: $0.016 / 1K tokensAugust 16, 2023OpenAI acquires Global IlluminationIn OpenAI's first public acquisition in its seven-year history, the company announced it has acquired Global Illumination, a New York-based startup leveraging AI to build creative tools, infrastructure and digital experiences.“We’re very excited for the impact they’ll have here at OpenAI,” OpenAI wrote in a brief post published to its official blog. “The entire team has joined OpenAI to work on our core products including ChatGPT.”August 10, 2023The 'custom instructions' feature is extended to free ChatGPT usersOpenAI announced that it's expanding custom instructions to all users, including those on the free tier of service. The feature allows users to add various preferences and requirements that they want the AI chatbot to consider when responding.August 1, 2023China requires AI apps to obtain an administrative licenseMultiple generative AI apps have been removed from Apple's China App Store ahead of the country's latest generative AI regulations that are set to take effect August 15.“As you may know, the government has been tightening regulations associated with deep synthesis technologies (DST) and generative AI services, including ChatGPT. DST must fulfill permitting requirements to operate in China, including securing a license from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT),” Apple said in a letter to OpenCat, a native ChatGPT client. “Based on our review, your app is associated with ChatGPT, which does not have requisite permits to operate in China.”July 25, 2023ChatGPT for Android is now available in the US, India, Bangladesh and BrazilA few days after putting up a preorder page on Google Play, OpenAI has flipped the switch and released ChatGPT for Android. The app is now live in a handful of countries.July 21, 2023ChatGPT is coming to AndroidChatGPT is available to ""pre-order"" for Android users.The ChatGPT app on Android looks to be more or less identical to the iOS one in functionality, meaning it gets most if not all of the web-based version’s features. You should be able to sync your conversations and preferences across devices, too — so if you’re iPhone at home and Android at work, no worries.July 20, 2023OpenAI launches customized instructions for ChatGPTOpenAI launched custom instructions for ChatGPT users, so they don’t have to write the same instruction prompts to the chatbot every time they interact with it.The company said this feature lets you “share anything you’d like ChatGPT to consider in its response.” For example, a teacher can say they are teaching fourth-grade math or a developer can specify the code language they prefer when asking for suggestions. A person can also specify their family size, so the text-generating AI can give responses about meals, grocery and vacation planning accordingly.July 13, 2023The FTC is reportedly investigating OpenAIThe FTC is reportedly in at least the exploratory phase of investigation over whether OpenAI's flagship ChatGPT conversational AI made ""false, misleading, disparaging or harmful"" statements about people.TechCrunch Reporter Devin Coldewey reports:This kind of investigation doesn’t just appear out of thin air — the FTC doesn’t look around and say “That looks suspicious.” Generally a lawsuit or formal complaint is brought to their attention and the practices described by it imply that regulations are being ignored. For example, a person may sue a supplement company because the pills made them sick, and the FTC will launch an investigation on the back of that because there’s evidence the company lied about the side effects.July 6, 2023OpenAI announced the general availability of GPT-4Starting July 6, all existing OpenAI developers ""with a history of successful payments"" can access GPT-4. OpenAI plans to open up access to new developers by the end of July.In the future, OpenAI says that it’ll allow developers to fine-tune GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 Turbo, one of the original models powering ChatGPT, with their own data, as has long been possible with several of OpenAI’s other text-generating models. That capability should arrive later this year, according to OpenAI.June 28, 2023ChatGPT app can now search the web only on BingOpenAI announced that subscribers to ChatGPT Plus can now use a new feature on the app called Browsing, which allows ChatGPT to search Bing for answers to questions.The Browsing feature can be enabled by heading to the New Features section of the app settings, selecting “GPT-4” in the model switcher and choosing “Browse with Bing” from the drop-down list. Browsing is available on both the iOS and Android ChatGPT apps.June 15, 2023Mercedes is adding ChatGPT to its infotainment systemU.S. owners of Mercedes models that use MBUX will be able to opt into a beta program starting June 16 activating the ChatGPT functionality. This will enable the highly versatile large language model to augment the car’s conversation skills. You can join up simply by telling your car “Hey Mercedes, I want to join the beta program.”It's not really clear what for, though.June 8, 2023ChatGPT app is now available on iPad, adds support for Siri and ShortcutsThe new ChatGPT app version brings native iPad support to the app, as well as support for using the chatbot with Siri and Shortcuts. Drag and drop is also now available, allowing users to drag individual messages from ChatGPT into other apps.On iPad, ChatGPT now runs in full-screen mode, optimized for the tablet’s interface.May 30, 2023Texas judge orders all AI-generated content must be declared and checkedThe Texas federal judge has added a requirement that any attorney appearing in his court must attest that “no portion of the filing was drafted by generative artificial intelligence,” or if it was, that it was checked “by a human being.”May 26, 2023ChatGPT app expanded to more than 30 countriesThe list of new countries includes Algeria, Argentina, Azerbaijan, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Estonia, Ghana, India, Iraq, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Lithuania, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mexico, Morocco, Namibia, Nauru, Oman, Pakistan, Peru, Poland, Qatar, Slovenia, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates.May 25, 2023ChatGPT app is now available in 11 more countriesOpenAI announced in a tweet that the ChatGPT mobile app is now available on iOS in the U.S., Europe, South Korea and New Zealand, and soon more will be able to download the app from the app store.

The new ChatGPT app will be free to use, free from ads and will allow for voice input, the company says, but will initially be limited to U.S. users at launch.When using the mobile version of ChatGPT, the app will sync your history across devices — meaning it will know what you’ve previously searched for via its web interface, and make that accessible to you. The app is also integrated with Whisper, OpenAI’s open source speech recognition system, to allow for voice input.May 3, 2023Hackers are using ChatGPT lures to spread malware on FacebookMeta said in a report on May 3 that malware posing as ChatGPT was on the rise across its platforms. The company said that since March 2023, its security teams have uncovered 10 malware families using ChatGPT (and similar themes) to deliver malicious software to users’ devices.“In one case, we’ve seen threat actors create malicious browser extensions available in official web stores that claim to offer ChatGPT-based tools,” said Meta security engineers Duc H. Nguyen and Ryan Victory in a blog post. “They would then promote these malicious extensions on social media and through sponsored search results to trick people into downloading malware.”April 28, 2023ChatGPT parent company OpenAI closes $300M share sale at $27B-29B valuationVC firms including Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive and K2 Global are picking up new shares, according to documents seen by TechCrunch. A source tells us Founders Fund is also investing. Altogether the VCs have put in just over $300 million at a valuation of $27 billion to $29 billion. This is separate to a big investment from Microsoft announced earlier this year, a person familiar with the development told TechCrunch, which closed in January. The size of Microsoft’s investment is believed to be around $10 billion, a figure we confirmed with our source.April 25, 2023OpenAI previews new subscription tier, ChatGPT BusinessCalled ChatGPT Business, OpenAI describes the forthcoming offering as “for professionals who need more control over their data as well as enterprises seeking to manage their end users.”“ChatGPT Business will follow our API’s data usage policies, which means that end users’ data won’t be used to train our models by default,” OpenAI wrote in a blog post. “We plan to make ChatGPT Business available in the coming months.”April 24, 2023OpenAI wants to trademark ""GPT""OpenAI applied for a trademark for “GPT,” which stands for “Generative Pre-trained Transformer,” last December. Last month, the company petitioned the USPTO to speed up the process, citing the “myriad infringements and counterfeit apps” beginning to spring into existence.Unfortunately for OpenAI, its petition was dismissed last week. According to the agency, OpenAI’s attorneys neglected to pay an associated fee as well as provide “appropriate documentary evidence supporting the justification of special action.”That means a decision could take up to five more months.April 22, 2023Auto-GPT is Silicon Valley's latest quest to automate everythingAuto-GPT is an open-source app created by game developer Toran Bruce Richards that uses OpenAI's latest text-generating models, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to interact with software and services online, allowing it to ""autonomously"" perform tasks.Depending on what objective the tool’s provided, Auto-GPT can behave in very… unexpected ways. One Reddit user claims that, given a budget of $100 to spend within a server instance, Auto-GPT made a wiki page on cats, exploited a flaw in the instance to gain admin-level access and took over the Python environment in which it was running — and then “killed” itself.April 18, 2023FTC warns that AI technology like ChatGPT could 'turbocharge' fraudFTC chair Lina Khan and fellow commissioners warned House representatives of the potential for modern AI technologies, like ChatGPT, to be used to “turbocharge” fraud in a congressional hearing.“AI presents a whole set of opportunities, but also presents a whole set of risks,” Khan told the House representatives. “And I think we’ve already seen ways in which it could be used to turbocharge fraud and scams. We’ve been putting market participants on notice that instances in which AI tools are effectively being designed to deceive people can place them on the hook for FTC action,” she stated.April 17, 2023Superchat's new AI chatbot lets you message historical and fictional characters via ChatGPTThe company behind the popular iPhone customization app Brass, sticker maker StickerHub and others is out today with a new AI chat app called SuperChat, which allows iOS users to chat with virtual characters powered by OpenAI’s ChatGPT. However, what makes the app different from the default experience or the dozens of generic AI chat apps now available are the characters offered which you can use to engage with SuperChat’s AI features.April 12, 2023Italy gives OpenAI to-do list for lifting ChatGPT suspension orderItaly’s data protection watchdog has laid out what OpenAI needs to do for it to lift an order against ChatGPT issued at the end of last month — when it said it suspected the AI chatbot service was in breach of the EU’s GSPR and ordered the U.S.-based company to stop processing locals’ data.The DPA has given OpenAI a deadline — of April 30 — to get the regulator's compliance demands done. (The local radio, TV and internet awareness campaign has a slightly more generous timeline of May 15 to be actioned.)April 12, 2023Researchers discover a way to make ChatGPT consistently toxicA study co-authored by scientists at the Allen Institute for AI shows that assigning ChatGPT a “persona” — for example, “a bad person,” “a horrible person” or “a nasty person” — through the ChatGPT API increases its toxicity sixfold. Even more concerning, the co-authors found having the conversational AI chatbot pose as certain historical figures, gendered people and members of political parties also increased its toxicity — with journalists, men and Republicans in particular causing the machine learning model to say more offensive things than it normally would.The research was conducted using the latest version, but not the model currently in preview based on OpenAI’s GPT-4.April 4, 2023Y Combinator-backed startups are trying to build 'ChatGPT for X'YC Demo Day's Winter 2023 batch features no fewer than four startups that claim to be building ""ChatGPT for X."" They’re all chasing after a customer service software market that’ll be worth $58.1 billion by 2023, assuming the rather optimistic prediction from Acumen Research comes true.Here are the YC-backed startups that caught our eye:Yuma, whose customer demographic is primarily Shopify merchants, provides ChatGPT-like AI systems that integrate with help desk software, suggesting drafts of replies to customer tickets.Baselit, which uses one of OpenAI's text-understanding models to allow businesses to embed chatbot-style analytics for their customers.Lasso customers send descriptions or videos of the processes they'd like to automate and the company combines ChatGPT-like interface with robotic process automation (RPA) and a Chrome extension to build out those automations.BerriAI, whose platform is designed to help developers spin up ChatGPT apps for their organization data through various data connectors.April 1, 2023Italy orders ChatGPT to be blockedOpenAI has started geoblocking access to its generative AI chatbot, ChatGPT, in Italy.Italy’s data protection authority has just put out a timely reminder that some countries do have laws that already apply to cutting edge AI: it has ordered OpenAI to stop processing people’s data locally with immediate effect. The Italian DPA said it’s concerned that the ChatGPT maker is breaching the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and is opening an investigation.March 29, 20231,100+ signatories signed an open letter asking all 'AI labs to immediately pause for 6 months'The letter's signatories include Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak and Tristan Harris of the Center for Humane Technology, among others. The letter calls on “all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4.”The letter reads:Contemporary AI systems are now becoming human-competitive at general tasks,[3] and we must ask ourselves: Should we let machines flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth? Should we automate away all the jobs, including the fulfilling ones? Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us? Should we risk loss of control of our civilization? Such decisions must not be delegated to unelected tech leaders. Powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable.March 23, 2023OpenAI connects ChatGPT to the internetOpenAI launched plugins for ChatGPT, extending the bot's functionality by granting it access to third-party knowledge sources and databases, including the web.

ChatGPT can engage with a range of topics, including programming, TV scripts and scientific concepts.Writers everywhere rolled their eyes at the new technology, much like artists did with OpenAI’s DALL-E model, but the latest chat-style iteration seemingly broadened its appeal and audience.FAQs:What is ChatGPT? How does it work?ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.When did ChatGPT get released?November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.What is the latest version of ChatGPT?Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4.Can I use ChatGPT for free?There is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.Who uses ChatGPT?Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.What companies use ChatGPT?Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.Most recently, Microsoft announced at it's 2023 Build conference that it is integrating it ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT. And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.What does GPT mean in ChatGPT?GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.What's the difference between ChatGPT and Bard?Much like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Bard is a chatbot that will answer questions in natural language. Google announced at its 2023 I/O event that it will soon be adding multimodal content to Bard, meaning that it can deliver answers in more than just text, responses can give you rich visuals as well. Rich visuals mean pictures for now, but later can include maps, charts and other items.ChatGPT's generative AI has had a longer lifespan and thus has been ""learning"" for a longer period of time than Bard.What is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn't necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they'll give canned responses to questions.ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.Can ChatGPT write essays?Yes.Can ChatGPT commit libel?Due to the nature of how these models work, they don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may well at this point be libel.We will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.Does ChatGPT have an app?Yes, there is now a free ChatGPT app that is currently limited to U.S. iOS users at launch. OpenAi says an android version is ""coming soon.""What is the ChatGPT character limit?It’s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.Does ChatGPT have an API?Yes, it was released March 1, 2023.What are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?Everyday examples include programing, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.What are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.How good is ChatGPT at writing code?It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can’t necessarily program an entire app’s worth of code. That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness -- in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used.Can you save a ChatGPT chat?Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.Are there alternatives to ChatGPT?Yes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google’s Bard and Anthropic’s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives. But the latter are harder -- if not impossible -- to run today.The Google-owned research lab DeepMind claimed that its next LLM, will rival, or even best, OpenAI's ChatGPT. DeepMind is using techniques from AlphaGo, DeepMind’s AI system that was the first to defeat a professional human player at the board game Go, to make a ChatGPT-rivaling chatbot called Gemini.Apple is developing AI tools to challenge OpenAI, Google and others. The tech giant created a chatbot that some engineers are internally referring to as ""Apple GPT,"" but Apple has yet to determine a strategy for releasing the AI to consumers.How does ChatGPT handle data privacy?OpenAI has said that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”.The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”.In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on ""legitimate interest"" (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.”What controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI's technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.An Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT's false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.Several major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.There have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.Where can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.Can ChatGPT be detected?Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they’re inconsistent at best.Are ChatGPT chats public?No. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users’ conversations to other people on the service.Who owns the copyright on ChatGPT-created content or media?The user who requested the input from ChatGPT is the copyright owner.What lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.Are there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?Yes.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231018497392/en/Walgreens is collaborating with the Cardiovascular Research Foundation (CRF) to advance the PREVUE-VALVE clinical trial for valvular heart disease treatments. Walgreens goal is to make clinical trials accessible to all, and its partnership with CRF combines the expertise and resources needed to transform cardiovascular research, laying the groundwork for the development of innovative treatments. (Photo: Business Wire)Walgreens aims to leverage its national presence, strong community relationships and data-driven clinical trials solutions to help identify and reach potential study participants.""The aging population has led to a surge in the incidence and prevalence of valvular heart disease in the United States. Unfortunately, many patients with valvular heart disease remain untreated or receive treatment later than recommended due to various barriers. At the Cardiovascular Research Foundation, we believe efficient clinical trials are essential for arming us with insights to effectively tackle this critical health challenge,"" said David J. Cohen, MD, MSc, Director of Clinical and Outcomes Research at CRF. ""Partnering with Walgreens will help us engage a broader and more representative patient population for enrollment in the PREVUE-VALVE study so that we can improve our ability to diagnose valvular heart disease before the onset of irreversible cardiac damage, which will allow for more timely treatment and ultimately, better health outcomes, for our patients.""Story continuesWalgreens will provide patient recruitment services to support this study, which seeks to define the prevalence of VHD in older Americans and to ensure representative access and enrollment. To enhance patient convenience and engagement, participants will have all study procedures performed in the comfort of their homes. By leveraging longitudinal pharmacy and social determinants of health insights and proprietary automated recruitment selection software, Walgreens looks forward to reaching eligible patients for enrollment at the right time to deliver the right message and help orchestrate their participation seamlessly.Historically, estimates of the prevalence of VHD in the United States have been derived from homogeneous populations with minimal diversity—particularly with respect to race and ethnicity. Furthermore, the older population, where VHD is more prevalent, has been disproportionately excluded from clinical trials. By enrolling a population representative of the U.S. as a whole, the PREVUE-VALVE study is a crucial step toward developing testing and treatments that address the needs of the most affected patients.""We know that older adults are vastly underrepresented in clinical trials and research despite being disproportionately impacted by many diseases,"" said Ramita Tandon, chief clinical trials officer, Walgreens. ""Walgreens is proud to leverage our expertise and capabilities in inclusive clinical trial recruitment in partnership with the Cardiovascular Research Foundation and other high-caliber collaborators to improve cardiovascular research for a population with significant unmet needs.""In a similar Phase 3 cardiovascular study, Walgreens exceeded its recruitment within weeks. Real-world insights enabled Walgreens to tap into historically underrepresented populations, resulting in a significant increase in Black/African American (17%) and Hispanic/Latino (19%) participation in the clinical trial, compared to nationwide 2020 averages of clinical trial participation of 8% and 11% respectively.The PREVUE-VALVE study is currently underway, with topline results expected in 2025, making a significant step forward in the fight against valvular heart disease.About WalgreensWalgreens (www.walgreens.com) is included in the U.S. Retail Pharmacy and U.S. Healthcare segments of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

The company aims to reach a total of 9,000 stores across the country by 2025.($1 = 7.3120 Chinese yuan renminbi)(Reporting by Sophie Yu, Brenda Goh, editing by Deborah Kyvrikosaios)]"

Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.04%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 0.25%.Shares of the coffee chain have depreciated by 3.21% over the course of the past month, outperforming the Retail-Wholesale sector's loss of 4.66% and lagging the S&amp;P 500's loss of 1.6%.The investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Starbucks in its upcoming release. The company is slated to reveal its earnings on November 2, 2023. The company's upcoming EPS is projected at $0.96, signifying a 18.52% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $9.23 billion, indicating a 9.74% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.Additionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Starbucks. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 0.28% downward. Starbucks is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Looking at valuation, Starbucks is presently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 23.09. This indicates a premium in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 19.16.Story continuesInvestors should also note that SBUX has a PEG ratio of 1.4 right now. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth.

An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for ADM basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for ADM imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for ADMThis agribusiness giant is expected to earn $7.18 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2023, which represents a year-over-year change of -8.5%.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for ADM. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 5.6%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of ADM to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

116,95d6572c-d6b6-37c4-b17d-0e9431b91de7,ADM,2023-10-18,Earnings Preview: Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-archer-daniels-midland-140104155.html,1697551264,STORY,['ADM'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 24, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis agribusiness giant is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.53 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -17.7%.Revenues are expected to be $23.49 billion, down 4.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.09% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for ADM?For ADM, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -8%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #1.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that ADM will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that ADM would post earnings of $1.59 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.89, delivering a surprise of +18.87%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.ADM doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

120,5d48303e-bcb5-3786-b6b7-6e666457ad23,PM,2023-10-18,Will Smoke-Free Products Fuel Philip Morris' (PM) Q3 Earnings?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smoke-free-products-fuel-philip-124700465.html,1697546820,STORY,"['PM', 'SAM', 'CL']","[Philip Morris International Inc. PM is ready to report third-quarter 2023 earnings on Oct 19. It is worth taking a closer look at the company’s smoke-free product business, which constituted 35.4% of its net revenues in the second quarter of 2023. We believe the smoke-free product segment is likely to have played a key role in determining Philip Morris’ performance in the quarter under review.Smoke-Free Products’ Prospects Look PromisingGrowing inclination toward health and wellness has pushed consumers toward low-risk, reduced-risk products (RRPs). Philip Morris has been progressing well with its business transformation. PM is well-placed to become a majority smoke-free company by 2025. To this end, the company’s IQOS, a heat-not-burn device, counts among one of the leading RRPs in the industry. These high-quality next-generation devices have been aiding adult smokers in switching from traditional cigarettes to smoke-free options.In the second quarter of 2023, revenues from smoke-free products (excluding Wellness and Healthcare) jumped 35.3% to $3,101 million (up 18.3% organically). In the quarter, Philip Morris witnessed continued strength in IQOS performance and pricing power. Total IQOS users at the end of the second quarter were estimated at roughly 27.2 million (including nearly 19.4 million who switched to IQOS and stopped smoking).Philip Morris International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePhilip Morris International Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Philip Morris International Inc. QuoteFor the third quarter, management expects heated tobacco unit (HTU) shipment volumes of 31-33 billion units. We expect a 26.1% jump in smoke-free product revenues (excluding Wellness and Healthcare) in the third quarter. Further, our model suggests total HTU shipment volume growth of 17.9% to 32.4 billion units in the third quarter.Speaking of the Wellness and Healthcare unit, Philip Morris’ buyouts of Vectura Group plc, Fertin Pharma A/S and OtiTopic were consolidated to form a Wellness and Healthcare category on Mar 31, 2022. Management expects net revenues of about $300 million for the Wellness and Healthcare segment for 2023.Among other initiatives, Philip Morris became the majority owner of Swedish Match on Nov 11, 2022. Management expects a robust performance from Swedish Match’s existing operations in 2023 due to expectations of strong ZYN volumes in the United States. This also bodes well for the quarter under review.Further, on Jan 30, 2023, Philip Morris unveiled a long-term partnership with KT&amp;G to continue commercializing the innovative smoke-free devices and consumables of the latter on a unique, worldwide basis (excluding South Korea). This may have contributed to results in the to-be-reported quarter.Story continuesOther TrendsPM has been battling cost-related headwinds for a while now. On its last earnings call, management highlighted its intentions to make additional growth-oriented investments, including the commercialization of ILUMA. These may have impacted margins in the quarter under review. Further, soft cigarette shipment volumes have been a concern.However, Philip Morris has been benefiting from its strong pricing power. Though higher pricing might lead to a possible decline in cigarette consumption, it is seen that smokers tend to absorb price increases due to the addictive quality of cigarettes.How Are Estimates Shaping Up?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $9.2 billion, suggesting a rise of 14.3% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for quarterly earnings has risen by 1.3% in the past seven days to $1.61 per share, implying growth of 5.2% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. PM has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 7.6%, on average.Philip Morris carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has an Earnings ESP of -0.31%. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is not the case here.

The company is likely to register bottom-line growth when it reports third-quarter 2023 numbers.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for The Boston Beer Company’s quarterly revenues is pegged at $592.8 million, indicating a drop of 0.6% from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter.Colgate-Palmolive Company CL currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.37% and a Zacks Rank of 3. The company is likely to register increases in the top and bottom lines when it reports third-quarter 2023 results.

Price and EPS SurpriseRoper Technologies, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseRoper Technologies, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Roper Technologies, Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteRoper is benefiting from strength across the Application Software segment due to solid growth in the Deltek, Vertafore and Aderant businesses. We expect the company’s Application Software revenues to increase 20% year over year for the third quarter.Strong retention and customer expansion activity and strength across the Foundry business have been fostering growth of the Network Software segment. Our estimate for Network Software segment revenues in the third quarter indicates a year-over-year increase of 8.1%.The Tech-enabled Products segment is expected to generate higher revenues on the back of improving supply chains and increased demand for residential and commercial ultrasonic or static meters. We expect the Tech-enabled Products segment revenues to climb 7.4% year over year for the third quarter.Contributions from the acquisition of Syntellis Performance Solutions (August 2023) and Frontline Education are expected to boost Roper’s top-line results in the to-be-reported quarter. Our estimate for the company’s total revenues in the third quarter suggests a 13.6% increase from the year-ago reported figure.However, the escalating cost of sales due to raw material cost inflation and higher selling, general and administrative expenses may partly affect ROP’s bottom-line performance.Earnings WhispersOur proven model suggests an earnings beat for Roper this time around.

A Look At Its Intrinsic Value,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/transdigm-group-incorporated-nyse-tdg-110318188.html,1697626998,STORY,['TDG'],"[Key InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, TransDigm Group fair value estimate is US$640TransDigm Group is estimated to be 35% overvalued based on current share price of US$863 Analyst price target for TDG is US$968, which is 51% above our fair value estimateToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for TransDigm Group What's The Estimated Valuation?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.80bUS$2.00bUS$2.00bUS$1.79bUS$1.80bUS$1.81bUS$1.84bUS$1.87bUS$1.90bUS$1.94bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x10Analyst x7Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 0.53%Est @ 1.02%Est @ 1.36%Est @ 1.60%Est @ 1.76%Est @ 1.88% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.8% US$1.7kUS$1.8kUS$1.6kUS$1.4kUS$1.3kUS$1.2kUS$1.2kUS$1.1kUS$1.1kUS$1.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$13bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.9b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.8%– 2.2%) = US$43bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$43b÷ ( 1 + 6.8%)10= US$22bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$35b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$863, the company appears reasonably expensive at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at TransDigm Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.930. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for TransDigm GroupStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.WeaknessInterest payments on debt are not well covered.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Total liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.Revenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value lower than the current share price?

126,70861c99-f5e4-39c5-953b-9ce2baf1bd6f,HCA,2023-10-18,HCA Healthcare (HCA) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hca-healthcare-hca-earnings-expected-140054167.html,1697551254,STORY,['HCA'],"[The market expects HCA Healthcare (HCA) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 24, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis hospital operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.99 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +1.5%.Revenues are expected to be $15.78 billion, up 5.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.5% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for HCA?For HCA, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.94%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that HCA will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that HCA would post earnings of $4.28 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.29, delivering a surprise of +0.23%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors.

(NYSE: HCA), one of the nation’s leading healthcare providers, Sarah Cannon Cancer Institute, part of HCA Healthcare, and GRAIL, LLC, a healthcare company with a mission of detecting cancer early when it can be cured, today announced a strategic collaboration to advance comprehensive cancer care through early detection. Starting today, GRAIL’s Galleri® multi-cancer early detection (MCED) test will be available to patients who meet screening criteria at select HCA Healthcare physician practices.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231017721204/en/More than 600,000 people die from cancer each year in the U.S., according to the American Cancer Society. This is in large part because some of the deadliest cancers are found too late when outcomes are often poor. Recommended screening tests save lives, but only cover five cancer types in the U.S.: breast, colon, cervical, prostate, and, in high-risk adults, lung. In fact, approximately 70% of cancer deaths have no recommended early detection screening.The Galleri test, available by prescription only, is the first clinically validated MCED test that can detect a shared cancer signal across more than 50 types of cancers using a simple blood draw. The MCED test offers a fundamentally different blood-based approach intended to be used in addition to recommended single cancer screenings.""As a leader in cancer prevention and care, this is an opportunity to be at the forefront of a new age of cancer screening,"" said Chris Ott, MD, FACEP, chief medical officer at HCA Healthcare Physician Services. ""This partnership allows us to support our patients and clinicians by offering cutting-edge innovation, including GRAIL’s groundbreaking MCED test, as part of our comprehensive cancer care programs.""Story continuesRecognizing the Galleri test is a new paradigm in cancer screening, Sarah Cannon Cancer Institute will leverage its leading nurse navigation program to support patients and providers through the diagnostic journey following a positive Galleri test result. Plans to enhance patient experience and outcomes include standardizing patient and provider education, developing evidence-based diagnostic pathways, and facilitating timely evaluations.""Sarah Cannon has been working with GRAIL for several years to advance the study of early cancer detection testing,"" said Dax Kurbegov, MD, vice president and physician-in-chief of Clinical Programs at Sarah Cannon Cancer Institute. ""Nurse navigation is an essential part of oncology care, and we believe this partnership will help us to think critically about the most useful support needed for the patient when obtaining this type of test, both today and in the future, as we establish this best-in-class offering.""HCA Healthcare is also participating in the PATHFINDER 2 multi-center interventional study of the Galleri test in Nashville, Asheville, Austin, and Denver. The company’s research partner, Sarah Cannon Research Institute (SCRI) and its contract research organization, will conduct a retrospective study focused on patient and provider outcome-based metrics and quality of care related to MCED testing as part of the initiative.""HCA Healthcare and Sarah Cannon are aligned with GRAIL’s mission to improve the detection of cancer at earlier stages, when the chances of successful treatment are higher,"" said Jeffrey Venstrom, MD, chief medical officer at GRAIL. ""In addition to HCA Healthcare offering the Galleri test, the use of Sarah Cannon Cancer Institute’s nurse navigation program to support both patients and healthcare providers around MCED screening is the first of its kind. This program will provide critical insights about cancer detection and appropriate diagnostic follow-up.""Talk to your primary care physician to determine if Galleri may be right for you.

GRAIL is focused on alleviating the global burden of cancer by developing pioneering technology to detect and identify multiple deadly cancer types early. The company is using the power of next-generation sequencing, population-scale clinical studies, and state-of-the-art computer science and data science to enhance the scientific understanding of cancer biology, and to develop its multi-cancer early detection blood test. GRAIL is headquartered in Menlo Park, CA with locations in Washington, D.C., North Carolina, and the United Kingdom. GRAIL, LLC, is a subsidiary of Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) currently held separate from Illumina Inc. under the terms of the Interim Measures Order of the European Commission.For more information, visit grail.com.About Galleri®The earlier that cancer is detected, the higher the chance of successful outcomes. The Galleri multi-cancer early detection test can detect a signal shared by more than 50 types of cancer, as defined by the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual, through a routine blood draw. When a cancer signal is detected, the Galleri test predicts the cancer signal origin, or the tissue or organ associated with the cancer signal, with high accuracy to help guide the next steps to diagnosis. The Galleri test requires a prescription from a licensed health care provider and should be used in addition to recommended cancer screenings such as mammography, colonoscopy, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, or cervical cancer screening. It is recommended for use in adults with an elevated risk for cancer, such as those aged 50 or older.For more information about Galleri, visit galleri.com.Important Galleri Safety InformationThe Galleri test is recommended for use in adults with an elevated risk for cancer, such as those aged 50 or older. The Galleri test does not detect all cancers and should be used in addition to routine cancer screening tests recommended by a healthcare provider. Galleri is intended to detect cancer signals and predict where in the body the cancer signal is located. Use of Galleri is not recommended in individuals who are pregnant, 21 years old or younger, or undergoing active cancer treatment.Results should be interpreted by a healthcare provider in the context of medical history, clinical signs and symptoms. A test result of ""Cancer Signal Not Detected"" does not rule out cancer. A test result of ""Cancer Signal Detected"" requires confirmatory diagnostic evaluation by medically established procedures (e.g. imaging) to confirm cancer.If cancer is not confirmed with further testing, it could mean that cancer is not present or testing was insufficient to detect cancer, including due to the cancer being located in a different part of the body. False-positive (a cancer signal detected when cancer is not present) and false-negative (a cancer signal not detected when cancer is present) test results do occur. Rx only.Laboratory/Test InformationGRAIL’s clinical laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) and accredited by the College of American Pathologists. The Galleri test was developed, and its performance characteristics were determined by GRAIL. The Galleri test has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. GRAIL’s clinical laboratory is regulated under CLIA to perform high-complexity testing.

Mr. Solomon, you may begin your conference.Story continuesDavid SolomonThank you very much, and good morning, everybody. Thank you all for joining us. Before I start my prepared remarks, I'd just like to take a moment to address the horrific events in the Middle East. We condemn the terrorist attacks against Israel in the strongest possible terms and are heartbroken by the loss of so many innocent lives. This is clearly an extremely difficult and uncertain time for the region. And it's very concerning for many of us around the world. We obviously will continue to watch closely as this crisis unfolds.Earlier this month, I marked the end of my fifth year as the CEO of Goldman Sachs. I've never felt more optimistic about the firm, and our strategy has never been more clear. We operate two core businesses, our market-leading Global Banking &amp; Markets franchise and our growing Asset &amp; Wealth Management platform, both of which are being positioned to deliver mid-teen returns through the cycle. As I reflect on the past 5 years, much of what has always made Goldman Sachs extraordinary remains the same: long track record of being a trusted adviser to the world's leading businesses, institutions and individuals; a global broad and deep platform with capabilities that span across products, geographies and solutions; an aspirational brand; exceptional people; and a culture of collaboration and excellence.Additionally, over this time, we have evolved the organization by institutionalizing a One Goldman Sachs operating ethos. This approach, coupled with our best-in-class talent, advice and execution capabilities, has strengthened and solidified our leadership position across our businesses. As we sit here today, our client franchise is as strong as ever, enabling us to remain at the center of the most complex and important transactions for our clients.For example, the IPO market has started to reopen. Since Labor Day, there have been four marquee IPOs priced in the United States, ARM Holdings, Instacart, Klaviyo and BIRKENSTOCK. Goldman Sachs was lead left on three of those four and the joint lead bookrunner on the fourth. No other bank can make that claim. Being entrusted to help companies navigate the critical transition of coming to market required long-standing client relationships, deep market expertise and experience. Given the execution of these transactions, I'm encouraged by the prospect of a wider reopening of capital markets. If conditions remain conducive, I expect the continued recovery for both capital markets and strategic activity. As a leader in M&amp;A advisory and equity underwriting, a resurgence in activity would be a tailwind for Goldman Sachs.In Asset &amp; Wealth Management, our strategy is working as evidenced by the successes we've seen across our franchise. While some active asset managers have faced quarterly outflows over the last few years, we posted our 23rd consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based inflows. We generated record management and other fees of $2.4 billion and are well on our way of achieving our $10 billion annual target to 2024. We are also ahead of pace on our $2 billion target for alternative management fees. While a market-leading client franchise allows us to execute from a position of strength, we know we still have work ahead of us. Earlier this year at Investor Day, we laid out a clear set of goals to narrow our strategic focus. And we have made significant progress on these priorities. Most recently, we announced the sale of GreenSky. We also announced the sale of Personal Financial Management this summer. We sold substantially all of our Marcus loan portfolio. And we have reduced our historical principal investments by $9 billion this year. We are confident that the work we're doing now provides us a stronger platform to 2024 and beyond.As I assess the operating backdrop, the U.S. economy has proven to be more resilient than expected, though there are reasons to remain vigilant. Treasury rates have risen sharply over the past few months with 10-year yields up 75 basis points in the third quarter. On top of that, recent inflation and employment data has come in above estimates, driving market expectations of higher-for-longer interest rates. And there still are a number of sectors in the economy that have yet to absorb the impact of higher rates, especially in light of the further tightening in financial conditions we've seen over the last quarter.At the same time, there has been an escalation of geopolitical stresses around the globe, the war in Ukraine, ongoing tensions with China and now the conflict in the Middle East. Overall levels of risk are more elevated than we've seen in quite some time. While we don't know where this will all lead, it could impact economic growth and stability in the U.S. and around the world. And we remain cautiously positioned.Before I turn it over to Denis, I'd like to spend a moment on Basel III Endgame proposal and reiterate my views on it. We, of course, support sensible regulation and the desire to ensure we have a safe and sound financial system. There are some who have recently said we need to address the lessons from the 2008 financial crisis, which is driving the need for much higher regulations. But frankly speaking, the rules, as proposed, go way too far and do not account for the vast array of improvements made by the largest banks as a result of Dodd-Frank and other reforms. Not only have banks doubled capital over the last 15 years but have improved the quality of capital, increased liquidity, simplified businesses that have been subjected to ongoing annual stress tests. Requiring too much capital will have negative consequences. I believe if these rules are implemented, three things will happen. First, the cost of credit will go up for businesses of all sizes, from large corporations to small businesses. Second, more activity will move to the unregulated shadow banking sector. Policies that incentivize a transfer of risk outside the regulated banking system could, in fact, increase systemic risk. And third, U.S. competitiveness will go down. Our capital markets are the deepest and the most liquid in the world. They're the engine of our economy as access to capital allows innovation and growth across the country. Our competitive standing as the leading global economy would be negatively impacted by this proposal.The net result of these proposed rules would be slower economic growth in the U.S. and a material improvement in the soundness of the banking system. We, alongside clients and others in the industry, have been engaging heavily with our regulators and government stakeholders. And given this engagement, we expect that there will be ongoing debate and ultimately changes to the proposed rules. Though regulatory uncertainty and geopolitical risks remain top of mind, I feel very confident about the state of our client franchise and the long-term opportunities for Goldman Sachs. We are focused on the execution of our strategy to further strengthen our leading Global Banking &amp; Markets franchise and grow our Asset &amp; Wealth Management business. I feel good about the relative performance in our core business. And we remain firmly committed to delivering for clients and shareholders. I will now turn it over to Denis to cover financial results for the quarter.Denis P. ColemanThank you, David. Good morning. Let's start with our results on Page 1 of the presentation. In the third quarter, we generated net revenues of $11.8 billion and net earnings of $2.1 billion, resulting in an earnings per share of $5.47 and a return on equity of 7.1%. As David highlighted, earlier this year, we made the strategic decision to narrow our focus. And we made strong progress across a number of activities. We provide details on the financial impact related to these decisions in the selected items table. In aggregate, these items reduced net earnings by $828 million, EPS by $2.41 and our ROE by 3.1 percentage points.These items include results related to our historical principal investments within Asset &amp; Wealth Management, including the net impact of marks, sell-downs and CIE impairments as well as results relating to GreenSky, which includes the impact of our announced sale and ongoing operating results. Additionally, we highlight modest ongoing losses in connection with our residual markets portfolio and operating the PFM business.Turning to performance by segment, starting on Page 4. Global Banking &amp; Markets produced revenues of $8 billion in the third quarter. Advisory revenues of $831 million were down versus a strong prior year period amid lower completions. Equity underwriting revenues rose year-over-year to $308 million, though industry volumes remained well below medium- and longer-term averages. Debt underwriting revenues of $415 million also rose versus the third quarter of 2022. For the year-to-date, we ranked #1 in the league tables across announced and completed M&amp;A as well as equity underwriting and ranked #2 in high-yield debt. Our backlog fell quarter-on-quarter as we successfully brought transactions to market. Though market conditions are dynamic, client engagement continues to be elevated. And our best-in-class franchise remains well positioned to support the needs of our clients as they access the capital markets. FICC net revenues were $3.4 billion in the quarter, down from a strong performance last year, particularly in currency and commodities and up relative to the second quarter. We produced record FICC financing revenues of $730 million, which rose sequentially on better results within mortgages and structured products. Additionally, we were pleased to win the bids for two pools of Signature Bank's capital call facilities, totaling just over $15 billion in commitments that were held for auction by the FDIC in September.As we spoke about at our Investor Day, alternative asset managers are an attractive client set for us. And the purchase of this portfolio allows us to increase our connectivity with this client base, who we can serve even more holistically with our One Goldman Sachs approach. These activities also enable us to grow durable revenues at attractive risk-adjusted returns.Equities net revenues were $3 billion in the quarter. Equities intermediation revenues of $1.7 billion rose 7% year-over-year on better performance in derivatives while equities financing revenues of $1.2 billion were lower versus a record in quarter. Both financing revenues across FICC and equities were nearly $6 billion for the year-to-date, representing a record performance for these more durable activities. Our financing results, combined with the substantial share gains we've made since our first Investor Day, are the direct result of the successful execution of our stated strategic priorities for this business. We are raising the floor in Global Banking &amp; Markets as reflected by our year-to-date ROE of 13.4% despite muted activity levels across investment banking.Now moving to Asset &amp; Wealth Management on Page 5. Revenues of $3.2 billion were lower year-over-year, primarily driven by weaker results in equity investments. Management and other fees increased 7% year-over-year to a record $2.4 billion, largely driven by higher average assets under supervision. Private banking and lending revenues were $687 million, up slightly year-on-year, as higher deposit balances and spreads were offset by our sale of substantially all of the Marcus loan portfolio. We remain very focused on driving growth in the more durable revenue streams of management and other fees as well as private banking and lending, both of which generated record revenues for the year-to-date period.Equity investments generated net losses of $212 million, driven by markdowns on investments in commercial real estate. In aggregate, the losses from our historical principal investments as well as the results for Marcus loans negatively impacted our 6% pretax margin for the segment by 18 percentage points for the year-to-date.Now moving to Page 6. Total assets under supervision ended the quarter at $2.7 trillion. We saw $11 billion of liquidity inflows and $7 billion of long-term net inflows, representing our 23rd consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based inflows. Turning to Page 7 on alternatives. Alternative AUS totaled $267 billion at the end of the third quarter, driving $542 million of management and other fees for the quarter. Gross third-party fundraising was $15 billion for the quarter and $40 billion for the year-to-date. We were pleased to announce the close of Goldman Sachs Vintage Fund IX in the third quarter, our largest private equity secondaries fund and one of the largest in history at approximately $14 billion. Total third-party fundraising since our 2020 Investor Day is now $219 billion, putting us well on pace to hit our $225 billion target ahead of schedule.On-balance sheet alternative investments totaled approximately $49 billion, of which roughly $21 billion is related to our historical principal investment portfolio. In the third quarter, we reduced this portfolio by over $3 billion, bringing year-to-date reductions to $9 billion. We are on track to achieve our 2024 year-end target of a historical principal investment portfolio below $15 billion.Next, Platform Solutions on Page 8. Revenues were $578 million, including a $123 million revenue reduction related to the GreenSky loan book, which was more than offset by a $637 million associated reserve release as we moved the portfolio to held-for-sale. On Page 9, firm-wide net interest income was $1.5 billion in the third quarter, down sequentially as increased funding cost supported trading activities. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $178 billion, flat with the prior quarter. Our provision for credit losses was $7 million, which reflected net charge-offs in our credit card lending portfolio, offset by the reserve release I mentioned related to GreenSky. Additionally, within our wholesale portfolio, impairments were partially offset by a reserve reduction that was driven by increased stability in the macroeconomic environment versus the prior quarter.On Page 10, we provide additional detail on our CRE exposure similar to last quarter. CRE loans continue to represent a relatively small percentage of our overall lending book at 14%. CRE investments are diversified across geographies and positions with no single position representing more than 1% of the total on-balance sheet alternative investments. Across both equity investments and CIEs, we have marked or impaired office-related exposures by approximately 50% this year.Now turning to expenses on Page 11. Total quarterly operating expenses were $9.1 billion. Our year-to-date compensation ratio, net of provisions, is 34.5%, inclusive of approximately $275 million of year-to-date severance costs. At Investor Day in February, we articulated a goal of $600 million in run rate payroll efficiencies to be achieved in 2023 and 2024. And we are currently tracking to surpass that goal. These efficiencies allow us to reinvest in our highest-performing people, particularly as the market for top talent remains fiercely competitive.Quarterly non-compensation expense was $0.9 billion. The year-over-year increase in non-comp expenses was driven by the write-down of $506 million in intangibles related to GreenSky as well as CIE impairments of $358 million. While one-time expenses have been elevated for the year-to-date, we continue to focus on bringing down non-comp expenses and are making progress on our $400 million run rate efficiency goal. Our effective tax rate for the first 9 months of 2023 was 23.3%, higher versus the first half due to the write-off of deferred tax assets related to GreenSky and the geographic mix of our earnings. For the full year, we expect a tax rate of under 23%.Now on to Slide 12. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.8% at the end of the third quarter under the standardized approach, 180 basis points above our current capital requirement of 13%. In the quarter, we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchase of $1.5 billion and common stock dividends of $937 million. Given the uncertainty around the capital rules at this time, we expect to moderate fourth quarter share repurchases versus the third quarter. We remain committed to paying our shareholders a sustainable growing dividend and maintaining a competitive yield.In conclusion, our third quarter results reflect the ongoing narrowing of our strategic focus and the execution of our priorities, which will help drive our businesses to produce mid-teens returns through the cycle. We are confident in our ability to deliver for shareholders while continuing to support our clients and remain optimistic about the future opportunity set for Goldman Sachs. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.Glenn Paul SchorrI guess, just big picture, if we add back all the significant items in the quarter, we're obviously still well short of the mid-teens targets. I know this is super slow times, like decade-lows in investment banking, and you're in the process of hopefully reducing a lot of on-balance sheet stuff. So I wonder if you could help us bridge the gap from here to there. Because in the back of our mind, we also have the potentially up to 25% increase in the denominator. So I wonder if you could bridge the gap of like how much comes, do you think, from improvement in capital markets activity? How much is yet to be freed up capital from the denominator? I know it's tough, but I want to say high level, just (inaudible)David SolomonSure, Glenn, and appreciate the question. And so we'll keep it high level and let's separate into what we've got and then we can have a separate discussion about Basel III. But first, we are simplifying the firm and kind of managing the firm to drive us toward the overwhelming majority of the firm to be in two core businesses, our Global Banking &amp; Markets franchise, which is performing very well in an environment that's not a great environment for that business. Investment banking activities are well below 10-year norms. I don't think that will stay that way. But if you look at the performance of the business through 9 months, that business, which is kind of 70% of the firm, that is 2/3 or 70% of the firm, that business is operating with a 13.4% ROE in an environment that's not the best environment for that overall business. I can't tell you when the environment will get better, but I do believe that the capital markets and banking environment will improve in the coming years. History tells us that it doesn't stay closed for multiple years at a time.There is an adjustment. We're making the adjustment. Yes, the world is uncertain. As we mentioned, that could be a headwind. But I do think it will improve. And that business performs well. And we firmly believe that, that business is a mid-teens through-the-cycle business, the way we've materially grown our wallet shares, the way we've grown our financing footprint, which adds more balance to the business and with our market-leading franchises across that business.Second, we have the Asset &amp; Wealth Management business, which we believe is mid-teens or higher returns as we reduce the historical principal investments and make it a lower capital fund business. We're on that journey. I think you see us making progress. We've talked about how we've reduced the historical principal businesses -- the historical principal investments by $9 billion this year. We set a target for $15 billion by next year, which we'll meet, and then close to 0 2 years later. And so that business, we have a high degree of confidence we'll operate at mid-teens or higher as we reposition it. As we've also stated, we're reducing the drag in our platforms. We're narrowing the platforms and reducing the drag. And we're relatively confident that over the next 12 to 24 months, we'll make materially more progress in that. So you add that up with what we have, and I think you can get very comfortable with the mid-teens target.Now the Basel rules. The Basel rules, if they were implemented as they're positioned now, would be a headwind to that. But also, that doesn't account for how we'd optimize and how we'd pass through pricing. With these things (inaudible) not to say it won't be ahead, but I don't want to speculate on what it would do to our targets until we actually understand how it's coming through and what we can do across our businesses to appropriately manage it. So we continue to be very optimistic about our view to deliver meaningfully higher returns to our shareholders. And when there's more clarity on Basel, we're committed to giving you a clear picture of that view. But I wouldn't jump to a conclusion on it at this point, I'm not saying you are. I wouldn't jump to a conclusion on it at this point.Glenn Paul SchorrOkay, I appreciate that. One quickie follow-up on your prepared remarks. You mentioned a number of sectors that have yet to absorb the higher rates. I'm curious if you could give a little color either on which sectors or how meaningful that is. I'm thinking from more of the big-picture economy standpoint, but that caught my ear.David SolomonYes. Glenn, as I listen to you play it back, what I'd say, U.S. economy has been more resilient. The fiscal stimulus has helped mute the material tightening of monetary conditions that's occurred. I'm still of the belief that there's been a lag with this tightening. And across a broad swath of the economy, we will see more sluggishness. Now that doesn't necessarily mean it has to be a recession. And certainly, there's a good debate on where this all lands. But we again in the past quarter materially tightened economic conditions. And I just think there's a lag in most sectors of the economy, not all but most sectors of the economy.And I do think over the next 2 to 4 quarters, the impact of that tightening will be more evident and will create slowdowns in some areas. I am hearing, as I interact with CEOs, particularly around consumer businesses, some softness, particularly in the last 8 weeks in certain consumer behaviors. I don't want to overamplify that because I think the economy and the consumer has been more resilient. But I think that gears some watching closely.OperatorWe'll move to our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.Ebrahim Huseini PoonawalaI guess, maybe just one first follow-up, Denis. I just want to make sure I heard you correct. Did you say you marked your CRE exposure by 50% in CRE office? And on that, just give us a sense of visibility even beyond office CRE. Clearly, it's a very manageable issue for you. But it remains sort of a source of nuisance and earnings noise. How much more do we have to go before this is kind of pinned down?Denis P. ColemanSure. So yes, to clarify, for our CRE and CIE exposure in the office space, we've either marked or impaired that down by about approximately 50% this year. So that's -- I think that's quite significant. We started the year with about $15 billion of CRE alternative investments. That's been reduced now by about $5 billion. 3/4 of that was either through paydowns or dispositions, the balance through marks and impairments. So we're making very, very significant progress against those exposures.If you were to look at the same set of exposures in non-office, the adjustment there through marks or impairments is about 15% year-to-date. So we feel we've reduced a lot of notional, appropriately reflected the valuations in those positions. But as indicated by our targets, we intend to continue to move down those exposures.Ebrahim Huseini PoonawalaGot it. And I guess, just a separate question. I mean, I think the capital markets environment, it is what it is. When you look at the firm over the next year or 2, if maybe, David, where do you see the best growth opportunities? One, maybe talk about the client franchise and cap markets financing. Is that getting better or worse? And then there's a lot of talk about private credit, direct lending. You've talked about credit being an opportunity. Just give us a sense of could that be a meaningful source of growth as we think about the next year or 2?David SolomonSure. So in our Global Banking &amp; Markets franchise, we still believe that we have opportunities with our focus on our execution to continue to grow our wallet share. We expanded our focus from the top 100 accounts to the top 150 accounts. And we also are expanding the granularity that we look at our accounts from the position of 1, 2 or 3 as opposed to just top 3. And so we still do see some wallet share opportunities, but we obviously have a very strong wallet share. So that's not most significant.We are growing our financing for our Global Banking &amp; Markets franchise. And we expect to continue to grow that financing footprint. And we have a plan to continue to put more financial resources toward growing that financing footprint. And we do think that it has reasonable returns. And it also creates a virtuous cycle for our client franchise in terms of our overall wallet share because we're a significant financer with them.When you turn to Asset &amp; Wealth Management, I think we've been very clear at our Investor Day, and Marc stated this, that we think we can grow the revenues in that business by high single digits. That is driven by our continued growth in management fees over time and the continued growth in the wealth management sector, where we are experiencing good growth, and we still see good opportunities in wealth management to grow the franchise all over the world. And we've made continued good progress on that journey.When you talk about private credit, we have, as you know, over $100 billion of private credit. We've launched private credit vehicles. We obviously have a very powerful ecosystem when you look at Global Banking &amp; Markets. And what we do with financing, which we think can also be an Asset &amp; Wealth Management opportunity for growth in private credit, but we would expect significant opportunity for the growth in private credit as a part of the overall growth of our Asset &amp; Wealth Management franchise. So those are a handful of things I'd highlight at this point.OperatorWe'll move to our next question from Christian Bolu with Autonomous Research.Chinedu BoluJust another one on Basel III Endgame, appreciate that you think it's going to change and all that. But now that you've had a chance to digest the actual proposal as is, any more color on how you think it affects the competitiveness of your markets businesses? Are there any particular businesses that are more or less impacted? And then maybe give us some color on potential mitigation actions.David SolomonSure, Christian. I appreciate it. I mean, I'm going to talk very high level because again, this is all fluid. But obviously, if these rules went in place the way they're proposed, they would have an effect on the businesses. But it's different from business-to-business. There are certain activities that would meaningfully impact end users, whether they're corporates or individuals, where it would be obvious that you'd pass on cost. A corporation that wants to hedge and comes to us and we sit opposite in an uncollateralized derivative, I can't imagine that their desire to hedge won't still continue even if the cost of that hedge is higher. Obviously, at some balance, they would think about that differently.There are certain businesses where we might reduce our activity level because with the new Basel rules, the returns don't look attractive. But there are others, and the one I'd point to that's most obvious, which by the way, a significant part of the impact to us would be, is prime, okay? There aren't a lot of alternatives for big institutions in the prime business. There are very few in Europe, a little bit. And obviously, the Europeans, if this was implemented this way, would have an advantage. But at the end of the day, there are a handful of scaled players. There are lots of scaled institutions that need that service.Our belief is we'd be able to optimize and pass on pricing in a reasonable way. We'd have to look at the final rules. We'd have to adjust. So it will affect behavior. It will affect pricing. It will affect optimization. But I know everybody wants to jump to the clear answer. I think you need to see the rules and then institutions and end users need to adapt to the new reality, whatever it is. And it's not binary that it only affects us or others in the industry that are obviously in the process of working through that as we have in the past.Chinedu BoluThat's helpful. Maybe a question on the platform businesses here. I just have a two-part question. I guess, firstly, maybe just update us on how you're thinking about the partnership with Apple. Can the economics work for Goldman in the current states? Or does it make sense to further think about disposing of that partnership? And then the second question is more on the credit quality in your senior credit cards. Kind of what are you seeing in terms of credit quality in that portfolio? How does it compare to your expectations and the broader sort of credit card industry?David SolomonAll right. I'll start on the first part and Denis will make some comments on credit and the portfolio. First, I think we hired a gentleman, Bill Johnson, who's got decades of experience, to help us better optimize the credit card portfolio -- the credit card partnerships. As we've stated to you a number of times, and I'll repeat it here very clearly, we've worked to narrow our focus. You've seen us execute around Marcus loans and GreenSky. Our partnerships with Apple and GM are long-term contracts. And we don't have the unilateral right to exit those partnerships.So our focus at the moment is on managing them better, getting rid of the drag and bringing them to profitability. And we're making progress both in the way we run them and against the cost base that we put against them. And Bill Johnson joining is helping with all that. We'll continue as we go forward to work constructively with our partners and examine what's best in the long run for Goldman Sachs. But our core focus is on reducing the drag over the course of the next 12 to 24 months and ensuring we operate them better. Denis, do you want to comment a little bit on the credit quality that we're seeing?Denis P. ColemanSure. What I'd add is we obviously remain very focused on the overall credit quality of the portfolio. A couple of things to bear in mind. In Consumer, the net charge-off ratio for the quarter was 5.1%, down from 5.8% last quarter. And the total dollar amount of charge-offs is down as well. You'll also see that our coverage ratio now stands at 13.3%, which we think is an appropriate level, given our expectations for the portfolio.That adjustment is basically a function of GreenSky being removed from that ratio. And so now that applies to the cards portfolio. But we feel good about where that stands right now. On the overall performance of credit on the forward, we'll continue to be focused. We made a number of adjustments to our credit underwriting box. And we'll continue to monitor that as we move through the economic environment.OperatorWe'll move to our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.Steven Joseph ChubakSo David, you had alluded to increased competition for talent driving some pressure on expenses. I was hoping you could just speak to the commitment to deliver on the 60% efficiency goal. And maybe more specifically, given changes in revenue mix, some recently announced business exits and the heightened competition you cited, how that's going to impact your ability to deliver on that 60%, if at all.David SolomonYes. So we continue to be committed to the 60% efficiency ratio. But as you know, we're moving through -- we're narrowing our focus. We're moving through some things that we're trying to create more transparency on, Steven, and highlight for you. I'm going to turn to Denis to make sure that we get the number right. But ex those one-off items, the efficiency ratio for the quarter would have been?Denis P. ColemanAbout [64.6%].David SolomonOkay. So putting it in perspective, I think it's important to highlight that we don't think the things that we're highlighting continue in perpetuity. We're trying to narrow the focus. And when we look at our Global Banking &amp; Markets business and our Asset &amp; Wealth Management platform, we think we have the right target. Now back to your point, Steve, about competition. The competition for talent, especially the best talent, remains very, very strong. And so we think we've got a very, very good talent ecosystem. I feel good about the hiring we're doing. I'd just highlight that for our analyst jobs out in universities, we had 260,000 applications for approximately 2,600 jobs. There are over 1 million applications for employment at Goldman Sachs last year, very, very aspirational and desirous place to work. But the competition for talent remains high. And so we'll strike the right balance and making an investment in our talent. You heard Denis talk about some of our efficiencies and the fact that the efficiencies allow us to make a reinvestment in some of the best talents. We feel good about where we are. But we also believe that as we continue to execute on our strategy, which narrows our focus and keeps us focused on our two core businesses of Global Banking &amp; Markets and Asset &amp; Wealth Management, that the efficiency ratio target that we're hiring -- that we're highlighting over the next few years is a reasonable target.Steven Joseph ChubakThat's great color. And just for my follow-up, a broader question on the sponsor outlook. Alts fundraising, it's continued at a healthy clip. But PE is facing numerous headwinds, whether it's the LP denominator effect, higher rates and just slower realization activity in general. I was hoping you could speak to the broader outlook for the sponsor business and the implications for both the sponsor banking activity as well as the alternative asset management business.David SolomonSure. So that broadly defined sponsor community, Steven, which really is the broad alternatives world, private capital world, the first thing I'd just say is we believe strongly that there's still a very, very long-term secular growth trend that is intact and will continue. I think there's some very, very interesting macro dynamics. I believe there's over $70 trillion of assets held by baby boomers that sometime in the next 20 years either will be passed on to a younger generation for aggressive investment, will go to taxes or will go to charitable foundations, by the way, charitable foundations, who also invest. So there's a very, very strong dynamic of good flows and a shift, especially given the size of the public markets, into private asset classes. And so we believe that's firmly intact. There's no question that the capital raising environment is more muted than it's been. I would say it was extraordinarily robust in 2020 and 2021 and very, very robust in an environment where monetary policy was incredibly accommodative. But there's no question that all of this investing can be successful as new vintages and a new reset environment are opened up, even if rates are higher and they operate higher. The one thing I know about the sponsor community is they generally make money by selling assets. And the sponsor community owns an enormous portfolio of businesses. And they also make money when they buy new assets. They obviously have to buy new assets at different valuations with different financing costs now. And what I'd say is for the last 6 quarters, the last 1.5 years, that community has been very quiet. In our dialogue, they are starting to see more interesting opportunities. And I would expect in the next 12 to 24 months, the level of activity in the sponsor community will increase again, both in terms of sales, it's one of the reasons why I'm optimistic on capital markets and our advisory activities we look forward over the course of the next 4 to 8 quarters, but also in terms of new purchases. I'm not suggesting that it will go back to where it was in 2021. That would not be the normal. But if you look at kind of 10-year historical averages and the percentage of investment banking activity the sponsor activity would make up, I would expect that you'll see us go back to those averages. And at the moment, we're well below those averages at the current point in time.OperatorOur next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.Brennan HawkenI'd love to start on expenses and comp. And David, you just spoke a little to this when answering Steven's question. But the comp ratio, we saw revenue growth broadly quarter-over-quarter and yet the comp ratio ticked up, which is rather unusual for Goldman. Denis, I know you layered in that there was nearly $300 million of severance year-to-date. Was some of that in the third quarter? Or was there any unusual items impacting the comp ratio? Or was this mostly just because of the competition for talent?Denis P. ColemanSo in terms of third quarter, it was very, very small. We previously disclosed $260 million of severance. So there's a small amount of severance in the quarter. We just think it's important to continue to call that out and highlight it, so you can track that over the course of the year. That obviously rolls into our overall ratio in terms of what we're thinking for the full year. And we made the adjustment to the comp ratio in the third quarter based on what our expectations are for year-end performance as well as what we expect to pay our people. And we're looking at the entire composition (inaudible) and being mindful that we continue to pay for performance but also recognizing, in particular across our core businesses, we have leading market shares in Global Banking &amp; Markets, record year-to-date financing activity, record management fees year-to-date, record private banking and lending activities year-to-date. And these are the bedrocks of our business for the foreseeable future. And we think it's important that we continue to recognize and retain the talent associated with those businesses that are going to unlock our mid-teens returns in the future.Brennan HawkenOkay. And then when you're thinking about -- thanks for all the color on the CRE and the exposures. When you're thinking about these historical principal investments that you're intending to continue to sell by the end of next year, what portion of those are CRE or CRE-related? Is it possible to give any color around the assets that you're looking to sell and how exposed they are to CRE or other sectors?Denis P. ColemanSure. So I made a comment earlier. If you look at aggregate CRE-related on-balance sheet investments and you look across asset classes like loans, debt securities, equity securities and remaining exposure of equity in our CIE portfolio, that, in aggregate, now stands at a little bit under $10 billion, $9.7 billion, and down already $5 billion year-to-date. There are portions of some of those exposures that relate to our firm-wide activities, our CRA obligations and some co-invest exposures. If you look at the -- in aggregate, about 43% of the CRE on-balance sheet investments is HPI. And that's what we're looking to sell down over time.OperatorWe'll move to our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.Michael Lawrence MayoThe pivot is not new, it's been advertised. I guess, what's new is the actual losses. So looking back, who is accountable? And who pays the price for the losses with GreenSky, the Marcus loans and a consumer expansion strategy that was wider than you want it to be now? And then looking ahead, once you eliminate what you want to eliminate both on the consumer side and principal investments, how much would that alone improve ROE?David SolomonThanks, Mike, appreciate the question. The leadership of the firm, which includes myself and the other senior leadership, are responsible for everything that happens here and everything that we do for our shareholders and for our people. So obviously, we're responsible and accountable for any decision that we make. I've said publicly before that I'm happy that we pivoted. As you say, the pivot is not new. We've made the pivot. We said we were going to do certain things. With hindsight, you'll do certain things differently. We obviously reflect. We learn from the things that we do. But I think it's important for companies to try things, for companies to learn and adapt. When you make a decision that you think is the wrong decision for shareholders and the firm, you adjust accordingly. So we're doing that and we're moving forward. The second part of the question was?Michael Lawrence MayoHow much does ROE improve simply by discarding of your extra principal investments and the remaining consumer businesses you want to get rid of?David SolomonWell, I think we've given you a bunch of transparency, Mike, just looking at this. But if you look at what created a drag to ROE this quarter, 75% of the drag to ROE this quarter were the impairments and the [marked] accounts on the historical principal investments. And if you look over the last few quarters, the most significant impact on ROE performance has been the historical principal investments. Now also, there were benefits from those historical principal investments historically. But in this environment, obviously, you don't see that. We think it's a better business to release that capital and run a fund business, a lower capital fund business. And so we're driving that. I think earlier in the call, we talked about the through-the-cycle performance of the banking and markets business. You can see the banking and markets ROE right now and also the forward ROE of the Asset &amp; Wealth Management business with less capital in it. The drag from the platforms is getting smaller. And over the next 12 to 24 months, it will get smaller, too, hopefully eradicated. And so that will give you a cleaner ROE that we continue to believe can be mid-teens through the cycle.Michael Lawrence MayoAnd then what is your ability and appetite for more buybacks? Basel III, of course. But to the extent that you're discarding of the principal investments that theoretically should free up more capital for either buybacks or reinvestment elsewhere, kind of what are your plans and what are your limitations?David SolomonYes. So I think Denis highlighted this in the prepared remarks. We've built a pretty big cushion and buffer, given that we successfully reduced our SCB based on actions we're taking. We think that under the stress test, as we continue to reduce principal investments, we will have more benefit to SCB. Now obviously, Basel is out there and it's uncertain, so we're, at the moment, operating a little bit more conservatively around that. And we've highlighted that we probably will be a little bit more conservative on buybacks until we have more clarity. But we will continue to buy back stock. We will continue to pay our dividend.And as we have clarity under this strategy, there should be meaningfully more capital release, which should ultimately benefit to further buyback. But at the moment, we'd like -- we're going to be a little bit more cautious and we'll have a little bit more clarity around the capital rules before we plow ahead.OperatorWe'll move to our next question from Ryan Kenny with Morgan Stanley.Ryan Michael KennySo wanted to follow up on the earlier questions on markets, maybe asked another way. So trading revenues are clearly extremely strong. Industry wallet in both fixed income and equities is tracking well above pre-pandemic levels, and you've been taking share. But looking forward, is there any scenario related to Basel Endgame where we see industry wallet size shrink? And as you think about higher-for-longer rates, how do you expect that, that impacts the various trading businesses?David SolomonLook, I think the intermediation activity for large institutions and corporations and governments around the world continues. The growth of government (inaudible) world, it continues. The market capital world continues to grow and expand. I can't and I won't speculate on exactly where the final Basel rules wind up and how everyone optimizes through all that. But I don't think anything is changing in intermediation. And the need to finance the positions and the activities of so many of our clients is growing. And so I continue to think for leading players that have scale and global footprint and are in a leading position in these markets businesses, I think they're very well positioned in these market businesses. Of course, there will be ups and downs in those businesses. But I think the businesses will continue to perform very, very well.OperatorOur next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.Devin Patrick RyanWant to come back to wealth management. I know that the sale of Personal Financial Management is a small business. But just if you can remind us how and where you want to compete in wealth management moving forward. And David, maybe give a little more color on some of those growth opportunities you alluded to that you're seeing there across the globe.David SolomonYes. So I appreciate that question, Devin. Our focus is on ultra-high-net-worth management, where we have a leading franchise. I just highlight that ultra-high-net-worth management -- high-net-worth wealth management is still a very fragmented business. And while we have a leading franchise, leading franchise is kind of mid-single-digit share. And we have less share than that in places like Europe around the world. We've seen really good growth in Europe. We see continued growth in the U.S. We have an ability, as we put more resources on the ground and invest in more resources to cover clients, to continue to grow that business. We've seen good growth over the last 5 years. I think we have (inaudible) run rate room to do that. One of the decisions we made, and again, this is on focus and kind of a lesson learned, is by selling United Capital and selling PFM, which was a small business, as you highlight, it allows us to take the resources and the investment we might have geared towards growing that and add it to our investment in ultra-high-net-worth growth. And we think that's a better-returning business and something we're very confident that we can continue to execute on.Devin Patrick RyanOkay, terrific. And then just a quick follow-up. So the $15 billion capital call facilities with Signature Bank, it sounds like you think that could help gain share with alternative asset managers. And you framed out obviously why that's such an important customer base for Goldman Sachs. So if you can, maybe just give a little flavor for how that's going to help drive market share and how you think about where you sit with sponsorships, given how important they are as a customer for Wall Street, whether you have any sense of like where you are in the top 3 or where you can go from 3 to #1, or just any flavor for where your market share opportunities exist there.David SolomonSure. We have -- in traditional investment banking services, we have leading share with sponsors across M&amp;A and leveraged finance. These capital facilities are key to the way they operate their business. And while we've been in the business of capital facilities, it is an area of growth for us, an area of lending growth for us. One of the things that was interesting about these portfolios is the portfolios bring a series of new clients to us where we haven't been a lender and we haven't been engaged in this activity. And it gives us an attachment to them.So this was an opportunity to expand an activity that we run meaningfully. Again, and I made this comment when we were talking about the Global Banking &amp; Markets business, financing your clients strengthens your overall position with them because the financing is important to them. And so as we continue to finance sponsors, I think it strengthens an already very strong position with the sponsor community.OperatorAnd we'll move to our next question from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.Daniel Thomas FannonI had a question on Platform Solutions. So for the quarter, if we exclude the write-down, is this a reasonable run rate for expenses? And as you think about achieving your target of profitability in this business, is this going to come more from the expense side or revenue growth? And if you could also just give an outlook for transaction banking, just given revenues are down both sequentially and year-over-year.Denis P. ColemanSure. Thank you for the question. I don't think it's the right run rate. I think there's a combination of things that we expect over the next 12 months in terms of growth in revenue, composition of the clients as well as ongoing efficiency with respect to expenses. So I think we should be outperforming any type of run rate analysis. I think on transaction banking, we've tried to explain the strategic focus for us for that business, which is to grow a higher-quality client business over the long term. We had grown quickly. We're now focused on growing with high-quality clients, high-quality deposits. As you note, the revenues and the deposit balances were down slightly sequentially, I think, reasonably in line with the industry, given some migration to other higher-yielding opportunity sets. But we did grow our client count. We remain committed to the business. And we think that it works very well with our overall investment banking franchise and footprint. And we think it could be a good value unlock over the longer term for Goldman Sachs.Daniel Thomas FannonAnd as a follow-up, you mentioned in terms of alternatives and the fundraising, the private equity challenges. But maybe if you could talk broadly about fundraising and some of the bigger funds maybe that you're in the market with today. And then also, as you think about the maturity of the business broadly within alternatives, how are you thinking about the contribution of incentive fees going forward? And when should we start to see those become a more material component of the overall revenue profile?Denis P. ColemanSo on the alternative space, our fundraising activity, $15 billion in the quarter, $40 billion year-to-date, has been broad-based. We have a broad-based platform. We have mentioned the secondaries fund. David covered some of the private credit spaces. These are big areas of interest for our clients around the world. They're particularly relevant. We expect to continue to invest in those platforms as well as across the platform more broadly.Incentive fees come through as we get to the end of funds, we're in a position to start to distribute carry. So incentive fees will be lumpy. It will depend on the performance of different funds. But we expect that there will be more incentive fees next year and beyond. When we laid out at Investor Day the building blocks for our performance in the segment, we put on the page, not only the top line target information that David covered earlier but also estimated incentive fees sort of on an annual basis. So I think that's a source of upside for us.OperatorWe'll move to our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.Gerard Sean CassidyDavid, in the past, you -- and you talked about the IPOs, the four that you guys were very involved with this quarter. But in the past, you talked about green shoots. And part of it was the convincing of private equity owners or companies that were owned by private equity that if they wanted to go public, they're going to have to recognize that the valuations today are far below where they were in 2021 at the peak of the cycle. Are you finding those conversations easier today? Are you finding more people are recognizing that's correct and if they want to go public, they just had to accept it?David SolomonYes. I mean, I appreciate the question, Gerard. I think absolutely, they're easier. And if you look at a handful of the companies that have gone public, you can look at their private market valuations 2 years ago versus the valuation now. But I don't think those discussions are difficult. I think those discussions have a real sense of realism in them. And I think there are a number of companies that recognize the new environment and are focused on what they have to do to advance themselves strategically.Denis P. ColemanAnd Gerard, I'd just add, it's actually especially helpful to have numerous real data points in the market, both (inaudible) space for equities and across the leveraged finance space. So the conversations that we're having with our clients now, who are looking to access the markets, they're informed by our leading role and insights into most of the activity that's been accomplished in the last several weeks. And so I think that is an incremental source of our optimism that we have those data points and that insight to share with clients and advise them on how and when they can get to market and what types of terms and pricing.Gerard Sean CassidyOkay, very helpful. And then as a follow-up, it's not a big line item obviously for you folks. But can you share with us some of the color in the transaction banking area? That was obviously a new business line that you guys created. Just how is it going? I saw the revenues were down slightly, I think, sequentially. But what's going on in that line of business? And again, granted, it's not a major line of business for you folks at this time.Denis P. ColemanSure. No. Thanks, Gerard. Our transaction banking activity remains a strategic focus. The revenues and the deposit balances are down slightly on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Those things are linked. We have grown our client count. And we remain committed to making the investments to grow high-quality balances and clients in that business over the medium to long term, no change in strategy.OperatorOur next question comes from Saul Martinez with HSBC.Saul MartinezI wanted to drill down a little bit more on Platform Solutions. I think, Denis, you mentioned that this quarter isn't necessarily a great run rate for expenses or revenues. But even this quarter, if I adjust for the loan markdown and the impairment, it seems like you are -- if my math is correct, you are PPNR positive. Obviously, credit costs are high, the credit card book is seasoning and you're still growing that portfolio. But if you can just help us parse through some of the moving parts and help us understand the glide path to getting back to -- or getting to close to breakeven or breakeven over the next, say, 24 months?Denis P. ColemanSure. Thanks, Saul. So just a couple of things on glide path to help with the question and the context, so rate of growth is important in a business like this that's been growing very, very quickly and obviously taking provisions in line with CECL. We expect the growth rate for that activity has been slowing and could slow further. And that has some positive impacts. And then as David mentioned, we made a strategic hire of a very seasoned industry professional. I mean, we're working very, very closely with him on the overall operations of our platform. We remain in discussions with our card partners and working carefully to improve the overall efficiency for the platforms for our clients and for Goldman Sachs. I think it's a combination of the way we're going to grow on the forward combined with how we manage the expense and the operating efficiency.Saul MartinezOkay, that's helpful. And just maybe a quick follow-up there. I think you mentioned that NCOs, net charge-offs, were down this quarter. Is that -- and you do have a 13.3% reserve coverage. It does seem like you're maybe closer to a scenario where provisioning to come down quite a bit, especially under CECL. But just maybe just give us a sense of how you're feeling about the credit outlook. And is my assessment right that your reserving could -- especially if you slow down, it could come down pretty materially over the next year to 2 years?Denis P. ColemanSo you have a couple of facts that are right. We did have a charge-off ratio that was down sequentially quarter-over-quarter from 5.8% to 5.1% and lower charge-offs. We are not necessarily depicting that's the ongoing path for credit in the consumer portfolio. It's something we're still mindful of, given the environment, given the vintages in which we've originated those exposures. We do feel that the coverage ratio at 13.3% is appropriate. And we obviously set that based on our expected life of loan losses. So as we move forward, our expectation is we'll continue to see elevated charge-offs. And as you look at our reporting on that, with GreenSky pulled out of the consumer line, you'll have a more pure look at the cards platform. And we do expect that will show elevated charge-offs.OperatorFor our next question, we'll return to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.Michael Lawrence MayoJust a clarification on my prior question. So if I have this right, you reduced your PE investments by $3 billion quarter-over-quarter. And that allowed a $2.5 billion reduction in capital allocated to the Asset &amp; Wealth Management segment. I mean, is that completely correlated? So if you get rid of the $21 billion of remaining principal investments, does that free up, say, $16 billion? Is that ballpark right?Denis P. ColemanNo. Mike, I think when we started talking about the reduction of our historical principal investments over time, we gave a number of about $9 billion of capital release for the entire portfolio. So I don't think -- I'd be happy to get on with you and sort of work through your numbers. But I don't think we have $16 billion incremental on the forward, significantly less than that.Michael Lawrence MayoSo how much do you have left? Once you discard the $21 billion that remains, how much capital should be freed up?Denis P. ColemanI mean, on a year-to-date basis, based on the activity that we've undertaken, that's a release of about $2 billion, to give you a sense. So we probably have remaining mid-single digits.Michael Lawrence MayoOkay. And as far as the comp ratio, should we consider these one-time charges as part of comp? Or would that be excluded when we think about our models?Denis P. ColemanSo we obviously have to include it for the purpose of the comp ratio accrual. We do think of them as more one-time in nature. We, as you know, did a headcount reduction earlier in this year. That's not our current expectation to repeat that. If anything, we think that the work we've done to rightsize the firm is something that puts us in a position to now make more selective investments in our headcount on the forward. So we don't expect that type of severance to repeat itself. And we are taking into account, as we set the compensation ratio, that severance payments is obviously not available to pay those employees that remain with the firm. We're very focused on retaining to continue to drive the franchise.OperatorAt this time, there are no further questions. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.]"

HES, and Ryder System R. All three sport a positive Zacks Earnings ESP Score.Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) finds companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity.The idea is that more recent information is generally more accurate and can better predict the future, giving investors an advantage in earnings season.Let’s take a closer look at each.Hess Corp. Hess is a globally integrated energy company engaging in the exploration, production, development, transportation, purchase, and sale of crude oil and natural gas liquids. Analysts have taken their expectations well higher for the release, with the $1.31 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate up 30% since July of this year. Hess will report on October 25th before the market’s open.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company has consistently exceeded earnings expectations as of late, beating the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate in seven consecutive quarters. Still, it’s worth noting that top line performance has left some to be desired, as Hess has missed revenue expectations in back-to-back releases.As we can see below, the company’s quarterly releases have regularly brought volatility, seeing buying pressure following the most recent release.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, we expect the company to post $2.6 billion in revenue, reflecting a 20% pullback from year-ago sales of $3.2 billion. The quarterly estimate has narrowly moved lower since July, down a fractional 0.4%.Packaging Corporation of AmericaPackaging Corporation of America is the third largest producer of containerboard products and a leading producer of uncoated freesheet paper in North America. Analysts have primarily left their earnings expectations unchanged since July, with the $1.92 per share consensus estimate down a penny. PKG will report on October 23rd after the market’s close.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe story is primarily the same regarding top line expectations, with the $1.9 billion quarterly revenue estimate down 0.4% since July and reflecting a pullback of 8% from year-ago sales of $2.1 billion. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.As we can see, sales have eclipsed pre-pandemic levels.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLike HES, Packaging Corporations’ quarterly releases have brought volatility to shares, seeing both positive and negative reactions post-earnings in 2023.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRyder SystemRyder System is a leading logistics and transportation company providing supply chain, dedicated transportation, and fleet management solutions.

This particular fund, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the Northern Trust Quality Dividend Index.The Northern Trust Quality Dividend Index is designed to provide exposure to a high-quality income-oriented portfolio of long-only U.S. equity securities, with an emphasis on long-term capital growth and a targeted overall beta that is similar to that of the Northern Trust 1250 Index and the Index are selected based on expected dividend payment and fundamental factors.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesInvestors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.Story continuesAnnual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.37%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.It's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 2.25%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.For QDF, it has heaviest allocation in the Information Technology sector --about 30.50% of the portfolio --while Financials and Healthcare round out the top three.Taking into account individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 9.45% of the fund's total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp Common Stock Usd 0.00000625 (MSFT) and Procter &amp;no.38; Gamble Co/the Common Stock Usd 0 (PG).The top 10 holdings account for about 34.12% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskYear-to-date, the FlexShares Quality Dividend ETF return is roughly 9.97% so far, and is up about 18.31% over the last 12 months (as of 10/18/2023). QDF has traded between $48.75 and $60.11 in this past 52-week period.The fund has a beta of 0.98 and standard deviation of 16.18% for the trailing three-year period, which makes QDF a medium risk choice in this particular space. With about 143 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesFlexShares Quality Dividend ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - All Cap Blend segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.IShares Core S&amp;P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF (ITOT) tracks S&amp;P Total Market Index and the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) tracks CRSP US Total Market Index. IShares Core S&amp;P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF has $44.45 billion in assets, Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF has $309.77 billion. ITOT has an expense ratio of 0.03% and VTI charges 0.03%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box - All Cap Blend.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

145,29a3669c-26cd-37bc-9aca-dece06194163,NTRS,2023-10-18,Northern Trust (NTRS) to Post Q3 Earnings: What to Expect?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/northern-trust-ntrs-post-q3-133200305.html,1697549520,STORY,['NTRS'],"[Northern Trust Corporation’s NTRS third-quarter 2023 results are scheduled to be released on Oct 18, before market open. The company’s revenues and earnings are expected to have declined from the year-ago reported levels.In the last reported quarter, NTRS’ earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were aided by a rise in net interest income (NII), driven by higher rates. An improvement in credit quality was another positive in the second quarter. However, a rising expense base and lower fee income were headwinds.Northern Trust has a mixed earnings surprise history. Its earnings missed estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, met once and surpassed once, the negative surprise being 0.03%, on average.Northern Trust Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Northern Trust Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseNorthern Trust Corporation price-eps-surprise | Northern Trust Corporation QuoteNTRS’ activities in the to-be-reported quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ optimism. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings of $1.50 per share has moved marginally downward in the past week. The figure indicates a decline of 16.7% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.72 billion, suggesting a decrease of 1.9% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.Key Factors &amp; Estimates for Q3Loans &amp; NII: The lending scenario was subdued for the quarter under review on higher interest rates and an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. Specifically, demand for commercial and industrial loans stayed muted in the third quarter, per the Fed’s latest data. Moreover, demand for commercial real estate loans declined in the quarter under review from the second-quarter end.Hence, a weaker lending environment is likely to have affected average interest-earning assets.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $133.17 billion for average earning assets indicates a marginal sequential decline.Story continuesFederal Reserve raised interest rates by another 25 basis points in the quarter under review. Thus, the policy rate reached 5-5.25% in July 2023, marking the 11th time FOMC has hiked interest rates in a tightening process that began in March 2022.In September, the rate hike was paused. With this, interest rates reached 5.25-5.5% in the third quarter, marking the highest level in around 22 years.Despite the high interest rate environment, softer loan demand and rising funding costs are anticipated to have negatively impacted NII in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII is pegged at $460 million, implying a sequential decline of 10.2%.Fee Income: Northern Trust uses a lag effect to calculate its asset servicing fees and wealth management servicing fees, i.e., computations are based on the prior-quarter end valuations.Asset servicing fees comprise custody and fund administration, investment management, securities lending, and other fees.The favorable equity market performance in the second quarter is likely to have led to an improvement in custody and fund administration, and investment management fees for NTRS in the third quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for custody and fund administration, and investment management fees is pegged at $433 million and $139 million, suggesting sequential increases of 1.4% and 3.7%, respectively.The consensus estimate for asset servicing fees is pegged at $632 million, indicating a 1.8% sequential rise.The consensus mark for wealth management servicing fees is pegged at $486 million, implying sequential growth of 2.3%.The consensus estimate for consolidated trust, investment and other servicing fees is pegged at $1.1 billion, suggesting a 2% sequential rise.In the third quarter, lower volatility in foreign exchange (FX) markets and decreased client activity are likely to have adversely impacted NTRS’s FX trading income. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at $48.2 million, indicating a 3.5% sequential decrease.The consensus estimate for total fee income is pegged at $1.26 billion, indicating a 1.1% rise from the prior quarter’s reported figure.Expenses: Northern Trust’s expenses are expected to have been high in the third quarter on rising compensation, and equipment and software expenses. Moreover, general inflationary pressures are likely to have inflated costs, whereas wage inflation is anticipated to have escalated personnel expenses.What Does the Zacks Model Say?Our proven Zacks model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Northern Trust this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

We have also covered a detailed discussion on the importance of recruiting the right people for the right place and some noteworthy examples. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Skills Employers Look For in Candidates. Recruiting the right people for the right company is paramount in the business world. After all, an organization's success hinges on its ability to assemble a team of talented individuals who can drive innovation and meet its strategic objectives. It is worth emphasizing that a single bad hire can cost a company an average of $15,000. Hence, finding the ideal candidates is a task that goes beyond simply assessing qualifications and experience; it's about identifying individuals with the skills and qualities that align with the company's culture, vision, and future goals. A survey by technology company ThriveMap found that 96% of HR leaders prioritize cultural fit when hiring. Over 75% of companies rely on gut feeling during candidate assessments. 92% of organizations use structured interview questions, and nearly two-thirds implement specific competency questions to improve their hiring for cultural fit. However, most importantly, hiring failures are attributed to cultural mismatches in 89% of cases.Hence, recruitment is about selecting the best candidates according to the workplace environment. To read more about the best workplace environments, check out our article about the best companies to work for in 2023. However, to understand the significance of this environment, we can look at some well-known companies that have left a mark on history with their incredibly smart hiring decisions.For example, hiring Andy Jassy in 1997 proved to be an extraordinary decision for Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Under his leadership, Amazon Web Services (AWS) was conceptualized in 2003 and launched in 2006. Initially comprising a modest team of 57 people, AWS became a colossal success, generating billions in revenue annually. Jassy's remarkable contributions to AWS, valued at billions of greenback, were further emphasized by his promotion to AWS CEO in 2016. As CEO, he played a pertinent role in the company's growth and success. His extraordinary performance was rewarded with a ten-year compensation package of $212.7 million. Story continuesSpeaking of Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), in the second quarter, their net sales increased 11% to $134.4 billion from $121.2 billion in 2022, excluding a $0.3 billion forex impact. Notably, North America segment sales increased 11% to $82.5 billion, while International segment sales increased 10% to $29.7 billion. AWS segment sales also saw growth, up 12% to $22.1 billion. The operating income of Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) reached $7.7 billion, significantly higher than the $3.3 billion in Q2 2022. North American segment had $3.2 billion in operating income, rebounding from $0.6 billion in 2022, whereas the International segment narrowed its operating loss to $0.9 billion from $1.8 billion. AWS segment's operating income was $5.4 billion, slightly down from 2022's $5.7 billion.On the other hand, the collaboration between Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Shonda Rhimes is another great example of how putting the right person in the right place can lead to success for businesses. In 2017, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) made an exclusive deal with Shonda Rhimes, a famous TV producer. She is known for her incredible storytelling skills and a strong commitment to her work, perfectly matching Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)’s goal to create captivating content that appeals to worldwide audiences.This partnership was a big win for Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). They gained a prolific content creator, who added many new and high-quality series to their collection. Rhimes also had the creative freedom to create instant hits like ""Bridgerton."" At the same time, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) became even more competitive than traditional TV networks and other streaming services. Another exciting news regarding the company is that Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) is set to venture into the physical retail space with ""Netflix House”. This concept will essentially combine shopping, dining, and immersive entertainment. These destinations are inspired by popular Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) shows and movies to provide fans with a unique experience. While specific locations remain undisclosed, the first Netflix Houses are anticipated to open in the US by 2025.15 Skills Employers Look for in CandidatesPressmaster/Shutterstock.comMethodologyTo prepare the list of skills employers look for in candidates, we conducted extensive research to find out the skills that have been highly appreciated in getting individuals hired.

Today's Research Daily features a real-time update on the Q3 earnings season and new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Walmart Inc. (WMT), NIKE, Inc. (NKE) and The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Q3 Earnings Season Scorecard Including this morning's earnings reports, we now have Q3 results from 39 S&amp;P 500 members that combined account for 11.4% of the index's market capitalization. Total earnings for these 39 index members are up +7.1% from the same period last year on +7% higher revenues, with 89.7% beating EPS estimates and 69.2% beating revenue estimates. While the beats percentages are about in-line with the preceding 20-quarter average for this group of 39 index members, the earnings growth rate represents a modest improvement over other recent quarters. For the Finance sector, which has dominated this initial reporting cycle, we now have Q3 results from 31.2% of the sector's total market capitalization in the S&amp;P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance companies are up +9.7% from the same period last year on +9.3% higher revenues, with 100% of the companies beating EPS estimates and 72.7% beating revenue estimates. While the revenue beats percentage for this group of Finance sector companies is about in-line with other recent quarters, the EPS beats percentage is the highest for this group since the second quarter of 2021. Hard to draw any firm conclusions from this relatively small sample of results at this stage, but it is nevertheless a positive start to the Q3 earnings season. Looking at Q3 as a whole, combining the actual results for the 39 index members that have reported with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total earnings for the quarter are now expected to be down -1.1% on +0.8% higher revenues. Story continuesExcluding the Energy sector drag, Q3 earnings for the rest of the index would be up +3.9% on +3.3% higher revenues.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Right now, Puma Biotech is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Amgen has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that PBYI likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than AMGN has recently. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.PBYI currently has a forward P/E ratio of 3.76, while AMGN has a forward P/E of 15.67. We also note that PBYI has a PEG ratio of 0.61. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. AMGN currently has a PEG ratio of 3.70.Another notable valuation metric for PBYI is its P/B ratio of 3.89. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, AMGN has a P/B of 22.60.Based on these metrics and many more, PBYI holds a Value grade of A, while AMGN has a Value grade of C.Story continuesPBYI sticks out from AMGN in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that PBYI is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

155,6240c75f-8fce-3451-be2f-5b7f760ecbc2,AMGN,2023-10-18,Investors Heavily Search Amgen Inc. (AMGN): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-amgen-inc-130006265.html,1697547606,STORY,['AMGN'],"[Amgen (AMGN) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest biotech drugmaker have returned +9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, which Amgen falls in, has lost 4.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Amgen is expected to post earnings of $4.64 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.3%.The consensus earnings estimate of $18.31 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +3.5%. This estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $19.94 indicates a change of +8.9% from what Amgen is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Amgen.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Amgen, the consensus sales estimate of $6.93 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +4.2%. The $27.21 billion and $30.57 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +3.4% and +12.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryAmgen reported revenues of $6.99 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.9%. EPS of $5 for the same period compares with $4.65 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.63 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.41%. The EPS surprise was +12.61%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Amgen is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amgen. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

On Oct 13, 2023, Newmont and the Union presented the agreement to the Mexican Labor Court, which approved it, bringing the strike to an end.The strike was initiated by the Union demanding Newmont pay additional profit sharing equal to double the amount agreed upon one year earlier, as well as other claimed violations of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.The agreement specifies that Newmont will not pay any additional incremental profit sharing for 2022. This was the reason for the strike, and the profit-sharing payments made by the company this year were entirely compliant with Mexican law and the Collective Bargaining Agreement.Also, if the Penasquito mine does not make a profit in 2023 as a result of the strike, Newmont agreed to pay an additional bonus in the second quarter of next year, equal to two months' salaries, as it acknowledges the hardship employees have faced given the length of the strike. Employees will also get a fixed payment from Newmont that would roughly equal 60% of wages lost since the strike started on Jun 7, 2023. The goal of this payment is to lessen the financial impact that the Union-initiated strike has placed on the company's workers.Shares of NEM have lost 4% over the past year against a 18% rise of its industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNewmont, on its second-quarter call, said that it is on track to achieve attributable gold production guidance of 5.7-6.3 million ounces.

This move sent shockwaves through the industry and raised questions about the project's future.Let’s delve into the details of this termination, its potential implications and the context surrounding it.Background of the ContractOriginally awarded in 2020, the contract signified a substantial commitment by Shell to revamp its pipeline infrastructure in Singapore. The project aimed to repair a nearshore pipeline and single-buoy mooring system at Shell's Bukom refinery in the country. It was a crucial part of Shell's efforts to ensure efficient and safe offloading of crude oil, a cornerstone of the company’s operations.The TerminationIn a filing to Malaysia's stock exchange Bursa, Sapura Energy revealed that the termination of the contract followed a letter dated 20 Sep, from a Shell subsidiary and a meeting between the companies on 5 Oct. According to a statement by Sapura Offshore Sdn Bhd (SOSB), Shell decided to terminate the contract without admission of liability, reserving all of SOSB's rights.Legal RamificationsIn response to the termination, SOSB sought legal advice from external counsel, suggesting that this decision may not be taken lightly. The termination of such a significant contract could lead to legal disputes and financial problems for both parties. While the exact nature of these consequences is yet to be seen, they could have far-reaching effects on both Shell and Sapura Energy.Project RescopingBefore the termination, Sapura Energy had been in negotiations regarding the rescoping of its EPCI contract for the second phase of Shell's pipeline rejuvenation project. This suggests that there might have been issues or disagreements regarding the project's scope, timeline, or other critical aspects. While the exact reasons behind the termination are not explicitly stated, it's clear that this project was facing challenges that led to its dissolution.Story continuesIndustry SpeculationAs news of this termination spread throughout the industry, speculations regarding the broader implications for the oil and gas sector sparked. This raised questions about the stability of EPCI contracts in the current economic and geopolitical landscape. The oil industry, in particular, is subject to fluctuations in supply and demand, and the termination of major contracts can have a ripple effect on oil businesses and the market as a whole.ConclusionThe termination of the Shell-Sapura Energy contract for the pipeline rejuvenation project in Singapore has raised eyebrows and sparked debate within the industry. While the exact reasons behind this decision remain undisclosed, it is clear that the project faced significant challenges. The legal ramifications and potential consequences for both parties are yet to be determined.Zacks Rank and Key PicksCurrently, SHEL has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the energy sector are CVR Energy CVI and USA Compression Partners USAC, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and Harbour Energy HBRIY, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

The Offshore Alliance union said it had called off strikes originally planned for Thursday at the U.S. energy major's Gorgon and Wheatstone projects in Western Australia, which supply around 6% of the world's LNG. Earlier this year, Australia's Woodside Energy also managed to avert strikes after reaching a deal with workers in August. Here is the sequence of events so far: Date Development Aug. 9 Workers at Woodside's liquefied LNG facilities in Australia vote for industrial action. Aug. 10 Chevron and Woodside say they are holding talks with union to avert any potential action by the workers. Aug. 11 Australia's labor regulator, the Fair Work Commission, allows workers' union to hold a ballot of employees to decide if they wanted to make a decision on taking industrial action at Chevron's Gorgon and downstream Wheatstone LNG facilities. Aug. 15 Negotiations between Chevron, Woodside Energy Group and Australian unions continue but a source with knowledge of the matter tells Reuters that the talks are unlikely to yield results for days. Aug. 16 Woodside says ""positive progress"" was being made on talks with a union alliance on disputes over the wages of workers. Aug. 16 The Offshore Alliance says during the negotiations Woodside was ""well off the pace on key bargaining issues including job security and remuneration."" Aug. 18 Voting opens in Chevron's facilities to let workers decide if they want to strike due to disputes over wages and working conditions. Aug. 20 Unions at Woodside's North West Shelf offshore gas platforms announce plans to strike as early as Sept. 2. Aug. 22 Woodside CEO Meg O'Neil says the company has had ""constructively addressed"" several concerns of workers but said it also has a duty to shareholders to be able to run the business. Aug. 23 Woodside and unions meet for another round of talks to avoid the strikes. Aug. 23 Chevron's Australian unit says it would increase domestic gas production capacity at its Wheatstone facility. Aug. 24 Woodside reaches an in-principle agreement with unions to avert strikes. Aug. 24 Workers at Chevron's Gorgon and Wheatstone downstream facilities vote to allow unions to call for a strike if necessary. Aug. 25 Unions at Chevron's LNG facilities in Australia warn that work stoppages could cost the U.S. energy major billions in exports if workers' demands on wages and conditions were not met. Aug. 28 Workers at Chevron's offshore Wheatstone facility grant unions the power to call strikes on their behalf. Aug. 28 Unions representing workers at Chevron's two major Australian LNG complexes say that they will take industrial action from Sept. 7. Aug. 29 Chevron's workers release details of industrial action including potential work stoppages of up to 10 hours. Sept. 1 Chevron workers reject a company pay and conditions offer. Sept. 1 The offshore alliance says no meetings have been scheduled between unions and Chevron. Sept. 4 Mediation talks to avert strikes at Chevron's LNG facilities in Australia begin once again. Sept. 5 Chevron workers announce plans for total strikes from Sept. 14 if their demands were not met. Sept. 5 Some employees of Chevron's Wheatstone LNG facility in Australia offer to work during industrial action in a bid to avert domestic supply disruptions, the Offshore alliance says. Sept. 6 Workers at Chevron's LNG facilities agree to pause planned strike action for one day until Sept. 8. Sept. 7 Chevron's LNG workers agree to delay the strike until 1 p.m. local time in Perth (0500 GMT) on Sept. 8 from the earlier scheduled start at 6 a.m. in Perth. Sept. 8 Workers at Chevron's LNG project begin strike as talks between the company and the unions fail to yield any results. Sept. 9 Chevron starts withdrawing contractor workers from Gorgon as the strike continues. Sept. 11 Chevron says it sees ""no reasonable prospect of agreement"" with the workers and would apply to the Fair Work Commission for an ""intractable bargaining"" declaration, which, if granted, would end the strike and allow the labor regulator to dictate an agreement. Sept. 12 The office of the labor regulator said it would hold a hearing on Sept. 22 about the dispute, while the unions wanted it to be held at a later date in November. Sept. 14 Union group Offshore Alliance said a turbine tripped at one of Wheatstone's two LNG trains, which convert natural gas into liquid, on the same day strikes escalated. Sept. 15 Workers begin a 24-hour strike at Chevron's LNG plants. Union representative says they intend to extend industrial action for a further two weeks to mid-October. Sept. 18 Chevron says full production had resumed on Sept. 17 at its Wheatstone LNG plant after a fault last week cut production by almost a quarter. Sept. 20 Latest round of talks between Chevron and unions at its two LNG facilities in Western Australia ends without a deal. Sept. 21 Chevron says it would accept the terms of a deal brokered by the Fair Work Commission to end the dispute. Sept. 22 Australian union alliance calls off strikes at Chevron's two major LNG projects after accepting proposals from the country's industrial arbitrator to end long-running disputes over pay and conditions. Oct. 5 Workers vote to restart strikes accusing Chevron of reneging on commitments. Oct. 6 Night-shift workers at Chevron's facilities also vote for strikes. Oct. 9 Chevron asks the Fair Works Commission to help resolve the dispute again as unions announce Oct. 19 as the date for fresh strikes. Oct. 16 Workers at Chevron's LNG facilities reaffirm their plan to resume strikes as mediated talks continue. Oct. 18 Workers at Chevron and the company reach an agreement the day before strikes were to resume.

For a quick overview of the top 5 animal health companies, read our article Top 5 Animal Health Companies in the World.The animal health industry is in solid shape for continued growth despite global economic downturns in 2020 due to COVID-19. Medium to long-term livestock and companion animal market trends are essential in determining future market behaviors in the related animal health industry.The global animal health market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.36% from 2023 to 2028, reaching US$45.2 billion by 2028. This growth is driven by several factors, including increasing number of pet owners and their desire for high-quality veterinary care, rising awareness of zoonotic diseases, and numerous technological advancements.According to Bloomberg, the pet economy is expected to grow more than 50% in coming years, driven by spending on sophisticated drugs and treatments and pampering. The pandemic pet boom added 5 million new pets to U.S. households, a 4% increase. This surge in pet ownership is fueling the growth of the animal healthcare industry. Pet owners are increasingly willing to invest in their pets' health and well-being, leading to demand for more sophisticated drugs and treatments.A Look into the Animal Healthcare IndustryZoetis Inc. (NYSE: ZTS), the world's largest producer of medicine and vaccinations for pets and livestock, reported a solid second quarter of 2023. The company saw a 9% operational revenue growth and 12% operational adjusted net income growth. This was driven by a diverse portfolio across markets and species. Segment growth was more balanced this quarter, with 11% active growth internationally and 7% growth in the U.S. operations. The first half has primarily been as expected, with 6% operational revenue growth. However, Zoetis Inc. (NYSE: ZTS) expects more substantial growth in the year's second half, especially in its U.S. companion animal business.Story continuesAdditionally, in livestock, which has grown 8% year-to-date on an operational basis, Zoetis anticipates unfavorable comparisons in the second half due to the timing of price decreases in Jackson in the U.S. last year and resumption of supply of several products after outages in the first half of 2022.Elanco Animal Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELAN), a $4.5 billion market cap company, posted a loss of $78 million in its most recent financial year. However, analysts expect Elanco Animal Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELAN) to reach the break-even point in 2024 after incurring a final loss in 2023. This is good news for investors, as it suggests that Elanco Animal Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELAN) is on the right track.Importance of R&amp;D Investments in the Animal Healthcare IndustryTwo leaders in the animal health sector, Kathy Turner of IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (NASDAQ:IDXX) and Rob Kelly of Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS), believe that companies should continue to invest in R&amp;D during the current economic downturn. They acknowledge that it will be difficult for all firms to maintain the same level of pre-COVID-19 spending, but they argue that R&amp;D is essential to the industry's long-term success. European animal healthcare companies spend 8% of revenue on R&amp;D, investing over €600 million annually in new product development.Top 20 animal health companies in the worlddidesign021/Shutterstock.comMethodologyTo rank the top 20 animal health companies in the world, we sourced data from Pharma Shots and Fierce Pharma.

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. NRG Energy (NRG) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.93 a share, just 20 days from its upcoming earnings release on November 6, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $1.93 Most Accurate Estimate and the $1.79 Zacks Consensus Estimate, NRG Energy has an Earnings ESP of 8.12%.NRG is part of a big group of Utilities stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Southern Co. (SO) as well.Southern Co. is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on November 2, 2023. SO's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.32 a share 16 days from its next earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Southern Co. is $1.31, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.61%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, NRG and SO could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

To skip the detailed analysis of the renewable energy sector and the green movement, go directly to the 5 Best Green Stocks To Invest In 2023.Renewable energy and its associated sources like wind and solar have become significant subjects of discussion, not only among everyday consumers but also within the realms of businesses, investors, and financial experts. With global warming escalating each moment, there is a growing fixation within the global community to mitigate the impact of rapid climate change and preserve the planet and its resources for future generations. The adoption of renewable energy is on the rise, emerging as the fastest-growing energy source globally. As such, a number of companies and countries have set their sights on achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050.Recent advancements have shown encouraging signs, with 2022 marking a record-breaking year for new renewable electricity capacity. As an illustration, approximately 340 gigawatts (GW) of capacity was added during the year. The implementation of significant policies in 2022, such as REPowerEU in the European Union, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in the United States, and China’s 14th Five-Year Plan for Renewable Energy, will provide added impetus to expedite the deployment of renewable electricity in the upcoming years. Notably, in 2022, China accounted for nearly half of all investments in green energy. Their investment in clean energy amounted to $546 billion, surpassing the United States, which invested $141 billion during the same period. Additionally, the European Union recently secured a provisional agreement to increase the proportion of renewable energy to 42.5% by 2030, up from the current 32%. That said, the United States isn't lagging behind by any means. In the next decade, the nation's yearly renewable energy capacity has the potential to triple, reaching 110 gigawatts (GW), propelled by advancements in clean-energy legislation spurring increased investments in the sector.Story continuesIn addition, the International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts a 3% annual increase in global electricity demand from 2023 to 2025, surpassing the growth rate seen in 2022. The firm highlights that over 70% of this surge will likely originate from China, Southeast Asia, and India. Concurrently, developed economies are striving to boost electricity production and decrease dependence on fossil fuels, particularly in heating and transportation sectors. The IEA also forecasts that renewable energy sources like solar and wind power, along with nuclear energy, will collectively cater to over 90% of the additional global demand by 2025.To take advantage of the growth of the global renewable energy industry, investors can look towards notable names within the industry that reign as some of the best clean energy stocks, including the likes of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), and NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE).11 Best Green Stocks To Invest In 2023Our MethodologyFollowing an extensive analysis of the renewable energy sector, we identified 11 of the best clean energy stocks with the highest hedge fund ownership during the second quarter of 2023. The hedge fund sentiment for each stock was extracted from Insider Monkey's database, encompassing 910 top-tier hedge funds. Our selection specifically focused on stocks with significant involvement or infrastructure within the renewable energy sector.11. Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P.

Brookfield’s balance sheet is also relatively well-protected against rising rates given it has 97% fixed-rate debt with an average term to maturity of 12 years.”Much like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), and NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P. (NYSE:BEP) is a prominent player in the race for renewable energy.10.

169,5f684899-f01f-3a48-8971-79c61d10385f,NEE,2023-10-18,Analysts Estimate NextEra Energy Partners (NEP) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-nextera-energy-partners-140053435.html,1697551253,STORY,"['NEP', 'NEE']","[The market expects NextEra Energy Partners (NEP) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 24. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis limited partnership for clean-energy projects is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.48 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -48.4%.Revenues are expected to be $386.6 million, up 28% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.5% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for NextEra Energy Partners?For NextEra Energy Partners, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -14.94%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that NextEra Energy Partners will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that NextEra Energy Partners would post earnings of $0.72 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.53, delivering a surprise of -26.39%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.NextEra Energy Partners doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The firm delivered a negative earnings surprise of 26.4% in the last reported quarter.Let’s discuss the factors that are likely to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly results.Factors to NoteThe firm’s third-quarter earnings are expected to have benefited from the ongoing growth of its high-quality renewable energy portfolio. During the second quarter, NEP completed the acquisition of a 690-megawatt (MW) portfolio of operating wind and solar projects from Energy Resources. This is expected to further drive the firm’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.NextEra Energy Partners’ earnings are also expected to gain from Yellow Pine Solar, a 125-MW solar generation and a 65-MW storage facility in Nevada, which started commercial operations during the to-be-reported quarter.The firm continues to enjoy structural tax advantages and is not likely to pay meaningful U.S. taxes for at least 15 years. This might have also bolstered its third-quarter earnings.Q3 ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NextEra Energy Partners’ earnings is pegged at 48 cents per unit, implying a year-over-year decline of 48.4%.The consensus mark for revenues is pinned at $386.6 million, indicating a 28% improvement year over year.Our Zacks model predicts renewable energy sales to contribute nearly 84% to the firm’s total revenues compared with 78.1% in the year-ago quarter.What Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for NextEra Energy Partners this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. That is not the case here as you will see below.NextEra Energy Partners, LP Price and EPS SurpriseNextEra Energy Partners, LP Price and EPS SurpriseNextEra Energy Partners, LP price-eps-surprise | NextEra Energy Partners, LP QuoteStory continuesEarnings ESP: NEP’s Earnings ESP is -14.94%.

And I'm immensely grateful and proud of our employees in Israel, who, despite everything that they have been going through, continue to deliver uninterrupted service to our clients. Our hearts go out to colleagues, clients and community members in the region. Now I'll share some brief comments about our financial results for the third quarter and will then give a quick overview of some of our strategic priorities. BNY Mellon delivered solid financial performance and continued progress on the steady transformation of our company. As you can see on Slide 2 of the financial highlights presentation, we reported earnings per share of $1.22 versus $0.39 in the third quarter of last year. Excluding notable items, which primarily impacted last year's results, EPS of $1.27 increased by 5% year-over-year. We generated a return on tangible common equity of 20% on $4.4 billion of revenue, up 2% year-over-year and a pretax margin of 29% in the third quarter. These results once again highlight the efficacy of our prudent and proactive asset and liability management amid a rapidly evolving operating environment. Net interest revenue was up 10% year-over-year as we continued to maximize the positive aspects of rising interest rates. Our strong liquidity position allowed us to reduce our wholesale funding footprint and despite the significant steepening of the curve, unrealized losses in our investment securities portfolio remained well contained. Our 20% return on tangible common equity, together with all of these actions, allowed us to continue to deliver attractive capital returns to our shareholders while further strengthening our capital and liquidity ratios to be prepared for a wide range of macroeconomic outcomes. As I've just rounded out the first 12 months in my seat, I'd like to take a step back for a moment and reflect on our work to date and where we're headed. Through a series of strategic reviews, we have affirmed what we believe to be our key assets. Number one, our client reach and breadth of engagement. Our top-tier clients from all regions of the world both trust and want to do more business with us. Number two, our collection of market-leading businesses. We're a broad-based financial services company with a balance and diversification that makes us stronger. And our unique business mix sets us apart from our competitors.And number three, our culture of teamwork. Our people are naturally collegial and seek out opportunities to work together to serve our clients and communities. These assets are hard to replicate, and it's rare that they exist together. But as I have acknowledged before, the company's long-term financial performance track record hasn't lived up to the quality of this franchise. As a result, we've committed to drive higher underlying growth, consistently deliver positive operating leverage and improve our pretax margin over time. As an important mark of clarity and focus to help tie together where we are heading and why, we recently communicated 3 strategic pillars to our employees around the world: one, be more for our clients; two, run our company better; and three, power our culture. These 3 pillars are not fundamentally changing the businesses we're in. Instead, they drive at how we operate and who we are day to day for our clients. As I've said before, strategy is important but ultimately, just a set of words. Actually doing it and how we do it matters a lot. While this was just 1 quarter in what will be a multiyear transformation, I'm optimistic about the steady improvements we are seeing inside of BNY Mellon. And I want to share with you some of this perspective that gives us confidence that we're on the right track with the work that we are doing under each of these pillars. First, I'm encouraged by the pace of progress towards making BNY Mellon a better-run company. Our businesses have historically operated largely in silos. We've run somewhat like a corporate conglomerate with a holding company that owns a series of vertically self-sufficient subsidiaries. This has led to clunky client journeys, wasteful duplication and a lack of joined-up thinking. We have many opportunities to run our company better and more efficiently to reduce bureaucracy. And we need to be smart and disciplined with how we spend so our investments in the business go further. I've talked to you before about our efficiency initiative, comprising about 1,500 ideas, developed by those who often see items ripe for improvement most clearly and closely: our people. This program, internally we call it Project Catalyst, is well underway, and we started to see some early benefits in our financial results. As you may recall, in January, we set out to essentially halve our expense growth rate this year to roughly 4% growth excluding notable items compared to roughly 8% ex currency in 2022. We have made good progress against this goal. With less than 3 months left in the year, we are confident that we will outperform our 4% expense growth target for 2023, all while self-funding over $0.5 billion of incremental investments this year. As we've started the budgeting process for 2024, we are determined to bend the cost curve further. We're now working to adopt the platform's operating model, which will help us to do things in one place, do them well and elevate overall execution. And we're embracing new technologies so we can be more productive, more efficient and focused on growth. Automation of processes and investment in operations digitization and AI across the firm will make it easier for our employees to do their jobs and subsequently channel their energies toward new innovations, which brings me to our work towards being more for our clients. Our financial results in the quarter tell a tale of 2 cities. Against the backdrop of seasonally slower summer months, we once again saw outperformance in some of our differentiating businesses. Strength in Clearance and Collateral Management continued. And we saw healthy underlying growth in Pershing as well as solid momentum in Asset Servicing. This was offset by continued softness in Investment Management fees and lower exchange revenue, given the subdued market backdrop. Our path to higher underlying growth is clear. In addition to always being on the hunt for new clients, we have to deliver more to our existing clients, develop new products and do a better job at connecting the adjacent ones. Our new Chief Commercial Officer has hit the ground running as we start operationalizing One BNY Mellon across the organization to sharpen our commercial focus and elevate the client experience across the firm. At the same time, we're pushing forward with innovative new client solutions that leverage the adjacencies among our businesses. While still early days, initial client wins with our recently launched solutions as well as the quality of our pipelines are encouraging. Pershing X's new open architecture Wealth Management platform, Wove, is off to a promising start, including a couple of client agreements already signed, several prospective clients in active contracting and a steadily growing pipeline. As an example, Integrity, a nationwide insurance and financial services firm with a network of over 0.5 million agents and advisers, has selected our Wove platform to support their wealth management business. With Wove, we are also connecting solutions from across BNY Mellon. For example, Integrity will have access to third-party models and institutional-grade solutions from our specialist firms in Investment Management and broker-dealer clearing and custody solutions through Pershing. In another example, Pershing expanded their long-standing relationship with Lincoln Investment as the company transitioned their self-clearing business on to Pershing's custodial platform and selected Wove to provide a suite of technology solutions to its financial professionals.As we onboard additional clients through the remainder of 2023, we are planning to start disclosing relevant financial information and leading indicators for you all to keep track of Wove's growth trajectory at the beginning of next year. We also signed the first external client, a leading G-SIB owned European asset manager for our recently launched buy-side trading solutions. Without a doubt, we expect our more prominent solutions like Wove and buy-side trading to move the needle on growth over time. But we are leaning into innovation to solve the evolving client challenges across all of our businesses. For example, in Treasury Services, we were one of the first banks to go live on FedNow, the Federal Reserve's new instant payment rail. This allows us to expand our capabilities for corporations, nonbank financial institutions and fintechs. And as a service provider, we are helping our financial institutions clients access instant payments, remain competitive and provide best-in-class service for their customers. As another example, this quarter, the business announced the launch of Bankify, an open banking payment solution that, as an alternative to credit or debit cards and third-party payment platforms, helps organizations receive consumer payments from bank accounts with a seamless user experience and guaranteed settlement. Let me conclude by saying that we are optimistic about the opportunity in front of us. And our strategic objectives for the short, medium and long term are clear. We are innovating and pushing forward on our multiyear growth investments, all the while remaining disciplined to deliver positive operating leverage and pretax margin expansion. As I've said all along, the path to transforming BNY Mellon into a consistently high-performing company will take some time. But for 2023, we are on track to deliver what we said we'd deliver at the beginning of the year while making steady progress toward our strategic priorities. I'm proud and appreciative of our people's dedication to be more for our clients, run our company better and power our culture collectively to unlock BNY Mellon's potential. With that, over to you, Dermot.Dermot William McDonoghThank you, Robin, and good morning, everyone. I will start on Page 3 of the presentation with our consolidated financial results for the third quarter. Total revenue of $4.4 billion was up 2% year-over-year. Net interest revenue was up 10% year-over-year primarily driven by higher interest rates, partially offset by changes in balance sheet size and mix. Fee revenue was flat. Growth on the back of higher market values, net new business and the favorable impact of a weaker dollar was offset by the Alcentra divestiture in the fourth quarter last year, lower foreign exchange revenue and the mix of AUM flows. Firm-wide assets under custody/administration of $45.7 trillion were up 8% year-over-year, reflecting higher market values, client inflows, the weaker dollar and net new business. Assets under management of $1.8 trillion were up 3% year-over-year, reflecting the weaker dollar and higher market values, partially offset by the Alcentra divestiture. Investment and other revenue was $113 million in the quarter, reflecting continued strength in fixed income trading. Expenses were down 16% year-over-year on a reported basis primarily reflecting the goodwill impairment associated with our Investment Management reporting unit in the third quarter last year. Excluding notable items, expenses were up 3% year-over-year. Provision for credit losses remained low at $3 million in the quarter as the impact of reserve builds to reflect continued uncertainty on the outlook for commercial real estate was largely offset by reserve releases related to financial institutions. As Robin noted earlier, reported earnings per share were $1.22. Excluding notable items, earnings per share were $1.27, representing 5% growth year-over-year. We delivered positive operating leverage, our pretax margin was 29% and we generated a return on tangible common equity of 20%. Turning to capital and liquidity on Page 4. Consistent with the prior quarter, we returned $450 million of capital to our shareholders through common share repurchases and we paid approximately $330 million of dividends to our common stockholders, reflecting our previously announced 14% dividend increase, which became effective in the third quarter. Taken together, we returned 82% of earnings to shareholders in the quarter or 107% on a year-to-date basis. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio improved sequentially by approximately 40 basis points to 6.1%, reflecting a decrease in average assets and an increase in Tier 1 capital driven by capital generated through earnings net of capital returns through buybacks and dividends. Unrealized losses related to available-for-sale securities remained roughly unchanged in the quarter. The CET1 ratio was 11.4%, representing an approximately 30 basis point improvement compared with the prior quarter, reflecting lower risk-weighted assets and an increase in CET1 capital. Just like our regulatory capital ratios, our liquidity ratios further strengthened in the quarter. The consolidated liquidity coverage ratio was 121%, a 1 percentage point improvement compared with the prior quarter. And our consolidated net stable funding ratio was 136%, well in excess of the regulatory requirement. Next, on Page 5, net interest revenue and further details on the underlying balance sheet trends, which I will describe in sequential terms. Net interest revenue of $1 billion was down 8% quarter-over-quarter driven by changes in balance sheet size and mix, partially offset by higher interest rates. As we expected, temporary deposits related to the debt ceiling impasse in the second quarter left in July and along with seasonally low balances in August, average deposits for the quarter decreased by 5% sequentially. In line with our expectations, interest-bearing deposits were down 3% and noninterest-bearing deposits were down 16%. You will remember from prior earnings calls that we expected noninterest-bearing deposits to moderate to approximately 20% of total deposits in the second half of this year, which is consistent with our deposit mix in the third quarter. Following seasonal troughs in August, we saw the anticipated pickup in monthly average balances in September and again, some modest growth in the first 2 weeks of October. Average interest-earning assets were down by 6% quarter-over-quarter. This reflects a reduction in cash and reverse repo by 11%, while we actively reduced wholesale funding. Our investment securities portfolio was down 4% and loan balances were up 1%. Moving to expenses on Page 6. Expenses for the quarter were down 16% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 3% excluding notable items. This year-over-year increase was driven by higher investment and revenue-related expenses, the unfavorable impact of the weaker dollar as well as inflation, partially offset by efficiency savings and the Alcentra divestiture. I'll talk more about our outlook for expenses in a moment, but as Robin mentioned earlier, it is worth highlighting that for 2023, we are expecting to fully self-fund over $0.5 billion of incremental investments through efficiency savings.Turning to our business segments starting with Securities Services on Page 7. As I discussed the performance of our Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services segment, I will comment on the investment services fees for each line of business described in our earnings press release and the financial supplement. Securities Services reported total revenue of $2.1 billion, up 1% year-over-year. Fee revenue was flat. 2% growth in investment services fees was offset by a 19% decline in foreign exchange revenue on the back of lower volatility and volumes. Net interest revenue was up 12%. In Asset Servicing, investment services fees were up 3% driven by higher market values, healthy net new business and a weaker dollar, partially offset by lower client transaction activity. The strength of our balance sheet as well as the stability, breadth and depth of our solutions remain clear differentiators that position us well with clients confronted with a persistently challenging market environment and an evolving competitive landscape. For example, ETF assets under custody/administration were up over 20% year-over-year, and the number of funds serviced on our platform continue to grow at a healthy clip. In alts, assets under custody/administration and related investment services fees both grew in the mid-single-digit percentage range despite the number of fund launches having slowed significantly over the past year. Within Issuer Services, investment services fees were down 2%. Growth from net new business and Corporate Trust was more than offset by the absence of fees from elevated Depositary Receipt cancellation activity in the third quarter of last year. Next, Market and Wealth Services on Page 8. Market and Wealth Services reported total revenue of $1.4 billion, up 6% year-over-year. Fee revenue was up 5% and net interest revenue increased by 6%. In Pershing, investment services fees were up 2%, reflecting higher fees on sweep balances, partially offset by the impact of lost business and lower transaction volumes consistent with the decline in U.S. equity exchange volumes. Despite the continued headwind from the ongoing deconversion of the regional bank client highlighted in the second quarter, Pershing saw $23 billion of net new assets on the platform this quarter, reflecting positive momentum in the underlying business. As Robin mentioned earlier, the momentum around Wove is building with both new and existing clients. While at the same time, ongoing investments in the core Pershing platform to enhance adviser experience and lead with innovative solutions have positioned us well to capitalize on the heightened pace of change in the RIA community. In Treasury Services, investment services fees decreased by 1% as growth from higher client activity was offset by higher earnings credits for noninterest-bearing deposit balances. In Clearance and Collateral Management, investment services fees were up 16%, reflecting broad-based growth across U.S. and international Clearance and Collateral Management. In particular, we saw strength in domestic clearance volumes, reflecting elevated volatility and U.S. treasury issuance activity and continued migration from the Fed's reverse repo facility to traditional tri-party collateral management balances. Recent macro trends, including heightened volatility, uncertainty associated with monetary policy and banks' regulatory capital requirements as well as the recent consolidation in the banking sector further reinforce the value of our tri-party collateral management service. In addition to expanding our platform both in the U.S. and internationally, we continue to innovate new solutions for our clients to better utilize their collateral. Turning to Investment and Wealth Management on Page 9. Investment and Wealth Management reported total revenue of $827 million, down 4% year-over-year. Fee revenue was down 2% and net interest revenue declined 33% year-over-year. Assets under management of $1.8 trillion increased by 3% year-over-year. As I mentioned earlier, this increase reflects the weaker dollar and higher market values, partially offset by the Alcentra divestiture. In the quarter, we saw $15 billion of net outflows from long-term strategies, driven by client derisking and rebalancing and $7 billion of net inflows into short-term strategies led by our Dreyfus Money Market Fund complex. In Investment Management, revenue was down 4% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the Alcentra divestiture and the mix of AUM flows, partially offset by higher performance fees as well as the impact of higher market values and the weaker dollar. In our Wealth Management business, revenue decreased by 5% driven by lower net interest revenue and changes in product mix, partially offset by higher market values. Client assets of $292 billion increased by 14% year-over-year, reflecting higher equity market values and cumulative net inflows. Page 10 shows the results of the Other segment. I will close with our current outlook for the rest of the year. Based on market-implied forward interest rates at the end of last month, our net interest revenue outlook for the full year '23 remains unchanged for 20% growth year-over-year. Moving to expenses. We are making good progress on bending the cost curve while protecting our important investments to accelerate growth and deliver superior client experiences. Where we sit today, I am confident that we will outperform the target of 4% expense growth, excluding notable items that we communicated in January, and we remain determined to drive that growth rate down to 3% for the full year '23. This reflects our expectation for a sequential step-up in expenses, excluding notable items in the fourth quarter, with seasonally higher business development expenses as well as discrete increases for professional services and occupancy. And finally, we expect to continue stock buybacks at a pace consistent with the second and third quarter. This is in line with our full year outlook to return 100% of earnings or more to shareholders over the course of '23 while maintaining our strong capital ratios, mindful of the significant uncertainties relating to the operating environment. In conclusion, our financial results this quarter highlight the effectiveness of our balance sheet management and tangible progress on our journey towards higher operational efficiency and scalability. While we have more work to do, our teams around the world are embracing change and our pace of bringing innovative new client solutions to the market gives us confidence that revenue growth will follow over time. With that, operator, can you please open the line for Q&amp;A?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.Steven Joseph ChubakWanted to start off with a question on the NII outlook. I was hoping you could just give some thoughts on the deposit trajectory if rates are higher for longer and the Fed continues to engage in QT. And given we're at that 20% lower bound for NIBs where do you expect that to ultimately settle out as a percentage of deposits?Robin Antony VinceSure, Steven. I'll take that. So I guess the way I'd like to answer the question is just to kind of start with January where we kind of gave the guidance to the market of 20% NII growth for the year. And we've been consistent with that on the call since then, and we reconfirm that guidance today for 20% for the full year. Now the world has kind of played a different hand to us over the course of the year since January. We had the bank turmoil in March, and we had the debt ceiling impasse over the summer. And clients used us as the port in a storm during that time and we kind of saw surges in deposits, and so that benefited us. Now over the course of the summer, we see those deposits leave, and we feel we've reached an inflection point of puts and takes between the natural organic flow versus our kind of surge deposits leaving. So we feel the pace of decline has slowed. We feel like we hit the trough in August, and we've seen modest pickup in deposits in September and into October. So overall, that, and when you take the asset side of the balance sheet and how liquid we are on the asset side and how that's rolling down, you might want to know that as the balance sheet continues to roll down, we have a yield pickup of 200 to 300 basis points, which kind of what gives us a lot of kind of confidence in our estimate for the year and outlook into '24. As it relates to NIBs, we always said that it was going to be 25% to 20% through the cycle. The trough happened during the summer months and has stayed in the 20% ZIP code. So we feel overall pretty good about NIBs as a percentage of total deposits being in the 20% range.Steven Joseph ChubakVery helpful. And just for my follow-up on the expense outlook. You've spoken about the commitment to improve operating margins. You cited a number of efforts, Robin, to deliver efficiencies across the platform. As we look out to next year, given a lower NII exit rate relative to the first half for you and for some of your industry peers, wanted to get a sense of how much flexibility is embedded in your expense plans and your ability to drive expenses lower potentially in a more challenging revenue backdrop.Robin Antony VinceSteven, I'll start. So look, we've said on every call this year that bending the cost curve is a very important strategic objective for the firm. And we're attacking structural expenses in a number of different ways. And that's just continuous execution day in, day out, blocking and tackling. The result of all that blocking and tackling have caused us to outperform the 4% guidance that we gave in January, and we're determined to push that number to closer to 3%. While we don't believe the work is over this year and we're now in the middle of budget season, and we are determined to bend the cost curve into next year and to continue to deliver that positive operating leverage. And we kind of go at it in a number of different ways: rationalizing vendors, rationalizing locations, remixing our kind of headcount and how we hire. This year was our biggest campus class ever, double last year, and we'll continue to build on that. So there are a lot of things happening underneath the hood that give us a high degree of confidence that we'll be able to continue to bend the cost curve into '24 and beyond.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.Ebrahim Huseini PoonawalaJust maybe to -- following up on the discussion around deposits. I think Dermot, you used the word trough multiple times. Just give us a sense of -- obviously, you've called it right this year in terms of how things have played out. But just give us a sense of is it about the mix or the granularity of your deposits or the client behavior that you've seen that gives you confidence that this 20%, what you saw in August, was a trough? And if we are in a period through next year where there are no rate cuts, it's higher for longer, like where does the negative surprise come from, if any?Dermot William McDonoghThanks for the question. So look, this has been a journey for the last 15 months. We took a view at the beginning of last year that the Fed was going to hike quite significantly and to position -- we positioned the balance sheet in a way to do that.And so when we kind of talk about deposits, I think it's very important to look at both sides of the balance sheet at the same time in terms of how we're positioned on the asset side. We have a lot of the balance sheet in cash, which benefits from the higher interest rates. Our fixed rate securities are going to roll down over the next -- a decent amount of the fixed securities, I think it's a quarter a year, roll down over the next couple of years. So -- and that gets us a pickup of 200 to 300 basis points. And at the beginning of the year, we did forecast a kind of mid-single-digit decline in deposits and that kind of bottoms-up analysis. And also, it's important to remember that clients of BNY Mellon are not just with us for deposits. They come into our ecosystem. And just remember, it's a $1.3 trillion cash ecosystem that we have, and they come in for a variety of different reasons. It's a portfolio of businesses that give us our deposit makeup. So when we look at it at a portfolio level, we get a lot of confidence around the stability of the deposit base. And look, there were a lot of gives and takes this year through the bank turmoil in March and the debt ceiling impasse, which benefited us, and that's kind of moderated. And those deposits have left for higher-yielding opportunities. But we feel like the summer slowdown, the seasonal slowdown that we experienced in August and the conversations that we have and talking to our deposit team, we feel very good about where we are on the deposit balance now and the pickup that's happened in September and October. And that kind of gives us the confidence to say here today that 20% NII is a good number, which I think should be good for you guys to know that we've been consistent in our approach over the whole year.Ebrahim Huseini PoonawalaThat's helpful. And I guess maybe if I heard you correctly, I think you mentioned $0.5 billion of investments are self-funded. That's about 4% of your expense base. Is that $0.5 billion -- I'm just wondering the relevance of that number. Is that something that we should think about either go forward sort of incremental investment spend that you need to self-fund through efficiencies as we, from the outside, try to figure out what expense growth could look like next year? Just if you could contextualize that $0.5 billion in investments and what that means going forward.Dermot William McDonoghSo the way I kind of think about that and the message that I would like to give you is it gives a message of discipline in that with half the growth rates, we're going towards 3%. And within that 3% growth, we've had the financial discipline to be able to self-fund $0.5 billion of investments that we will -- we are confident that will deliver further efficiency in years ahead and revenue opportunities. So it's both kind of powering the top line and automating and driving further efficiency. And we look to continue to do that into the budget season this year and next year. And like this year, we doubled the efficiency saves that we have typically achieved in past years. And that's both bottoms up. I think we both have mentioned it in our prepared remarks, the Catalyst project that we're roughly 40% the way through. And we're doing real work day in, day out that is driving that expense growth down and is kind of delivering opportunities for us that we will harvest in the quarters to come.Robin Antony VinceEbrahim, I'd add just a couple of things to that. One, we've been very deliberate about not cutting our way to glory, but rather working the problem at a pretty fundamental level so that we can both manage our expenses for the necessary operating leverage, which we want to achieve, but also sowing the seeds for future efficiencies and future fee growth. And so that's really the way in which we're thinking about it.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.Kenneth Michael UsdinJust one more follow-up. So yes, it's great to see the 20% for the year reiterated. And obviously, as discussed, that implies a lower fourth quarter exit. But I want to more importantly understand the moving parts from there, and at what point can you see that stability going forward in terms of some of the things on the front book side helping versus where deposit costs could continue to go up. Just trying to understand, if we're at a stable DDAs, can you see a path early next year to get that NII point stable? And just -- let me start there.Dermot William McDonoghSo I don't really want to give guidance for next year today, Ken. We will do that in January. I've gotten lots of questions about that at Barclays as well. So I kind of feel good about the 20%. I feel good about the deposit pipeline that we have. We've talked on previous earnings calls about our strategic pivot a couple of years ago where we centralized all our deposit businesses in one area. And so I feel very good about how we're managing the deposits, how we're pricing the deposits. We're a little bit different to other institutions in that we have -- our clients are sophisticated. So cumulative basis are not materially changed from last quarter, they're in the 80% ZIP code, and we've passed on the rates. So I think it's important to note that there's no material pricing lag to catch up here. And so we kind of feel the absolute level of deposits is pretty good. We feel very good about our outlook for the rest of the year. But look, the world is very uncertain. And who knows what comes tomorrow. And for '24, like we'll give you a more detailed guidance in January. But I feel pretty good about where we are today.Robin Antony VinceYes. And Ken, I'll just add to that. Just to draw your attention to really emphasize 2 things. Number one is when we started off the year and we gave the guidance of 20% for NII growth over the course of the year, clearly, the year has turned out differently. But I think the power of the global liquidity solutions team that we've put together has really been able to prove our ability to be agile in this space, sort of a little bit irrespective of the environment. I don't want to be complacent with that comment because, clearly, the world can change. But we saw a lot of things over the course of the first 3 quarters of the year. I think the team has done a very good job adapting to those and maintaining the consistency. And you'll remember Dermot's comments earlier in the year, which is we thought NIBs were hanging in a little higher than we would have expected them to be. And we've always expected them essentially to come down to this level. It just happened a little later than we thought, but obviously, we've been fine with that. And then the second comment is remembering the inputs in terms of the diversification. Dermot said it earlier, but it really is critical to our deposits franchise. We've got the Issuer Services business with Corporate Trust, which drives on one set of inputs to their deposit algorithm. We've got a clearing and collateral management business, which has a different set of drivers. We've got our Treasury Services business, which has yet a different set of drivers. And of course, we have our Asset Servicing business as well. So that breadth and diversification just creates for different outcomes, and I think you've seen that over the course of this year. So we're not sitting here today giving guidance for next year, but the fourth quarter NII is probably a pretty decent place to start as you think about the world.Kenneth Michael UsdinOkay. Got it. And just one question on Pershing. It's great to see the wave start and the good commentary you have about the momentum. Just wondering, we know that there was going to be a client deconversion coming out of that as well. Did we see that in the third quarter result? Or is that still a pending yet to happen?Dermot William McDonoghSo we expect that to happen over several quarters, Ken. I think the important point -- so it happened over both quarters. I think second quarter was a little bit more than the third quarter, but we do expect that to work its way through over the next several quarters. I think the important point I'd leave you with on Pershing in addition to the Wove development is the fact that we added $23 billion of net new assets in the quarter. And the underlying strength of the business and our ability to provide solutions to our clients in that space is really, really terrific to see.Kenneth Michael UsdinYes. And that's what I'm hoping for, that you can offset that with the organic growth. That's what I'm getting at.Dermot William McDonoghYes. We believe we have the confidence to earn our way out of that over the next several quarters.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.Michael Lawrence MayoI think you guys have been pushing for stronger fee growth, and that's a slog. But in the meantime, you're certainly bending the cost curve, as you say. I guess, Robin, to your opening comments about a conglomerate with a bunch of silos and breaking those down, certainly are -- is a key to growing revenue faster. How can you actually implement horizontal integration among these businesses and by breaking down the silos? Like do you have any proof points or evidence now? Or is this more like a 3- to 5-year plan?Robin Antony VinceSure, Mike. So look, this approach of de-siloing the company is clearly one of our critical pillars, and we put that under the heading of run the company better in terms of our internal conversations. And so there are many things that we're doing. We're really looking at what is it that we do across the company where we have like capabilities. So we have some examples of that on the business side. A recent example is we had institutional clearing and settlement that we actually did in our Pershing business, but we also have an institutional clearing product in our Clearance and Collateral Management business. So we've moved the piece from Pershing into our Clearance and Collateral Management business. So now it's all together. And I could give you 5 other examples that are just like that of us rearranging pieces on the business front end inside the company to be able to be more joined up in terms of how we approach clients. And so that is essentially truly making sure that we have consistent client-facing platforms in terms of how we're doing business. Then on the supporting side of the organization, and if you think about our company a little bit like a platforms business, we have all these world-leading platforms, the largest security lending company in the world, the largest collateral manager, the largest asset servicing custodian with AUC, et cetera, et cetera. What we hadn't done is adapted the way we run the company to actually look like that. So we've decided to adopt this more platforms-like operating model, where we're taking things that we -- in terms of the support that we provide for our businesses and reducing that duplication. So I'll give you an example. On the call center side, we used to have 7 call centers. Those 7 call centers were each essentially providing a service to their respective businesses. Now we're moving, at the beginning, but moving towards a single consistent contact center that can provide the service to all 7 of those businesses and frankly, do it in a better, cheaper way, which is providing more capability to our clients, even though the difference in the word call center versus contact center because there's a client benefit associated with that. So look, we're at the beginning of this thing, but we think a platforms operating model is very fit for purpose for our company and it should really simplify how we work, improve the client experience and our employees. And we've got other proof points. We talked about deposits. Dermot was describing the better outcomes that we think we've had as a result of implementing global liquidity solutions. That is a consistent deposit approach across the company. We've got KYC as an example as well. We used to do KYC in each of our businesses. We're bringing that together, to have a KYC platform. So there are a lot of proof points that we've got in various stages of development here in addition to the actual pilots that we did specifically for a platforms operating model.Michael Lawrence MayoSo when you add it all together, you said next year, you expect to have positive operating leverage. Is that in aggregate or positive fee operating leverage? And how can you have such confidence at this stage?Robin Antony VinceSo look, we're committed to positive operating leverage over time. And I don't want my second year as CEO to be one where we have negative operating leverage. So we are focused on positive operating leverage next year. That's aggregate operating leverage, to answer your question. And one of the reasons why we have confidence in that is because we've been investing on both the revenue side and on the expense side in the short-, medium- and long-term perspective. Dermot just went through a few things that we've done specifically for 2023, but the platforms conversation and the answer I just gave to you, that's an investment in medium- and long-term efficiencies. And we haven't seen any of the benefit of that really yet. And the same thing is true on the revenue side. Some of the shorter-term things that we've done and the enthusiasm around One BNY Mellon, the referrals that we've had across the business, we've talked about that in prior quarters. But now we're moving to the medium- and longer-term benefits, which are really getting the benefit of our Chief Commercial Officer and her approach to operationalizing One BNY Mellon, that's a more medium-term opportunity. And then long term, really harnessing the benefits of these product investments that we've made with things like Wove and buy-side trading. So we've been seeding on the revenue side and the expense side, short, medium and long term as we try to manage for this operating leverage over time.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.Alexander BlosteinMaybe to shift gears a little bit. I was hoping to spend a minute on capital. Nice to see the capital ratios build over the course of the quarter. So I guess as you're thinking on the buyback on a forward basis, given that it's been a little bit lighter over the last couple of quarters, how are you thinking about that over the next 12 months? And maybe just a reminder in terms of how much capital do you expect to accrete back to your capital ratios from securities maturing over the next, call it, 6 quarters or so?Dermot William McDonoghSo I'll take that one, Alex. So I would say for the next quarter, no really change in the buyback. It's going to be consistent with the last couple of quarters. Going back to one of the 3 things that we said in January, buybacks was one of those and we committed to buying back 100% more of earnings of -- returning 100% more of earnings to our shareholders over the course of the year, and we're on track to do that. I would say as we look out in the world today, it's very different to where it was in January. You still have the kind of huge volatility in the rate environment, like it was 100 basis points in Q3. The geopolitics are very uncertain at the moment. So -- and then last but not least, you've kind of got Basel III and advocacy and what's going to happen there. So there are a lot of things to be worried about and at this stage, we'd rather be on the cautious end of things and see no real need to change our stance on buybacks in the short term. As it relates to your specific question, we have about $2.3 billion of unrealized losses in our AFS portfolio, and we expect about half of that to come back into capital over the next 12 months. So from where we sit here today, we continue to build capital. We feel very good about our capital position. Ratios are healthy. Liquidity is healthy. And at the right time, we'll communicate a change in stance on that. But for now, steady as she goes.Alexander BlosteinGreat. And then there's one business that I was hoping to kind of double click into, which is Clearance and Collateral Management. We've seen really good growth there for the last several quarters now. I think it's up 11% year-to-date versus last year. Can you maybe help us unpack some of the sources of that growth, between sort of what's been really market and maybe somewhat elevated volumes, given everything that's been going on in treasuries versus more kind of baseline growth in that business as we're sort of thinking about the building off of this baseline?Dermot William McDonoghSo look, CCM, Clearance and Collateral Management, very big business for us. I would say a couple of things. A lot of volatility in the market this year, significant volumes, lots of treasury issuance, all of that is -- kind of helps that business. I think we continue to innovate as well internationally. And so we've spent a lot of time on the road with clients overseas. Because of our strength in the U.S., we feel that we have a lot of value to add in the international space. And so we kind of look to build our international business from here. I think in the medium term, we kind of still see that business continuing to grow, given the level of treasury issuance and what's happening in the market. So we kind of feel good about the underlying growth. Also, a lot of people might think of it as a kind of steady eddy type business, but I have to say the amount of innovation that we do under the hood in terms of serving our clients' needs with new solutions and how they can optimize their respective balance sheets and fund it on our platform is very, very pleasing to see. So we feel very good about the state of the business and the trajectory from here.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.Brennan HawkenI'd love to start on Pershing. I'm curious if you could maybe give a little color on what drove the strength in Pershing revenues. I know you flagged higher fees on sweep balances, but we're seeing other wealth management firms flagging headwinds there. So curious about whether or not you can provide some color on that and what's driving the resilience for Pershing. And then I know that it's going to be several quarters before we see the decommissioning that you referenced. Any sense you can give for size of that headwind that we should expect?Dermot William McDonoghSo on the last question first, we don't really give specific guidance on the deconversions. But look, as I said on an earlier question, we feel the underlying strength of the business, you're always going to take your lumps and things that happen that you wouldn't expect to happen. And we feel we have the ability and the confidence and the people and the strategy and the products to earn our way out of that. So Pershing is a very -- it's a very strong business for us. It's in our most profitable segment, Market and Wealth solutions. And we feel very good about the margin of that segment and of Pershing in particular. Just kind of double-clicking on your original question, there are many things that make up the fees that are coming into Pershing. They're transactional, which is kind of correlated to U.S. exchange volumes, asset-based based on equity market levels and balance-based. And so again, when you take the kind of portfolio approach that we have with our business and the different composition of the fees and then the amount of clients that we're onboarding, that kind of -- that leads you to a nice, good fee outcome for the business overall. And so look, Pershing is market-leading. We're #1 with broker-dealers. We're very important to the RIA community. We have a lot of excitement in the marketplace around our Wove product. And so we have -- that's attracting new clients to our system as well as existing clients who are excited about that product. And that gives us belief that by adding to our existing platform new products, we'll be able to be a more meaningful player than we are today.Robin Antony VinceAnd Brennan, I'll just add one thing. You used the term underlying momentum, I think, and it's very true in the business. If we've been on this call maybe a year ago, someone would probably have asked me, did I think that we could compete with the self-clearing changes that were going. I remember we had these conversations about the puts and takes of the various different flows in the market. Whereas this quarter, we announced Lincoln, who was self-clearing, joining our platform because they just see the benefits of the economies of scale that we can provide, the capabilities that we have and then, of course, with an eye to Wove and the opportunity to be able to really provide that adviser set of solutions in the same way as the classic Pershing platform provides the investor set of solutions. So we feel quite good about the feedback that we're getting. And remember as well that we have this relatively unconflicted business model in terms of the fact that we're not running our own large RIA sales force next to our business. And we think that some of our clients really appreciate that.Brennan HawkenYes. That's all very helpful color. And then I'd like to ask a follow-up question on the noninterest-bearing. So you flagged that there was some growth quarter-to-date. Is it possible to quantify or give us a rough idea about what kind of growth we'd be talking about? And are you also seeing corresponding growth in the overall deposit base along with the trend in the NIBs?Dermot William McDonoghSo I think I used the word modest in my prepared remarks for September off the seasonal lows. And I also used the word inflection point with the puts and takes between the level of activity as a result of March and the debt ceiling impasse. We kind of feel we've kind of reached a more natural level for deposits. And if you kind of go back to the remarks in January, we kind of went -- declined in the deposit base of kind of mid-single digits from where we were at the beginning of the year. And so that's really largely how it's played out with albeit a different zigzag to what we thought was going to be at the beginning of the year. And look, the important thing to walk away from the call with is we feel confident with the outlook and the guidance that we're giving today of 20%. And that's made up of a ton of different factors both on the deposit side and on the repricing on the asset side. So we kind of think of the 2 as very joined up and interlinked and don't really want to get into specific numbers, but we feel pretty good about where we're at.Brennan HawkenOkay. And are those trends applying to both the broad deposit base as well as the NIBs? Just...Dermot William McDonoghYes, I think it's fair to say that. Yes.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research.Robert Henry WildhackI appreciate the update on the strategic priorities. I'm curious on the do more for clients front. How is the progress you've made and are making there manifested itself so far? Are you seeing an uptick in organic growth, new business wins, anything like that? And then the obvious follow-on from there is when do you think that we could expect to see that progress manifest itself and whether see revenue growth or operating leverage more broadly?Robin Antony VinceYes, it's an important question, Rob. So the way that we have laid out be more for our clients internally is in a few different threads. So the first is delivering more to existing clients. And you've heard from us before on this. So many of our clients have a single business relationship with us, a single product, single solution. And so we just have the opportunity, frankly, to have them be able to do more things with us by connecting the dots and offering more to our current clients. I'll give you a stylized example. So if you're an Asset Servicing client today, you probably do some securities lending with us. You may or may not do some foreign exchange with us. If you do those 2 products with us, why wouldn't you do some margin segregation with us? If you do margin segregation with us, you're in our collateral ecosystem, why wouldn't you do more collateral management with us? If you're in that ecosystem, you're starting to touch the cash ecosystem, and so why wouldn't you also be open to some of the cash liquidity related solutions we have? And if you're touching that, you're adjacent to Treasury Services, and so why wouldn't you also be interested in some of our Treasury Services products? And so that's exactly -- the fact that we haven't done that is the ultimate manifestation of the problem with silos for a company like ours because our businesses are pretty adjacent to each other. So that is a very important focus. It is the top priority of our new Chief Commercial Officer, to really drive the operationalization of making all of that a reality as opposed to just a sort of an internal call to action in the company. The second thread is developing new products and connecting adjacent products so the -- and different than the first example, so the 2 things which are inextricably related to each other could potentially be sold as a solution. If you look elsewhere in the technology industry, there are often multiple pieces of software that are bundled into one aggregate solution, which is actually what clients buy. We haven't done as much of that because our products have been strewn across the company in their respective silos. So by being able to look more horizontally, we get to be able to gather up the products and think about the world a little bit more along the lines of solutions. And you've seen us do that with some of our Asset Servicing clients more recently, where we've done these bigger, more bundled deals. And there are more opportunities for that. And then the third opportunity is to just win more market share and brand-new clients. Now to be fair, we do know a lot of the clients that are out there in the world, 90% plus of Fortune 100 companies, 97% of global banks. So that's not the biggest opportunity of all of them, but we want to be in the hunting business as well. And so we'll go find those clients that we don't currently do business with and actually engage them as well. So there are a lot of threads under that whole umbrella of being more for clients.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.Gerard Sean CassidyRobin, can you expand upon your comments about FedNow? You touched on it how you're one of the early adopters who are in the test phase. And just what implications are once this goes live throughout the system?Robin Antony VinceSo immediate payments are one of those disruption opportunities that don't come along that often in the overall ecosystem. And you have to remember that the U.S. is actually less advanced in some respects in terms of the speed and the efficiency of payments versus some other large countries around the world. And so we look at this as saying, well, we have a large installed client base that's pretty rooted in some of the classic payment methods. We are a large check clearer. We're a large payments provider. And we also have a pretty unconflicted approach because we're not really in the credit card business, which creates a little bit of fee disruption risk if you are in that business to embracing instant payments. And so we identified this some years ago that this would be an opportunity that we would want to participate more in, and that's exactly what we've been doing. So we've been live on The Clearing House rails for a while. We're now live on the FedNow service. Those are essentially competitor instant payment services to each other. But now we are going to be focused, as I think the rest of the industry will be, on the network effect that's going to be required to really adopt these instant payment rails. And so we're a provider to small and midsized banks, helping them to access the rails. We think there are a bunch of things that you can do with these new rails that you couldn't do with some of the old rails. Request for payment is a great example, the opportunity to really deliver e-billing, instant requests for payments that can be met with instant perfectly timed payments. There's a lot of control there. There's also some security opportunities. Who wants to give their bank account and ABA number out and their credit card number out when you're dealing with various billing-based solutions?And so operationalizing all of that with our clients is important. We just launched Bankify, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. That allows consumers to be able to use these rails a little bit more efficiently. And so look, it's early days in this disruption, and I don't want to call exactly how and when it's going to occur. But we feel over time, this is a good new technology. And as we do see more network effect and these use cases start to go live, it provides a lot of client value. And so at the end of the day, I think that client value is going to win out, and we want to help them to do that.Gerard Sean CassidyGreat. And then Dermot, you touched on with deposits the challenges the banking system faced earlier in this year. And Bank of New York was looked at as a safe haven in some people's minds, and your deposits have reflected that as you pointed out. Can you share with us, if QT stays with the Fed through the end of next year, what kind of impact are you guys thinking that, that could have on deposits throughout 2024?Dermot William McDonoghSo I think it's a bit too early for me, Gerard, to kind of give you guidance for '24 on that. But like as I said earlier, we kind of feel we've reached a more kind of normalized level, given what happened in March and then the debt ceiling and who kind of knows what's going to happen from here. But our balance sheet is positioned for higher for longer. We have a lot of the balance sheet in cash. Our fixed income securities are going to roll off a quarter a year over the next few years. And the pickup in yield from that is about 200 to 300 basis points. So when we look at the balance sheet together, we kind of feel very good about our NII for the next while. January will be when we give you more detailed guidance for how we think about it for '24. But our deposit base and how our clients are in the ecosystem -- and look, if they're not with us for deposits, we want them to be in our Dreyfus Money Market Fund complex and be kind of using our products and services. So we don't want to lose the cash. We can put the cash into other products. So I think we feel very good about where the deposit franchise is now. We feel very good about the pipeline of activity that's coming our way. But who knows? And we are prepared and risk managed to a higher for longer continued QT, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.Robin Antony VinceAnd Gerard, just to add one point to that when it comes to the rates markets. We've avoided trying to have a crystal ball on exactly what it is going to -- that's going to happen. We said we think resilience is a commercial attribute for us. You highlighted the benefit of that resilience that we saw earlier on in the year as clients really came to us as a safe refuge. And obviously, we're very happy to help them with that. But that also means that we have views about what might happen. We have views about how we position our balance sheet. But ultimately, we are positioning to be able to deal with any of these eventualities. I was -- sat on a trading desk for the first 10 years of my career. And the current level of 10-year rates is kind of at the bottom end of the range over that period of time. So there's absolutely no reason why the curve can't move further from here. It's moved 100 basis points since mid-July at the 10-year point. And so we are positioning ourselves to be able to be adaptable to however the world is going to unfold. And Dermot commented on that when it came to our capital ratios earlier on. Now there are some things that have played out exactly as before, other things that have played out a little differently. I think the treasury has done a very good job in coordinating with the Fed as they have ramped up the issuance of bills in particular, and that has worked very gracefully with the roll down of essentially $1 trillion at this point of the RRP. So the interplay between reserves, between RRP, between the very high levels of issuance coming out of the treasury, these are all significant inputs. And our data shows us that there's actually been less foreign buying in the treasury market over the course of this year. And so there's going to be a supply and demand dynamic that's going to occur further out the curve, which I don't think anybody can predict, but you certainly have to be ready for the different ways that could play out.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.Brian Bertram BedellMaybe just a nuance on the net interest revenue by segment. So just the Securities Services versus the Market and Wealth segment. It looked like there was more pressure on the Securities Services business NII in -- versus the second quarter. Just wondering if that is more of the well in NIBs that you referenced, Dermot, in August? And if you think that might just normalize as we move into the fourth quarter? And, I guess, and/or are you doing things internally in terms of the growth initiatives that you just talked about, Robin, a couple of answers ago, that might accelerate the NIR in that segment much more rapidly over time?Dermot William McDonoghSo let me deal with the first question. So I would say there is nothing really noticeable underneath the hood that is nuanced that are -- is different by different segments. Like if you think about Asset Servicing -- our Issuer Services as a segment is made up of 3 businesses: Asset Servicing, Depositary Receipts and Corporate Trust. Corporate Trust as a business tends to attract a higher level of NIBs due to the nature of that business. Q3 would have been a seasonally quieter period for that business. Debt issuance activity was more muted. So that would explain a little bit of that. In Asset Servicing, I would just say like how clients are behaving with us at the moment in the ecosystem, but I wouldn't really call anything out that is kind of noticeably different. And we kind of think about our deposits as one platform kind of centrally managed under one roof, and that's how we kind of manage it.Brian Bertram BedellOkay. Great. And then just -- maybe just a follow-up on the -- actually in the other -- investment and other revenue. There's one area there that's been growing quite nicely sequentially for now 3 straight quarters. It's the Other trading revenue line. And the size of that is now -- if it continue with this type of growth for the next 2 or 3 quarters, you'll be approaching your FX trading revenues. I just wonder if you talk about the drivers of that and whether you see that type of growth path continuing.Dermot William McDonoghLook, the key feature of that business this quarter as it has been all of this year really has been the strength of our fixed income trading. You do have a little bit of seed capital gains in there as well, but it's predominantly the fixed income trading. So we feel very good about it in the overall kind of scheme of the quarter and the results. It's a small number in the big scheme of things, but we like what we have there.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.Glenn Paul SchorrI know we've touched on this throughout the question, so you can be brief, but I want to put it in a different package. So not lost on you, we've seen a lesser ability to predict or control client behavior from some of the peers when it comes to all things deposits. And so I don't know if there's a way to give it the attribution, but is there -- is it all related to your business mix and client base? Do you think your consolidated deposit efforts have actually moved the needle? Just trying to get inside your confidence relative to what we've seen elsewhere. And I don't know how much of that is depletion of nonoperating balances anyway, so now you know most of what's left is operating. Sorry, if repetitive.Dermot William McDonoghSo I will give you 2 dimensions to that answer, Glenn. One is we have a portfolio of businesses that attracts both interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposits, Corporate Trust, Treasury Services, Asset Servicing, Clearance and Collateral Management being the primary ones. They all have different characteristics about them, and they do things in slightly different ways. So it kind of gives you a portfolio effect so that you feel like you have a diversified deposit platform. I think that's important point number one.Important point number two is how we manage and price the deposits. If you came to BNY Mellon 3 years ago, you would have all of those deposits in different lines of business. They would have all handled their clients separately, they would have all priced their deposits separately and you would have ended up with suboptimal outcomes when you aggregate that up from the BNY Mellon's standpoint. Now we've got global liquidity solutions. It's one team, interfaces with each of the line of the businesses. But we price consistently, we manage consistently and we have a pipeline that we think of as one firm. I think you add all that together, you get the One BNY Mellon effect, you get the strategy effect and you get the line of business effect. And that gives us confidence that we have a good handle on our deposit franchise and where we want to be from here.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Rajiv Bhatia with Morningstar.Rajiv K. BhatiaGreat. So just following up on the deposit conversations. I mean, by my calculations, your deposit betas rose quite a bit in the quarter. I guess can you comment on what your U.S. dollar versus non-U.S. dollar deposit betas were in the quarter? And then how do your deposit betas differ across your lines of businesses such as Asset Servicing, issuer servicing, Pershing and payments?Dermot William McDonoghSo thanks for the question. I guess 75 of our book is dollars, 10 -- roughly 10 euro, roughly 10 sterling and the rest, other. As it relates to betas, I kind of think about it in cumulative beta terms. The cumulative beta of our dollar book is around 80%, which I think I said earlier, and that hasn't materially changed quarter-over-quarter. Sterling and euros are about 50%, 60%, respectively, give or take a little bit. And so we kind of feel as it relates to passing on the pricing, the clients that we have are sophisticated, largely passed on the prices as they come through. And it may grind a little bit higher from here. But overall, we feel pretty good about where the book is, where it's priced. You may see some modest catch-ups and lags here or there. But overall, we think it's where it should be, given what's happened in the market.Rajiv K. BhatiaGreat. And then like your deposit betas by like lines of business?Dermot William McDonoghI don't have that level of detail with me, so we can follow up with you offline.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global.James Francis MitchellJust a question. You guys have had a lot of success in improving the organic growth in things like Pershing, Collateral Management, but Investment Management has been sort of left out of that discussion. Long-term flows outside of liability management have been negative last year. So do you see an organic growth opportunity there? Are you investing in that business? And how do you improve that organic growth from here?Dermot William McDonoghThanks for the question, Jim. Look, we said on a couple of calls ago that where the margin of that business is at the moment, we feel we have work to do. We're not happy with it. There are a bunch of things that have happened last year that are feeding into this year that have caused a kind of remixing by our clients out of active strategies into passive, which are lower fee paying out of equities into fixed income. So there's rebalancing going on under the hood, and we're kind of attacking it in a number of different ways. One being kind of getting after structural expense inefficiencies. We've talked a lot about that today, and that's -- this segment is no different to that. So we're attacking it there. We're rolling out new products, and that's going to take time to build AUM, but do that in a first-class way. We kind of think organic growth will come on the back of that. Inside of BNY Mellon, we have a very kind of powerful distribution platform. So we're very focused on kind of really energizing the distribution platforms to support our kind of boutique asset managers. And we've made some leadership changes there this year, and we're going to begin to see the fruits of that in the coming quarters. So we're kind of going at it in a number of different ways. And some of the asset management boutiques are performing very well, and we're very happy with them. And some of them have work to do, and we're very focused on it, and we're not sitting idle wishing it to happen. We're active in trying to make it happen.OperatorAnd our final question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.Michael Lawrence MayoJust as a follow-up. You've been giving a lot of optimism. I know you have to execute, but you said you're bending the cost curve, NII should do pretty well, the way you're positioned for rates, you're investing for growth, you're shooting for positive operating leverage next year. So it's -- all sounds pretty good. When you think about the risk to the company over the next year, what are the main risks that come to mind that you think you need to pay a little extra attention to, whether it's macro or micro?Robin Antony VinceSo I'll just start, Mike, with the way that you set up the initial part of the question. You're right, we are optimistic about the potential that we have in the company and the opportunities that our franchise and our businesses afford us. Now we haven't lived up to that potential. But the reason why you detect the optimism, I think, in the way that we talk about it is because we do have an inherent optimism that this is absolutely a doable proposition to unlock that potential. Now it's a ton of work. As Dermot just said in answer to a different question, we're not going to wish our way there. And maybe that's one of the things that we've really doubled down on now as a leadership team is that we have to work the problem. And we have to work the problem through all of these different angles in order to really be able to unlock the potential. And as I said in my prepared remarks, there's a cultural change that we need to create in the company to take what has otherwise been a great culture, but take it to the next level, power it forward that really allows us to de-silo and operate more broadly across the board. And you and I just talked about that a few minutes ago. We have to execute to get it done. So of course, it follows from that, that if really evolving the culture to de-silo and to move towards this platform mindset and getting things done in execution are critical to us unlocking our potential, then the biggest risk in the company in some respects from an internal point of view become not doing those things. So we are laser-focused on doing those things, tracking those things and as a leadership team, really coming together to make sure that we're holding each other to account for the respective parts that everybody in the leadership team of the company plays in moving that forward. So that's the reason for the optimism but also the reason for the constant humility associated with the fact that it's execution that's going to get the job done. Now in terms of the outside world, there's clearly a ton going on in the world. We've got geopolitical tensions through a continuum, all the way to war in many regions of the world right now. We have all of the uncertainty still of rates and inflation in the economy here in the U.S. that creates uncertainties. There's the ever-present cyber risk, which we always take very seriously. And those things are always collectively on our minds. We don't pretend to predict exactly how things are going to occur.

Dollar Tree (DLTR) stock rises on an upgrade from Goldman Sachs forecasting a strong upside on the discount retailer's growth strategy. Lastly, activist investment firm Engaged Capital is taking a stake in V.F. Corporation (VFC), whose brand portfolio includes Vans and North Face.Yahoo Finance Live anchors Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton take a closer look at several stocks after Tuesday's closing bell.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: Let's get to some other movers we are watching and we want to start with one that also had to do with earnings. That is Bank of New York Mellon out with a beat on the top and bottom line. While deposits slid for the quarter, executives on the earnings call said that deposits are likely to moderate going forward. In other words, they're not going to be falling by the same pace.This is a similar situation to what we saw with Charles Schwab yesterday where deposits are still falling, but the rate of decline is slowing. And that maybe there's some sort of trough that investors are looking for when it comes to deposits here. The company also says its assets under custody or administration were $45.7 trillion at the end of September. That was actually down a little bit from the end of June. So it's not just, sort of, consumer deposits it's also its assets under management or under custody.JOSH LIPTON: But you can see that well in the green. I think you nailed it. I mean, the key here does seem to be the bank is saying total deposits, yes, they dropped 5% in the quarter. But then execs on the call seemed to indicate that, yes, this is likely to stabilize going forward. I think that's what investors really clued in on. Also, they did reaffirm their growth targets in 2023.Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: Yeah.JOSH LIPTON: Moving on, Goldman Sachs points to a potential 20% upside for Dollar Tree. Analysts upgrading the discount store to buy from neutral and boosted the price target as well. The firm noting it sees strong earnings growth potential driven by gains in market share and sticky inflation reels in low and middle-income consumers.So Goldman now fans-- actually not just of Dollar Tree, which you say, but actually their fans have Dollar Tree and Ollie's Bargain Outlet. They go to buy on both those names, Julie, . It seems like what they like here is a couple of things they like the value offerings. They like the easier comps and they like what they see as attractive valuations.By the way, they also downgraded BJ's Wholesale to neutral saying other names look more compelling in their universe. You can see some of the pops there.JULIE HYMAN: You know, it's really interesting to me here because, on the one hand, there's been this thesis that these various discount retailers would benefit during a time of economic weakness and yet they're all down year to date, including Dollar Tree, which you can see is off by 18% So so much for that kind of phenomenon helping things here.And then finally, wrapping it up with VF Corp, those shares jumping in today's session. The move coming after activist investment firm Engaged Capital took a stake in the company. Engaged Capital pushing for cost cuts and changes to the board for VF Corp, which is the owner of brands like Vans and North Face.But those shares higher by 14%. VF saying in a statement to us, they're aware of Engaged Capital's investment in the company and the comments. And they said, ""We value the views of our shareholders and seek to maintain an open dialogue with the investment community."" So not--JOSH LIPTON: Exactly what you should say.JULIE HYMAN: --you know, not saying go away, but not saying come here either, right, which is, kind of, treading the line.JOSH LIPTON: So basically, it sounds like Engaged Capital is saying, listen, we want to build a stake. We want you to make divestitures and we want you to pay down debt, which Bloomberg says, by their math, now amounts to about $8 billion as of July. So this is the company that control Vans. They control North Face, and Dickies. They did hire this new CEO over the summer as well as you were dealing with softer sales growth.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, exactly.]"

It will decide on Nov. 17.Althea Spinozzi, senior fixed income strategist at Saxo Bank, said the likely jump in Italian bond yields if Moody's pulls the trigger ""would virtually force the European Central Bank to intervene.""TOO BIG TO DOWNGRADE?However Spinozzi added that the consequences of Italian debt being relegated to junk would probably be enough to convince the agency to hold off, a view shared by some other analysts.""A downgrade would have some fairly significant ramifications for peripheral debt in general,"" said Jim Leaviss at fund manager M&amp;G Investments.""Given the scale of what a downgrade would do I think the hurdle for Moody's to do it is pretty high.""Italian Economy Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti, speaking to reporters last week at an international gathering in Morocco, said he did not fear a downgrade but he was aware of the risk.""Who can rule it out? Can I rule out that I'll trip if I start walking?,"" he said.The contrast between Italy and other peripheral euro zone countries is striking, reflected in the fact that unlike during previous periods of market stress in 2008 and 2011, Italian bond spreads versus Germany are now the widest.Greece last month regained investment-grade status from DBRS, while Portugal got a ratings upgrade from Fitch and an outlook improvement from S&amp;P Global and Moody's.The International Monetary Fund last week forecast Italian growth at just 0.7% for next year, the lowest in the euro zone and well below Spain, Portugal and Greece.Still higher yields would make it more expensive for Rome to service its huge public debt, equal to around 140% of national output.Next year Rome will have to sell some 548 billion euros ($580 billion) of bonds, 46 billion more than in 2023, according to calculations by Intesa Sanpaolo.Nevertheless, Giovanni Radicella, fixed income head at fund manager Arca Fondi, said a full-blown Italian crisis remained unlikely.""One reason to buy a country is the risk premium. And when it reaches a new fair value it will lure back buyers and the sell off would be contained,"" he said.($1 = 0.9443 euros)(additional reporting by Valentina Consiglio and Dhara Ranasinghe, graphics by Stefano Bernabei, editing by Gavin Jones and Toby Chopra)]"

They chanted ""Hey hey, ho ho, exploitation's gotta go,"" according to a livestream of the event on Facebook.Tyson, the biggest U.S. meat company by sales, said it respects people’s right to protest peacefully and encourages employees to raise concerns with the company. It did not comment on child labor allegations. The company's code of conduct says suppliers are expected to ensure they do not use child labor.Magaly Licolli, an organizer of the rally, said Tyson needs to do more to keep kids out of its supply chain.""Tyson keeps avoiding the subject by saying that they are not hiring directly the workers,"" said Licolli, the director of Venceremos, an organization that advocates for poultry workers in Arkansas.Licolli said she helped two teenage boys from Guatemala recover wages after they were hired by a contractor to gather chickens on a farm that supplied Tyson and were not initially paid. Tyson did not comment on the incident.The U.S. Department of Labor said in February that a major food safety sanitation company paid $1.5 million in penalties for employing more than 100 teenagers at meatpacking plants, including two Tyson facilities in Arkansas and Tennessee.The Labor Department on Monday confirmed its Wage and Hour Division has investigations open at Tyson and Perdue Farms, when asked about reports that migrant children were used to clean slaughterhouses.Demonstrators at the rally also called on Tyson to slow speeds on processing lines in chicken plants, carrying a banner that read ""Slow down the line, keep workers in mind.""

185,e309548f-0c74-355e-823c-f0bbcad4be1a,TSN,2023-10-18,Nu Holdings and Tyson Foods have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nu-holdings-tyson-foods-highlighted-124400744.html,1697546640,STORY,"['TSN', 'PFE', 'NU']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – October 17, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Nu Holdings Ltd. NU as the Bull of the Day and Tyson Foods TSN as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Pfizer PFE and BioNTech BNTX.Here is a synopsis of all four stocks.Bull of the Day:Nu Holdings Ltd., a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is an international provider of digital banking services. NU shares are widely outperforming the market this year with the backing of a leading industry group. The stock is hitting a series of 52-week highs and displaying relative strength as buying pressure accumulates in this highly-ranked stock.Operating at the intersection of technology and financial services, Nu Holdings is part of the Zacks Technology Services industry group. This group ranks in the top 38% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. Because it is ranked in the top half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect this group to outperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months. The industry has been steadily outperforming the market this year with a 25.7% return.Historical research studies suggest that approximately half of a stock’s price appreciation is due to its industry grouping. In fact, the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. It’s no secret that investing in stocks that are part of leading industry groups can give us a leg up relative to the market. By focusing on leading stocks within the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries, we can dramatically improve our stock-picking success.Company DescriptionNu Holdings provides digital financial services in Brazil, Mexico, Columbia, as well as internationally. The company offers credit and debit cards, mobile payment solutions, and savings solutions for individuals and businesses.In addition, the company offers NuCrypto, which enables the buying and selling of cryptocurrencies through the Nu app; NuInvest, an investment product that provides equity, fixed-income, options and ETF products; and NuInsurance, an insurance offering that helps customers secure life insurance and funeral benefits. Nu Holdings was founded in 2013 and is headquartered in Sao Paulo, Brazil.Story continuesEarnings Trends and Future EstimatesNU has built up an impressive earnings history, surpassing earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters. Back in August, the company reported second-quarter earnings of $0.06/share, a 50% surprise over the $0.04/share consensus estimate. NU has delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 120.83%.Analysts covering NU are in agreement and have been increasing their earnings estimates as of late. For the current fiscal year, analysts have increased earnings estimates by 23.53% in the past 60 days. The 2023 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate now stands at $0.21/share, reflecting a staggering potential growth rate of 425% relative to the prior year. Revenues are projected to surge 61.9% to $7.76 billion.Let’s Get TechnicalNU shares have advanced nearly 95% this year. This is the kind of stock we want to include in our portfolio – one that is trending well and receiving positive earnings estimate revisions.Notice how the 200-day (red line) moving average is sloping up. The stock has been making a series of higher highs and recently climbed back above its 50-day moving average (blue line). With both strong fundamentals and technicals, NU is poised to continue its outperformance.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. As we know, Nu Holdings has recently witnessed positive revisions. As long as this trend remains intact (and NU continues to deliver earnings beats), the stock will likely continue its bullish run into the end of this year and beyond.Bottom LineThe future looks bright for this highly-ranked, leading stock. Momentum has picked up in October as the market attempts to regain its footing.Backed by a leading industry group and impressive history of earnings beats, it’s not difficult to see why this company is a compelling investment. Robust fundamentals combined with an appealing technical trend certainly justify adding shares to the mix.Bear of the Day:Tyson Foods is a processor and marketer of chicken, pork, and beef. The company has been struggling due to high inflation and low pricing power for its product offerings. Tyson Foods has witnessed elevated input costs and has been dealing with weak margins for several quarters. Weakness in the consumer staples sector has also contributed to poor stock performance.A member of the S&amp;P 500, Tyson Foods manufactures and markets its products under recognized brand names such as Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, and Ball Park. The company sells its products in more than 80 countries through its sales staff to grocery retailers and wholesalers, meat distributors, chain restaurants, convenience stores and hospitals. Tyson Foods was founded in 1935 and is headquartered in Springdale, AR.The Zacks RundownTSN stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and is a component of the Zacks Food – Meat Products industry group, which ranks in the bottom 9% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. As such, we expect this industry group as a whole to underperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months, just as it has over the course of the year.Candidates in the bottom tiers of industries can often be potential short candidates. While individual stocks have the ability to outperform even when included in a poorly-performing industry group, the inclusion in a weaker group serves as a headwind for any potential rallies and the journey forward is that much more difficult.Despite the underperformance this year, stocks in this group remain relatively overvalued.As a part of this group, TSN stock has experienced considerable volatility in 2023. Shares recently touched a 52-week low even as the market has bounced off the September lows.Recent Earnings Misses and Deteriorating OutlookTSN has fallen short of earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters. The food company most recently reported fiscal third-quarter earnings back in August of $0.15/share, missing the $0.34/share consensus EPS estimate by 55.9%. Earnings plunged 92.3% from the same quarter in the prior year.Tyson Foods has missed earnings estimates by an average of 50.5% over the past four quarters. Consistently falling short of earnings estimates is a recipe for underperformance, and TSN is no exception.The company has been on the receiving end of negative earnings estimate revisions as of late. For the current fiscal year, analysts have decreased estimates by 3.79% in the past 60 days. The fiscal 2023 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate now stands at $1.27/share, translating to negative growth of -85.5% relative to last year.Falling earnings estimates are a huge red flag and need to be respected. Negative growth year-over-year is the type of trend that bears like to see.Technical OutlookTSN stock is in a sustained downtrend. Shares have plunged below both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The stock is making a series of lower lows, with no respite from the selling in sight. Both moving averages have rolled over and are sloping down – another good sign for the bears.While not the most accurate indicator, TSN stock has also experienced what is known as a ‘death cross’, wherein the stock’s 50-day moving average crosses below its 200-day moving average. Tyson Foods would have to make a serious move to the upside and show increasing earnings estimate revisions to warrant taking any long positions in the stock. TSN shares have fallen more than 24% in the past year alone.Final ThoughtsA deteriorating fundamental and technical backdrop show that this stock is not set to hit new highs anytime soon. The fact that TSN is included in one of the worst-performing industry groups provides yet another headwind to a long list of concerns. A history of earnings misses will likely serve as a ceiling to any potential rallies, nurturing the stock’s downtrend.Shares continue to experience substantial volatility and have widely underperformed this year. With negative earnings estimate revisions continuing to pile up, this stock should be avoided as there are plenty of better alternatives in the current market environment.Additional content:Pfizer (PFE) Cuts 2023 Outlook as Covid Product Demand FallsPfizer slashed its previously issued revenue guidance for 2023 due to lower-than-expected demand for its COVID products, COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty, and its oral antiviral pill for COVID, Paxlovid.Pfizer records direct sales and alliance revenues from its partner, BioNTech for Comirnaty, and product revenues from Paxlovid.The revenue guidance was lowered from $67.0 to $70.0 billion to $58.0 to $61.0 billion, which includes a $7 billion cut in Paxlovid revenues and a $2 billion reduction in Comirnaty revenues. The earlier revenue guidance included approximately $13.5 billion in sales from Comirnaty and Paxlovid sales of approximately $8 billion. Full-year 2023 combined revenues for Paxlovid and Comirnaty are now expected to be approximately $12.5 billion compared with $21.5 billion expected previously.Excluding COVID-19 products, Pfizer continues to expect its revenues to rise 6% to 8% on an operational basis in 2023 as sales from non-COVID drugs remain strong. With the demand for COVID products coming in lower than expected, Pfizer announced cost cuts, including layoffs, which are expected to deliver targeted savings of at least $3.5 billion. Of this, approximately $1.0 billion is expected to be realized in 2023 and at least $2.5 billion is expected to be realized in 2024.In the third quarter, Pfizer will record a non-cash charge of $5.5 billion as COVID inventory write-offs in the cost of goods sold. As a result of the lower-than-expected COVID revenues and the inventory write-offs, adjusted EPS is expected in the range of $1.45 to $1.65, down from $3.25 to $3.45 expected previously.Pfizer’s shares were down almost 2.5% on Friday in response to the guidance cut. Pfizer’s stock has declined 37.4% so far this year against an increase of 8.5% for the industry.Pfizer said it has amended its supply agreement with the U.S. government for Paxlovid and the latter will return approximately 7.9 million treatment courses of Emergency Use Authorized (EUA)-labeled U.S. government inventory at the end of 2023. In exchange, the U.S. government will receive credit for future NDA-labeled treatment courses from Pfizer.From the beginning of 2024, Pfizer will begin selling Paxlovid in traditional commercial markets in the United States, with prices to be negotiated with payers. Earlier. Pfizer had said it will transition from government markets to commercial markets by the second half of 2023.Pfizer reduced its 2023 outlook for Paxlovid due to the $4.2 billion non-cash revenue reversal for the return as well as the delay in transition to the commercial market, as discussed in the previous parah. The Comirnaty guidance was lowered by $2 billion due to lower-than-expected vaccination rates.During the pandemic, Pfizer gave the world the first and most widely used vaccine, Comirnaty, and an oral treatment for COVID-19, Paxlovid. The profits that Pfizer generated from its COVID products in 2021 and 2022 strengthened its cash position, which is being used to make acquisitions, increase dividends, buy back shares and reduce debt. The cash enabled it to acquire Arena, ReViral, Biohaven and Global Blood Therapeutics in 2022.It also allowed Pfizer to increase investments in R&amp;D and SI&amp;A to support its expected new product launches. Overall, the profits and cash from COVID products allowed Pfizer to invest in support of its growth plans for the second half of this decade.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderPfizer currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Pfizer Inc. price-consensus-chart | Pfizer Inc.

186,c66d5ce7-983d-34a9-b1ec-132cd27df19e,SYF,2023-10-18,Earnings Preview: Synchrony (SYF) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-synchrony-syf-q3-140056572.html,1697551256,STORY,"['TFIN', 'SYF']","[Synchrony (SYF) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 24. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis consumer credit company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.46 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -0.7%.Revenues are expected to be $4.3 billion, up 9.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4.36% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Synchrony?For Synchrony, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.70%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Synchrony will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Synchrony would post earnings of $1.22 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.32, delivering a surprise of +8.20%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Synchrony doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry, Triumph Financial (TFIN) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.37 per share for the quarter ended September 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -40.3%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $107.58 million, down 3% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Triumph Financial has been revised 12.7% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -2.70%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Triumph Financial will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Mastercard is bringing the promise of open banking to more consumers and small businesses, enabling them to permission the sharing of their financial data between trusted parties.The promise of open banking cannot be realized without trust. As more people manage their finances online, the digital landscape is evolving to safeguard against account takeovers and synthetic identity fraud, which can lead to significant financial losses. In fact, consumers in the U.S. and Canada lost $3.2 billion from fraudulently opened accounts in 2022. To help, Mastercard is harnessing AI to protect more than 125 billion payment transactions every year, underpinned by its data responsibility principles: you own your data, you control it, you should benefit from the use of it and we protect it.Easing the burden of online bill paymentsAs consumers look for more choice in how they pay – particularly for recurring payments – they also expect those payments to be frictionless and secure. To scale account-based payments, Mastercard is working with partners like J.P. Morgan Payments on its Pay-by-bank solution, which uses Mastercard’s open banking technology to take the pain out of recurring biller and merchant payments made via ACH – from rent and utilities to government and insurance payments.To further scale and modernize payments, Mastercard is now partnering with Worldpay so consumers can permission their data to be shared (not stored) seamlessly between trusted parties and securely pay bills directly from their bank account. Mastercard’s open banking technology removes the friction associated with manually typing in routing and account numbers each time. It also automates consumer onboarding for billers and merchants and reduces the risks and costs of storing bank account information. In addition, Worldpay will tap into Mastercard’s account owner verification capabilities to support merchants in the onboarding process.Story continues""We are delighted to partner with Mastercard to leverage their open banking platform in the U.S. to offer secure and seamless account verification services, providing our customers with enhanced payment options and advance open banking around the world,"" said Sudev Balakrishnan, chief product officer at Worldpay Merchant Solutions, FIS.Driving responsible lending and increasing access to capitalThrough a new partnership with Zip, Mastercard’s open banking technology, provided by its U.S. open banking arm Finicity, will enhance the real-time underwriting process of Zip’s lending program. Together, the companies are helping consumers more easily budget for larger purchases that can be paid over time1.""Zip is valued for helping customers with managing their expenses and providing access to a financial cushion in times of unexpected expenses,"" said Larry Diamond, co-founder and U.S. CEO of Zip. ""Our partnership with Mastercard helps us continue to deliver a positive payment experience for our customers.""When it comes to lending, small businesses also face obstacles getting access to capital. In the U.S., 52% of small businesses say their financing needs aren’t met. Earlier this year, Mastercard added advanced analytics to its open banking services to help lenders manage their risk profiles, while adding inclusive credit models for small business loans, including ongoing monitoring and expansion of credit lines.""Open banking solutions can speed up the lending process so consumers and SMEs are able to get quick access to funds they need and get back to running their businesses and completing purchases,"" said Daniel Keyes, senior analyst at Javelin Strategy &amp; Research. ""It’s particularly important that SMEs and consumers are only given funds that they’re in a position to pay back, and open banking can help make sure underwriters have access to the financial information needed so neither ends up overextended.""Scaling open banking across the globeMastercard is co-innovating with partners across the ecosystem to establish broad connectivity and data services to support customers, including access to more than 95% of deposit accounts in the U.S. and 3,000 banks across Europe. Mastercard also recently announced a partnership with European-wide investment platform Saxo Bank, which enables Saxo Bank customers to seamlessly add money to their investment accounts through an embedded platform using open banking.""We’re accelerating our open banking connectivity across the U.S., Australia and Europe, leaning into the breadth of Mastercard’s global network, expertise in data and privacy, and trust of our brand,"" said Jess Turner, executive vice president, Global Open Banking &amp; API at Mastercard. ""We’re providing more payment choice, redefining how identity is established and authenticated, and opening doors to tailored solutions that will revolutionize financial experiences.""Mastercard at Money20/20 USAJoin Mastercard at Money20/20 in Las Vegas from October 22-25 to experience how Mastercard is driving the future of finance through simple, safe and smart solutions. Throughout the show, the Mastercard booths (#6800 and #6910) at the Venetian Convention &amp; Expo Center will showcase interactive demos highlighting open banking and payment innovations including AI, fraud prevention and more.About Mastercard (NYSE: MA)Mastercard is a global technology company in the payments industry.

Test scores in math and literacy confirm that far fewer children are achieving proficiency levels in core curricula. A recent study states it will take five or more years for many older children to recover from pandemic learning loss.1Despite introducing technology to more classrooms around the globe, too often we find that educators embrace analog thinking when applying digital solutions.If all we do is substitute textbooks and worksheets for digital texts and portable document files (aka PDFs), we haven't changed learning - we've merely figured out how to spend more money to do the same old thing.Over the last decade, I have visited hundreds of kindergarten through grade 12 classrooms and university lecture halls across several countries. Even among the technology-rich institutions and countries, many remained caught in a time capsule. I typically see students:Typing in a word processing application (keyboarding is still in most curriculum);Typing text and pasting images they found online into presentation slides; orReading, watching and possibly responding to multiple choice questions in some web-based content created by a publisher.Our responsibility is to rethink the concepts of teaching and learning, employing the best practices to deliver meaningful academic outcomes.The history of passive versus active learningIn the 1960s, educational researcher Edgar Dale released his now-famous Cone of Experience.2 What he was trying to convey was those passive methods of learning - such as learning by listening, reading or watching - delivered poor results. However, he stated that when the learner is more actively involved in the process - such as through discussion, simulation or teaching others - that learner is likely to master the concepts faster and retain the information longer.Story continuesWhat learning method is more effective for students?I reflect back to when I was a fourth-grade student at Rushmore Elementary School on Long Island, New York. I think my classroom experience mirrored that of many who are reading this article. What did a typical day in school comprise?The teacher lectured us on a given topic in front of a chalkboard.We read from textbooks.And if it was a good day, we would get to see a filmstrip or movie.Now let's jump ahead to a technology-rich classroom pre-, during and post-COVID. How did technology change this learning?Teachers continue to lecture to students in front of an interactive flat panel, or the students watch previously recorded lectures created by educators.Students read from digital textbooks.And if it's a good day, they get to watch YouTube videos.Now, if we were to compare these teaching and learning strategies from the 1970s to today, we can observe that many of the techniques define learning as a passive experience for the student. We continue to listen, read and watch, which are the very strategies that Dale defined at least 50 years ago as delivering the worst results. Meanwhile, we've invested in expensive technology to support these strategies with digital tools, but we continue to rely on analog learning. And when schools invest significantly in technology and fail to see any improvement in academic outcomes, this remains the root of the problem.Bringing active learning methods into the classroomIf we re-examine the teachings of Dale, we see that more active methods of teaching and learning - Learning by Doing - empowers students to understand the relevance, while processing the knowledge in a very different and more effective way. Fortunately, there's a technological solution that embraces digital pedagogy at its roots, setting the stage for accelerated learning and greater results.Virtual Reality (VR) remains an outlier in schools and countries, but it shows the greatest potential for students to gain mastery in complex concepts faster and with greater retention.Recent studies involving major corporations have shown that students can be trained four times faster than traditional methods.3 Further, learners are significantly more confident in applying the skills learned because of hands-on simulations. Why does VR deliver far more effective learning experiences versus traditional analog teaching methods?Rather than trying to process abstract concepts, students complete purposeful experiences that help them understand in more tangible ways.VR allows students to see the cause and effect of right and wrong answers, bringing greater levels of understanding to the topic. Even when they make a mistake, they learn from it.VR makes learning more emotionally relevant by witnessing lessons firsthand.How VR can improve learning outcomesIf we can apply VR to skills such as those across science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics - aka STEAM learning - imagine the possibilities for the next generation of students. VR cannot remain solely used among early adopters for an occasional game or class activity. If integrated into the core curriculum, we can help more students gain mastery in areas such as literacy and math, areas that continue to remain a challenge for many nations.A recent study by WestEd, conducted during the 2022-2023 school year, helped demonstrate the impact of VR use in math instruction.4 Students who supplemented their instruction with VR content from publisher Prisms of Reality witnessed an 11% improvement in test scores when compared to the control group of students.But as we stretch the definition of the learning space and what can and should occur in classrooms, we open the door to limitless possibilities. Technologies that can reshape teaching and learning include many new innovations that Qualcomm Technologies is helping shape for future generations, including immersive VR simulations, drone and robotic technologies, machine learning and artificial intelligence.Our mantra ""Engineering Human Progress"" showcases our desire to help transform learning in classrooms across the globe. With more than 1.6 billion students in the world today, their learning is the greatest natural resource to benefit our world in the years to come.1: Elementary students are recovering faster from Covid learning loss, research shows.

Released today, a report from Expedia, Hotels.com, and Vrbo found that almost half (42 per cent) of Canadian sports fans were more likely to travel and see a game on the road rather than attending a game at home or in their closest sports city1.The Sports Travel Road Game Report also found that the average fan takes approximately three sports trips per year, and that 80 per cent of fans are looking to take either the same or more trips in the upcoming year than they did the previous year.Fans prioritized sports travel over dining at restaurants and going to concerts and reported spending on average $4,294 per year on sports trips (including travel, accommodation, tickets and food). For football fans, the cost per trip was said to be approximately $500 higher than the average fan trip, while hockey fans estimate an average spend of $1,291 per trip.""The amount sports fans are willing to spend may seem surprising to non-sports fans until you realize it's not just about the match — a game on the schedule gives some fans the reason they need to actually book and take their vacation, turning 'someday' into a reality,"" says Melanie Fish, head of PR for Expedia Group Brands. ""We combined the power of Expedia, Hotels.com, and Vrbo to get a comprehensive look at what's inspiring Canadian sports fans to travel, whether those fans are booking packages, a last-minute room on Hotels.com to see their team clinch a playoff spot or booking a Vrbo to stay with your fellow fans.""Fans reported hockey (47 per cent), baseball (21 per cent), soccer (21 per cent) and basketball (21 per cent) were the top sports they were looking to travel and watch in person over the next 12 months, and many were just as likely to travel for American pro football as they are for Canadian football (16 per cent).Story continuesWhile the majority (72 per cent) of fans said the game itself was the best part of being there in person, there are other reasons the in-person experience has so much appeal over watching games on a screen:Cheering along with the crowd (55 per cent)The chance to gather socially with friends and family (47 per cent)In-game entertainment (30 per cent)For specialty events like awards ceremonies and outdoor games, almost half (45 per cent) reported they were more likely to travel for these occasions than regular games. In fact, Expedia flight data shows bookings for Nashville, Tenn., saw an increase of 135 per cent during pro hockey's annual awards festivities3 in June 2023 when compared to the previous week.As for where Canadians are travelling to, Toronto came in as the most desired destination in the world for Canadian sports fans.

Forty-two percent have planned a sports trip around a birthday.When it came to deciding where to stay or what activities to do, 64 per cent said they felt inspired by athlete and team social media accounts and would add a featured activity or hotel to their itinerary. Soccer fans (80 per cent), esports fans (78 per cent), and hockey fans (64 per cent) were the most likely to be influenced by athletes on social media. Regardless of fandom, Gen Z was most inclined to find trip inspiration from athletes (79 per cent), and the breakdown between men and women was nearly even (67 per cent versus 66 per cent, respectively).All-star accommodation Over half of fans (53 per cent) said proximity to the arena was very important to them, but 44 per cent also wanted lodging to be close to other tourist attractions, proving that sports trips aren't just about the games themselves. Other top amenities for fans included complimentary breakfast (41 per cent) and discounted nightly rates (34 per cent).The majority of fans also admitted they're willing to shell out more on accommodation that's closer to the arena (73 per cent). Those aged 55+ were most interested in closer accommodation, but they were also the group least willing to pay extra for it.Fans were also interested in staying in vacation rentals, like Vrbo, where they could stay together and enjoy private amenities such as pools and hot tubs. Almost three quarters (72 per cent) of respondents said they would consider booking a vacation rental for an upcoming sports trip.Hotels.com fan-approved hotels:Hotels.com put together a list of great hotels for sports fans in the top desired destinations, ranging from suite rooms inside the ballpark to rooftop jumbotron viewing pools.Toronto: With several pro sports teams playing out of the city, Toronto is a great spot to get your sports fix. The Rogers Centre and Scotiabank arena are located on the same street, with the Hockey Hall of Fame just a few blocks away. In February 2024, Toronto will play host to the NHL All-Star game for the ninth time in history, and the first time since 2000. Hotels.com recommends: Toronto Marriott City Centre for its spectacular stadium views and ballpark room service eats.New York: Hosting some of the most storied and historic franchises, New York is a must for sports travellers. Take a tour of Yankee Stadium or Madison Square Garden or enjoy a game at one of the city's many sports bars. Hotels.com recommends: Renaissance New York Midtown Hotel for its proximity — only 0.4 km from Madison Square Garden.Montreal: Montrealers are passionate, and it's no surprise that this extends to their sports teams. The city hosted the Olympic games in 1976, and travellers can still visit Olympic Park to see some of the sites. Nostalgic hockey fans can visit the iconic Montreal Forum which is now a mall, but still houses pieces of its past. Hotels.com recommends: Le Centre Sheraton Montreal which is one block away from the Bell Centre.Las Vegas: With new teams playing out of Sin City, and a state-of-the-art stadium dominating the skyline, Las Vegas continues to grow as a top sports destination. Fans can enjoy the flashy and over-the-top game entertainment at any of the venues, as well as sports experiences like Top Golf. Hotels.com Recommends: Circa Resort &amp; Casino where spectators can enjoy watching a game on the 43.5-meter jumbotron from the comfort of the rooftop pool.Vancouver: Vancouver's Olympic legacy shines as brightly as the Olympic Cauldron located at Canada Place. Playing host to one of Canada's biggest international sports moments when both the women's and men's hockey teams secured gold on home soil, many sports fans still flock to the sites. Hotels.com recommends: Hotel Blu Vancouver, just a five-minute walk from BC Place.Expedia's fan-tastic activities: Since sports trips aren't just about watching games, Expedia curated an activity list based on top destinations that sports fans are sure to enjoy.Hockey Hall of Fame - Toronto, Ont.: browse hockey memorabilia, practice your shot, and get your picture taken with hockey's most iconic trophies.Madison Square Garden All Access Tour - New York, N.Y.: head behind the scenes at the home of some of the most prolific pro sports teams and concerts.Montreal Old Port Craft Brewery Tour - Montreal, Que.: learn about Montreal's rich brewing history while pairing delicious local cheeses with local craft beers.Las Vegas Strip Helicopter Tour with Dining Experience - Las Vegas, Nev.: soar over the skyline to see the newest stadiums, including the famous MSG Sphere, lit up at night.Gastown Historic Walking Food Tour - Vancouver, B.C.: eat your way through one of Vancouver's oldest areas, including Canadian poutine, Japanese karaage chicken and local craft beer.A Vrbo for every fan trip: For sports fans that like to travel in packs, Vrbo properties provide ample space to spread out and enjoy premium amenities like private pools, big screen TV's and full, modern kitchens for pregame snacks. Because Vrbo only provides whole, private homes, fans will never have to worry about sharing a space with their rivals. Check out these Vrbo sports trip and accommodation types:Fan cave faves: Decked-out properties like this hog-wild Retreat in Fayetteville, Ariz., or this purple and orange Dream Cottage in Clemson, S.C., let you show off your team spirit while living like a local. Wear your team colours proudly, from your jersey to your vacation space.Golf foursome friendcations: Heading to the links with friends? Sharing a Vrbo, foursomes can stay together and save money. This large home in Inverness, N.S., is only a 10-minute drive from Cabot Links and averages $650 per night, meaning each person pays $163 before taxes and still gets their own room, access to shared spaces, a full kitchen, and a backyard. Golf trip tip: in the Vrbo app, type the name of the golf course into the search bar to get properties in the area, and then filter for number of rooms.Sports complex superstars: For those who love to play sports, Vrbo has an abundance of properties to enjoy your own personal playground, like this luxury celebrity estate in Scottsdale, Ariz. From indoor roller rinks to private basketball courts, putting greens, and even hockey arenas, there's something for every sports fan.Viewing-party places: Fans looking to gather their people to watch the big game can find Vrbo's with private movie rooms, large living room spaces with generous seating, and outdoor grilling areas to get their BBQ on.

You can skip our detailed analysis on the strategic significance of these bases and head over directly to the 5 Most Important U.S. Military Bases in the World.The United States, in its early years, was a country that did not want to intervene in armed conflicts outside its borders. The country’s attitude towards having a global role changed completely after the two world wars which made it a nation that proactively sought to keep an eye on global threats and also promote American ideals across the world. While military and intelligence capabilities of the United States were greatly stretched in the two World Wars and later during the Cold War, in modern times it has had to grapple with the challenges emanating from countries like Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran. Therefore, in order to have a logistical edge over its foes, the US maintains military bases around the world, which gives it the capability to strike enemy targets anywhere in the world. A majority of these bases are equipped with modern military equipment and airfields.According to a report, the U.S. had about 750 military bases across 80 countries in the world and had deployed 173,000 troops in 159 different countries as of July 2021. Japan has the highest number of overseas military bases of the U.S. with 120 bases, followed by Germany and South Korea at second and third, with 119 and 73 bases respectively. These numbers are testament to America’s military and economic strength to be able to have such significant military presence outside its borders.United States Military StrengthThe United States has the most powerful military in the world. The country accounts for nearly 40% of all defense spending worldwide, which is triple the amount that China spends, and more than the combined amount that the next ten highest spenders incur on defense expenditure.Story continuesThe U.S. is also home to some of the largest defense contractors in the world. Most notably four of the top five defense contractors in the world, which include Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX), General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD), and The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA). You can read more on this in our article, Top 16 Defense Contractors in the World in 2023.U.S. Military Bases in the Middle EastThough an exact count is not known, the U.S. has several military bases in the Middle East that deploy more than 30,000 U.S. troops according to the Department of Defense. The most notable of all is the Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, situated west of Doha. It is the largest military installation of the United States in the Middle East and critical for operations in the region. The air base hosts an estimated 11,000 troops and is well equipped with fighter jets. The US Air Force deployed five 5th Generation F-22 Raptors developed by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) to the air base in 2020.The Al-Udeid Air Base is also used by the US to aid Qatar in bolstering its defense capabilities. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) in 2020 got a $657.2 million deal from the Qataris to provide sparing and logistics support for the Qatari air force’s fleet of F-15 aircraft. Moreover, formerly Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX), now RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) received a $77 million contract in the same year to upgrade Qatar’s Air Operations Center by 2025. Work on both contracts was and is being carried out at the Al-Udeid Air Base.U.S. Military Bases in Japan and South KoreaThe Americans have maintained a military presence in Japan since the conclusion of the second World War in 1945 and in South Korea since the Korean War starting 1950. More than half of all American troops deployed overseas are stationed in these two countries. Camp Humphreys, located 40 miles south of Seoul in South Korea, is the largest overseas U.S. military base in the world.The base is equipped with Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, an anti-ballistic missile defense system developed for South Korea by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) in response to regular missile threats from North Korea.U.S. Military Presence in EuropeThere are eight U.S. Army garrisons located across Europe which are home to at least 60,000 troops. Germany has the highest number of American bases and troops among European countries. The most notable U.S. military base in Europe is the Ramstein Air Base in Germany, which is critical to the American Air Force’s European operations.MethodologyWe have ranked the 15 most important U.S. military bases in the world based on our analysis and that of several other defense experts on the strategic importance of current active American military bases. Both domestic and overseas bases of the U.S. military are covered in this article. We've ranked these bases in order of importance.15 Most Important U.S. Military Bases in the WorldThe Visual Explorer / Shutterstock.comLet’s now head over to the list of the most important U.S. military bases in the world.15. Fort Meade, MarylandFort Meade is a large United States military installation located in Maryland that is critical for cyber and intelligence operations as it houses the U.S. Cyber Command and National Security Agency (NSA). First established in 1917, it is named after one of the most prominent generals of the Civil War, General George G. Meade. 14. Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, HawaiiHickam Air Field and Naval Base Pearl Harbor merged two historic bases to become one joint base in 2010. Both are of immense significance to the United States military. Hickam is home to the 15th Wing, 154th Wing, and the Hawaii Air National Guard. It also provides support to 140 associate and tenant units. On the other hand, Pearl Harbor provides vital shore side support to submarines and naval ships.Together, the joint base is home to 270 tenant units, several ships and submarines, and seven fixed-wing aviation squadrons. The base has a population of more than 100,000 people.13. Thule Air Base, GreenlandThe Thule Air Base is one of the most important U.S. military bases in the world, located only 947 miles from the North Pole, and 750 miles north of the Arctic Circle. This air force base is of vital significance when it comes to missile warning and space control and surveillance. The Thule Air Base is capable of detecting all intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) targeting any place in North America.12. RAF Lakenheath and RAF Mildenhall, United KingdomThese two sister bases have the largest presence of U.S. troops in the United Kingdom. Although it has a status of being the British Royal Air Force Station, the RAF Mildenhall and RAF Lakenheath primarily provide services to the US Air Force and are home to the 100th Air Refueling Wing. These are two of the most important U.S. military bases in the world.11. Naval Station Rota, SpainNaval Station Rota in Spain is often referred to as the gateway to the Mediterranean. It is one of the most important U.S. military bases in the world due to its strategic location that helps provide logistical support to the U.S. military and its allies. Built over 6,100 acres of land, the base provides cargo and fuel support to units and ships that transit the region. Moreover, it gives airfield and port facilities to the Naval Forces Europe Africa Central (EURAFCENT) and the 6th fleet.10. Incirlik Air Base, TurkiyeThe Incirlik Air Base is a strategically located base used by the American forces for operations in the Middle East and Europe. The base has always been used by the U.S. as a hub in times of humanitarian emergencies. When the Afghan war began in 2001, the Incirlik Air Base was used as the main hub for humanitarian airlift operations, special operations, refueling missions, and the sustainment of deployed forces.9. Naval Support Activity BahrainThe Naval Support Activity is one of the most important U.S. military bases in the world. Located in Bahrain, it is home to the US Navy’s Fifth Fleet and the US Naval Forces Central Command. It is a crucial base for American interests in the Persian gulf, particularly in providing operational support to the US and coalition troops, and ensuring security of ships, aircrafts and other remote locations in the region.8. Al-Udeid Air Base, QatarThe Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar is the largest military installation of the United States in the Middle East. It serves as a hub for overseas American operations, particularly against targets in countries like Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. More than 11,000 American and coalition troops are stationed at the air base.7. MacDill Air Force Base, FloridaThe MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida serves as the headquarters of the U.S. Central Command and the U.S. Special Operations Command. More than 15,000 people work at the base. MacDill has been a strategic center for decades and was used for various military operations, including Desert Shield and Storm in the Persian Gulf, Just Cause in Panama, and Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti.6. Ramstein Air Base, GermanyThe Ramstein Air Base in southwestern Germany serves as the headquarters for the American Air Force in Europe and for NATO’s Allied Air Command. It is one of the most important U.S. military bases in the world since it is a hub for the US and NATO’s European operations. The base became the transfer point in 2021 for Afghan civilians fleeing Taliban’s takeover of Kabul, and in 2022, the Ramstein Air Base hosted defense agency representatives from 42 countries to synchronize military assistance for Ukraine.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Most Important U.S. Military Bases in the World.Suggested Articles:25 Strongest Armies in the World in 2023Top 16 Defense Contractors in the World in 2023NATO Military Spending by Country: Top 20 CountriesDisclosure: None. 15 Most Important U.S. Military Bases in the World is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

TaicletThanks, Maria, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us on our third quarter 2023 earnings call. All of us on the line today are well aware that since our last call, the world is now seeing yet another terrible conflict. Everyone in our company remains dedicated to fully supporting the United States government's policy and efforts to deter aggression, restore security and achieve peace. Today, I will first highlight our third quarter results as we pursue our vision of 21st Century Security, designed to support the U.S. Department of Defense Strategy of Integrated deterrents and then I'll turn it over to Jay to provide additional detail before taking your questions. Starting on Page 3 of the slides. Sales increased 2% year-over-year to $16.9 billion and backlog remains at historically high levels at $156 million. EPS of $6.73 exceeded prior year and free cash flow was a strong $2.5 billion. We returned approximately 100% of free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the quarter. Earlier in October, we announced a $0.15 increase in our dividend which reflects 5% growth and is the 21st consecutive year of dividend increases for Lockheed Martin. At the same time, our Board also approved a $6 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization, bringing our total authorization to $13 billion, reconfirming our continued commitment to returning capital to shareholders. We are also reaffirming our full year 2023 financial outlook for sales, profit, EPS and free cash flow. Given the current status of the 2024 U.S. Defense budget, global geopolitical tensions and the macroeconomic environment, we will provide our expectations for our 2024 financial outlook during our full year 2023 earnings call in January. On the U.S. budget, though the specific trajectory of the future U.S. Defense budget is still in process between the administration and Congress, the global threat landscape is increasingly elevated. Our robust backlog reflects the relevance and importance of the Lockheed Martin portfolio and elevating returns to great power conflict involving the United States and its allies and the solid positioning of our business to serve our domestic and international customers. From a process standpoint and government, the current continuing resolution or CR is in place through November 17. At that point, one of the following could occur. FY '24 appropriations bills will be enacted, Congress will enact another partial or whole CR or there could be a partial or full government shutdown. In any of these scenarios, there continues to be the option also for supplemental requests related to support Ukraine, Israel and potentially Taiwan. As Congress continues to work through the FY '24 appropriations bills, we are optimistic that there will be consistent support for the National Defense strategy and funding for its priorities. In the meantime, we will continue to work with our customers and suppliers to minimize any potential disruptions due to the process. And we will press on with executing our 21st Century security strategy of building capacity, efficiency and resilience into our production operations, driving advanced digital technologies to enhance integrated deterrents and expanding our international business and operations. Turning to the F-35 program. We delivered 30 F-35 aircraft in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to 80 jets. Consistent with our announcement in September, we continue to expect to deliver a total of 97 aircraft this year, all in the Technology Refresh 2 or TR2 configuration. We are producing F-35s at a rate of [$156 billion] per year, and expect to continue at that pace while simultaneously working to finalize TR-3 software development testing. And we recently began flight test evaluations of the next software release that encompasses major systems upgrades such as improved RADAR, next-gen distributed aperture system and weapons capability. As previously announced, we continue to expect to deliver the first TR-3 configured aircraft between April and June of 2024. The superior technological capabilities of the F-35 continue to generate strong interest both domestically and internationally. In September, Denmark's first 4 locally based F-35 aircraft arrived on their home soil. Denmark's program of record calls for 27 F-35A aircraft. Also in September, the Czech Republic chose to become part of the global F-35 Lightning II program, and the U.S. State Department approved a possible $5 billion foreign military sale to South Korea for up to 25 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. Earlier in the quarter, Israel announced that we'll buy an additional 25 F-35s, which will add a third squadron and increased its F-35 fleet to 75 aircraft. Additionally, in August, Lockheed Martin was selected by the Australian Department of Defense, as their strategic partner for their AIR6500 program Phase 1. This transformational Pathfinder program will deliver the broadest scope of Joint All Domain Operations, or JADO in the free world, and will completely revolutionize the way the Australian defense force operates. By connecting Australian systems and platforms that operate across air, space, land, sea and cyber domains, we expect that AIR6500 will set the blueprint for future military operations worldwide. This proven technology will provide greater situational awareness and defense against increasingly advanced air and missile threats and enables significantly greater interoperability between Australia and allied nations. Lockheed Martin will lead this first phase which will provide the core architecture and multi-domain integration for the program. This is just 1 recent win that demonstrates the business success of our 21st Century Security cornerstone, trusted and reliable battle management and command and control systems that integrate across multiple domains, military services and allied forces. Late last year, Lockheed Martin also won the $500 million Defense of Guam award. And in late September, we were also awarded a potential 7-year, over $1 billion contract for systems engineering and software integration to the integrated combat system across the surface force portfolio of the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard. This will link together systems and software across the services and a JADO construct and it not only enables faster decision-making and better capabilities but also serves as a much more effective global deterrent strategy. Beyond these awards, we continue to develop 21st Century Security technologies to advance interoperability between Lockheed Martin product lines. The 5G.MIL hybrid base station that our engineers invented is the 1LM initiative that includes teams at MFC and Aeronautics. We recently transferred data from a sniper targeting pod that was set up in Orlando, Florida to the Tactical Missile Simulation Lab in Grand Prairie, Texas to provide real-time updates to a simulated missile inflate. This event significantly advanced efforts towards upcoming live fire demonstrations of cross domain platforms operating in a joint environment that will use data from multiple sources across an open architecture. Also, Skunk Works partnered with the University of Iowa's operator Performance Laboratory to demonstrate an AI commanded jamming capability. In this, we successfully used artificial intelligence on 2 air systems to provide jamming support to a simulated strike against enemy air defenses. This demonstration showed how AI agents with high performance and reliable behavior and operate in close coordination with and be controlled by human crude aircraft. We also conducted a successful test of the prototype radio for the PAC-3 MSE missile that will enable communications with the SPY-1 radar, the key sensor in the Aegis Weapon System. This test performed by a 1LM team across MFC and RMS paves the way for the design of a multifrequency radio data link for PAC-3 MSE. In turn, that will enable the U.S. Navy for the first time to have the ability to integrate the state-of-the-art PAC-3 missile onto its warships and open up another opportunity for Lockheed Martin in the future. International interest in PAC-3 also remains strong, as demonstrated by our deepening partnership with Poland, which signed a letter of offer and acceptance for 644 PAC-3 MSEs and related equipment in the quarter. In our RMS business, Sikorsky CH-53K helicopter is expected to grow meaningfully also over the coming years. In August, we won a $2.7 billion contract to build and deliver 35 additional CH-53K helicopters and it's the largest procurement to date for this multi-mission aircraft. Another long-standing major Lockheed Martin program, this one is space is also poised for significant growth ramp. In late September, the Fleet Ballistic Missile Program won a $1.2 billion contract for the Navy's Trident II D5 life extension. For nearly 7 decades, Lockheed Martin supported the U.S. Navy as a critical partner for its mission to provide sea-based strategic deterrents. The Trident II D5 LE missile will be in service through the 2040s, maintaining the proven performance of the D5 system for significantly less cost to the government than of designing a new missile. Also in our Space business, Lockheed Martin's next-generation interceptor, or NGI program, executed its digital preliminary design review in partnership with the Missile Defense Agency customer. That happened on September 29. During this review, the MDA assessed the NGI program's readiness and maturity to continue into the detailed design phase, confirming that our solution continues to meet the requirements for this crucial and demanding mission. Finally, the OSIRIS-REx sample return capsule touched down in the Utah Desert on September 24, returning NASA's first ever sample from an asteroid. After a 7-year mission traveling approximately, I believe, is 4 billion miles in space. The capsule holds material from Bennu a carbon-rich asteroid and scientists hope it will teach us more about the origins of organics that led to life on earth, plus the mechanics behind overall planet formation. After release of the capsule, the spacecraft was set on a new course to investigate the asteroid Apophis under the mission name OSIRIS-APEX. So with that interesting and exciting news, I'll turn it over the call to Jay and join you later for questions. Jay?Jesus MalaveThanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will walk you through our third quarter 2023 financial results. I'll also provide an update to our full year 2023 guidance, and offer a few comments on 2024. As I describe our results, please follow along with the web charts we have posted with our earnings release today. Starting on Chart 4, with consolidated sales and segment operating profit. Third quarter sales increased 2% year-over-year with 3 of the 4 business areas delivering growth. Segment operating profit was down 6% year-over-year due to lower net favorable profit adjustments and lower equity earnings, resulting in segment margins of 10.7%. Moving to earnings per share on Chart 5. GAAP EPS was comparable year-over-year, with lower segment profit and higher net interest expense offset by favorable below-the-line items, including lower share count, lower tax rate and fewer mark-to-market losses. On an adjusted basis, EPS was down $0.10 year-over-year, primarily due to the lower profit. Moving to cash flow on Chart 6. Our free cash flow was strong at over $2.5 billion in the quarter or 150% of net income, helped in part by our focus on working capital, primarily due to better collections at the end of the government fiscal year. Once again, we demonstrated our commitment to shareholders by returning 99% of our free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases this quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we've returned almost $5.3 billion or 116% of free cash flow. As Jim mentioned, our Board approved a 5% increase to the quarterly dividend and an additional $6 billion in share repurchase authorization. These tools remain a key part of our total shareholder return strategy. Okay. Moving to segment results and starting with Aeronautics on Chart 7. Third quarter sales at Aero decreased 5% driven by lower volume on F-35, partially offset by higher volume at Skunk Works. F-35 production was down due to the previously mentioned Lot 15-17 sales catch up in the third quarter of 2022, and an overall more linear throughput this year. Both development and sustainment saw solid year-over-year growth in the quarter. Operating profit decreased 12% from the prior year due to the lower volume and lower net profit adjustments. On the F-16 program, international interest remains strong. We delivered the second Block 70 aircraft to Bahrain in July and in September, the first Block 70 aircraft for the Slovak Republic was unveiled at our facility in Greenville, South Carolina. The Slovak Republic will be the first European country to receive this newest and most capable version of the fighting. Today's latest version, the Block 70-72 will be flown by 6 countries and counting. With a backlog of 126 aircraft as of the third quarter, the F-16 program continues to play a crucial role in 21st Century Security missions for international allies. It will be a key contributor to growth over the coming years. Shifting to Missiles and Fire Control on Page 8. Sales increased 4% year-over-year driven by higher sales volumes on munitions programs within Tactical Strike Missiles, partially offset by lower volume within integrated air and missile defense. Segment operating profit also increased 4% year-over-year due to the higher net profit adjustments. Margins were comparable at 13.5%. MSC has built a strong backlog, and we continue to see strong demand for our missiles and munitions with allied nations seeking to improve the security posture amidst today's complex threat environment. This backlog provides a foundation for growth over the coming years across several of our product lines, including PAC-3, GMLRS, HIMARS, Javelin and JASSM and LRASM. Turning to Rotary and Mission Systems on Page 9. Sales were up 9% in the quarter, driven by higher volume across a handful of programs within our integrated warfare systems and sensors and C6ISR lines of business. Operating profit increased 2% due to higher sales volume and was partially offset by lower net profit adjustments. RMS backlog increased in the quarter, primarily due to the $2.7 billion CH-53K award, which is pictured for Lot 7 and 8, the first full rate production lots as part of the U.S. Marine Corps 200 aircraft program of record. This significant contract bolsters Sikorsky and its partners creates additional production efficiencies and provides the U.S. Marine Corps with transformative capabilities. On Chart 10, we continue to see strong growth across our space portfolio with sales increasing 8% year-over-year driven by higher volume on NGI, Fleet Ballistic Missile, GPS and Orion programs. Operating profit decreased 15%, as the benefit from higher sales volume was more than offset by lower net profit adjustments and lower equity earnings from United Launch Alliance. Space backlog grew slightly to over $30 billion at the end of the third quarter helped by the $800 million Transport Layer Tranche 2 award for 36 beta satellites. Transport Layer is part of the proliferated space architecture and will strengthen deterrents with more resilient space architectures for beyond line of sight targeting, data transport and advanced missile detection and tracking. With this award, we will build and deliver a total of 88 data communication satellites to the Space Development Agency in support of their low-earth orbit constellations. Okay. Now shifting to our 2023 expectations on Page 11. For the full year, we're holding the outlook for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share and free cash flow. We've successfully driven and delivered more linear results in 2023 than prior years, which enables more efficient use of our capacity, but sets up for a difficult compares to last year's fourth quarter. In conjunction with our recent announcement of increased share repurchase authorization, we're increasing our share repurchase forecast for 2023 to $6 billion, provided there is not an extended shutdown scenario. These repurchases along with dividends, are expected to return nearly 150% of our free cash flow to shareholders for the year. And between 2022 and 2023, we are on track to repurchase nearly 13% of our current market cap. We're also set to deliver mid-single-digit free cash flow per share growth in 2023, and we're positioning the company to continue that level of growth in the future. Okay. A few comments on 2024. While we don't have a formal outlook to share, I'll provide a few directional markers as we see them today, barring any environmental setbacks. We still anticipate low single-digit sales growth as we convert our strong backlog position. As I previously mentioned, the backlog supports a higher growth rate, but the value chain remains constrained by extended lead times that have yet to compress. On segment margins, we expect the underlying business to be relatively flat year-over-year, but anticipate variability caused by the timing of impacts from the MFC classified program. And our free cash flow, we're following the budget process to determine whether it will have an impact on the timing of our program schedules and milestones, but are continuing to set internal targets that deliver mid-single-digit growth in free cash flow per share. Okay. Let's wrap it up. Results through the first 3 quarters have been solid with a long-term demand environment that is favorable to Lockheed Martin's 21st Century Security capabilities. Our focus on linearity and working capital is helping to drive more consistent sales and improved cash flow. We're maintaining our full year outlook while increasing our planned share repurchases, further demonstrating our commitment to shareholder returns. And finally, we're executing our 21st Century Security strategy through improving capacity and resilience in the defense enterprise, accelerating the adoption and insertion of 21st Century digital technologies, and collaborating more closely with international partners and allies to improve security solutions. With that, Lois, let's open up the call for Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein.Douglas Stuart HarnedI wanted to see if -- just could I understand the F-35 situation a little bit more. Now the TR-3 deliveries of F-35, those are now expected at some point in Q2 next year. But I think it's difficult for us to have total confidence in that timing.And what I'm trying to understand is as you continue to produce F-35, which will need software upgrades before delivery, you're recognizing revenues on percent completion, so revenue should continue to be solid. But when you look at, say, a June delivery date, what's the impact on your production recognition of revenues, earnings and cash flow should that date move around, how should we think about the timing here?Jesus MalaveSo Doug, the timing on sales and the profits associated with the sales, the booking margin, I really shouldn't expect much variability with that. As we've mentioned, that really doesn't get impacted. What you could see and what we are seeing today is that our risk retirements are obviously dependent upon complete -- successful completion of the test program. And so that will -- could limit our ability to take profit adjustments on a Lot 15-17 program. But as I've said in the past, we are performing and expect to continue to perform profitability stronger on 5 Lot 15-17 than we did on Lot 12-14. And so we might see some short-term limitations on our ability to take profit rate adjustments, we still expect and have confidence will drive higher profitability on this contract locked in the prior one.OperatorAnd the next question is from the line of Cai von Rumohr from TD Cowen.Cai von RumohrYes. So Jay, I think recently, you made a comment about gravity on margins, and you haven't provided a guide for '24. But I think one of the issues that kind of you mentioned has been the classified missile program at MFC, where you have some LRIP options coming up. Could you maybe give us some color in terms of the status of that and how that impacts -- could impact next year? And any other items we should be watchful of that might exert gravity on margins?Jesus MalaveSure, Cai. Thanks. So yes, I mean, that's the question we've talked about. It's been a headwind. It's something that we've talked about for the upcoming number of years, including next year. And in fact, we are seeing some of the headwind this year, and it really -- it's dependent upon an analysis really the timing of recognition of these losses. And there are certain things that need to be met from a performance standpoint on the program. And then it becomes an assessment on the probability of an option being exercised. And so there's just variability in that timing. It could be as early as, frankly, as this quarter, or into next quarter. What we could find ourselves in a situation is that we're recording multiple lots in 2024, which would put some downward pressure on next year's margins. So we'll have a better feel for that next year, and it could be in the range of anywhere between 25 to 50 basis points of headwind from where we are and where we end today or this year from a margin perspective. So hopefully, that provides a little bit of color on the impact of that program. Is that as far as any others, look, we -- if you look at this year, we had lower profit adjustments this year. We expect there to be in the low 20s in 2023. We're evaluating what that means for 2024 in general. But again, I think, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're expecting the underlying business to be pretty much flattish, which would include recurring margins as well as profit rate adjustments in 2024.James D. TaicletYes. And Cai, it's Jim. Just to add on the classified program. First of all, given my Air Force pilot experience, I can tell you that this is a really important capability for the country. It should continue on as an important capability for many, many years and even decades, assuming the program is successful, which we think we're on track to be and it will be massively NPV positive over that longer time frame. So we're working our way through the schedule and the performance in the early phases of the contract, but at the end of the day, it will be worth it for the country and the company. But we will keep you all updated as Jay just did on the path to get there.OperatorAnd our next question is from the line of Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley.Kristine LiwagSo maybe an F-35 question. We've seen a lot of new countries express interest in the F-35 and current partners like Israel, have indicated plans to add to existing orders. What are your thoughts on expanding capacity to meet all the international demand? And is there demand from the customers to potentially bring forward their deliveries? And should you increase capacity, what level of investments?James D. TaicletSo Kristine, it's Jim. I'll start off and Jay can maybe speak to the required investment level. We're in sync with our joint program office customer, which represents the international cohort indirectly of the F-35 customer base and directly the U.S. services. We've all settled on the [$156 billion] per year rate as the joint investment that we're all willing to make, given the demand that's out there. There is the annual sort of slotting priorities discussion that happens within the joint program office and the international partners, and that will keep the line full for many, many years. If we were to get significantly more international orders that might motivate us jointly, and I mean us meaning the government and industry, including our suppliers, by the way to make an incremental investment. But I think that, that would have to be a significant increase in the order book above what we see today. So Jay, any other color on that.Jesus MalaveYes. I mean, the investments, it's probably in the low hundreds of millions. It's manageable. But again, to Jim's point, it needs to be coordinated with the customer.OperatorOur next question is from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.George D. ShapiroYes. Jay, on the F-35, can you discuss a little bit where we stood in the quarter in terms of sustainment revenue versus production because the decremental margin on the production was pretty high at 22%? And I'll sneak in one other one, which isn't RMS, the implication is that you'd have a 14% margin in Q4 to meet your guide, yet revenues would be relatively flat. So if you can just kind of tell us what's going on to cause that to occur.Jesus MalaveOkay. I'll start with the second one first on RMS margins and then come back on the F-35. On the margins for RMS, you're right, George, we're expecting an increase in profitability there. It's really a twofold function of higher profit adjustments. And there are -- and I think I've talked about this in the past, we do have some mix benefits through some delivery -- program deliveries here in the fourth quarter, which will give them some lift.As far as the F-35, just really from a sales perspective in the quarter, production was down pretty substantially, really close to 20%. Development was up quite substantially and sustainment was up in the high teens. So with solid there on sustainment, that's been strong all year long. We expect that to grow for the year around 10%.OperatorAnd our next question is from the line of Ron Epstein. One moment, please.James D. TaicletLois, are you still there?OperatorYes. One moment. We're opening his line. I'm sorry, the next person that we will go to is David Strauss from Barclays.David Egon StraussJay, I think the IRS came up with some recent updated guidance around Section 174. I want to see what your interpretation of that was, whether it's supported your position or your peers that are taking, I think, higher levels of -- or a higher associated with Section 174. And then any updated thoughts on where pension might come out for you guys next year given what appears to be much higher discount rates and weak asset returns?Jesus MalaveSure. Thank you, David. The first one on the R&amp;D capitalization, the draft guidelines that came out. We view those as promising. We believe that they support our position of continuing to deduct the costs associated with cost plus contracts. And just as you remember, we treat that and view it as a cost of sale, not really as an R&amp;D activity. The risk is really borne by the acquirer of those services. The rights are short-lived and they're also restricted. And so we believe the draft language is, at least thus far, appears to be consistent with our approach. And so we view it positively. As far as pension, a couple of things going on with pension I'll go on the P&amp;L. FAS pension will see a significant reduction next year. We're going to go from about $375 million of income in '23 to about $50 million of loss in 2024. It's a function of 2 things. One is the returns. And the second is essentially the expiration of benefits that we're amortizing since -- from the 2014 salary plan freeze. And so those run out, and so we'll see a significant increase. As you know, that's pretty much noncash, but it will affect EPS. On the CAS side of it, we'll see a little bit of a slight reduction anywhere between $25 million to $50 million reduction. But again, the biggest piece there is on FAS. From a cash contributions, we talked about anywhere between $500 million to $1 billion of contributions required starting in 2025. Right now, given where things are, we would expect that to be in the higher range, if not higher for 2025. And if we stay where we are, it could trigger some contributions in 2024. But I will say, when you think about cash contribution to pension and what that means, we've got an enviable position in our balance sheet. We've demonstrated that we're willing to use it. And so I wouldn't view that higher pension contributions as limiting, otherwise limiting our ability to continue our cash deployment strategies, and that's the key point.OperatorThe next question is from the line of Ken Herbert from RBC Capital Markets.Kenneth George HerbertMaybe, Jay, just to follow up on a comment you made in the prepared remarks. I think you made a comment around the buyback activity in the fourth quarter sort of dependent upon timing of the fiscal '24 budget and whether or not there is a shutdown potentially. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about the timing of the '24 budget, but very specifically, if there's any sort of shutdown, how much does that put at risk sort of the buyback activity expected in the fourth quarter? Or if it's very short, does that not impact? And maybe you can walk through how you're viewing sort of the risks around that and impact on the fourth quarter cash deployment?Jesus MalaveSure. So to date, we've done $3 billion with this new guide at $6 billion, that's $3 billion in the fourth quarter. We're monitoring the status of the budget discussions and resolution of that. If we do find ourselves in a shutdown scenario would cause us to take a pause in another relook at that share repurchase. And what we would probably do is just defer it, so it would be more of an issue of timing versus anything else until such time that the budget gets clarified. So history tells us, these things are fairly short-lived. We believe that we'll be able to get through it here in the fourth quarter. If not, then it would just push probably into the first quarter and the like and really won't see a meaningful impact there. But again, in a shutdown scenario, you just take a look at what does that mean? It does -- you can't have new starts. It could be disrupted to programs. It could also put us in a situation where we're doing some self-funding to keep programs on track. And to the extent that occurs, it could be a limiting factor on share repurchase.Maria Ricciardone LeeLois, are you still there?OperatorYes. The next question will come from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Sheila's line did drop from the Q&amp;A. So we'll move to Rob Stallard and he's from Vertical Research.Robert Alan StallardA question for Jim or Jay. On the balance sheet, you noted that you're returning more than 100% of free cash flow to shareholders at the moment. But we do have this ongoing U.S. budget uncertainty and you're going to put more money into the pension fund. So how sustainable do you think it is to be returning more than 100% to shareholders going forward?Jesus MalaveIt's a good question. If you look at just the profile with this incremental authorization that we have, the way we're looking at it is $6 billion here in 2023, $4 billion in 2024 and then essentially $3 billion in '25 and $3 billion in '26, which puts us equal to free cash flow in that ballpark, assuming kind of a $6 billion placeholder offer free cash flow in those given years. And so that's the way we're viewing it, Rob. So over time, over the next few years, it will revert back to more of a 100% of free cash flow. But again, we'll look at it year-by-year. As you've seen in the last 2 years, we did increase it here in the fourth quarter, and we'll continue to evaluate those opportunities as they present themselves, the reality of what happens with actual pension funding, what progress we make in our working capital reduction initiatives and all those will go into the mix master and provide the inform what we formally do in any given year.OperatorThe next question will come from the line of Richard Safran from Seaport Research Partners.Richard Tobie SafranSo if we take an optimistic scenario here on what happens with the budget outlook, I wanted to know if you could discuss the 2024 bookings and the opportunity set both classified and unclassified. Again, if we assume no shutdown and we assume to get funding, I'm interested in what the major competitions are next year is what was -- how you see backlog growth and the book-to-bill is better than 1?Jesus MalaveRichard, we've got a pretty decent line of sight to continuing growth in our backlog. There's a lot of activity happening in classified, which I can't speak to specifics about, but we do see some award decisions next year there. We'll continue to see orders strength in MFC over this time period. And we've talked about orders between 2023 and 2027, of $10 billion. We have not seen all of those orders come to fruition yet. So we would expect those to be continued opportunities for us. We'll continue to have F-35, so Lot 18 next year is probably something that we should probably consider coming into the backlog in 2024. In addition to the performance-based logistics program on the F-35 program, we've our proposal to the customer. We continue to have dialogue. And we're cautiously optimistic that we can get under contract in the first half of next year. So those are some key awards to think about for 2024.OperatorThe next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies.Sheila Karin KahyaogluCan you guys hear me?James D. TaicletYes. We can hear you fine, Sheila.Sheila Karin KahyaogluSo just wanted to ask Jim and Jay, you're a pretty confident management team just given your big backlog, $150 billion. You're returning 150% to shareholders, which is a big number. So you've talked about low single-digit growth and 11% margins for some time. So I just kind of wanted to know what's changed given the backdrop is seemingly better, is it just a budget uncertainty? Is it supply chain? Is it F-35? Maybe if you can just comment on that.Jesus MalaveWell, not much has really changed, to be honest, we talked about low single digits for a while now. We -- I talked about that in my prepared remarks. On the margins, underlying margin is generally flattish because we could be in a situation next year where we have multiple lots of the classified program, that could cause some variability. But that doesn't fundamentally alter what we've been really talking about. Same thing with free cash flow. We've been targeting mid-single-digit free cash flow per share growth. And we still see a path there. We know there are some headwinds, whether it's pension and the like, but we still believe that, that we have a line of sight to be able to do that. And that's what we're going to be working through on a year-by-year basis and starting with 2024 over the next couple of months. We'll work through solidify our plans, and we'll present them formally to you in January.James D. TaicletYes. In the longer term, there are some things that are changing significantly. One is the global threat environment and the geopolitical situations getting more concerning and challenging. That's refocusing the U.S. and certainly our allies around the world on national defense an increasing manner. The second big trend that's going on is the continued evolution of both physical and digital technology at a rate never seen before serving human history, frankly.And so the opportunity for our company to take the leadership role in integrating those technologies, whether they're hypersonics, hypersonic defense, space technologies that are advanced as well as 5G, distributed cloud, artificial intelligence, we're investing in all those technologies to try to drive them in and pull through using this 21st Century concept, the technology driving concept we have is to pull through our platforms and enable them quickly on the open architecture that we're advocating for that will be quickly and widely adoptable making our platforms more compelling as we go forward in time. And then the third thing is the notion that we have international defense strategy, and I think our allies are increasingly embracing is international cooperation, which drives interoperability and also linking command and control systems, all of which comport with our strategy. So I think there are some megatrends that are going on over a longer term that won't necessarily affect us quarter-to-quarter as Jay was stating, but will give us opportunities that I think the company is uniquely positioned to take advantage of over that long term.OperatorAnd our next question is from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan.Seth Michael SeifmanMaybe, Jay, one quick housekeeping question and then one broader question for both of you. The mid-single-digit growth you talked about for free cash flow per share next year. Did that assume any kind of pension contribution next year? And how big might that be or not? And then just more broadly, when you guys talk about seeking out additional suppliers of Solid, is that something for maybe developing hypersonics programs for late in the decade and into the 2030s? Or is that about replacing your suppliers on kind of today's existing programs?James D. TaicletI'll talk to Solid Rocket Motors and Jay can take the free cash flow for share part of your question there. So our objective is to bring antifragility into our own supply chain first and to broadly apply that to the DoD in partnership with them as well. And so when it comes to solid rocket motors, I mean we're actually starting with GMLRS, for example, a legacy technology where we want to augment our existing supplier and have a dual source, frankly. And then that will extend into other systems, large and small and legacy in advance. So this is not a onetime objective. This is a broad in a way, campaign like approach to strengthening our own supply chain and enabling multiple sources really for even beyond our company for our industry, which I think is important. So I do think that this is not a one-shot deal. We're in negotiations and discussions with a counterparty. We think we can start us off with on this journey, but it's going to be a long journey, and we'll probably have additional participants and programs as the years and even decades roll on.Jesus MalaveOn the question of the free cash flow per share for 2024, Seth, what I mentioned is that we're setting up internal targeting and internal actions to be able to arrive at that incremental pension contribution would obviously put pressure on that. And we'll go through that over the next coming months and determine what the art of what's possible and what our plans would be, and again we'll present that in January.OperatorAnd the next question is from Myles Walton from Wolfe Research.Myles Alexander WaltonJay, a quick clarification and then a question for Jim. The clarification on the margins for next year, 25 to 50 basis points of risk, I guess, is what you're seeing on the MFC. Should we anticipate that there's a way around that? Or is that the base case? And then, Jim, in the press release, you talked about digital services revenue over time. And I'm just curious, maybe you could touch on your vision of what digital services revenue is today and where you want to take it over the next several years?James D. TaicletSo digital services will be a wide range, but we're starting with this notion of trusted, reliable mission systems engineering for command and control and battle management systems. That is a business we're already in, actually. It is largely digital already. And it's these kind of programs like defensive farm. We have a program in the UAE that's based on this technology as well. Call it, DIAMONDShield. We're using that core technology to then expand into other programs like AIR6500. So we're already in that business. It's in, I think, the mid-low to mid-single-digit billions at this point. And we're going to try to ramp that up in and of itself, add other technologies to that for networking, connecting again our platforms as well as other platforms from other OEMs to provide mission solutions for the DoD. So the digital and the physical technologies will ultimately come together in a way that can advance mission capability for our customers in, say, air-to-air combat, surface, warfare, et cetera, and air and missile defense integration. Those kinds of missions, we want to advance every 3 to 6 months of the combination of digital and physical technologies of our own and from others, partners, et cetera, that we will work with. So this is, again, long-term broad approach, but we've already got a very, very good starting point that's material in the command and control and battle management systems that we have today and how we're augmenting them and modernizing those for the future.Jesus MalaveOkay. Going back to the question on margins for next year. Just as I mentioned, underlying margins, and let me for sake of clarity, margins, excluding the impact of the MFC program, we expect to be flattish. The MFC programs, it will provide a drag on the margins next year, and it's a question of timing. So it could be anywhere between 25 to 50 basis points. And again, we'll have a lot more clarity on that as we close out the year.OperatorThe next question is from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.Noah PoponakJay, I guess I also wanted to ask about margins, and you sort of did there, but I don't know if you would just state where you expect the MFC margin to shake out for the year, next year or what it looks like in the quarters with the more concentrated losses? And then I just wondered if you could talk about how -- a little bit more about how this got here. I know you've talked about having the fixed price LRIPs with prices fixed a little while ago. Was -- is that something that's been going on longer than I realized? I know you also -- my understanding is you also no bid missile program that was awarded recently because it had fixed price development. Is the customer shifting the risk a little bit towards the contractor? Or am I overreading what I'm seeing out there?Jesus MalaveWell, let me maybe take the second part of it and then circle back. There are really 2 different programs. The -- I think you're referring to the standard attack weapon award and that was a fixed price development program that we decided not to pursue because of the risk posture over there. Each program and pursuit really stands on its own, and we review those individually. In this case, we thought the risk profile was just too much. And so we backed off. On this particular program, on the classified program, that was a cost-plus development program. So there really was not much risk associated what the development cycle. There are these production low rate initial production lots that were priced pretty aggressively. And hence, we're starting -- we're going to start to see the headwinds associated with that. As Jim mentioned, these are -- this would be a long-term program. And we know what it takes to make sure that we provide accretive NPV on these types of programs. And so we track that and monitoring that, and we're confident over the long term, we'll be able to deliver that. So again, these are case-by-case type of situations that we pursue. On the -- we'll probably have to get back to you on the specific MFC margins for next year. I think we can back into 25 to 50 on the total company, you can back into what that impact is for MFC. But I just don't have it in front of me.James D. TaicletAnd Noah, just to give you context here, the approach we're taking no matter what the customer's initiative is on risk balancing or imbalancing, the approach that Jay and I are taking here, as we look at programs going forward and opportunities is really a holistic one where we do take the long-term total program value into account, but we also take -- we'll take into account seriously short and midterm risk management. .And especially when it comes to fixed price either development or initial rate production because if you look at the concept of fixed price initial rate production on a program this technology is not settled in the first place yet because the development hasn't been done, we would ascribe a higher risk factor to that I think, going forward here based on both experience and just our own perspectives on these kinds of things.Maria Ricciardone LeeOkay. And Lois, I think we have time for 1 more as we approach the top of the hour.OperatorAnd that question come from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi.Jason GurskyJim, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, the idea of a supplemental for Taiwan. I'm wondering if you wouldn't do us a favor, just kind of remind us of what you're shipping into Taiwan today. And in the context of a supplement to what kinds of things do you think are going to be in high demand and would lead to more revenue for you all Jay, related to international here. I was wondering if you could just give us a quick update on the margin profile of your international business, kind of writ large today outside the F-35 program. If international is growing faster, is the expectation here that we would, all else be equal see margin expansion in light of international historically being higher margin than domestic business?James D. TaicletSo Jason, on Taiwan, I think the signature program that everybody is aware of is F-16 in both production and modernization. So that's ongoing. But we also provided a kind of comprehensive defensive Taiwan, like a Defense of Guam award we won last year, approach to integrating these digital technologies with the aircraft available that we provide and others, the missile systems that we provide and others and integrate them into sort of the approach to defending Taiwan just like we're designing for Guam. So there could be a wide range of digital and physical products that would come with this over time. The U.S. government will help define with the Taiwanese government. What -- when if any of those will be procured and released for export to Taiwan to the FMS program and other vehicles. So I can't speak for the government as to what that will look like. But I think it's, again, a possibility that given the rising tensions there could be supplementals for Taiwan in addition to, as we said, Israel and Ukraine.Jesus MalaveAnd on the international margins, historically, the margins have been higher than they are for U.S. government customers. But in this case, it's so what I would expect the base business to continue this higher margin. But a lot of the incremental opportunities that we've been talking about are really going through foreign military sales contracting which are more like U.S. DoD-type margins. And so while we will see kind of a net blended margin profile that's probably higher than the kind of base U.S. DoD, it will be limited -- at least the incremental business is going to be limited because they are FMS.Maria Ricciardone LeeAll right. Great. Thanks, everybody. So I think we're at the top of the hour. I'll turn the call back over to Jim for some final thoughts.James D. TaicletSure. Thanks, Maria. I think before we conclude today, I do want to thank all of our employees around the world and across the country for their continued dedication. They're supporting our signature programs. They're going after new pursuits, advancing these digital technologies. And all that together will really enhance deterrents globally, especially in the more sort of dangerous world we live in. I want to really congratulate and thank our teams for everything they're doing. We also want to make sure that you the shareholders are reminded yet again that everything we're doing here is designed to deliver a compelling value to you all for many years to come. Jay and I really focus on free cash flow per share, along with the dividend to make sure that you're getting an interesting return over time, and we're trying to expand the business as we go as well. So thank you again for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with all of you on our next earnings call in January. And Lois, that concludes the call for this morning. Bye-bye.OperatorThank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&amp;T Event Conference, and you may now disconnect.]"

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 24, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis homebuilder is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.78 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +3.4%.Revenues are expected to be $4.04 billion, up 2.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.79% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PulteGroup?For PulteGroup, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.10%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that PulteGroup will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that PulteGroup would post earnings of $2.47 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3, delivering a surprise of +21.46%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.PulteGroup doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

199,d33b7f91-5bf2-43af-aba6-e55131284516,PHM,2023-10-18,Homebuilders feel lousy about housing conditions — except for maybe the biggest ones,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/homebuilder-confidence-drops-140045859.html,1697551245,STORY,"['DHI', 'PHM']","[Homebuilder pessimism deepened this month as mortgage rates reached 23-year highs. But the downcast outlook may not be shared equally among developers.More builders again classified housing conditions as poor rather than good in October, according to a monthly sentiment index from the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) and Wells Fargo Housing. The index reading dropped to 40 from a downwardly revised 44 in September, marking the second straight month it fell below the crucial breakeven measure of 50 — and the lowest point since January.While the results underscore the chilling effect rising mortgage rates are having on housing activity, the index may not reflect the experiences of the largest builders, which are better capitalized to take advantage of the odd dynamics in the market.""The tone will be pessimistic, [but] I would say it is a better indicator for small to mid-sized builders,"" Jody Kahn, senior vice president of research and surveys at John Burns Research and Consulting, told Yahoo Finance before the index was released. ""It’s about the haves and have-nots when it comes to capital.""Other index measures this month were also weak.The gauges for current sales conditions, sales expectations in the next six months, and traffic of prospective buyers all dropped month over month. All readings sit below 50, indicating that more builders believe those particular conditions are bad than good. Buyer traffic was especially poor, coming in at a reading of 26.Housing conditions in the four regions covered by the index all worsened in October with three of four — the Midwest, South, and West — posting readings below 50. The Northeast’s index measure teetered at 50.The widespread decline in sentiment came as mortgage rates remained above 7% for nine straight weeks, with some experts warning that they could reach 8% this year.Read more: Mortgage rates at 20-year high: Is 2023 a good time to buy a house?Story continues""Builders have reported lower levels of buyer traffic, as some buyers, particularly younger ones, are priced out of the market because of higher interest rates,"" NAHB chairman Alicia Huey, a custom homebuilder and developer from Birmingham, Ala., said in a statement.As a result, builders reached into their pockets to attract buyers.Read more: How to buy a house in 2023The index found that 32% of builders cut home prices in October, the same share as September and the highest rate since December 2022. Overall, 62% of homebuilders provided some kind of sales incentives this month, up from 59% and also the highest since December 2022.And that’s where the divergence in moods among homebuilders may come in. The well-financed builders can negate rising interest rates with specific inducements, while also offering near-ready inventory for buyers frustrated by the dearth of properties on the resale side.""Those two factors are really driving sales,"" Kahn said.Homebuilders now are serving more entry-level buyers than normal because of the supply shortage among existing homes. (Homeowners are reluctant to sell and buy a home at such high mortgage rates when they have such a low one currently.)For instance, 42% of new single-family homebuyers were first timers in 2023, up from 27% in 2018, which was a more normalized market, the NAHB found.Read more: First-time homebuyer in 2023: What you need to knowThese are also more budget-conscious buyers with smaller down payments and who are sensitive to rapid changes in mortgage rates, which can make a monthly payment unworkable.Bigger can do it better? Homes under construction in Las Vegas. (Photo: Chase Stevens/Las Vegas Review-Journal) (Las Vegas Review-Journal via Getty Images)Larger builders with mortgage lending arms or joint ventures with lenders can afford to pinch their margins some to buy the rate down on mortgages for the entirety of the term for these borrowers. So instead of a 7.75% rate for 30 years, these buyers get a home loan at 5.75%, Kahn said.Smaller builders largely can swallow only a temporary buy-down, which lowers the rate for one or two years. But if a buyer can’t qualify for the higher monthly payment after the buy-down expires — a requirement put in place after the Great Recession — the deal is dead.These buyers also want to close quicker because a shorter window is a way to protect themselves from future rate increases, Kahn said, and it mimics the transaction timing on the resale side.Having inventory that’s 30 to 60 days from completion provides that assurance and timeframe, but that’s a scenario mostly well-capitalized builders can offer. Smaller developers don’t have the financing to hold incomplete and unsold properties on their books.""These two things are significant in supporting the sales,"" Kahn said. ""Smaller builders don’t have the capacity to do those things.""(Credit: John Burns Research &amp; Consulting)That goes a long way toward explaining why the sentiment reading from the NAHB — whose membership skews toward those that develop fewer than 100 homes a year — could be echoing the experiences of those homebuilders over the biggest private and public ones. (The panel of builders surveyed for the NAHB index is proportionate in size and geography to NAHB's membership composition, a spokesperson said.)In fact, John Burns conducts its own regular surveys of builders throughout the year and the most recent one — results Kahn has yet to publish — showed a considerable gap between how smaller builders and larger ones answered survey questions, she said.That’s a key consideration for investors looking toward a number of third quarter results from seven of the top 10 publicly traded homebuilders in the next few weeks, including D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI) and PulteGroup Inc. (PHM).""The biggest builders are making those earnings reports,"" Kahn said, ""and they definitely have all the advantages.""Janna Herron is the personal finance and real estate editor for Yahoo Finance.

200,25a6bd0f-bc8e-3ff7-8f7b-6503cc1660ae,PHM,2023-10-18,Wall Street Analysts Think PulteGroup (PHM) Is a Good Investment: Is It?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-analysts-think-pultegroup-133005330.html,1697549405,STORY,['PHM'],"[Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about PulteGroup (PHM) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.PulteGroup currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.50, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 14 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.50 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 14 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 10 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 71.4% and 7.1% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for PHMBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for PHMCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for PulteGroup here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying PulteGroup, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Story continuesZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is PHM Worth Investing In?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for PulteGroup, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 0.4% over the past month to $11.58.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for PulteGroup. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for PulteGroup with a grain of salt.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(Operator Instructions) This call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Johnson &amp; Johnson. You may begin.Jessica MooreGood morning. This is Jessica Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson &amp; Johnson. Welcome to our company's review of the 2023 third quarter business results and full year financial outlook. A few logistics before we get into the details. As a reminder, you can find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules, on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson &amp; Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. Please note that this presentation contains forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's future operating and financial performance, market position and business strategy. You are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations of future events using the information available as of the date of this recording and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. A description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2022 Form 10-K, which is available at investor.jnj.com and on the SEC's website. Additionally, several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today's agenda. I will start by reviewing the third quarter sales and P&amp;L results for the corporation and highlights related to our two businesses. Joe Wolk, our CFO, will then provide additional business and financial commentary before sharing an overview of our cash position, capital allocation priorities and updated guidance for 2023. The remaining time will be available for your questions. Joaquin Duato, our Chairman and CEO; John Reed; and Ahmet Tezel, our Innovative Medicine and MedTech R&amp;D leaders; as well as Erik Haas, our VP of Litigation, will be joining us for Q&amp;A. To ensure we provide enough time to address your questions, we anticipate the webcast will last approximately 60 minutes. As a reminder, on August 23, 2023, Johnson &amp; Johnson announced the final results of the exchange offer and completion of the separation of Kenvue Inc. Unless otherwise stated, the financial results and guidance highlighted today reflect the continuing operations of Johnson &amp; Johnson. We will report the Consumer Health financial results as discontinued operations. Additionally, going forward, the Pharmaceuticals segment will be referred to as Innovative Medicine. Starting with Q3 2023 sales results. Worldwide sales were $21.4 billion for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 6.8% versus the third quarter of 2022. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 6.4% as currency had a positive impact of 0.4 points. In the U.S., sales increased 11.1%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported growth was 1.6%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 0.7%, with currency positively impacting our reported OUS results by 0.9 points. It is important to note that operational sales in Europe were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 vaccine and loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 4.9% worldwide, 8.9% in the U.S. and 0.3% outside the U.S. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $4.3 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $1.69 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.62 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.8 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.66, representing increases of 14.1% and 19.3%, respectively, compared to the third quarter of 2022. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 13.9%. I will now comment on business sales performance. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the third quarter of 2022, and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. Beginning with Innovative Medicine. Worldwide Innovative Medicine sales of $13.9 billion increased 5.1% with growth of 10.9% in the U.S. and a decline of 2.3% outside of the U.S. Operational sales growth increased 4.3% as currency had a positive impact of 0.8 points. Excluding COVID-19 vaccine sales, worldwide operational sales growth was 8.2% with growth of 10.9% in the U.S. and growth of 4.3% outside of the U.S. Sales outside the U.S., excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, were negatively impacted by approximately 500 basis points due to the loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA in Europe. Innovative Medicine growth was driven by our key brands and continued uptake from our recently launched products, with 11 assets delivering double-digit growth. We continue to drive strong sales growth for both DARZALEX and ERLEADA with increases of 20.7% and 27%, respectively, due to continued share gains and market growth. Within Immunology, we saw growth in STELARA and TREMFYA with increases of 15.8% and 21.5%, respectively. This growth was predominantly driven by favorable patient mix and market growth. Turning to newly launched products. We continue to make progress on our launches of CARVYKTI and SPRAVATO. We are also encouraged by the early success of our launches of TECVAYLI and TALVEY, sales of which are driving the growth in other oncology. We expect to begin disclosing TECVAYLI sales in Q1 2024. Total Innovative Medicine sales growth was partially offset by the loss of exclusive of ZYTIGA and REMICADE, along with a decrease in IMBRUVICA sales due to competitive pressures. I'll now turn your attention to MedTech. Worldwide MedTech sales of $7.5 billion increased to 10% with growth of 11.6% in the U.S. and 8.3% outside of the U.S. Operational sales growth increased 10.4% as currency had a negative impact of 0.4 points. Abiomed contributed 4.6% to operational growth. Excluding the impact of acquisition and divestitures, worldwide adjusted operational sales growth was 6%. On a pro forma basis, utilizing sales in the prior year from Abiomed as a stand-alone company, MedTech's growth for the quarter would be 6.4%. MedTech was negatively impacted across all platforms by international sanctions in Russia worth approximately 60 basis points and volume-based procurement in China, primarily in 5 MedTech platforms: Spine, trauma, endocutters, energy and electrophysiology. As communicated last quarter, we saw the return to more normalized seasonality with moderate deceleration in the third quarter. The Interventional Solutions franchise delivered operational growth of 48.1%, which includes $311 million related to Abiomed. This reflects growth in Abiomed patient procedures in the high teens and continued strong adoption of Impella 5.5 technology in surgery. Electrophysiology is a major contributor to this growth with a double-digit increase of 20.3%. This reflects strong growth in all regions, including Europe, driven by our global market-leading portfolio, including the most recently launched QDOT RF ablation and OPTRELL mapping catheters.Operational growth of 3.2% in Surgery was driven primarily by procedure recovery and strength of our biosurgery and wound closure portfolios. Growth was partially offset by the impacts of volume-based procurement in China and supply challenges. Global growth of 5.4% in Vision was driven by price actions in contact lenses and other as well as strength of new products, including ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products in contact lenses and TECNIS Eyehance, our monofocal interocular lens in surgical vision. Growth of contact lenses was partially offset by strategic portfolio choices and supply challenges, although these continue to improve. Global Vision growth was negatively impacted by 100 basis points due to the Blink divestiture. Orthopedics operational growth of 2.6% reflects procedure growth; success of recently launched products, such as the global expansion of our VELYS digital solutions; and expansion in ambulatory surgical centers; partly offset by the impacts of volume-based procurement in China in spine and trauma. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2023. I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold margin was flat due to favorable patient mix and lower COVID-19 vaccine supply network-related exit costs in the Innovative Medicine business, partially offset by commodity inflation, unfavorable product mix and restructuring related to excess inventory costs in the MedTech business. Selling, marketing and administrative margins deleveraged 40 basis points, driven by increased expenses across enterprise. We continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing $3.4 billion or 16.2% of sales this quarter. R&amp;D was leveraged by 120 basis points, primarily driven by portfolio prioritization, partially offset by higher milestone payments in the Innovative Medicine business. Additionally, IP R&amp;D impairments were $206 million in the third quarter of 2023. Interest income was $182 million in the third quarter of 2023 as compared to $99 million of income in the third quarter of 2022. The increase in income was driven by higher interest rates earned on cash balances, partially offset by higher interest rates on debt balances. The other income and expense line was an expense of $499 million in the third quarter of 2023 compared to an expense of $226 million in the third quarter of 2022. This was primarily driven by higher unrealized mark-to-market losses on public securities, partially offset by the lower COVID-19 vaccine-related exit costs and lower litigation expense. Restructuring in the third quarter was $158 million, primarily related to the Innovative Medicine restructuring program announced in the first quarter. Regarding taxes in the quarter. Our effective tax rate was 17.4% versus 16.7% in the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by a non-deductible, non-recurring pretax charge that occurred in the current quarter. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 15.6% versus 15.9% in the same period last year. As a result of the completion of the exchange offer, Johnson &amp; Johnson is presenting the Consumer Health business financial results as discontinuing operations, including a gain of approximately $21 billion. I encourage you to review our upcoming third quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax and separation-related matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the third quarter of 2023, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales increased from 35.3% to 37.6%, primarily driven by favorable patient mix in Innovative Medicine, partially offset by unfavorable product mix and commodity inflation in MedTech. Innovative Medicine margins improved from 41.4% to 45.4%, primarily driven by favorable patient mix and R&amp;D portfolio prioritization. MedTech margins declined from 25% to 24.7%, primarily driven by commodity inflation and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by a divestiture gain. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson &amp; Johnson third quarter results. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk. Joe?Story continuesJoseph J. WolkThank you, Jessica, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. This quarter's call marks a new era for Johnson &amp; Johnson with a sharpened focus on Innovative Medicine and MedTech. What has remained consistent is our credo and our commitment to patients. We are privileged to build upon our 137-year legacy of tackling the world's most complex health care challenges and helping patients with serious unmet health needs around the world. As we look forward, we are well positioned to grow our business and innovate across the spectrum of health care. We are excited about what's ahead and what we can achieve in the future. Before we dive into our performance, I want to briefly touch upon other items important to our business. The first is a brief recap of the Kenvue separation which was formally completed during the quarter. The transaction was executed within our targeted time frame and under budget while generating significant cash and value for our shareholders. Through this separation, we raised $13.2 billion in cash proceeds through the Kenvue debt offering and IPO. We reduced Johnson &amp; Johnson's outstanding share count by 191 million shares or approximately 7% without the use of cash and in a tax-free manner. We maintained our current quarterly dividend per share, and we retained approximately 180 million shares of Kenvue stock that provides cash proceeds for future flexibility. We will see the full impact to EPS of the share reduction in 2024. Another item warranting comment is the Inflation Reduction Act. We continue to believe the IRA's price-setting provisions are damaging to innovation and will prevent the delivery of transformative therapies and cures to patients. As we await adjudication of legal proceedings initiated by us and others, we did submit all requested information in compliance with CMS' drug price-setting scheme to continue supporting patients' access to our medicines that help them stay healthy and live longer. Moving to segment highlights in the quarter. As Jessica previously shared, our teams delivered strong results in the third quarter while continuing to advance our pipeline to enhance future growth. Within the Innovative Medicine business, two important regulatory milestones were announced during the quarter. Specifically, we received the European Commission approval for a reduced biweekly dosing frequency for TECVAYLI for eligible patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, and U.S. FDA and European Commission approval of TALVEY, a first-in-class bispecific therapy for the treatment of patients with heavily pretreated multiple myeloma. Regarding clinical data, we are excited to have an unprecedented seven late-breaking abstracts, including three featured in the Presidential Symposium being presented at the European Society of Medical Oncology meeting this weekend. Highlights will include the results from all three Phase III studies of RYBREVANT in lung cancer, including MARIPOSA, MARIPOSA-2 and PAPILLON. Additionally, updated data from the SunRISe-1 study of TAR-200 in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer will be shared, as well as the first-ever data of TAR-210 in patients with FGFR mutations. We also look forward to presenting Phase II data for nipocalimab in rheumatoid arthritis at the American College of Rheumatology Annual meeting in November and have already launched a Phase II combination study in RA. Lastly, we plan to initiate multiple clinical development programs for our targeted oral peptide JNJ-2113. This includes the initiation of the ANTHEM Phase IIb study in ulcerative colitis, which will begin this month; and the Phase III clinical program titled ICONIC, for adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, expected to begin in November. Moving to MedTech. Notable highlights in the quarter include significant advancements in electrophysiology across our cardiac ablation platform. We received FDA clearance for multiple atrial fibrillation ablation products in our portfolio to be used in a workflow without fluoroscopy. This FDA indication is unique to Johnson &amp; Johnson and is a significant advancement where caregivers and patients are not exposed to harmful fluoroscopy-related radiation during their cardiac ablation procedures. It also allows for the removal of heavy lead protective equipment that may lead to orthopedic complications for care teams. In pulse field ablation, we have completed our clinical trial in Europe and submitted for CE Mark for our VARIPULSE catheter. We expect the completion for our U.S. VARIPULSE study to occur in the fourth quarter. We are also simultaneously advancing clinical studies for two additional pulse field ablation catheters, the STSF dual energy catheter capable of delivering both PF and RF energy through the same device; and OMNYPULSE, a large-tip focal catheter. Beyond electrophysiology, we have completed enrollment in the Abiomed Impella ECP clinical study, a landmark pivotal trial designed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the Impella ECP during high-risk PCI procedures. Impella ECP is the world's smallest heart pump and the only heart pump compatible with small-bore access and closure techniques. While not a clinical advancement, we have also taken steps in the quarter to improve MedTech's future margin profile, implementing a restructuring program designed to simplify and focus the operations of our Orthopedic business. As part of this 2-year program, we expect to exit certain markets and product lines across that business. We anticipate some short-term modest revenue deduction in Orthopedics of approximately $250 million in total over the next 2 years, given the market and product line exits, but believe these actions will improve our ability to meet demand, resulting in accelerated growth and enhanced profitability. The program is expected to be completed by the end of 2025 with total program costs estimated to be between $700 million and $800 million. Let's now turn to cash and capital allocation. We ended the third quarter with approximately $24 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $30 billion of debt for a net debt position of $6 billion. Free cash flow year-to-date through the third quarter was approximately $12 billion, up from the $5 billion we reported year-to-date in the second quarter of 2023. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to execute a strategic and disciplined approach, utilizing our strong credit profile and robust free cash flow generation to prioritize continued investment in our business, increasing dividends on an annual basis, executing strategic business development initiatives for inorganic growth and executing share repurchases when appropriate. Moving on to our 2023 guidance update. Based on the strong results delivered in the quarter and the first 9 months of this year, balanced with planned investments in the fourth quarter, we are raising the ranges for full year sales and EPS guidance. We now expect operational sales growth for the full year 2023 to be in the range of 8.5% to 9.0% or up $600 million at the midpoint in the range of $84.4 billion to $84.8 billion on a constant currency basis, and adjusted operational sales growth in the range of 7.2% to 7.7%. Just a reminder, our sales guidance continues to exclude any COVID-19 vaccine revenue. While we do not speculate on future currency movements, utilizing the euro spot rate as of last week at $1.06, we now anticipate an incremental negative currency impact of $400 million, resulting in a full year impact of negative 1% or $800 million. Looking across the P&amp;L. Adjusted pretax operating margin is still expected to improve by approximately 50 basis points versus prior year, driven by stronger margin profile and business mix. Net other income is also being maintained, ranging from $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. Due to higher interest rates earned on our cash, we now expect net interest income in the range of $300 million to $400 million. And finally, based on current tax law, our estimate for the effective tax rate for 2023 will be between 15.0% and 15.5%. These revised estimates translate to an increase in our adjusted operational earnings per share guidance by $0.10 at the midpoint. Our new range is $10.02 and to $10.08, or 12.5% growth at the midpoint; and adjusted reported earnings per share in the range of $10.07 to $10.13, or 13% growth at the midpoint. Since January, we've been able to increase our guidance throughout the year for a cumulative impact of $3 billion on operational sales and $0.25 on adjusted operational earnings per share, which includes absorbing $0.10 for our licensing deal with Cellular Biomedicine Group announced in the second quarter of 2023. Now I appreciate that many of you are turning your attention to 2024, and our team is actively finalizing our plans for next year. With that context, allow me to provide some preliminary perspectives for you to consider. For Innovative Medicine, we remain confident in our ability to deliver growth from key brands and anticipate continued progress from our newly launched products, all while advancing our robust pipeline with many exciting data readouts, filings and approvals ahead of us. This includes data presentation and regulatory submissions for TREMFYA in IBD, presenting data from our Phase III study of nipocalimab in myasthenia gravis and readouts from two Phase III ERLEADA trials in early stage prostate cancer. We do not expect entry of STELARA biosimilars in the United States during 2024. However, as a reminder, STELARA does have a composition of matter patent expiry in mid-2024 in Europe. For MedTech, we expect our commercial capabilities and continued adoption of recently launched products across all MedTech businesses will continue to drive our growth and improve competitiveness while continuing to advance our pipeline programs, including innovation in pulse field ablation, Abiomed and surgical robotics. We expect procedures in 2024 to remain consistent with elevated 2023 levels. With respect to tax. As you may be aware, the European Union member states are in the process of enacting the EU's Pillar Two directive, which generally provides for a 15% minimum tax rate as established by the OECD Pillar Two framework. The first EU effective date for certain aspects of the law is January 1, 2024. As a result, we currently estimated up to a 1% tax rate increase in 2024. In addition, the U.S. Treasury's current perspective on Pillar Two will be harmful as it relates to the treatment of U.S. incentives for innovation and will result in U.S.-based multinational companies paying more tax revenue to foreign governments. Regarding share count given the Kenvue separation. The full benefit of the approximately 191 million net share reduction in Johnson &amp; Johnson shares outstanding from the exchange offer will be reflected in our 2024 financials. And finally, while we don't speculate on future currency impact, utilizing the current euro spot rate would yield an approximate $0.15 negative currency impact on 2024 full year adjusted earnings per share. We are pleased with our strong performance during the first 9 months of this year and have positive momentum as we move into 2024. We look forward to sharing more about the strength of our business, promise of our Innovative Medicine and MedTech pipelines and the long-term strategy of Johnson &amp; Johnson at our upcoming Enterprise Business Review on December 5 at the New York Stock Exchange. More information, including an overview of the day's schedule, will be shared shortly. We hope you will be able to join us either in person or on the available webcast. I want to conclude my remarks by thanking our teams around the world for their continued hard work and unwavering commitment to excellence on behalf of our patients. We are confident that our strategy will position us to deliver long-term growth and create significant value for our shareholders. With that, it's my pleasure to turn to Kevin and begin the Q&amp;A portion of the call.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from David Risinger from Leerink Partners.David Reed RisingerCongrats on the strong financial performance. So my question is on benchmarking MARIPOSA results, please. Could you share your thoughts on key considerations, including AstraZeneca's recent FLAURA2 results, which included a 9-month PFS benefit?John C. ReedJohn Reed here. It's great to join the call. This is my first time as a newcomer to J&amp;J. And before I answer your question, David, I would just like to say I have to tell you, I'm really enjoying being a new member of the J&amp;J team. I've really been impressed with the culture inspired by our credo, with the caliber of our talent, our people here at J&amp;J, and with the really strong performance of the pipeline. We've already launched two NMEs this year, AKEEGA for prostate cancer and TALVEY for myeloma, continuing our tradition bringing new therapies in those agents. And we're positioned to deliver an average of more than two NMEs per year between now and the close of the decade, 2030. So the pipeline is very robust, and it's exciting to be here and to be a part of it. So on to your question. The data will be presented at ESMO in a Presidential session, so we're embargoed until then. Abstracts will be available on Wednesday. I can only say that the RYBREVANT-lazertinib combo did perform well head-to-head against osimertinib. Our regimen is a chemo-free option for patients, which we think is important, and we'll present those data at ESMO.OperatorNext question today coming from Matt Miksic from Barclays.Matthew Stephan MiksicI think most folks may look at the orthopedic results in medical devices as maybe being a little bit softer than expected, and I know that's not everything by a long shot for J&amp;J. But given expectations were for kind of continued strength heading into Q3, if you could talk maybe a little bit about your comment on more traditional seasonality and thoughts on the sustainability of that strength, as well as the sort of divestiture and sort of realignment plan, Joe, that you described.Joaquin DuatoSo thank you for the question. And yes, I mean, our results in Orthopedics were 2.6% growth overall. And part of it, as you mentioned, is driven by seasonality. As we have commented, we are in a journey of improvement in Orthopedics. We want to be #1 and #2 in every segment we compete. And that is a place where we are not there yet, but we are very confident that we are going to continue to make improvements by investing and by growing in the highest-growth segments. We have made improvements in our portfolio. For example, on the [ME] side, we have a complete portfolio now. On the revision side, on the cementless side, we are launching now our VELYS Orthopedics total knee surgery replacement in Europe. And we already have about 30,000 procedures that have been performed with our VELYS robotic system. Overall, we are increasing our penetration also in the ASCs, which is a fast-growing segment. And we see our performance continue to improve in the U.S. and globally. In this particular quarter, we also had some impact due to the impact of [value-based] procurement in China and also because of the impact of the Russia sanctions that was mentioned already in the prepared remarks. So overall, in Orthopedics, we are determined to continue our journey of improvement. We are focusing in having the right portfolio. We have a very strong team in the field. And as Joe has announced, and Joe can comment that we have a plan to be able to continue to improve our margins in Orthopedics.Joseph J. WolkYes. Just very quickly, Matt. Thanks for the question. With respect to the restructuring program that we announced specifically in Orthopedics, we're looking to exit those less-profitable markets and product lines. So we'll have some, clearly, inventory write-downs as a result of that over the next 2 years. There will be some modest revenue disruption. But we actually do think these actions not only accelerate growth going forward, but will improve profitability.OperatorYour next question is from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs.Chris ShibutaniCan you provide us with some insight into updates on the talc litigation process? And then secondly, if you could just comment, Joe, you used the word voracious last time with your appetite for business development opportunities. How does that word stand, still, in terms of your appetite on the forward?Joseph J. WolkSo Erik, why don't I turn it over to you to discuss the talc litigation matter? And then I'll come back and answer Chris' second question.Erik HaasGreat. Thanks, Joe. The short answer is that we continue to pursue the four-pronged strategy that we communicated back in July. So let me quickly summarize those four prongs and highlight the salient development and perhaps anticipate some follow-up questions about talc. So the first prong, we are pursuing the appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States of the July ruling by the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court that dismissed LTL's bankruptcy case. Notably, our appeal recently was joined by counsel representing the vast majority of the talc claimants. Also thereafter, the bankruptcy court certified the case for a direct appeal to the Third Circuit, bypassing the District Court because the bankruptcy court found that the appeal raises matters of significant public interest, the resolution of which would materially advance the progress of the case, and we fully agree with that assessment. On the merit, the appeal challenges both the validity as well as the application of the novel standard that was imposed by the Third Circuit that requires a showing of ""immediate financial distress"" to proceed with the bankruptcy case. That immediate financial distress requirement, which the Third Circuit did not specifically define, is nowhere in the Bankruptcy Code and is contrary to the standards that are employed by other circuits. Moreover, under any reasonable interpretation of that standard, we believe the record has fully established that LTL faced immediate financial distress due to the large volume of talc claims that were asserted against it. In terms of timing. The Third Circuit could rule at any moment whether it will take the direct appeal or not. If it does, we expect briefing to take place over the next couple of months with a decision in the early 2024 time frame. And because we do anticipate the Third Circuit will summarily affirm the application of its standards, we will immediately thereafter request the Supreme Court to resolve the circuit split and decide if the Third Circuit's novel approach is an appropriate standard for deciding a motion to dismiss. We do not think it is. We hope to squeeze the served petition to the Supreme Court into the first term in 2024. But if not, we will raise it in the second term. The second prong of our strategy involves working with the counsel representing the vast majority of the talc payments, more than we had previously that were along with us, along with the -- and in addition to the future claims representatives. And together with the counsel and the future claims representatives, we're pursuing a consensual resolution of the talc claims through another bankruptcy. And that is exactly what the bankruptcy court, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court, urged and strongly recommended that we do in its decision that actually dismissed the case. And the New Jersey Court made those recommendations having found that LTL had made remarkable progress towards an equitable and efficient resolution to date. So we are continuing on in that process. In terms of timing on the second prong. The consensual resolution is on the same trajectory as the initial bankruptcy plan with a vote expected in the next 6 months to determine whether the requisite supermajority of claimants support the plan. Third. While those negotiations are proceeding, we will continue to vigorously defend the meritless talc claims in the tort system. As you may have seen just this last week, we had a significant favorable ruling in that regard with the New Jersey's Appellate Court in the Barden case, reversing a $223 million verdict against the company. The appellate court reversed because it determines the opinions of the leading plaintiff's experts were unsound, were unscientific and were unsubstantiated. And it is that baseless nature of those expert opinions why we have prevailed in the vast majority of the cases that have been tried to date. In terms of timing of the litigation. There are two additional mesothelioma cases that we expect will be tried this year, with more to come in 2024. As with the Barden case, it's important to keep in mind that the ultimate resolution of those matters often is determined at the appellate level, not at the trial level, which is the place and which occur in the forms that the plaintiff lawyers choose. Finally, we will aggressively challenge the abuses of the judicial system by the mass tort claims bar and its experts, with our own affirmative litigation. We mentioned last time that we brought two actions against the plaintiff's bar's lead experts for defaming our talc products with publications premised on knowingly false propositions. And those are moving forward. They've been fully briefed with respect to the initial case motions. And in terms of timing, we expect ruling shortly from the Federal District Court in New Jersey whether those matters may proceed to the discovery phase. So that's a quick summary. I'd be happy to answer any follow-up questions you may have regarding the strategy.Joseph J. WolkGreat. Thank you, Erik. Chris, regarding your second question. If J&amp;J had a nickel for every time voracious was quoted back to me since the second quarter earnings, we probably could have taken up guidance even a little bit more. And while that's often associated with wanting or devouring great quantities, I think it's really the second definition in Webster's, where having a very eager approach to an activity, the construct in which I meant that term in the second quarter. So we -- I could have said that 5 years ago, 10 years ago. My predecessors could have said that. We routinely, almost weekly, meet on new opportunities that may complement our existing portfolio or our future pipeline in both MedTech and Innovative Medicines, and the current moment is no different. In fact, we're in a very good position, given the low levels of net debt, the cash we were able to raise, to fulfill one of our capital allocation priorities, which you're probably very, very familiar with at this point in time. But we're not going to compromise our principles in making sure that it's a strategic fit. So it fits into the scientific expertise, the commercial capabilities or the global reach that will add value to that asset in our hands versus someone else. And we're going to make sure that we're disciplined in that approach financially by ensuring that we have a return that's commensurate with the risk that we're bearing on behalf of shareholders. So we'd much rather have an okay deal pass us by than make a bad deal. And that's kind of the principles that we'll live into. There's no deal that's too big, given our credit rating as well as our financial strength and annual cash flow generation. But as you know, we've had great success doing smaller earlier-stage deals as well. We're agnostic with respect to whether it be -- the next one being MedTech or Innovative Medicines. We are simply looking for the best qualified deal that meets both strategic and financial parameters. So hopefully, that answers your question.OperatorOur next question is coming from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America.Geoffrey Christopher MeachamI'll stick with one. So on CARVYKTI, can you talk about the commercial backdrop just with respect to new centers or prescribers? And related on manufacturing, you guys have any update on the vector constraints and maybe when that could be relieved?Joaquin DuatoThank you, Geoff. And as you have seen in the progression quarter-over-quarter of CARVYKTI, we continue to have, on one hand, strong demand; and on the other hand, progress in our manufacturing. We're also very encouraged by the data that came out with CARTITUDE-4 that eventually, we make CARVYKTI also a medicine in earlier lines of therapy. So when it comes to our manufacturing progress, I'm going to let John explain what are we doing in order to be able to supply the strong demand that we are seeing in CARVYKTI today. Overall, what you can expect, Geoff, is that we -- you will continue to see quarter-over-quarter improvement in 2023 into also 2024.John C. ReedYes, to follow-up on Joaquin's comments. We've been progressively adding more and more capacity. That's included at our original launch site in New Jersey, but we're close to having an additional manufacturing site up and rolling in Europe in Belgium, and also have recently increased our capacity by using some excess capacity that Novartis had to further bolster the number of slots that we can accommodate. One of the traditionally rate-limiting components of the therapy has been the lentivirus component. And there, we've made really outstanding progress in-house mastering that technology, increasing the scale at our factory in Switzerland. And we're in the process -- we're building, and I think it will be available next year, another factory in the Netherlands to support the lentivirus component, which has sometimes been one of the rate-limiting aspects. So altogether, the capacity continues to ramp up, and we continue to perfect the technology, I would say. Same thing with the number of centers that are qualified to administer the therapy, and we're also making progress on a number of countries where CARVYKTI will be available. So very excited, obviously, about the momentum with that. Really best-in-class CAR therapy. The CARTITUDE-4 data, as you know showed unprecedented progression-free survival benefit, a hazard ratio of 0.26, overall response rate of 99%, 86% complete response. Very durable for a one-and-done therapy that was well tolerated. The Grade 3 or above cytokine release syndrome was only 1.1%. So this is really, I think, now emerging as the preferred second-line therapy. And we hope to do more, such as bringing to front line as a possible alternative to stem cell transplant.Joaquin DuatoAnd Geoff, to your point, in multiple myeloma new product launches, we are also very encouraged by the launch of TECVAYLI and also the recent [approval] of TALVEY. The progression of these medicines is exceeding our internal expectations. And we already have about 2,000 health care professionals in the U.S. that are REMS-certified to be able to administer TECVAYLI and TALVEY. So very encouraging progress in these two medicines in multiple myeloma. And we expect to be able to break out TECVAYLI sales beginning in 2024.OperatorYour next question is coming from Josh Jennings from TD Cowen.Joshua Thomas JenningsWas hoping to ask on STELARA and the biosimilar competition in the U.S. now expected in 2025. That's not new news. But wanted to check in on how beneficial is the extra year for the Innovative Medicine business' defense strategy? I guess, focusing on just the potential for TREMFYA to take share from STELARA in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease indications. And does timing shift provide more confidence in the potential hit to constant currency revenue target set for 2025 for the pharma unit?Joaquin DuatoThank you for the question. Certainly, we have always been very confident in being able to hit our $57 billion target in 2025 for pharma. As I have explained before, there are a number of factors there are. The first one and most important is the growth that we're having in our key assets: TREMFYA; ERLEADA; UPTRAVI; our long-acting injectables; and especially DARZALEX, which continue to have a tremendous trajectory gaining share in first line. We are encouraged, as I just commented, by the launches of CARVYKTI; the progression of SPRAVATO; and also the recent launches, too, also in multiple myeloma of TECVAYLI and TALVEY. And looking into 2024, the remainder of the year, and also into 2025, we have some very exciting news in our pipeline. Some of them have been already commented. For example, the first chemo-free regimen as first-line in EGFR-mutated non-small lung cancer. We will be presenting the data of MARIPOSA in -- at ESMO, and that potentially will be a filing and an approval in 2025. This would be a new standard of therapy in this line of therapy in this very important need for patients. We also continue to be encouraged by the progress in our TARIS drug delivery platform. You are also going to see data being presented at ESMO. Very important for us, in two existing products, we will be presenting data on TREMFYA in IBD, both in Crohn's and in ulcerative colitis, for a potential approval later in 2024. That's going to be a very significant growth driver for TREMFYA. Take into consideration that in the STELARA case, IBD represents 75% of the sales. So we still have a lot of growth in front of us with TREMFYA as we do also in ERLEADA, in which we will present data in localized high-risk prostate cancer. We're also going to be able to present some data of nipocalimab in myasthenia gravis, end of this year. So all in all, very good news for our pipeline in 2024 and 2025. Certainly, the entrance of the biosimilars in 2025 in the U.S. is another factor that builds our confidence that we are going to be able to meet the $57 billion. For me, the most important thing now is to look forward and to think about the growth profile of our Innovative Medicine group into the second half of the decade. We have a number of growth drivers that are already there that I've described, but also the strength of our pipeline, both in immunology, in oncology and in neuroscience, profiles us as a strong company that has a strong growth profile into the second half of the decade. And that's part what we will be looking forward to discussing with you in our upcoming enterprise business review, focusing what is going to be the growth profile in the second half of the decade.OperatorNext question is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.Christopher Thomas SchottMaybe, Joe, just a little bit more color on 2024. I appreciate the details you provided, seems like a year of another healthy top line growth. But can you just give us some directional color on margins next year? I know there are some dis-synergies with Kenvue this year. I'm just trying to get a sense of how you think about margin progression here as you kind of balance some of these, kind of the pipeline opportunities and some of these top line growth initiatives, versus kind of dropping that to the bottom line. So just any directional color would be appreciated.Joseph J. WolkYes. Sure, Chris. Thanks for the question. So first off, we're very pleased with the margin progress that we've been able to make in 2023. I think we started the year to -- roughly flat to now improving by 50 basis points. A lot of that has really gone -- is directly attributable to the efforts of many people in the organization who really took the to look at our infrastructure as a two-segment company versus a three-segment company. So the dis-synergies that we warned about and talked about early on in the Kenvue separation process really haven't come to manifest. In fact, as we look out to 2024, we see minimal to almost no impact from dis-synergies from the separation. We are in the process of finalizing our business plans for 2024. I'd like to get a little bit better assessment of how the clinical development pipeline is shaping up, what the investments are required there. But we're a larger company. We take the opportunity to look each and every year at efficiencies. So we're not in a position to give you margin guidance right now, but I would expect that something similar to where we started this year would not be a bad starting point for next year. Again, it's going to depend on the investments that the R&amp;D teams from both MedTech and Innovative Medicines can bring forth. And we'll obviously look to accelerate bringing some great products to patients sooner if we have that opportunity.OperatorYour next question is coming from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.Lawrence H. BiegelsenJoe, just -- could you just clarify what you meant by flat procedures in '24 in MedTech? Are you assuming -- does that mean flat in MedTech growth? And just for my question, can you talk about what you're seeing with bariatrics? For GLP-1, this is. And how you're thinking about the potential impact of GLP-1s across your device business, long term, especially in cardio and ortho?Joseph J. WolkSo I'll give the second half of that question to Joaquin, but thanks for the clarifying question with respect to market growth. We are not suggesting flat market -- or flat market in MedTech next year. What we do is -- are foreseeing right now, based on what we know today, is the elevated levels, the market overall being 5% to 7% versus what traditionally has been maybe 4% to 6%. We see that same 5% to 7% next year. Joaquin?Joaquin DuatoThank you, Larry. And taking a step back, we see the evolution of our MedTech business in a very positive way. One of our key goals for us is to be a top-tier grower in MedTech. When I look at the results of MedTech this year, we are delivering on that. Our growth in the quarter pro forma was 6.4% when you compare with Abiomed as a stand-alone company. And when you look at our pro forma growth year-to-date in MedTech, it's 7.9%. So very pleased with the performance of our MedTech business. And we have expectations to continue our progression into 2024, in part fueled by the procedural growth that we see and also by our continued improvement in our execution and the launch of new products. Some of them we can discuss later. For example, we will be launching our first PFA catheter in Europe into 2024. When it comes to GLP-1s, it's good for patients to have new options for treatment, especially in obesity, which, at times, has been a stigmatized disease in which patients were not looking for treatment due to the stigmatization of that. Certainly, as you commented, we're seeing some impact in our bariatric business in the short term as some patients are reconsidering surgery, expecting to get treatment. But overall, when we talk to surgeons, bariatric surgeons, what is a complementary role of surgery and GLP-1s and many of them comment on the fact that they could see a tailwind for bariatric surgery down the road given this complementary nature, the increased awareness about obesity, more patients seeking treatment. And many of the patients, about 30% of them, are not going to be tolerating these medications, so they would be another funnel for our bariatric business. In the rest of our MedTech business, at this point, we continue to see robust procedure increase, and we don't anticipate that change that -- think that then changing in the foreseeable future.OperatorNext question is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley.Terence C. FlynnI was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more, John, on nipocalimab in RA. I know we're going to see the full data here at ACR. But is this a drug that you see potentially working in a broad population? Or is there a biomarker subset, group, that's more likely to respond? And then how are you thinking about Phase III plans here in this indication?John C. ReedYes. Thanks for the question, and we look forward to sharing those data at the ACR in November in San Diego. The -- we're looking at nipo as either a monotherapy, combined with a precision medicine strategy, or as a combination for a broad population where we aim to combine with an anti-TNF agent. And we see those two mechanisms as being very complementary, reducing the levels of autoantibodies with nipo, and then inhibiting inflammatory mechanisms with the TNF. That so-called DAISY study, the Phase II, is underway now, and we'll test that combination. So that, in general, has been the way we're looking at RA, not only for nipo, but other agents in our pipeline, where we see the future being monotherapies that are targeted in a precision medicine way or broad therapies that are combos that can bring together synergistic mechanisms in a safe way. We're excited to be launching the DAISY program to look at that combo. And we're hoping that, that will bring deeper, more durable remissions for patients as we bring those new mechanisms together.OperatorNext question is coming from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank.Joanne Karen WuenschIs it possible to give us a little bit more detail on a couple of things? You mentioned headwinds from VBP. And I'm just curious if there's, a, a way to quantify it? And b, a way to say if it's at least better or worse or the same as it has been in the last couple of quarters? And then similarly in other aspects of China, we've been hearing a lot about anti-corruption policies, et cetera. If you could comment on that, that would be great.Joaquin DuatoThank you, Joanne. And first, let me say that China for us is a key market and a market in which we are delivering growth now, and we are going to continue to deliver strong growth into 2024. So it's a key growth driver for us. So on one hand, certainly, VBP represents a headwind in price. And on the other hand, it also represents an opportunity as you can expand quality products, medical technologies into more patients. So there are a number of MedTech platforms now currently undergoing VBP headwinds, electrophysiology, spine, trauma, endocutters and energy. And these effects will last during 2023 and part of 2024. We have already anniversary our large joints VBP, so at this point, we have about 80% of our platforms that have been already affected by VBP. Again, as we look into 2024, we expect continue to deliver a strong growth in China and China remaining a key part of our growth. When it comes to question that you were asking in anti-corruption side, we have a strong culture of compliance in our business. And at this point, we may see some limitations related to physician and surgeon access, but we are not seeing any material impact in any part of our business due to that, and we'll continue to monitor the situation. Overall, as I said, we continue to see China as a key driver of our growth and also as a key source of innovation moving into the future.OperatorYour next question is coming from Vamil Divan from Guggenheim Securities.Vamil Kishore DivanGreat. I just want to maybe dive a little deeper on the immunology side. Appreciate some of the comments you made there already. But for the quarter, the performance was very strong for several of your products there. So I'm just curious if there were any sort of onetime items there that we should be aware of. It sounded like it was a lot about patient mix and market growth that you guys were commenting on. I'm curious if you can just highlight any major stocking or sort of onetime pricing adjustments that we should take into account as we look at future quarters.Joaquin DuatoThank you. We are very pleased with the performance of our immunology business. Especially, we're pleased with the performance of TREMFYA with 25.1% growth in the quarter, which shows our ability to drive growth there. As I said before, TREMFYA currently is now indicated in psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis. As an analog, in the case of STELARA, that represents about 25% of the sales. So with the upcoming readouts, filing and potential approvals of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, we expect to have significant growth in TREMFYA. We talk about TREMFYA as a $5 billion product earlier in our Analyst Day in 2021. Now you can see clearly that we're going not only to meet that, but to clearly exceed that benchmark for TREMFYA. So when it comes to STELARA, we had also a very robust growth of close to 16%. In that case, there is a prior period adjustment in the quarter a year ago that represents about 600 basis points. So you should take that into consideration when you think about the STELARA growth. We are very pleased overall, as I said, with our immunology portfolio. Overall, our immunology portfolio in the quarter grew 12.4%, which is very strong considering that we also have headwinds there of REMICADE biosimilars. And we remain very excited about the immunology portfolio as a key driver for J&amp;J. Our Innovative Medicines are going to be bringing significant improvements in IBD with TREMFYA, as I recall. But also staying there, we have our target oral peptide which is going to be presenting some data soon, that we already presented data in psoriasis. And also, we have the combination of guselkumab and golimumab in IBD, which has presented also groundbreaking. So very encouraged about our immunology portfolio and the ability to drive growth in the second half of the decade. More to be seen in our EBR later in the year.OperatorYour next question is coming from Danielle Antalffy from UBS.Danielle Joy AntalffyAhmet, I wanted to actually bring you into the conversation here and ask about some of the innovation in MedTech. And specifically, you guys have an Ottava Day coming up. And just curious what you can say about, a, what we get to see? Obviously, appreciating you're not going to totally open the kimono and front-run the day. But b, and probably most importantly, sort of where you see Ottava ultimately fitting into the robotics landscape and helping contribute to a continued move higher in robotics penetration?Ahmet TezelSo first of all, thank you for the question. Similar to John, this is my first call as well. So really excited to be here, equally excited to be leading a team of talented scientists, engineers and physicians as we do smarter, less invasive and more personalized solutions for our patients. So with respect to Ottava, we have made great progress on the platform. The team is really focused on combining a really differentiated architecture, based on its software and hardware, together with our best-in-class instruments. And we believe that combination of a differentiated architecture with instruments is going to enable us to have high value from day 1. Now we will have more updates on Ottava next month, as you mentioned. And at that time, we will provide a lot more detail. But the one point I'll make is that, even today, robotic-assisted surgery penetration is in single digits. So there's still a lot of growth left in that segment. And we're really excited because Ottava brings a lot of differentiation. So we're very excited that we can make a big kind of path. We can open our path and growth there in that segment as well.Joaquin DuatoDanielle, if I may interject here on Ottava. I've been in touch with multiple surgeons around the world. And one common comment that I find is that they all want, they all are rooting for Johnson &amp; Johnson to come into the robotic surgical space. They want to have the service and the support that they have accustomed doing decades with our Ethicon business, and they also want to be able to utilize the advanced instruments with whom they have grown. So what I see in the surgical space is that the surgeons want to have alternatives, and they are all looking forward to having Johnson &amp; Johnson play an important role in robotic surgery.Jessica MooreThank you, Danielle. We have time for one last question.OperatorOur final question today is coming from Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald.Louise Alesandra ChenI wanted to ask you on the FLAURA2 results, if they impacted at all your thinking on your market opportunity for MARIPOSA? And why or why not?John C. ReedNo, I don't think it influences because it's really important to pay attention not only to progression-free survival, but also overall survival as well as the PFS to the survival on the second line of therapy. Unfortunately, with today's therapies, almost all lung cancer patients will eventually relapse, they will need a second line therapy. And we think chemo was best reserved for that circumstance, where the patient now has failed the frontline targeted therapies. So I would really say, pay attention to overall survival, pay attention to that progression-free survival, too, endpoint because these are going to be, I think, really things that matter in terms of what the long-term outcome is for patients with EGF receptor mutant lung cancer. The -- we believe, based on the data we'll present in the Presidential session at ESMO, that the combination of RYBREVANT, our bispecific antibody, the first bispecific ever approved for a solid tumor indication, incidentally, fully human; as well as the third-generation small molecule oral EGF receptor, lazertinib, which is brain-penetrant. In our mind, we believe that, that will become the new frontline standard of care for EGF receptor mutant lung cancer and offer patients durable remissions that are achieved in a chemo-free regimen.Jessica MooreThank you, and thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. We apologize to those that we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team with any remaining questions you may have.I will now turn the call back to Joaquin for some brief closing remarks.Joaquin DuatoThank you, Jess, and thank you to all of you for joining us today. I'm proud to present today the company's performance. This is the first quarter that we report as a new J&amp;J, focused in health care innovation, in MedTech and in Pharmaceuticals. And I believe this new J&amp;J has a better foundation to continue to drive growth for the next decades. We are achieving strong results in 2023 with our 7.5% adjusted operational growth in the quarter. It's the second quarter in a row that we have a beat and a raise of our guidance. And we continue to believe that we're going to have a very strong finish into 2023, and that reads well for a strong 2024, too. We have a dedicated team, both in Innovative Medicines and in MedTech. And we think we are very well positioned, as I said, to carry the momentum that you are seeing in 2023 into 2024. Finally, we are looking forward to engaging all of you at our Enterprise Business Review on December 5. Thank you very much and enjoy the rest of your day.OperatorThank you. This concludes today's Johnson &amp; Johnson's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.]"

He added that J&amp;J also will continue to “vigorously defend itself” in talc cases that come to trial while it explores the bankruptcy option once again.Courts have twice rejected J&amp;J’s attempts to use the bankruptcy courts to force a talc settlement by setting up a trust to pay victims. Chapter 11 rules let corporations put money into trusts that decide how much claimants should be paid, instead of allowing juries to decide damages. Many J&amp;J claimants have vocally opposed relying on a trust.In July, a judge in New Jersey rejected J&amp;J’s second bankruptcy attempt, in which the company sought to resolve at least 40,000 suits for about $8.9 billion. The judge said J&amp;J didn’t meet the test for financial distress imposed by a federal appeals court. The company has vowed to appeal that ruling to the US Supreme Court. In the meantime, J&amp;J faces at least at half dozen trials over the next six month in which talc users will ask jurors to find the company’s baby powder caused their cancers.Story continuesClare Boyle, a J&amp;J spokesperson, declined to comment further on the company’s plans.Attorneys for some plaintiffs opposed the idea of a return to bankruptcy court.“It’s unbelievable that J&amp;J would even think about trying to once again use the bankruptcy courts to cram down an unfair settlement on talc victims after being told twice before they are misusing the Chapter 11 system,” Andy Birchfield, an Alabama-based lawyer who represents thousands of women suing over cancers they blame on baby powder use, said Tuesday in an interview. “We are not interested in allowing a wealthy corporation to try to force us into a paltry resolution of these cases.”Read More: J&amp;J Sees Talc-Suit Surge After $9 Billion Settlement TossedJ&amp;J’s lawyers already know they’ll be on thin ice trying to use bankruptcy courts again to deal with the company’s talc exposure, so the strategy is more about delaying trials, said Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond professor who teaches about mass-tort law.“J&amp;J could face court sanctions if they take this blatant step of defying the appellate courts and having a unit file for bankruptcy once again,” Tobias said. “It’s a head-scratching move.”The first time J&amp;J put a unit into bankruptcy to resolve the baby-powder suits, an appeals court ordered the case dismissed, finding the company didn’t face imminent financial distress. J&amp;J is one of the most profitable companies in the world, with a credit rating higher than the US government.“The first attempt was a creative gambit, at best,” said Elizabeth Burch, a University of Georgia professor who specializes in the law governing consolidated mass-tort cases. “The second attempt was ethically dubious. And a third attempt to use bankruptcy to rope in plaintiffs who don’t want to settle seems nothing short of bad faith.”51,000 LawsuitsJ&amp;J now faces at least 51,000 lawsuits claiming talc used in baby power and similar products caused cancer, which have been consolidated before a federal judge in New Jersey for pre-trial information exchanges. During its second bankruptcy, lawyers said the company may eventually face about 100,000 claims.Consumers allege in those cases that J&amp;J executives knew since the early 1970s its talc-based powders contained trace amounts of asbestos, but failed to alert consumers or regulators. J&amp;J contends its talc-based products don’t cause cancer and the company has marketed baby powder appropriately for more than 100 years.The New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company pulled its talc-based powders off the market in the US and Canada in 2020, citing slipping sales, and replaced talcum with a cornstarch-based version. J&amp;J vowed to remove all its baby powders containing talcum powder worldwide by the end of this year.Holly Froum and Negisa Balluku, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts, said last month that J&amp;J may wind up paying as much as $10 billion to resolve its talc liability after the bankruptcy’s dismissal. Earlier this year, Chris Schott, a JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. analyst, estimated J&amp;J’s total talc liability at $8 billion to $10 billion.A poll of talc plaintiffs will be organized in the next six months to gauge potential support for a settlement, Haas said. Even if a third bankruptcy survived a challenge, the company would still need to win the backing of at least 75% of claimants to create a trust to settle cases. Lawyers for victims opposing the settlement say they have the votes to block J&amp;J’s bankruptcy gambit.Mikal Watts, a lawyer for talc victims interested in J&amp;J’s offer, said Tuesday its unclear whether third time’s the charm for J&amp;J’s efforts to resolve the talc liability via Chapter 11. “Everybody is working hard to see if we can achieve a settlement this time.”The consolidated case is In Re Johnson &amp; Johnson Talcum Powder Products Marketing, Sales Practices and Products Liability Litigation, 16-md-2738, U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey (Trenton).(Updates with law professors’ comments starting in ninth paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekJeep’s Jump to $100,000 SUVs Risks Leaving Loyal Buyers BehindThe Ozempic Effect Is Coming for Everything From Kidney to Heart Disease TreatmentsThe New Middle East Is an All-Too-Familiar NightmareBiden’s FCC Revives the Longest-Running Policy Fight in TechIndia’s Glitzy Cricket Contest Is Entering the Big Leagues©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis on the strategic significance of these bases and head over directly to the 5 Most Important U.S. Military Bases in the World.The United States, in its early years, was a country that did not want to intervene in armed conflicts outside its borders. The country’s attitude towards having a global role changed completely after the two world wars which made it a nation that proactively sought to keep an eye on global threats and also promote American ideals across the world. While military and intelligence capabilities of the United States were greatly stretched in the two World Wars and later during the Cold War, in modern times it has had to grapple with the challenges emanating from countries like Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran. Therefore, in order to have a logistical edge over its foes, the US maintains military bases around the world, which gives it the capability to strike enemy targets anywhere in the world. A majority of these bases are equipped with modern military equipment and airfields.According to a report, the U.S. had about 750 military bases across 80 countries in the world and had deployed 173,000 troops in 159 different countries as of July 2021. Japan has the highest number of overseas military bases of the U.S. with 120 bases, followed by Germany and South Korea at second and third, with 119 and 73 bases respectively. These numbers are testament to America’s military and economic strength to be able to have such significant military presence outside its borders.United States Military StrengthThe United States has the most powerful military in the world. The country accounts for nearly 40% of all defense spending worldwide, which is triple the amount that China spends, and more than the combined amount that the next ten highest spenders incur on defense expenditure.Story continuesThe U.S. is also home to some of the largest defense contractors in the world. Most notably four of the top five defense contractors in the world, which include Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX), General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD), and The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA). You can read more on this in our article, Top 16 Defense Contractors in the World in 2023.U.S. Military Bases in the Middle EastThough an exact count is not known, the U.S. has several military bases in the Middle East that deploy more than 30,000 U.S. troops according to the Department of Defense. The most notable of all is the Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, situated west of Doha. It is the largest military installation of the United States in the Middle East and critical for operations in the region. The air base hosts an estimated 11,000 troops and is well equipped with fighter jets. The US Air Force deployed five 5th Generation F-22 Raptors developed by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) to the air base in 2020.The Al-Udeid Air Base is also used by the US to aid Qatar in bolstering its defense capabilities. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) in 2020 got a $657.2 million deal from the Qataris to provide sparing and logistics support for the Qatari air force’s fleet of F-15 aircraft. Moreover, formerly Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX), now RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) received a $77 million contract in the same year to upgrade Qatar’s Air Operations Center by 2025. Work on both contracts was and is being carried out at the Al-Udeid Air Base.U.S. Military Bases in Japan and South KoreaThe Americans have maintained a military presence in Japan since the conclusion of the second World War in 1945 and in South Korea since the Korean War starting 1950. More than half of all American troops deployed overseas are stationed in these two countries. Camp Humphreys, located 40 miles south of Seoul in South Korea, is the largest overseas U.S. military base in the world.The base is equipped with Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, an anti-ballistic missile defense system developed for South Korea by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) in response to regular missile threats from North Korea.U.S. Military Presence in EuropeThere are eight U.S. Army garrisons located across Europe which are home to at least 60,000 troops. Germany has the highest number of American bases and troops among European countries. The most notable U.S. military base in Europe is the Ramstein Air Base in Germany, which is critical to the American Air Force’s European operations.MethodologyWe have ranked the 15 most important U.S. military bases in the world based on our analysis and that of several other defense experts on the strategic importance of current active American military bases. Both domestic and overseas bases of the U.S. military are covered in this article. We've ranked these bases in order of importance.15 Most Important U.S. Military Bases in the WorldThe Visual Explorer / Shutterstock.comLet’s now head over to the list of the most important U.S. military bases in the world.15. Fort Meade, MarylandFort Meade is a large United States military installation located in Maryland that is critical for cyber and intelligence operations as it houses the U.S. Cyber Command and National Security Agency (NSA). First established in 1917, it is named after one of the most prominent generals of the Civil War, General George G. Meade. 14. Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, HawaiiHickam Air Field and Naval Base Pearl Harbor merged two historic bases to become one joint base in 2010. Both are of immense significance to the United States military. Hickam is home to the 15th Wing, 154th Wing, and the Hawaii Air National Guard. It also provides support to 140 associate and tenant units. On the other hand, Pearl Harbor provides vital shore side support to submarines and naval ships.Together, the joint base is home to 270 tenant units, several ships and submarines, and seven fixed-wing aviation squadrons. The base has a population of more than 100,000 people.13. Thule Air Base, GreenlandThe Thule Air Base is one of the most important U.S. military bases in the world, located only 947 miles from the North Pole, and 750 miles north of the Arctic Circle. This air force base is of vital significance when it comes to missile warning and space control and surveillance. The Thule Air Base is capable of detecting all intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) targeting any place in North America.12. RAF Lakenheath and RAF Mildenhall, United KingdomThese two sister bases have the largest presence of U.S. troops in the United Kingdom. Although it has a status of being the British Royal Air Force Station, the RAF Mildenhall and RAF Lakenheath primarily provide services to the US Air Force and are home to the 100th Air Refueling Wing. These are two of the most important U.S. military bases in the world.11. Naval Station Rota, SpainNaval Station Rota in Spain is often referred to as the gateway to the Mediterranean.

In May, Nate Anderson’s firm leveled a series of accusations against Icahn Enterprises, claiming that it was over-leveraged and trading at an excessively steep premium to its net asset value. Hindenburg also said that IEP’s once-high dividends weren’t sustainable.IEP fell 1% to close at $17.77 in New York trading Tuesday, giving the firm a market value of about $7 billion.

The European Commission on Thursday ordered Illumina to unwind the transaction. Icahn, who has a position in Illumina, has long been critical of the deal.The complaint accusing the defendants of breaching their financial duty was filed under seal Tuesday, according to Delaware Chancery Court records.Story continues“Throughout my long, long career as an activist, I have never found it necessary, until today, to sue a board of directors in this manner,” Icahn said. “The lawsuit has been filed under seal, so we are limited in what we can say. I continue to believe in the company’s long-term potential and I have full faith in Illumina’s new CEO, and its employees.”David McAlpine, a spokesperson for Illumina, said the company is reviewing the complaint. Illumina has previously said Icahn failed to fully understand the value of the Grail deal and the regulatory issues involved in it.Icahn is one of the most famous activist investors, having owned or sparred with a long-list of famous companies, including TWA, RJR Nabisco, Marvel, Texaco and Blockbuster.

(SO) is Poised to Beat Earnings Estimates Again,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-southern-co-poised-beat-161010391.html,1697559010,STORY,['SO'],"[Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? Southern Co. (SO), which belongs to the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This power company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 9.01%.For the most recent quarter, Southern Co. Was expected to post earnings of $0.74 per share, but it reported $0.79 per share instead, representing a surprise of 6.76%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.71 per share, while it actually produced $0.79 per share, a surprise of 11.27%.With this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Southern Co.In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Southern Co. Currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.61%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on November 2, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. NRG Energy (NRG) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.93 a share, just 20 days from its upcoming earnings release on November 6, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $1.93 Most Accurate Estimate and the $1.79 Zacks Consensus Estimate, NRG Energy has an Earnings ESP of 8.12%.NRG is part of a big group of Utilities stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Southern Co. (SO) as well.Southern Co. is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on November 2, 2023. SO's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.32 a share 16 days from its next earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Southern Co. is $1.31, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.61%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, NRG and SO could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

The plant will have an annual capacity of 600 kilotons of finished goods.The partnership is a significant step toward the decarbonization of the industrial sector in the United States. The aluminum industry is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, and Novelis is committed to reducing its carbon footprint.The new solar plants will help Novelis achieve its goal of being carbon neutral by 2050 or sooner. These are expected to generate enough clean energy to power more than half of the Bay Minette facility's renewable energy needs. This will help Novelis reduce its reliance on fossil fuels and save money on energy costs. In addition to the solar plants, Southern Co. and Novelis are also exploring other projects to reduce the latter’s carbon emissions, including carbon capture, energy storage, etc.In conclusion, the partnership between SO and Novelis is a win-win for both companies and the environment. The solar plants will help Novelis reduce its carbon emissions, save money on energy costs and create jobs.

221,c245b801-8dbc-349e-a7de-f9eae76c0f3a,CI,2023-10-18,Cigna Group's (NYSE:CI) 24% CAGR outpaced the company's earnings growth over the same three-year period,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cigna-groups-nyse-ci-24-110054308.html,1697626854,STORY,['CI'],"[One simple way to benefit from the stock market is to buy an index fund. But many of us dare to dream of bigger returns, and build a portfolio ourselves. For example, the The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) share price is up 82% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 18% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 7.5% in the last year , including dividends .On the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Cigna Group To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During three years of share price growth, Cigna Group achieved compound earnings per share growth of 17% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 22% average annual increase in the share price. This indicates that the market is feeling more optimistic on the stock, after the last few years of progress. It is quite common to see investors become enamoured with a business, after a few years of solid progress.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Cigna Group has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Cigna Group the TSR over the last 3 years was 90%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveCigna Group provided a TSR of 7.5% over the last twelve months. But that was short of the market average. It's probably a good sign that the company has an even better long term track record, having provided shareholders with an annual TSR of 9% over five years. Maybe the share price is just taking a breather while the business executes on its growth strategy. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   3 warning signs for Cigna Group  that you should be aware of.But note: Cigna Group may not be the best stock to buy.

Last Monday, defense stocks, oil, and safe-haven assets surged, while Israeli stocks plunged.According to The Wall Street Journal, Iran helped plan the attack, which could derail the recent easing of its tensions with the Biden administration and the removal of restrictions on its oil exports.Another major concern is that Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon, which shares a northern border with Israel, might step up attacks. Hezbollah is much more powerful and better equipped than Hamas.If Iran escalates the war, and Israel ends up fighting on several fronts, defense stocks could rally further.Shares of Northrop Grumman NOC have surged about 16% since the start of the conflict, while those of Lockheed Martin LMT and General Dynamics GD are about 10% higher.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Right now, both Embraer and Northrop Grumman are sporting a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that these stocks have improving earnings outlooks. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.ERJ currently has a forward P/E ratio of 19.17, while NOC has a forward P/E of 21.57. We also note that ERJ has a PEG ratio of 1.13. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. NOC currently has a PEG ratio of 5.82.Another notable valuation metric for ERJ is its P/B ratio of 0.93. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, NOC has a P/B of 4.78.Story continuesThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to ERJ's Value grade of A and NOC's Value grade of C.Both ERJ and NOC are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that ERJ is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

225,eb7a7af7-8b53-3ced-a264-e2e8d0b121d7,NKE,2023-10-18,20 Most Eco-Friendly Cities in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-most-eco-friendly-cities-085315320.html,1697619195,STORY,"['HLT', 'NKE']","[In this article, we look at the 20 most eco-friendly cities in the world. If you would like to skip our detailed analysis of the sustainability of urban infrastructures, you can directly go to the 5 Most Eco-friendly Cities in the World. Climate change has been one of the biggest crises of the 21st century, and it has affected so much beyond nature. Rising temperatures and extreme weather events have resulted in drastic and costly consequences for our urban settings as well. The changing weather has severely affected everything from human health to basic urban infrastructure. In addition, urban activities have contributed severely to environmental damage, making this a cyclical process where one event eventually becomes a catalyst for its own perpetuation. According to the UNEP, more than 75% of global CO2 emissions come from urban settings, with the transportation and construction industries being the two most significant contributors to this plague.This is one of the biggest reasons why today’s urban settings need to be made eco-friendly if the world hopes to put some limitations on this ever-increasing climate devastation. The WHO has estimated that almost 3.5 billion people are currently living in areas that are prone to climate change and its associated damages. If efforts aren’t made to curb the impending danger, climate change could ultimately cause as many as 250,000 additional deaths per year, leading to another world epidemic. The consequences will not be limited to life and nature; current trends have showcased the economy taking a major hit because of climate change as well. Also see 25 Best Countries for Green Living.Morgan Stanley estimated that the world had to spend a collective of $650 billion to respond to climate disasters just between the years of 2016-2018. A myriad of other studies have reported that national economies worldwide are spending billions of dollars trying to deal with the impacts of climate change. Countries with fragile economies are especially at stake because they would require international assistance in order to deal with their climate issues. All of these issues have combined to make sustainable and eco-friendly cities a need of the hour. They’re not just fancy checklists for environment enthusiasts; rather, they’re a necessity without which the global economy cannot hope to stand a chance against the doom of climate change. Story continuesThe idea of a sustainable city is an all-encompassing one. It’s an urban area holistically designed and managed in a way that makes it sustainable in all three areas of social, environmental, and economic impact. Sustainability itself doesn’t come from changing policies in just one industry; instead, it has to be the collective impact of every sector, from transportation and infrastructure to energy and power. Business corporations are leading the environmental movement in many cities around the world through CSR initiatives and projects that deploy green technologies and provide citizens with better access to a sustainable lifestyle. A 2022 report by UNCTAD took a deep dive into how urban entrepreneurs utilize innovative solutions to tackle the rising environmental challenges in urbanized settings. Based on its findings, the report called for policymakers to generate collaborative stakeholder relationships with these entrepreneurs to develop eco-friendly cities in the world. According to the report, such ties can lead to strengthened communities and improved well-being for those living within them. In terms of businesses, Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE) is making some brilliant contributions to building sustainable cities. According to research studies, nearly 10% of global carbon emissions come from fast fashion, which is turning cities into dumpsters. Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE) has elaborated on its Move to Zero mission, which aims to increase the percentage of recycled materials in its products. Steps like these might not seem like direct contributions to urban sustainability, but with objectives like these, companies like Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE) are setting the groundwork for eco-friendly cities worldwide. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) is a corporation working directly on SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities. Under its broader goal of creating a positive impact on the environment, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) has taken several steps to reduce its carbon emissions. These include reducing single-use plastics within the hotels, utilizing energy-efficient LEDs, tracking the environmental impact of over 5,000 hotel branches, and investing in climate-related funds. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) also believes it opened the first net-zero hotel in the US, i.e., Hotel Marcel New Haven, Tapestry Collection by Hilton.While some might blame these big corporations for greenwashing and using these initiatives as cover-ups for their wider carbon emissions, others may see it as a step in the right direction. Regardless, many companies have been increasingly adopting 'environment-friendly' measures.Despite these contradictory views, it can be said that some cities have emerged as the most eco-friendly cities in the world and, hence, can be adopted as model structures for other cities with similar circumstances. As awareness around the need for sustainable cities grows, investors prefer focusing their capital on these cities because they offer good prospects in terms of long-term business. These cities also provide better living standards for those who’ve spent their whole lives surrounded by urban pollution and degradation. You can also check out 25 cities that have the best climate year round.20 Most Eco-Friendly Cities in the WorldRawpixel.com/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyIn order to aid investors and citizens in locating the most eco-friendly cities in the world, we have utilized three extensive indexes that evaluate hundreds of cities on a lengthy list of criteria. The Arcadis Sustainable Cities Index 2022 has evaluated 100 cities regarding their economic, social, and environmental health. The planet pillar has indicators such as waste management, public consumption, renewable energy, and GHGs. The IESE Cities in Motion Index (CIMI) has ranked 183 cities on nine sectors across 112 indicators, of which environment is one angle. Lastly, the Sustainable Cities Index Report by Corporate Knights has ranked 70 cities in terms of their environmental health, using factors such as water consumption, sustainable transport, and climate change resilience. The top 35 cities (based on environmental factors) were shortlisted from all three indices and then ordered based on their average rankings. For the cities which acquired an equal average ranking, the CIMI is used to tie-break. The rankings are arranged in descending order, with the value ‘1’ being assigned to the most eco-friendly city in the world. Here are the most sustainable cities in the world. 20. Los Angeles, USAAverage Rating: 24The Los Angeles metropolitan area has the largest number of electric vehicles in the US, close to some 293,000. The city is also commended for having quite an EV-friendly highway system and a good ratio of charging stations as compared to the population numbers. The city has also significantly invested in its public transportation system to fight carbon emission levels.19.  Vancouver, CanadaAverage Rating: 23.6Over 95% of the electricity in Vancouver comes from renewable sources, which makes this place one of the most eco-friendly cities in the world. The Greenest City Action Plan aims to increase this number to 100% by 2050. The city also currently has 77 ‘green spaces’ spread throughout its entirety, with thousands of ‘green’ and ‘clean energy’ jobs in its various industries. 18. Frankfurt, GermanyAverage Rating: 21CIMI Score: 27One-third of the total urban area in Frankfurt is covered by greenery, which contributes massively to the reduction of CO2 levels in the atmosphere. The city is filled with locations that house beehives on their rooftops, stabilizing the local biodiversity. The city also has a giant solar panel grid with a yearly yield of almost 300,000 kWh. 17. Ottawa, Canada Average Rating: 21CIMI Score: 23As one of the most sustainable cities in the world, Ottawa’s most prominent distinction is its ever-improving air quality. Maintaining high air quality can prove to be quite difficult in an era defined by personal ownership of multiple vehicles, but Ottawa has achieved this due to policies such as shifting away from fossil fuels, especially coal. 16. Hamburg, GermanyAverage Rating: 20Hamburg has managed to carry environmental sustainability and economic development hand-in-hand, which is quite a feat in today’s urbanized world. The city has especially achieved considerable milestones in terms of waste reduction, cycle paths, neighborhood redevelopments, and electric mobility. Hamburg was named the ‘European green capital’ as early as 2011, and since then, it has only improved in terms of being one of the most eco-friendly cities in the world. 15. Auckland, New ZealandAverage Rating: 19CIMI Score: 32Auckland is highly commended for the speed at which it is going green, which is one of the fastest in the whole world. A study by Lonely Planet in 2021 named Auckland ‘the best city to travel to’ for its scenic outdoor spaces. The city has managed to generate a 6% increase in its forest-covered areas since 1990. 14. Canberra, AustraliaAverage Rating: 19CIMI Score: 08Canberra is considered one of the most eco-friendly cities in the world due to its excellent system of public transportation and its air quality levels. A 2021 study by Uswitch ranked Canberra as the most sustainable in the world, with 88.6% of its transport infrastructure being green. Pollution levels are also comparatively low, with only 13.89 polluted particles out of every 100. 13. Amsterdam, The NetherlandsAverage Rating: 17.6 One of the biggest sustainable ventures in Amsterdam is the city’s high usage of bicycles, with 63% of the city residents using bicycles on a daily basis and 32% of the traffic movement being by bike, making up the largest chunk. The city also has a vast number of eco-friendly and ethical restaurants with innovative policies for waste management and sustainability. 12. Vienna, Austria Average Rating: 17Every one in two city residents makes use of public transport in Vienna, making it the primary source of movement around the city. Renewable sources fulfill 30% of the city’s energy requirement, and composting is a major element within its infrastructure. In the 2020 ranking of the world’s greenest cities put out by Resonance Consultancy, Vienna took the first place. 11. Zurich, SwitzerlandAverage Rating: 15.5 The city of Zurich plans to reduce direct greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2040, a decade earlier than many other cities on this list have planned. The city has individual plans in place for multiple indicators of eco-friendliness; examples include the Noise Protection Strategy (2020), Heat Mitigation Plan (2021), Urban Trees Plan (2022), and multiple others. This major focus from a policymaking arena is what helps Zurich be one of the most eco-friendly cities in the world. 10. Munich, Germany Average Rating: 15Munich follows a socio-economic sustainability model that empowers local businesses for long-term sustainability. The city has a growing number of cycle lanes, with affordable public bikes available to rent. Munich is also filled with zero-waste stores and farmers’ markets that value ethical production and consumption. 09. Tokyo, JapanAverage Rating: 14.6 The Tokyo Metropolitan Government (TMG) plans to turn Tokyo into the world’s first ESG city by 2050, aiming for it to become a model for urban settings worldwide. One of the project’s main goals is to attract ESG-focused venture capital, which has led the government to set up a subsidy scheme for companies focusing on sustainability. The ESG model envisions a zero-emission building and public transport infrastructure. 08. Edinburgh, United Kingdom Average Rating: 14.5The household waste generated by residents of Edinburgh is less than any other city in Scotland, making the city a prime example of waste management and recycled consumption. Almost 25% of the population uses the bus either daily or every other day. From 2010 to 2017, Edinburgh recorded the fourth-highest reduction in CO2 emissions compared to all major UK cities. A First Mile study from 2019 named Edinburgh as the greenest city in the UK. 07. Montreal, CanadaAverage Rating: 13.5 Montreal is said to have the fourth-best cycling infrastructure in the world, making it one of the most eco-friendly cities in the world. There are 65 parks spread across the city, making for quite a green infrastructure. 99% of the city’s energy comes from renewable sources. The city has released multiple sustainability action plans that draw collaboration from business corporations as well. 06. Berlin, Germany Average Rating: 11.3 Berlin is considered the most eco-friendly city in Europe for tourists, based on survey reports by Schengen Visa Info. The city performs exceptionally well in terms of the number of sustainable hotels and vegan dining options that are available. 44% of the city is covered by natural elements such as parks and forested lands, a number higher than most European cities. The city has also cut its carbon emission levels by one-third compared to 1990.  Click to continue reading and see the 5 Most Eco-friendly Cities in the World.Suggested Articles:15 Most Sustainable Companies in the World15 Countries That Care About The Environment Most20 Most Environmentally Friendly States in AmericaDisclosure: None. 20 Most Eco-friendly Cities in the World is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Q3 Earnings Season Scorecard Including this morning's earnings reports, we now have Q3 results from 39 S&amp;P 500 members that combined account for 11.4% of the index's market capitalization. Total earnings for these 39 index members are up +7.1% from the same period last year on +7% higher revenues, with 89.7% beating EPS estimates and 69.2% beating revenue estimates. While the beats percentages are about in-line with the preceding 20-quarter average for this group of 39 index members, the earnings growth rate represents a modest improvement over other recent quarters. For the Finance sector, which has dominated this initial reporting cycle, we now have Q3 results from 31.2% of the sector's total market capitalization in the S&amp;P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance companies are up +9.7% from the same period last year on +9.3% higher revenues, with 100% of the companies beating EPS estimates and 72.7% beating revenue estimates. While the revenue beats percentage for this group of Finance sector companies is about in-line with other recent quarters, the EPS beats percentage is the highest for this group since the second quarter of 2021. Hard to draw any firm conclusions from this relatively small sample of results at this stage, but it is nevertheless a positive start to the Q3 earnings season. Looking at Q3 as a whole, combining the actual results for the 39 index members that have reported with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total earnings for the quarter are now expected to be down -1.1% on +0.8% higher revenues. Story continuesExcluding the Energy sector drag, Q3 earnings for the rest of the index would be up +3.9% on +3.3% higher revenues.

Dollar Tree (DLTR) stock rises on an upgrade from Goldman Sachs forecasting a strong upside on the discount retailer's growth strategy. Lastly, activist investment firm Engaged Capital is taking a stake in V.F. Corporation (VFC), whose brand portfolio includes Vans and North Face.Yahoo Finance Live anchors Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton take a closer look at several stocks after Tuesday's closing bell.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: Let's get to some other movers we are watching and we want to start with one that also had to do with earnings. That is Bank of New York Mellon out with a beat on the top and bottom line. While deposits slid for the quarter, executives on the earnings call said that deposits are likely to moderate going forward. In other words, they're not going to be falling by the same pace.This is a similar situation to what we saw with Charles Schwab yesterday where deposits are still falling, but the rate of decline is slowing. And that maybe there's some sort of trough that investors are looking for when it comes to deposits here. The company also says its assets under custody or administration were $45.7 trillion at the end of September. That was actually down a little bit from the end of June. So it's not just, sort of, consumer deposits it's also its assets under management or under custody.JOSH LIPTON: But you can see that well in the green. I think you nailed it. I mean, the key here does seem to be the bank is saying total deposits, yes, they dropped 5% in the quarter. But then execs on the call seemed to indicate that, yes, this is likely to stabilize going forward. I think that's what investors really clued in on. Also, they did reaffirm their growth targets in 2023.Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: Yeah.JOSH LIPTON: Moving on, Goldman Sachs points to a potential 20% upside for Dollar Tree. Analysts upgrading the discount store to buy from neutral and boosted the price target as well. The firm noting it sees strong earnings growth potential driven by gains in market share and sticky inflation reels in low and middle-income consumers.So Goldman now fans-- actually not just of Dollar Tree, which you say, but actually their fans have Dollar Tree and Ollie's Bargain Outlet. They go to buy on both those names, Julie, . It seems like what they like here is a couple of things they like the value offerings. They like the easier comps and they like what they see as attractive valuations.By the way, they also downgraded BJ's Wholesale to neutral saying other names look more compelling in their universe. You can see some of the pops there.JULIE HYMAN: You know, it's really interesting to me here because, on the one hand, there's been this thesis that these various discount retailers would benefit during a time of economic weakness and yet they're all down year to date, including Dollar Tree, which you can see is off by 18% So so much for that kind of phenomenon helping things here.And then finally, wrapping it up with VF Corp, those shares jumping in today's session. The move coming after activist investment firm Engaged Capital took a stake in the company. Engaged Capital pushing for cost cuts and changes to the board for VF Corp, which is the owner of brands like Vans and North Face.But those shares higher by 14%. VF saying in a statement to us, they're aware of Engaged Capital's investment in the company and the comments. And they said, ""We value the views of our shareholders and seek to maintain an open dialogue with the investment community."" So not--JOSH LIPTON: Exactly what you should say.JULIE HYMAN: --you know, not saying go away, but not saying come here either, right, which is, kind of, treading the line.JOSH LIPTON: So basically, it sounds like Engaged Capital is saying, listen, we want to build a stake. We want you to make divestitures and we want you to pay down debt, which Bloomberg says, by their math, now amounts to about $8 billion as of July. So this is the company that control Vans. They control North Face, and Dickies. They did hire this new CEO over the summer as well as you were dealing with softer sales growth.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, exactly.]"

The main indexes managed to pare most of these losses by the close, though, even as Treasury yields spiked. Ahead of the opening bell, data from the Census Bureau showed retail sales rose 0.7% from August to September, more than economists were expecting. Excluding auto sales, retail sales were up 0.6%.""Retail sales defied expectations with a large September gain, putting consumer spending on very strong footing entering into Q4,"" says Jonathan Millar, senior U.S. economist at Barclays.

The big bank said Q3 earnings were down 36% year-over-year to $5.47 per share, though this was still more than analysts were anticipating. Revenue of $11.8 billion also beat estimates.Nvidia sheds $53 billion in market capNvidia (NVDA) was another notable decliner today, with the semiconductor stock slumping 4.7% after the U.S. said it will expand restrictions on sales of artificial intelligence (AI) chips to China. While shares finished well off their session lows after a company spokesperson said that Nvidia doesn't ""expect a near-term meaningful impact"" on financial results, today's slide still chopped $53 billion from the trillion-dollar chipmaker's market cap.Story continuesAlso in single-stock news, VF Corp (VFC) surged 14.0% after The Wall Street Journal indicated activist investor Engaged Capital is building a stake in the North Face parent. The report suggests Engaged wants to help VFC cut unnecessary costs and potentially shake up the board of directors.It's been a rough stretch for VFC stock, which is down 33% for the year-to-date. Off the price charts, the retailer slashed its dividend in February, though at 7.4%, it remains one of the highest yielding dividend stocks in the S&amp;P 500.As for the major indexes, the rate-sensitive Nasdaq Composite was the worst performer – shedding 0.3% to 13,533 as yields on the 2-year and 10-year Treasuries headed back toward levels not seen in nearly two decades.

The expansion will result in branches in more than 200 markets across 39 states, according to a press release the bank issued in June.Bank of America has said it plans to lower its total branch count with the help of digital banking services. As of Oct. 13, Bank of America had 3,798 U.S. branches, according to data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.At an industry conference earlier this year, Aron Levine, the company's president of preferred banking, said there will be a net reduction in branches, but at a ""more gradual"" speed.""We have a strategy of identifying areas where we can close two, open one,"" Levine said.On Tuesday, during Bank of America's quarterly earnings call, CEO Brian Moynihan told analysts that the headcount in the company's consumer business went from about 100,000 to about 60,000 and ""continues to drift down"" as digital banking adoption increases.Story continuesWells Fargo, meanwhile, closed one branch in 11 different states and two branches apiece in New Mexico and California, according to the OCC bulletin. Those closures were effective on Oct. 4.The San Francisco-based bank has cut the number of branches it operates by 6% from a year ago, Chief Financial Officer Michael Santomassimo said last week during the company's third-quarter earnings call.Still, ""branches continue to play an important role"" in the way the company serves its customers, Santamassimo said. Wells is both refurbishing some branches and looking at ""targeted expansions"" in markets such as Chicago, where it currently operates just seven branches, he said.The $1.9 trillion-asset bank has said that it plans to open at least 23 more branches in the greater Chicago area. Wells had 4,471 branches as of Oct. 13, according to FDIC data.""As customer preferences and transaction patterns change, so will our branches,"" a Wells Fargo spokesperson said Tuesday in response to an inquiry about the latest round of branch closures.Large and regional banks evaluate the size of their branch networks frequently and make adjustments as needed. Last month, JPMorgan Chase closed 14 former First Republic Bank branches in California as part of its plan to shrink First Republic's branch network after acquiring the failed bank in May. At the same time, JPMorgan continues to open new branches.Bank of America and Wells do as well.According to recent OCC bulletins, Bank of America plans to open new branches in locations such as Pittsburgh, Ohio and Utah, while Wells will open offices in the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens.]"

The new results released by the Wall Street giant make it clear that his challenges are far from over.Third quarter profits fell 33% from a year ago as Goldman continued a costly retreat from consumer banking and tried to recover from a prolonged slump in dealmaking.Earnings were dragged lower by a big write-down on GreenSky, a specialty lender it agreed to sell, and impairments on old real estate investments. The charges it took reduced pre-tax profits by almost $1 billion.Its performance during the quarter trailed other big bank rivals JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC), all of which reported profit increases year over year.Goldman's stock fell 1.6% Tuesday. Since Solomon became CEO, Goldman's stock has risen 40%, outpacing other Wall Street banks aside from rival Morgan Stanley (MS).Solomon, who took over the top job in October 2018, has endured scrutiny all year long after wrestling with everything from job cuts and a global investment banking slowdown to reports of partner unrest.He is trying to focus the firm around its traditional core strengths of assets and wealth management, trading, and investment banking.That means getting out of some businesses, including consumer banking and mass market financial advice, and making the firm's asset-management unit less reliant on Goldman's own investments.Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon speaking in February during Goldman's annual investor day. (Brendan McDermid/REUTERS) (Brendan McDermid / reuters)One analyst, Mike Mayo, challenged Solomon on a Tuesday conference call to describe who is ""accountable"" and ""pays the price"" for losses associated with GreenSky and the firm’s ill-fated foray into consumer banking. The firm has said its consumer-lending expansion cost the firm more than $3 billion since 2020.Solomon said the leadership of the firm, which includes him, is ""responsible and accountable for any decision that we make"" and ""I’m happy we’ve pivoted.""Story continues""We said we were going to do certain things. With hindsight you will do certain things differently. We obviously reflect, we learn from the things that we do, but I think it's important for companies to try things for companies to learn and adapt.""Another analyst, Dick Bove, told Yahoo Finance that ""the company's problems are all associated with write-offs that they're taking in businesses that they're trying to extricate themselves from."" He added: ""I actually think Goldman Sachs is on the right path.""Solomon indicated that the bank will not so easily be able to exit its credit card partnership businesses with Apple and GM.""Our partnerships with Apple and GM are long-term contracts, and we don't have the unilateral right to exit those partnerships, so our focus at the moment is on managing them better, getting rid of the drag, and bringing them to profitability, and we're making progress,"" he said.Where Solomon was optimistic Tuesday was discussing Goldman's traditional Wall Street businesses. He pointed out that of four major companies that went public after Labor Day, Goldman was the lead bookrunner on three and joint lead bookrunner on the fourth.“No other bank can make that claim,” he said.Its investment banking fees of $1.5 billion were up 9% from the second quarter and up 1% from a year ago, driven mostly by an increase in its debt and equity capital markets businesses.He did acknowledge, however, that there are a number of risks facing the US economy even though it ""has proven to be more resilient than expected,"" ranging from higher-for-longer interest rates from the Federal Reserve to wars in Ukraine and the Middle East.""Overall levels of risk are more elevated than we've seen in quite some time. While we don't know where this will all lead, it could impact economic growth and stability in the US and around the world, and we remain cautiously positioned.""Click here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

The book will channel the voices of 30 leading climate and community development experts to lay out the challenges communities of color and low-income communities face on the frontlines of climate change - and what can be done to fortify those communities. Funded by the Wells Fargo Foundation, the book will be available in early 2024.As UN climate scientists made clear in a report released this fall, the opportunity to ensure a resilient future for all is rapidly receding, and we must accelerate actions to reduce carbon emissions. The technologies and strategies are there, but far too often they fail to reach the most vulnerable. Across the United States, low-income Americans and people of color are often poorly positioned to withstand the effects of climate change. Now more than ever, ensuring a more equitable future means ensuring that all communities across the country are investing in sustainable systems, technologies, and solutions.Through the lens of the community leaders driving this movement, the book will explore how governments, the private sector, thought leaders, and civil society can all contribute to the transformation of American communities. Deploying practical case studies, the text will serve as a nationwide call to action for how to craft a transition to a cleaner economy and more resilient future without leaving millions of people behind.""As increasing greenhouse gas emissions escalate the frequency and intensity of natural disasters, we need to act now to ensure every community can thrive,"" said Krista Egger, vice president of Building Resilient Futures at Enterprise Community Partners. ""We have an opportunity to make bold climate investments while addressing our country's aging infrastructure, racial inequities, health crisis, and economic downturn. This book outlines not only what's possible, but how to get it done.""Story continues""Climate risk is a civil rights issue, with social and economic consequences that directly connect to where people live, how much they earn and the color of their skin,"" said Michael T. Pugh, LISC CEO. ""When we develop climate solutions that respond to long-standing inequities, we have the chance to build a stronger, healthier, future for tens of millions of people and better protect the planet.""""The private sector and nonprofits can make investments now that will protect communities and strengthen the economy,"" said Claire Kramer Mills, director of Community Development Analysis at the New York Fed.

""We look forward to the insights and thoughtful perspectives from this book that can support our customers and all communities in the transition to a resilient, equitable, and sustainable future.""The book will be available in print and online at no cost and will launch with a nationwide series of conversations - both virtual and in-person - featuring a collection of the book's authors, as well as experts in the field. A digital outreach campaign will engage policymakers, investors, philanthropists, and government officials to ensure community voices are fully included in the national debate over climate change, decarbonization, and resilience.Among the topics to be explored in the book:Defining climate resilience and why it matters for community developmentDelivering the health benefits of decarbonization and clean energy to communitiesDeveloping clean energy systems that don't burden residentsEnsuring equity in greener forms of public and private transportationInvesting in workforce development for Indigenous communities in the green economyFacilitating resilient, equitable communities through federal, state, and local policiesFor updates on the book, follow Enterprise and LISC on LinkedIn.

243,eaa44ad2-945c-3119-ae6c-de9ef7974407,WFC,2023-10-18,Banks have to get used to a new normal: Expert,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/banks-used-normal-expert-170846984.html,1697562526,VIDEO,"['BAC', 'WFC', 'JPM']","[Several big banks including JPMorgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Bank of America (BAC), saw a boost in profits due to higher interest rates. American Banker Washington Bureau Chief John Heltman joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss some concerns in the banking sector amid the higher interest rate environment.“For the banks, I think it’s going to be more, kind of, getting used to this new normal. And that new normal is interest rates are not zero. And they were zero for like all but three of... the last 15 years or something. And that’s one kind of environment and now we’re in a different one and I don’t think we’re going back,” Heltman says.“The broader concern about credit quality is a real one and is... the next shoe to drop. But the concerns have mostly been circling around commercial real estate, specifically... office-based loans, but also retail,” Heltman notes.Click here to watch the full interview on the Yahoo Finance YouTube page or you can watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live here.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: John, if we do see another rate hike, I guess what kind of-- what will we then see from the bank, do you think, just in terms of what that means for their business going forward? Whether or not they'll be able to continue to weather some of the challenges, given the fact that we have heard from some of the bank executives, Brian Moynihan today saying that the consumer is still strong, yet we are seeing, continue to see signs of the consumers pulling back even further.JOHN HELTMAN: So when I say a rate hike, I'm talking like maybe 25 basis points. So it's just going to be-- for the banks, I think it's going to be more kind of getting used to this new normal, and that new normal is interest rates are not zero. They were zero for like all but three of the last-- of like the last 15 years or something, and that's one kind of environment, and now we're in a different one, and I don't think we're going back, as in some sort of major global calamity that would necessitate it.Story continuesSo what it means is that the fundamentals are still going to be there. It's going to-- the loans that you have on your books that you made prior to 2021 aren't going to perform as well, but over time those are going to mature, and those are going to come off your books and theoretically be replaced with more profitable loans, more competitive loans that will be even more competitive in a higher interest rate environment.The challenges around cost of funds, what you have to pay for deposits, and so far the big banks, especially the big banks, have been able to get away with not having to quite pay as much as they probably should, but that also is going to normalize over time. Consumers are going to demand more of a return on their assets.BRAD SMITH: Right, and so for what we have heard from the banks overall, where are you starting to see, perhaps in the pass through, about consumer sentiment here and whether that's deposits, whether that's delinquencies, or even, you know, where they're still taking on loans here, even at this rate environment, where are you starting to see some cracks in the consumer?JOHN HELTMAN: So the first to go is always credit cards. When people have-- hit hard times, they tap their credit cards, and that hasn't-- the broader concern about credit quality is a real one and is kind of the next shoe to drop. But the concerns have mostly been circling around commercial real estate, specifically office loans, like office space loans, but also retail.Like, there's kind of like a new world out there, where not as many people are returning to the office, and fewer people return to the office means fewer cups of coffee or danishes that you can sell to them on their way-- on their commute, among other things. And so, like, that's kind of like, I think, where most of the concern is, rather than sort of like overleverage among consumers generally.But consumers, the thing is, like, with this higher interest rate environment, they also can get more on the cash that they are saving than they used to be able to with zero risk. They can just put it in a bank or put it in a high yield savings account and get a yield that is comparable to what they would have been getting out of the market just a few years ago.]"

(NYSE:PFE) Revenue and EPS estimates,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bearish-analysts-just-cut-pfizer-100351569.html,1697623431,STORY,['PFE'],"[The latest analyst coverage could presage a bad day for Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), with the analysts making across-the-board cuts to their statutory estimates that might leave shareholders a little shell-shocked. Revenue and earnings per share (EPS) forecasts were both revised downwards, with analysts seeing grey clouds on the horizon.Following the latest downgrade, the current consensus, from the 20 analysts covering Pfizer, is for revenues of US$59b in 2023, which would reflect a stressful 25% reduction in Pfizer's sales over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are supposed to tumble 69% to US$1.17 in the same period. Previously, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$66b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$2.88 in 2023. It looks like analyst sentiment has declined substantially, with a substantial drop in revenue estimates and a large cut to earnings per share numbers as well. Check out our latest analysis for Pfizer earnings-and-revenue-growthIt'll come as no surprise then, to learn that the analysts have cut their price target 6.3% to US$41.37.One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. We would highlight that sales are expected to reverse, with a forecast 43% annualised revenue decline to the end of 2023. That is a notable change from historical growth of 18% over the last five years. Compare this with our data, which suggests that other companies in the same industry are, in aggregate, expected to see their revenue grow 8.0% per year. So although its revenues are forecast to shrink, this cloud does not come with a silver lining - Pfizer is expected to lag the wider industry.The Bottom LineThe biggest issue in the new estimates is that analysts have reduced their earnings per share estimates, suggesting business headwinds lay ahead for Pfizer. Regrettably, they also downgraded their revenue estimates, and the latest forecasts imply the business will grow sales slower than the wider market. With a serious cut to this year's expectations and a falling price target, we wouldn't be surprised if investors were becoming wary of Pfizer.Story continuesEven so, the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for the value creation of shareholders.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Most Innovative States in the US.Innovation: The Future of AmericaOne of the key drivers of the US economy is innovation. The United States is one of the most innovative countries in the world as it continues to pour hefty investments in research and development. On February 28, McKinsey reported that the United States has dedicated a federal funding of $2 trillion to foster innovation over the next 10 years.The United States is home to various innovation hubs which offer state-of-the-art research and development facilities, quality education institutions, and incubators. Apart from the established innovation hubs in Boston and Silicon Valley, new innovation setups are appearing across other areas including Indiana and Tulsa. These centers of innovation are of profound importance since they account for 80% of the engineers and patents in the country, while contributing 60% to the country's overall exports.The growth in the most innovative regions is also fueled by educated talent. These areas have the ability to attract the potential workforce. Academic centers play an important role in building the right kind of talent for an innovative future. Since innovation hubs attract many companies, abundant employment opportunities emerge for those who have adequate skills. Another important factor that contributes to innovation is how easily startups can avail pre-seed and seed funding since they might not have enough capital to invest in the beginning. These startups can utilize the capabilities of high level R&amp;D throughout their journey, from early idea proposition to final product commercialization. You can also take a look at some of the US states with the lowest business taxes.Companies Leading Innovation GloballyRenowned companies that have the most innovative products to offer in the US include Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE). You can also view the country's top states for business in 2023.Story continuesOn September 14, Reuters reported that Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has been working on a disruptive innovation that could alter the way it makes electric vehicles, by casting the EV underbody in one piece. This approach is based on creating large sub-assemblies of a car and then binding them together. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has plans to launch cheaper electric vehicles while locking in high profits in the future. It has also been speculated that the unique manufacturing technique would enable the company to manufacture a car completely within 18 to 24 months, as compared to an average manufacturing time of 3 to 4 years taken by the company's competitors.Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) utilizes cutting edge technology to come up with world-class innovative products. On October 17, the company reported the upcoming launch of its new Apple Pencil in early November. The Apple Pencil will be compatible with iPads having a USB-C port. Greater drawing precision will be facilitated by the product. Back in June, one of the innovative ideas from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) materialized in the form of its new Vision Pro headset, the company’s first ever mixed reality headset and the first spatial operating system worldwide. The company also introduced its new MacBook Air as the best and the thinnest 15-inch laptop in the world.Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is a pharmaceutical and biotechnology company which transforms the landscape of health and well-being in America and across the globe. The company was one of the first in the industry to launch a vaccine for the global pandemic, Coronavirus. The recent developments from Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) have been quite novel. The company has been working on an mRNA-based vaccine for Lyme disease which will be a new kind of HIV vaccine. The vaccine under development is a major breakthrough considering that Lyme disease affects approximately half a million Americans every year. On September 7, Reuters reported that the company posted positive results for the phase 2 trial of the vaccine. Overall, the vaccine shots have been safe among children and adults.  The phase 3 of the clinical trials are being carried out by Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and the partnering firm, Valneva.

This is the company’s first quarterly report since the biggest shakeup in its 13- year-old history when it completed the separation from its consumer health spinoff Kenvue back in August.JNJ Reported A Better Than Expected Third QuarterDuring the third quarter, JNJ generated $21.35 billion in revenue, topping the expected $21.04 billion as sales grew 6.8% YoY with JNJ earning a net income of $4.31 billion, flat compared to last year’s comparable quarter. The resulting adjusted earnings per share amounted to $2.66, topping LSEG’s expectation of $2.52.Pharmaceutical And Innovative Medicine Were The Stars Of The Q3 ShowPharmaceutical sales expanded more than 5% YoY as excluding the sales of its Covid vaccine that wasn’t nearly as popular as those of its rivals like Pfizer Inc (NYSE: PFE), the sector brough in revenue of $13.85 billion, topping StreetAccount’s estimate $13.34 billion for the entire segment. The sales expansion is owed to Darzalex, a biologic for the treatment of multiple myeloma and Erleada, a prostate cancer treatment, along with JNJ’s blockbuster drug Stelara that works against immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. JNJ executives noted that the pharmaceutical growth was partially offset by a decline in sales of its prostate cancer drug Zytiga and blood cancer drug Imbruvica, which is co-marketed by AbbVie Inc (NYSE: ABBV). Along with oncology, AbbVie focuses on immunology, neuroscience, eye care and aesthetics.Medical devices business expanded 10% YoY with sales rising to nearly $7.46 billion but it came short of StreetAccount’s expectation of f $7.58 billion. The YoY rise is also the result of JNJ’s acquisition of Abiomed, a cardiovascular medical technology company, it completed in December. Electrophysiological products that evaluate the heart’s electrical system and help doctors understand the cause of abnormal heart rhythms also contributed to growth, along with lenses, wound closure products and devices for orthopedic trauma and serious injuries of the musculo-skeletal system.Story continuesThe strong results come amid investor anxiety over the thousands of lawsuits claiming that J&amp;J’s talc-based products caused ovarian cancer and several deaths due to being contaminated with asbestos. Although these products now belong Kenvue, JNJ will assume all talc-related liabilities in the U.S. and Canada.JNJ Also Lifted Its 2023 GuidanceJ&amp;J expects full year sales in the range between $83.6 billion and $84 billion, raising its previous guidance of $83.2 billion to $84 billion it issued in August. It also raised its guidance for adjusted earnings per share from a previous forecast of $10.00 to $10.10 to the range between $10.07 to $10.13.A Sharpened Focus On Innovative Medicine And MedTech SolutionsAs JNJ continues to innovate across the spectrum of healthcare, its ambitions are to deliver the medical breakthroughs of tomorrow. But although the healthcare giant’s results are considered a bellwether for the broader health sector, innovators are across the industry and moving frontiers of medicine, including its rival Pfizer. Pfizer recently revealed the FDA approved its lung cancer combination treatment. Back in August, the FDA also approved the blood cancer therapy that Pfizer developed for patients suffering from multiple myeloma, and branded as Elrexfio.View more earnings on JNJAbbVie claims to be leading one of the largest data convergence initiatives in the biopharma industry as it strives for gathering accurate information within minutes as opposed to months. Besides making this important step in digital health revolution, AbbVie is also investing in precision medicine, genetics and genomics, patient-focused drug development, therapeutic modalities and advanced technologies that includes machine learning and AI. Besides the innovations in drugs and therapies, there is also significant progress in early detection that has been made by companies such as Mainz Biomed N.V. (NASDAQ: MYNZ). Mainz Biomed is a molecular genetics diagnostic company focused on early cancer detection whose flagship product is ColoAlert®, , a user-friendly at-home test for detecting colorectal cancer. While Mainz Biomed just presented its flagship product in Copenhagen, Denmark, during the UEG Week, an event devoted to latest advancements and breakthroughs in gastroenterology, it is also developing a detection test for pancreas, PancAlert. Mainz Biomed representatives are also in Paris where they are scheduled to represent positive detailed results from its ColoFuture study at the 4th International Conference on Gastroenterology that will last until October 18th.  Mainz Biomed will be presenting even better than expected results of its multi-center international clinical trial that assessed the potential of integrating mRNA biomarkers into ColoAlert®.Therefore, just because JNJ is among the biggest giants in healthcare does not necessarily mean that it will be the one to deliver the medical breakthroughs of tomorrow. However, it did show its strength by delivering strong results despite the baby powder scandal that did not only result in lawsuits across the globe but also severe damage to its reputation. It changed its century-old logo rather quietly and making its mark in the medicine of tomorrow could certainly help restore its image, but its financial numbers are doing surprisingly well.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

Alongside the revised guidance, PFE also announced cost cuts, including layoffs, which are expected to deliver targeted savings of at least $3.5 billion. Pfizer is also expected to record a non-cash charge of $5.5 billion as COVID inventory write-offs in the cost of goods sold in the third quarter.Due to the lower-than-expected COVID revenues and inventory write-offs, Pfizer now expects its adjusted EPS between $1.45 to $1.65, down from the earlier guidance of $3.25 to $3.45.In response to Pfizer’s announcement, Moderna stated it “remains comfortable” with its previously issued guidance. Though the company reiterated its full-year 2023 product revenue guidance for COVID-19 vaccine sales to be between $6.0 billion and $8.0 billion, it did warn investors that it could not predict exact demand till it observes the full vaccination trends through October. Based on this observed trend, management will provide an update when it reports its Q3 earnings results on Nov 2.Despite Moderna sticking to its forecasts, it failed to calm investors sentiments who now raised concerns on the unpredictable demand for the COVID vaccine shots. Though Pfizer’s shares weren’t affected by the news so much, Moderna’s shares fell likely because the company’s COVID vaccines are the only approved/authorized marketed product in its portfolio.In the year so far, shares of Moderna have declined 48.8% compared with the industry’s 18.9% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe guidance cut by Pfizer also led to a decline in the share prices of its partner BioNTech BNTX and rival Novavax NVAX. Shares of BioNTech and Novavax were down 6.4% and 6.0%, respectively, on Monday, as similar to Moderna, these companies are entirely dependent on COVID vaccine sales for revenue.Story continuesIn a separate press release, BioNTech announced that it expects to record a non-cash charge for inventory write-offs related to Comirnaty up to €0.9 billion in the third quarter. This figure represents BioNTech’s half under the gross profit-sharing agreement with Pfizer.Novavax recently received permission from the FDA and CDC to use its updated protein-based COVID-19 vaccine in individuals 12 years and older. In a separate press release, Novavax also stated that it “remains confident” in the ongoing commercial rollout of its vaccine and will evaluate the vaccination rates in the country to understand the market better. Based on this understanding, it will provide an update alongside its Q3 results, which can be expected early next month.Moderna, Inc. Price Moderna, Inc. PriceModerna, Inc. price | Moderna, Inc.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this technology platform and digital payments company have returned -9.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.6% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which Paypal belongs, has gained 1.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Paypal is expected to post earnings of $1.22 per share, indicating a change of +13% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.95 points to a change of +19.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.61 indicates a change of +13.3% from what Paypal is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Paypal.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Paypal, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.39 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $29.69 billion and $32.37 billion estimates indicate +7.9% and +9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPaypal reported revenues of $7.29 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.1%. EPS of $1.16 for the same period compares with $0.93 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.26 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.43%. The EPS surprise was 0%.Over the last four quarters, Paypal surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Paypal is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Paypal. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. NetEase (NTES) earns a Zacks Rank #1 30 days from its next quarterly earnings release on November 16, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.64 a share.By taking the percentage difference between the $1.64 Most Accurate Estimate and the $1.56 Zacks Consensus Estimate, NetEase has an Earnings ESP of 5.13%.NTES is just one of a large group of Computer and Technology stocks with a positive ESP figure. Paypal (PYPL) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Paypal, which is readying to report earnings on November 1, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $1.23 a share, and PYPL is 15 days out from its next earnings report.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Paypal is $1.22, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.71%.Story continuesNTES and PYPL's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the quantum computing industry, head directly to 5 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Buy Now. The International Data Corporation (IDC) released its second projection for the global quantum computing market on August 17, 2023. It anticipates that customer spending on quantum computing will increase from $1.1 billion in 2022 to $7.6 billion by 2027, demonstrating a 48.1% compound annual growth rate over the forecast period. This updated forecast is considerably lower than IDC's earlier quantum computing prediction from 2021. Many factors have negatively impacted customer spending in the short-term, including slower progress in quantum hardware development, the emergence of alternative technologies like generative AI offering more immediate benefits, as well as higher interest rates and the possibility of a recession. IDC believes that the quantum computing market will continue to experience slow growth until there is a significant breakthrough in quantum hardware development that delivers a quantum advantage. In the meantime, most growth will be driven by improvements in quantum computing infrastructure and platforms and the rise of performance-intensive computing tasks suitable for quantum technology. IDC also expects investments in the quantum computing market to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 11.5% from 2023 to 2027, amounting to approximately $16.4 billion by the end of 2027. On September 13, 2023, D-Wave Quantum Inc.

Ed Ludlow, co-host of Bloomberg Technology, commented that there is a mistaken belief that quantum computing is primarily in the theoretical realm and has not yet made a tangible technological impact. To this, Baratz replied: Story continues“You’re absolutely right. Most people in the industry are saying that quantum computing is years away from commercial reality but at D-Wave we took a very different approach to quantum computing, one that has allowed us to deliver commercial quantum computers today. In fact, we’ve been delivering them for almost two years now. We have over sixty commercial customers that are leveraging our quantum computer to see improved performance and a broad array of business applications.”Similarly, a UK startup, Phasecraft Ltd., which originated from University College London and the University of Bristol, secured £13 million in funding in August 2023.

Since diversified information technology company IBM’s 2019 acquisition of Red Hat, the company has aggressively pursued a hybrid cloud strategy. Though IBM and its new management team have made solid progress on this pivot, we believe the company still meaningfully lags the cloud hyperscalers and other cloud-native companies. Management has also laid out aggressive long-term targets for revenue growth and free cash flow, both of which we believe the company will struggle to achieve as it faces intense competition in its hybrid cloud business and structural headwinds in the company’s legacy businesses.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Buy Now.  Suggested articles:14 Best SaaS Stocks To Buy NowJim Simons Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks13 Technology Stocks To Buy That Are Too Cheap To Ignore Disclosure: None. 11 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Our Head of News, Myles, was talking about how-- whether I wrote the same story over again. But this time, used GM.Well, in this case, GM now following Ford, in the sense that they are actually pushing back production of the EV Silverado, and also the Sierra EV, that they're going to make at this plant in Orion, Michigan. They said that they want to quote, better manage capital investment with aligning, with evolving EV demand. That's the big thing there, evolving EV demand. Potentially, what Ford is doing, when they cut a production shift for the Lightning, they're not seeing that demand there, potentially. Maybe they're cutting supply, rethinking pricing, and maybe changing the strategy.Maybe GM is seeing that as another-- as a harbinger of what they might see in the future. They're not going to stop making the truck. They're actually making it right now in a different plant. But they're not going to expand as much as they thought they were going to.JOSH SCHAFER: It seems like being careful with where they're investing at a time where they do have the strikes ongoing too, right? Just as far as-- GM only has so much money to go around like all companies only have so much money to go around. And when you have less workers literally working for you, and you're trying to think about how to be more efficient, maybe EVs just isn't the space of efficiency for these car companies right now, especially the car companies that have been creating traditional vehicles for so long.Story continuesIt's not like they're Tesla, and they're cutting back on EV production. So they're cutting back on all car production. They're still producing other cars. They're just saying, we got to be a little bit slower with the EV thing. And as Pra's just said, reminds us of our Yahoo Finance survey right, where people weren't that willing to move over to EVs. We were all pretty surprised by those numbers.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah. The demand picture, I think, is very interesting to me. And you're seeing on your screen now.57% said they're not likely to purchase an EV in our survey, compared to 11% that were unsure and 31% that were likely. And some of the big concerns here revolves around pricing, revolves around infrastructure. Driving range, another big factor there. And it makes me wonder if we overestimated how many people would be interested in EVs, and the tax credits we can get with those cars. I think that all is going to factor into it, because right now with interest rates so high, a lot of volatility in the economy right now, spending a ton of money on an EV just doesn't seem top of mind for consumers.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah. Two big things you guys mentioned. So interest rates, high prices. Those are weighing on demand. If you get these cars are cheaper, they'd probably sell better, right?But a big thing, I think, is there's a bifurcation between your Model Ys and smaller EVs, and your big pickup trucks. They're more money. Huge batteries.They need to be filled up with power, probably more frequently, and their charging infrastructure just isn't there yet. So I think there's more concern about that, whereas a Model Y can go 300, 320 miles. You don't have to worry about charging.JOSH SCHAFER: So I was going to ask. Traditionally, we think of pickup trucks as gas guzzlers, or is it the same for EVs? They take up a lot more battery. And therefore-- range anxiety. People you don't want to get a pickup EV. You'd rather get a Model Y.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: For instance, the Model Y probably has about a battery that's probably half the size of a F-150 extended range battery. And they probably get around similar range. But the Model Y will get a bit more, depending on the situation.So you're basically-- your efficiency is half, meaning you've got to charge more. It's going to take more-- it's going to cost more to fill up the battery. So it might be the fact that just that use case of an EV pickup not going to happen, or not happening right now.JOSH SCHAFER: Interesting to see how we've shifted over the last couple of years on maybe how big that potential TAM is for EVs. It seemed like you go back a couple of years. And it felt like it was as big as anything, just an impossibly big TAM.]"

It's something Tesla (TSLA) doesn't have to contend with. The EV maker will report its third-quarter earnings Wednesday after the close of trading, with investors keeping an eye on margins as the company reported low delivery numbers and cut back on prices of certain models earlier in the year. Wedbush Managing Director Dan Ives Joins Yahoo Finance to break down how Tesla benefits from the auto worker's strike.Ives say that pricing gives GM and Ford a ""huge advantage"" over Tesla, and that the companies' CEOs had been trying to build an EV strategy when ""the UAW really comes with a deal that is, what I view, is just not feasible, given the business model.""For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: Tesla is reporting its earnings tomorrow after the close of trading. All eyes will be focused on margins after it reported low delivery numbers and cut prices earlier this year. A lot has changed since the last earnings call, with the UAW walking out on the big three automakers here in the US, and many saying the strike will benefit Tesla, including Ford's executive chairman.BILL FORD: Toyota, Honda, Tesla, and the others are loving this strike, because they know the longer it goes on, the better it is for them.JULIE HYMAN: Let's bring in Dan Ives, Wedbush managing director. Hey, Dan. Good to see you. You are bullish on Tesla.DAN IVES: Good to be here.JULIE HYMAN: You know, we've heard a lot of rhetoric that the strike is going to be good for Tesla, and I guess I'm trying to figure out exactly how that is going to play out and whether we're going to see it in the numbers.DAN IVES: I mean, look, it's good for the long term, because the biggest competition was coming from Ford, GM, Stellantis in the US, and that's why it's really been a champagne on ice moment for Tesla relative to this, but clearly, look, they have their own challenges that they're trying to navigate. But the UAW torpedo has really been a disaster for Detroit.Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: Wait, so explain this to me, because why-- in the long term, why is it so good news for Tesla? I mean, eventually the workers are going to come back. Eventually, I mean, whether it's a week or even a month, and they're going to start churning out cars again that are going to compete with Tesla, so it feels like-- isn't it more of a temporary hiccup than anything more profound here?DAN IVES: Yeah, Julie, I mean, that's obviously a great point, but I think the bigger thing is what the deal ultimately looks like, what the cost intakes are going to be for GM, Ford. Do they have to raise prices $2,000, $3,000, $4,000? That's a huge advantage for them relative to Tesla and others, and I think that's really been the frustration here. Just as Mary and Farley are building this EV transformational strategy, the UAW really comes with a deal that is-- what I view is just not feasible, just given the business model.JOSH LIPTON: Well, Dan, first of all, I don't know where you are but I love that backdrop. All of a sudden, I feel like I want to just grab a couple margaritas with you, Dan, and just hang out. But let's talk Tesla. Tomorrow, what are the key metrics, Dan, you're going to be watching? You know, is it margins, is it deliveries, and what are you expecting on those bogeys?DAN IVES: Yeah, and, Josh, great to see you. Look, from a margin perspective, with these price cuts, they've sacrificed margins for volume. So the big focus is going to be 17% gross margin, the auto gross margin that's credit, that's the line in the sand, and then does Musk formally put a flag up there and say the price cuts are basically done? Because that's the problem here is that once you start going down these price cuts, the fear is you just continue to go down that same road in 2024, and it's very important that margins drop out this quarter.JOSH LIPTON: So, Dan, so let me ask you, though, I mean, you're right. Elon Musk has not been shy about this. He's playing a volume game, and if it means sacrificing profit margins, so be it, but in your opinion, Dan, you know the company, you've followed it for a long time, do you think the price cuts are over?DAN IVES: We think about 95% of them are over. I mean, there could still be some price cuts down the road, but I think in China they're going to really have to stop these price cuts, because ultimately then it's a race to zero, right? And I think that's-- even though this has been the right poker move to get to this point, I think going forward, they have to hold the line in the sand, because if they continue to cut prices and margins continue to trend lower, that would probably be what I'd say is probably the biggest bear case, in what's clearly a macro that's not roses and rainbows.]"

Instead of targeting a late 2024 production date, GM said it would push production to late 2025 in order to “better manage capital investment while aligning with evolving EV demand.”Last year GM said it would spend $4 billion to convert the Orion Assembly plant for EV truck production using the automaker’s Ultium platform. Currently, Orion builds the Chevrolet Bolt E and EUV, which is still scheduled to end production at the end of 2023, GM said.2024 Chevrolet Silverado EV RST is pictured at the New York International Auto Show, in Manhattan, New York City, April 13, 2022. (Andrew Kelly/REUTERS) (Andrew Kelly / reuters)GM’s United Auto Worker (UAW) employees impacted by the delayed plant conversion will be offered other opportunities in Michigan, the automaker said, including at GM’s Factory ZERO EV assembly plant that currently builds the GMC Hummer EV Pickup and SUV, Chevrolet Silverado EV, and Cruise Origin autonomous vehicle; the Sierra EV will be assembled at Factory ZERO next year. The UAW's ongoing stand-up strikes have not affected GM's Factory ZERO operations, at least so far.GM’s move to delay Orion’s conversion follows Ford’s decision to cut a shift at its F-150 Lightning EV pickup plant in Detroit, implying demand was drying up for the Lightning. The Wall Street Journal was first to report last Friday that Ford was considering cutting a shift at its Rouge electric vehicle plant, where the automaker builds the Lightning, citing a memo from a UAW official concerned about demand. “It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that our sales for the Lightning have tanked,” the memo reportedly also said.""We think Ford’s announcement is emblematic of the difficulties traditional automakers have faced with ramping up EV production, but also reflects consumer demand for EVs that wasn’t what it once appeared to be in terms of the robust reservation counts for certain new models,” CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson said to Yahoo Finance regarding the shift cut.Story continuesGM has committed to spend $35 billion by 2025 for its electrification plans, with a goal of being all-electric by 2035. With the automaker admitting “evolving EV demand” has led it to delay its EV expansion plans, it seems the evolution to an EV truck future in the US is going to happen much later than many in the industry had originally predicted.Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The top line increased 12.5% year over year due to upbeat air-travel demand. This was driven by a 14.6% rise in passenger revenues (accounting for 92.5% of the top line) to $13,349 million. More than 44 million passengers traveled on UAL flights in the third quarter.Cargo revenues fell 33.1% year over year to $333 million. Revenues from other sources jumped 10.5% from the third quarter of 2022 to $802 million.Despite the earnings and revenue beat, UAL shares decreased in after-market trading on Oct 17 due to weak adjusted earnings per share forecast for fourth-quarter 2023. The tepid projection was due to high costs. The suspension of flights to Tel Aviv is likely to raise non-fuel costs further in the fourth quarter.The Chicago-based carrier expects fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share in the band of $1.50-$1.80 per share.

Total revenue per available seat mile dipped 2.8% to 18.49 cents. The average yield per revenue passenger mile remained flat at 19.72 cents.Consolidated airline traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles, grew 14.6%. Capacity, measured in available seat miles, expanded 15.7%. Consolidated load factor (percentage of seat occupancy) contracted 0.9 percentage points to 86.4%.

Fuel gallons consumed were up 14.9%.Story continuesOperating expenses (on a reported basis) increased 11.6% to $12,745 million. Consolidated unit cost or cost per available seat mile (CASM), excluding fuel, third-party business expenses, profit-sharing and special charges, increased 2.6% to 11.51 cents.UAL exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $7,478 million compared with $7,166 million at the end of 2022. Long-term debt was $25,932 million compared with $28,283 million at the end of 2022.OutlookManagement has highlighted two scenarios while giving fourth-quarter 2023 outlook.Scenario 1 – Flights to Tel Aviv will remain suspended for October only.For the fourth quarter of 2023, United Airlines envisions capacity to improve by almost 15.5% from the year-ago reported figure. CASM, excluding fuel, third-party business expenses, profit-sharing and special charges, is suggested to increase roughly 3.5% mainly due to high labor costs.Total revenues are anticipated to climb 10.5% year over year. UAL projects fourth-quarter EPS to be $1.80. It forecasts average aircraft fuel price per gallon to be $3.28.Scenario 2 – Flights to Tel Aviv will remain suspended through year end.United Airlines expects capacity to improve by almost 14% from the year-ago reported figure. Total revenues are anticipated to grow 9% year over year. Adjusted CASM, excluding fuel, third-party business expenses, profit-sharing and special charges, is projected to register year-over-year growth of 5% in this scenario..Notably, UAL has significant exposure to Israel.

At the core of that criminal syndicate was a man named Robert Dell, who operated a drug recovery program out of a church in St. Petersburg, Fla.He also allegedly stole $1.4 million of goods.According to the Florida attorney general, Dell used his position as a pastor and counselor to coerce people to steal for him, often hitting stores five or six times per day.Dell would then fence the goods on eBay under the account ""anointedliquidator,"" where he had 100% positive feedback and a 35,000-item history.Dell and other associates were finally busted in August, and while this may seem like a breakthrough, it’s just one syndicate.""These cases are pretty typical in both the scale and breadth,"" Scott Glenn, Home Depot's vice president of loss prevention, told Yahoo Finance. And while the problem is getting more and more attention — Florida's attorney general is one of many AGs and local district attorneys tackling shrink — these cases are often linked to more unseemly crimes like money laundering and even human trafficking.The $1.4 million scheme Dell and his accomplices carried out is only a drop in the bucket. Retailers suffered more than $112 billion in losses due to shrink last year alone, according to the National Retail Federation, putting the bust at just 0.00125% of the year's total.New research out on Monday from CoreSight Research shows that consumers are becoming increasingly concerned. It's not just the annoyance of having to ask for a sales associate to unlock a case: 73% of consumers surveyed are worried that retailers will hike prices to cover the cost of increasing theft, and more than half of consumers are worried about store closures in their community due to organized retail crime.Story continuesCoreSight’s research also shows that it’s not just about retailers' bottom lines, as the impact can extend to their ability to hire or retain employees or even draw customers to stores.To that end, Target (TGT) is closing nine stores across four states by Saturday, Oct. 21, citing concerns about the safety of staff and consumers as retail crime increases.Before taking this draconian step, Target says it invested in strategies like beefing up security, using third-party guard services, and more theft deterrent tools. But it wasn’t enough for the nation’s second-biggest retailer.CoreResearch says membership-based retailers such as Costco (COST) and BJ’s Wholesale Club (BJ) stand to benefit until the problem is solved because you need a membership to walk through the door, which may be a deterrent in and of itself.Target exterior in December 2013. (Steven Senne/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Besides efforts by attorneys general and retailers, Congress passed the Inform Consumers Act to combat selling stolen goods, something Home Depot's Glenn said was a step in the right direction.But it's not enough for retailers like Home Depot, which will likely provide an update this November as it releases quarterly results.""We really need a much more coordinated and systemic effort at the federal level to take this problem seriously and really understand how much it impacts not only the financials of retailers and consumers but also the safety of the associates in our stores and the customers and the shopping public at large,"" Glenn said.Click here for all of the latest retail stock news and events to better inform your investing strategy]"

Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with ISRG.As of 2023-10-17, Intuitive Surgical Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $70.11. It's currently trading at a price of $274.11. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -290.97%. The company is significantly overvalued.Beyond Market Price: Uncovering Intuitive Surgical Inc's Intrinsic ValueThe modelThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Intuitive Surgical Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.AssumptionsTermValueExplanationEPS without NRI$3.99GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.Discount Rate11%An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.76%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.Growth StageGrowth rate (g1) = 11.40% Years of Growth Stage = 10We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.Terminal StageGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.CalculationGrowth Stage=EPS without NRI*[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)*(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=40.7Terminal Stage=EPS without NRI*(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10*[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)+(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=29.42Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)=Growth Stage+Terminal Stage=70.11Discounted Free Cash Flow ModelGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $43.86. This valuation indicates that the Intuitive Surgical Inc is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -524.97%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.Story continuesThe Bottom LinePlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation.  Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.Navigating with GuruFocus:Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)Class I railroads CSX and Canadian Pacific Kansas City (CPKC) have requested Surface Transportation Board approval to acquire portions of a southern U.S. short line in a bid to create more efficient rail freight flows between Mexico, Texas and the southeast U.S.CSX and CPKC are seeking to acquire portions of the Meridian &amp; Bigbee Railroad, currently a subsidiary of short line operator Genesee &amp; Wyoming.Their plans come as Georgia Ports Authority said separately last week that shifts in world trade patterns will benefit the Port of Savannah (see below).Leaders from both CPKC (NYSE: CP) and CSX (NASDAQ: CSX) have expressed interest in creating more efficient transport among those regions and establishing “a new direct connection and corridor linking Mexico, Texas and the U.S. Southeast.” CPKC and CSX announced their intentions in June. In August, CSX CFO Sean Pelkey said at an investor conference that “I haven’t seen a new interchange pop up [in my years at CSX] … that is going to be as significant as this one.”Mexico and the U.S. Southeast are “two of the fastest-growing regions connecting through a third (Texas),” longtime transportation analyst Tony Hatch told FreightWaves.Indeed, their competitors — Norfolk Southern (NYSE: NSC) and Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP) — have also expressed interest in beefing up offerings among those regions. UP is offering intermodal service that originates on Mexican rail carrier Grupo México from both Monterrey in Nuevo Leon and Silao in Guanajuato to cities in the southeastern U.S.Meanwhile, NS has a relationship with CPKC in which shippers can utilize the Meridian Speedway to go between Texas and Mexico and the Southeast. NS also has its own service products, including those that involve partners J.B. Hunt and Hub Group, and it recently expanded its intermodal offerings with Florida East Coast Railway.CSX is seeking to acquire the portion of Meridian &amp; Bigbee Railroad’s 93.7-mile line that runs in Alabama between Burkeville and Myrtlewood, according to an Oct. 6 filing to STB. That same day, CPKC filed a request to STB seeking to acquire the western line of the Meridian &amp; Bigbee line. It consists of approximately 50 miles of track between Meridian, Mississippi, and Myrtlewood.Story continuesCSX and CPKC say this arrangement would enable the railroads to create a direct interchange at Myrtlewood. Doing so would eliminate the need for an intermediate carrier on overhead traffic, according to CSX’s filing, and it would allow the railroads to avoid more congestion-prone and weather-sensitive interchanges, such as New Orleans.“The new, more efficient gateway at Myrtlewood will allow CSXT and CPKC to compete more effectively with other carriers and modes in the region,” CSX said in its filing.If CSX and CPKC are able to acquire these assets, then it would allow both railways to create a new freight rail corridor that will expand shipping options for intermodal, automotive and other interline traffic, CPKC said. The Meridian and Bigbee would also retain trackage rights to provide local service, the railway continued.“CPKC’s investments in track infrastructure [as a result of this acquisition] will enable faster, more efficient, economical, and safe operations on the Western Line,” the railway said in its filing, and it “will create a direct Class I to Class I connection that will provide improvements in the efficient movement of existing and future intermodal, automotive, and other interline traffic between the Southeastern United States and the Southwestern United States and Mexico. Creation of this Class I freight corridor will expand customer market reach, and by converting truck traffic to rail, reduce highway congestion. It will also benefit the environment by reducing fuel consumption.”The railways also told the board that the acquisitions should be considered “minor” transactions, which means they wouldn’t require as extensive a review process by STB. Minor transactions tend to be those in which anticompetitive concerns don’t appear to be an issue for shippers.The Meridian &amp; Bigbee, which G&amp;W acquired in 2005, currently has interchanges with Atlantic &amp; Gulf Coast Railway at Linden, Alabama; with CSX at Montgomery, Alabama; with CPKC at Meridian; and with Norfolk Southern at Selma, Alabama, and Meridian.CSX operated the Meridian &amp; Bigbee prior to G&amp;W’s takeover of the line.Shifting world trade patterns to benefit Georgia Ports AuthorityThe filings from CSX and CPKC don’t mention Georgia and the Port of Savannah to STB. But Georgia Ports Authority officials at the Savannah State of the Port event last Thursday noted the manufacturing shift to the Southeast. The region, which GPA says includes Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee, has also grown in population by 9% since 2012.CPKC said in its Oct. 6 filing to STB on the request to acquire the western line of the Meridian &amp; Bigbee that its proposed plan with CSX would “position CPKC to compete for the new traffic that will be generated by several new automotive plants that are planned to open in the Southeastern United States in the next few years.”The trend toward source shifting to Southeast Asia, which consists of adding a Southeast Asian country in addition to China for manufacturing needs, favors U.S. East Coast delivery via the Suez Canal, GPA said. Furthermore, India’s status as a growing economy represents business opportunities for GPA customers, the port authority continued.“We need to be ready for future economic cycles. We’re talking to customers and designing a gateway port and inland supply chain that meets their long-term requirements.  We’re all-in on this. The decisions we make will decide who we become as we prepare for the next wave of future cargo,” GPA President and CEO Griff Lynch said in a release. “Savannah’s ocean carrier customers are upsizing their vessels; 80 percent of the container ships entering the port are 11,000 TEU or larger.”GPA plans to focus on a “mid-American arc” that will stretch from Dallas to Chicago and Cincinnati, and it cited its proximity to Charlotte and Rocky Mount, North Carolina, and Miami, Tampa and Orlando, Florida.Two new partnerships also have sprouted or are underway: CSX’s Carolina Connector service to Rocky Mount, which GPA says could open up Ohio Valley opportunities, and Norfolk Southern’s slated Blue Ridge Connector service to northeast Georgia, which will open in 2026.GPA’s Mason Mega Rail is also now fully operational. GPA says the service “provides the greatest on-dock rail capacity of any port in the Western Hemisphere.” The 85-acre intermodal terminal has the capacity to put together and receive six 10,000-foot trains simultaneously, according to GPA’s website.GPA said it handled 5.4 million twenty-foot equivalent units in its 2023 fiscal year, and it forecasts 4%-6% growth in the coming years.Subscribe to FreightWaves’ e-newsletters and get the latest insights on freight right in your inbox.Click here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.Related links:UP to offer intermodal service linking Mexico, US SoutheastCross-border traffic, West Coast port activity benefit Eastern railroadsAugust volumes fall 28% from year-ago highs at Port of SavannahThe post CPKC and CSX file plans paving way to Mexico-Southeast corridor appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.Growth StageGrowth rate (g1) = 8.90% Years of Growth Stage = 10We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.Terminal StageGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.CalculationGrowth Stage=EPS without NRI*[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)*(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=66.36Terminal Stage=EPS without NRI*(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10*[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)+(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=43.24Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)=Growth Stage+Terminal Stage=109.60Discounted Free Cash Flow ModelGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $145.26. This valuation indicates that the Analog Devices Inc is fair valued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -18.99%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.Story continuesThe Bottom LinePlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation.  Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.Navigating with GuruFocus:Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

284,7a1a2963-3295-3b99-b5e7-70bab1460e12,V,2023-10-18,Visa (V) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-v-earnings-expected-grow-140059916.html,1697551259,STORY,['V'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Visa (V) reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 24. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis global payments processor is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.23 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +15.5%.Revenues are expected to be $8.55 billion, up 9.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.08% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Visa?For Visa, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.85%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Visa will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Visa would post earnings of $2.11 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.16, delivering a surprise of +2.37%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Visa appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis on the strategic significance of these bases and head over directly to the 5 Most Important U.S. Military Bases in the World.The United States, in its early years, was a country that did not want to intervene in armed conflicts outside its borders. The country’s attitude towards having a global role changed completely after the two world wars which made it a nation that proactively sought to keep an eye on global threats and also promote American ideals across the world. While military and intelligence capabilities of the United States were greatly stretched in the two World Wars and later during the Cold War, in modern times it has had to grapple with the challenges emanating from countries like Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran. Therefore, in order to have a logistical edge over its foes, the US maintains military bases around the world, which gives it the capability to strike enemy targets anywhere in the world. A majority of these bases are equipped with modern military equipment and airfields.According to a report, the U.S. had about 750 military bases across 80 countries in the world and had deployed 173,000 troops in 159 different countries as of July 2021. Japan has the highest number of overseas military bases of the U.S. with 120 bases, followed by Germany and South Korea at second and third, with 119 and 73 bases respectively. These numbers are testament to America’s military and economic strength to be able to have such significant military presence outside its borders.United States Military StrengthThe United States has the most powerful military in the world. The country accounts for nearly 40% of all defense spending worldwide, which is triple the amount that China spends, and more than the combined amount that the next ten highest spenders incur on defense expenditure.Story continuesThe U.S. is also home to some of the largest defense contractors in the world. Most notably four of the top five defense contractors in the world, which include Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX), General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD), and The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA). You can read more on this in our article, Top 16 Defense Contractors in the World in 2023.U.S. Military Bases in the Middle EastThough an exact count is not known, the U.S. has several military bases in the Middle East that deploy more than 30,000 U.S. troops according to the Department of Defense. The most notable of all is the Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, situated west of Doha. It is the largest military installation of the United States in the Middle East and critical for operations in the region. The air base hosts an estimated 11,000 troops and is well equipped with fighter jets. The US Air Force deployed five 5th Generation F-22 Raptors developed by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) to the air base in 2020.The Al-Udeid Air Base is also used by the US to aid Qatar in bolstering its defense capabilities. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) in 2020 got a $657.2 million deal from the Qataris to provide sparing and logistics support for the Qatari air force’s fleet of F-15 aircraft. Moreover, formerly Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX), now RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) received a $77 million contract in the same year to upgrade Qatar’s Air Operations Center by 2025. Work on both contracts was and is being carried out at the Al-Udeid Air Base.U.S. Military Bases in Japan and South KoreaThe Americans have maintained a military presence in Japan since the conclusion of the second World War in 1945 and in South Korea since the Korean War starting 1950. More than half of all American troops deployed overseas are stationed in these two countries. Camp Humphreys, located 40 miles south of Seoul in South Korea, is the largest overseas U.S. military base in the world.The base is equipped with Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, an anti-ballistic missile defense system developed for South Korea by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) in response to regular missile threats from North Korea.U.S. Military Presence in EuropeThere are eight U.S. Army garrisons located across Europe which are home to at least 60,000 troops. Germany has the highest number of American bases and troops among European countries. The most notable U.S. military base in Europe is the Ramstein Air Base in Germany, which is critical to the American Air Force’s European operations.MethodologyWe have ranked the 15 most important U.S. military bases in the world based on our analysis and that of several other defense experts on the strategic importance of current active American military bases. Both domestic and overseas bases of the U.S. military are covered in this article. We've ranked these bases in order of importance.15 Most Important U.S. Military Bases in the WorldThe Visual Explorer / Shutterstock.comLet’s now head over to the list of the most important U.S. military bases in the world.15. Fort Meade, MarylandFort Meade is a large United States military installation located in Maryland that is critical for cyber and intelligence operations as it houses the U.S. Cyber Command and National Security Agency (NSA). First established in 1917, it is named after one of the most prominent generals of the Civil War, General George G. Meade. 14. Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, HawaiiHickam Air Field and Naval Base Pearl Harbor merged two historic bases to become one joint base in 2010. Both are of immense significance to the United States military. Hickam is home to the 15th Wing, 154th Wing, and the Hawaii Air National Guard. It also provides support to 140 associate and tenant units. On the other hand, Pearl Harbor provides vital shore side support to submarines and naval ships.Together, the joint base is home to 270 tenant units, several ships and submarines, and seven fixed-wing aviation squadrons. The base has a population of more than 100,000 people.13. Thule Air Base, GreenlandThe Thule Air Base is one of the most important U.S. military bases in the world, located only 947 miles from the North Pole, and 750 miles north of the Arctic Circle. This air force base is of vital significance when it comes to missile warning and space control and surveillance. The Thule Air Base is capable of detecting all intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) targeting any place in North America.12. RAF Lakenheath and RAF Mildenhall, United KingdomThese two sister bases have the largest presence of U.S. troops in the United Kingdom. Although it has a status of being the British Royal Air Force Station, the RAF Mildenhall and RAF Lakenheath primarily provide services to the US Air Force and are home to the 100th Air Refueling Wing. These are two of the most important U.S. military bases in the world.11. Naval Station Rota, SpainNaval Station Rota in Spain is often referred to as the gateway to the Mediterranean. It is one of the most important U.S. military bases in the world due to its strategic location that helps provide logistical support to the U.S. military and its allies. Built over 6,100 acres of land, the base provides cargo and fuel support to units and ships that transit the region. Moreover, it gives airfield and port facilities to the Naval Forces Europe Africa Central (EURAFCENT) and the 6th fleet.10. Incirlik Air Base, TurkiyeThe Incirlik Air Base is a strategically located base used by the American forces for operations in the Middle East and Europe. The base has always been used by the U.S. as a hub in times of humanitarian emergencies. When the Afghan war began in 2001, the Incirlik Air Base was used as the main hub for humanitarian airlift operations, special operations, refueling missions, and the sustainment of deployed forces.9. Naval Support Activity BahrainThe Naval Support Activity is one of the most important U.S. military bases in the world. Located in Bahrain, it is home to the US Navy’s Fifth Fleet and the US Naval Forces Central Command. It is a crucial base for American interests in the Persian gulf, particularly in providing operational support to the US and coalition troops, and ensuring security of ships, aircrafts and other remote locations in the region.8. Al-Udeid Air Base, QatarThe Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar is the largest military installation of the United States in the Middle East. It serves as a hub for overseas American operations, particularly against targets in countries like Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. More than 11,000 American and coalition troops are stationed at the air base.7. MacDill Air Force Base, FloridaThe MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida serves as the headquarters of the U.S. Central Command and the U.S. Special Operations Command. More than 15,000 people work at the base. MacDill has been a strategic center for decades and was used for various military operations, including Desert Shield and Storm in the Persian Gulf, Just Cause in Panama, and Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti.6. Ramstein Air Base, GermanyThe Ramstein Air Base in southwestern Germany serves as the headquarters for the American Air Force in Europe and for NATO’s Allied Air Command. It is one of the most important U.S. military bases in the world since it is a hub for the US and NATO’s European operations. The base became the transfer point in 2021 for Afghan civilians fleeing Taliban’s takeover of Kabul, and in 2022, the Ramstein Air Base hosted defense agency representatives from 42 countries to synchronize military assistance for Ukraine.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Most Important U.S. Military Bases in the World.Suggested Articles:25 Strongest Armies in the World in 2023Top 16 Defense Contractors in the World in 2023NATO Military Spending by Country: Top 20 CountriesDisclosure: None. 15 Most Important U.S. Military Bases in the World is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

TaicletThanks, Maria, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us on our third quarter 2023 earnings call. All of us on the line today are well aware that since our last call, the world is now seeing yet another terrible conflict. Everyone in our company remains dedicated to fully supporting the United States government's policy and efforts to deter aggression, restore security and achieve peace. Today, I will first highlight our third quarter results as we pursue our vision of 21st Century Security, designed to support the U.S. Department of Defense Strategy of Integrated deterrents and then I'll turn it over to Jay to provide additional detail before taking your questions. Starting on Page 3 of the slides. Sales increased 2% year-over-year to $16.9 billion and backlog remains at historically high levels at $156 million. EPS of $6.73 exceeded prior year and free cash flow was a strong $2.5 billion. We returned approximately 100% of free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the quarter. Earlier in October, we announced a $0.15 increase in our dividend which reflects 5% growth and is the 21st consecutive year of dividend increases for Lockheed Martin. At the same time, our Board also approved a $6 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization, bringing our total authorization to $13 billion, reconfirming our continued commitment to returning capital to shareholders. We are also reaffirming our full year 2023 financial outlook for sales, profit, EPS and free cash flow. Given the current status of the 2024 U.S. Defense budget, global geopolitical tensions and the macroeconomic environment, we will provide our expectations for our 2024 financial outlook during our full year 2023 earnings call in January. On the U.S. budget, though the specific trajectory of the future U.S. Defense budget is still in process between the administration and Congress, the global threat landscape is increasingly elevated. Our robust backlog reflects the relevance and importance of the Lockheed Martin portfolio and elevating returns to great power conflict involving the United States and its allies and the solid positioning of our business to serve our domestic and international customers. From a process standpoint and government, the current continuing resolution or CR is in place through November 17. At that point, one of the following could occur. FY '24 appropriations bills will be enacted, Congress will enact another partial or whole CR or there could be a partial or full government shutdown. In any of these scenarios, there continues to be the option also for supplemental requests related to support Ukraine, Israel and potentially Taiwan. As Congress continues to work through the FY '24 appropriations bills, we are optimistic that there will be consistent support for the National Defense strategy and funding for its priorities. In the meantime, we will continue to work with our customers and suppliers to minimize any potential disruptions due to the process. And we will press on with executing our 21st Century security strategy of building capacity, efficiency and resilience into our production operations, driving advanced digital technologies to enhance integrated deterrents and expanding our international business and operations. Turning to the F-35 program. We delivered 30 F-35 aircraft in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to 80 jets. Consistent with our announcement in September, we continue to expect to deliver a total of 97 aircraft this year, all in the Technology Refresh 2 or TR2 configuration. We are producing F-35s at a rate of [$156 billion] per year, and expect to continue at that pace while simultaneously working to finalize TR-3 software development testing. And we recently began flight test evaluations of the next software release that encompasses major systems upgrades such as improved RADAR, next-gen distributed aperture system and weapons capability. As previously announced, we continue to expect to deliver the first TR-3 configured aircraft between April and June of 2024. The superior technological capabilities of the F-35 continue to generate strong interest both domestically and internationally. In September, Denmark's first 4 locally based F-35 aircraft arrived on their home soil. Denmark's program of record calls for 27 F-35A aircraft. Also in September, the Czech Republic chose to become part of the global F-35 Lightning II program, and the U.S. State Department approved a possible $5 billion foreign military sale to South Korea for up to 25 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. Earlier in the quarter, Israel announced that we'll buy an additional 25 F-35s, which will add a third squadron and increased its F-35 fleet to 75 aircraft. Additionally, in August, Lockheed Martin was selected by the Australian Department of Defense, as their strategic partner for their AIR6500 program Phase 1. This transformational Pathfinder program will deliver the broadest scope of Joint All Domain Operations, or JADO in the free world, and will completely revolutionize the way the Australian defense force operates. By connecting Australian systems and platforms that operate across air, space, land, sea and cyber domains, we expect that AIR6500 will set the blueprint for future military operations worldwide. This proven technology will provide greater situational awareness and defense against increasingly advanced air and missile threats and enables significantly greater interoperability between Australia and allied nations. Lockheed Martin will lead this first phase which will provide the core architecture and multi-domain integration for the program. This is just 1 recent win that demonstrates the business success of our 21st Century Security cornerstone, trusted and reliable battle management and command and control systems that integrate across multiple domains, military services and allied forces. Late last year, Lockheed Martin also won the $500 million Defense of Guam award. And in late September, we were also awarded a potential 7-year, over $1 billion contract for systems engineering and software integration to the integrated combat system across the surface force portfolio of the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard. This will link together systems and software across the services and a JADO construct and it not only enables faster decision-making and better capabilities but also serves as a much more effective global deterrent strategy. Beyond these awards, we continue to develop 21st Century Security technologies to advance interoperability between Lockheed Martin product lines. The 5G.MIL hybrid base station that our engineers invented is the 1LM initiative that includes teams at MFC and Aeronautics. We recently transferred data from a sniper targeting pod that was set up in Orlando, Florida to the Tactical Missile Simulation Lab in Grand Prairie, Texas to provide real-time updates to a simulated missile inflate. This event significantly advanced efforts towards upcoming live fire demonstrations of cross domain platforms operating in a joint environment that will use data from multiple sources across an open architecture. Also, Skunk Works partnered with the University of Iowa's operator Performance Laboratory to demonstrate an AI commanded jamming capability. In this, we successfully used artificial intelligence on 2 air systems to provide jamming support to a simulated strike against enemy air defenses. This demonstration showed how AI agents with high performance and reliable behavior and operate in close coordination with and be controlled by human crude aircraft. We also conducted a successful test of the prototype radio for the PAC-3 MSE missile that will enable communications with the SPY-1 radar, the key sensor in the Aegis Weapon System. This test performed by a 1LM team across MFC and RMS paves the way for the design of a multifrequency radio data link for PAC-3 MSE. In turn, that will enable the U.S. Navy for the first time to have the ability to integrate the state-of-the-art PAC-3 missile onto its warships and open up another opportunity for Lockheed Martin in the future. International interest in PAC-3 also remains strong, as demonstrated by our deepening partnership with Poland, which signed a letter of offer and acceptance for 644 PAC-3 MSEs and related equipment in the quarter. In our RMS business, Sikorsky CH-53K helicopter is expected to grow meaningfully also over the coming years. In August, we won a $2.7 billion contract to build and deliver 35 additional CH-53K helicopters and it's the largest procurement to date for this multi-mission aircraft. Another long-standing major Lockheed Martin program, this one is space is also poised for significant growth ramp. In late September, the Fleet Ballistic Missile Program won a $1.2 billion contract for the Navy's Trident II D5 life extension. For nearly 7 decades, Lockheed Martin supported the U.S. Navy as a critical partner for its mission to provide sea-based strategic deterrents. The Trident II D5 LE missile will be in service through the 2040s, maintaining the proven performance of the D5 system for significantly less cost to the government than of designing a new missile. Also in our Space business, Lockheed Martin's next-generation interceptor, or NGI program, executed its digital preliminary design review in partnership with the Missile Defense Agency customer. That happened on September 29. During this review, the MDA assessed the NGI program's readiness and maturity to continue into the detailed design phase, confirming that our solution continues to meet the requirements for this crucial and demanding mission. Finally, the OSIRIS-REx sample return capsule touched down in the Utah Desert on September 24, returning NASA's first ever sample from an asteroid. After a 7-year mission traveling approximately, I believe, is 4 billion miles in space. The capsule holds material from Bennu a carbon-rich asteroid and scientists hope it will teach us more about the origins of organics that led to life on earth, plus the mechanics behind overall planet formation. After release of the capsule, the spacecraft was set on a new course to investigate the asteroid Apophis under the mission name OSIRIS-APEX. So with that interesting and exciting news, I'll turn it over the call to Jay and join you later for questions. Jay?Jesus MalaveThanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will walk you through our third quarter 2023 financial results. I'll also provide an update to our full year 2023 guidance, and offer a few comments on 2024. As I describe our results, please follow along with the web charts we have posted with our earnings release today. Starting on Chart 4, with consolidated sales and segment operating profit. Third quarter sales increased 2% year-over-year with 3 of the 4 business areas delivering growth. Segment operating profit was down 6% year-over-year due to lower net favorable profit adjustments and lower equity earnings, resulting in segment margins of 10.7%. Moving to earnings per share on Chart 5. GAAP EPS was comparable year-over-year, with lower segment profit and higher net interest expense offset by favorable below-the-line items, including lower share count, lower tax rate and fewer mark-to-market losses. On an adjusted basis, EPS was down $0.10 year-over-year, primarily due to the lower profit. Moving to cash flow on Chart 6. Our free cash flow was strong at over $2.5 billion in the quarter or 150% of net income, helped in part by our focus on working capital, primarily due to better collections at the end of the government fiscal year. Once again, we demonstrated our commitment to shareholders by returning 99% of our free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases this quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we've returned almost $5.3 billion or 116% of free cash flow. As Jim mentioned, our Board approved a 5% increase to the quarterly dividend and an additional $6 billion in share repurchase authorization. These tools remain a key part of our total shareholder return strategy. Okay. Moving to segment results and starting with Aeronautics on Chart 7. Third quarter sales at Aero decreased 5% driven by lower volume on F-35, partially offset by higher volume at Skunk Works. F-35 production was down due to the previously mentioned Lot 15-17 sales catch up in the third quarter of 2022, and an overall more linear throughput this year. Both development and sustainment saw solid year-over-year growth in the quarter. Operating profit decreased 12% from the prior year due to the lower volume and lower net profit adjustments. On the F-16 program, international interest remains strong. We delivered the second Block 70 aircraft to Bahrain in July and in September, the first Block 70 aircraft for the Slovak Republic was unveiled at our facility in Greenville, South Carolina. The Slovak Republic will be the first European country to receive this newest and most capable version of the fighting. Today's latest version, the Block 70-72 will be flown by 6 countries and counting. With a backlog of 126 aircraft as of the third quarter, the F-16 program continues to play a crucial role in 21st Century Security missions for international allies. It will be a key contributor to growth over the coming years. Shifting to Missiles and Fire Control on Page 8. Sales increased 4% year-over-year driven by higher sales volumes on munitions programs within Tactical Strike Missiles, partially offset by lower volume within integrated air and missile defense. Segment operating profit also increased 4% year-over-year due to the higher net profit adjustments. Margins were comparable at 13.5%. MSC has built a strong backlog, and we continue to see strong demand for our missiles and munitions with allied nations seeking to improve the security posture amidst today's complex threat environment. This backlog provides a foundation for growth over the coming years across several of our product lines, including PAC-3, GMLRS, HIMARS, Javelin and JASSM and LRASM. Turning to Rotary and Mission Systems on Page 9. Sales were up 9% in the quarter, driven by higher volume across a handful of programs within our integrated warfare systems and sensors and C6ISR lines of business. Operating profit increased 2% due to higher sales volume and was partially offset by lower net profit adjustments. RMS backlog increased in the quarter, primarily due to the $2.7 billion CH-53K award, which is pictured for Lot 7 and 8, the first full rate production lots as part of the U.S. Marine Corps 200 aircraft program of record. This significant contract bolsters Sikorsky and its partners creates additional production efficiencies and provides the U.S. Marine Corps with transformative capabilities. On Chart 10, we continue to see strong growth across our space portfolio with sales increasing 8% year-over-year driven by higher volume on NGI, Fleet Ballistic Missile, GPS and Orion programs. Operating profit decreased 15%, as the benefit from higher sales volume was more than offset by lower net profit adjustments and lower equity earnings from United Launch Alliance. Space backlog grew slightly to over $30 billion at the end of the third quarter helped by the $800 million Transport Layer Tranche 2 award for 36 beta satellites. Transport Layer is part of the proliferated space architecture and will strengthen deterrents with more resilient space architectures for beyond line of sight targeting, data transport and advanced missile detection and tracking. With this award, we will build and deliver a total of 88 data communication satellites to the Space Development Agency in support of their low-earth orbit constellations. Okay. Now shifting to our 2023 expectations on Page 11. For the full year, we're holding the outlook for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share and free cash flow. We've successfully driven and delivered more linear results in 2023 than prior years, which enables more efficient use of our capacity, but sets up for a difficult compares to last year's fourth quarter. In conjunction with our recent announcement of increased share repurchase authorization, we're increasing our share repurchase forecast for 2023 to $6 billion, provided there is not an extended shutdown scenario. These repurchases along with dividends, are expected to return nearly 150% of our free cash flow to shareholders for the year. And between 2022 and 2023, we are on track to repurchase nearly 13% of our current market cap. We're also set to deliver mid-single-digit free cash flow per share growth in 2023, and we're positioning the company to continue that level of growth in the future. Okay. A few comments on 2024. While we don't have a formal outlook to share, I'll provide a few directional markers as we see them today, barring any environmental setbacks. We still anticipate low single-digit sales growth as we convert our strong backlog position. As I previously mentioned, the backlog supports a higher growth rate, but the value chain remains constrained by extended lead times that have yet to compress. On segment margins, we expect the underlying business to be relatively flat year-over-year, but anticipate variability caused by the timing of impacts from the MFC classified program. And our free cash flow, we're following the budget process to determine whether it will have an impact on the timing of our program schedules and milestones, but are continuing to set internal targets that deliver mid-single-digit growth in free cash flow per share. Okay. Let's wrap it up. Results through the first 3 quarters have been solid with a long-term demand environment that is favorable to Lockheed Martin's 21st Century Security capabilities. Our focus on linearity and working capital is helping to drive more consistent sales and improved cash flow. We're maintaining our full year outlook while increasing our planned share repurchases, further demonstrating our commitment to shareholder returns. And finally, we're executing our 21st Century Security strategy through improving capacity and resilience in the defense enterprise, accelerating the adoption and insertion of 21st Century digital technologies, and collaborating more closely with international partners and allies to improve security solutions. With that, Lois, let's open up the call for Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein.Douglas Stuart HarnedI wanted to see if -- just could I understand the F-35 situation a little bit more. Now the TR-3 deliveries of F-35, those are now expected at some point in Q2 next year. But I think it's difficult for us to have total confidence in that timing.And what I'm trying to understand is as you continue to produce F-35, which will need software upgrades before delivery, you're recognizing revenues on percent completion, so revenue should continue to be solid. But when you look at, say, a June delivery date, what's the impact on your production recognition of revenues, earnings and cash flow should that date move around, how should we think about the timing here?Jesus MalaveSo Doug, the timing on sales and the profits associated with the sales, the booking margin, I really shouldn't expect much variability with that. As we've mentioned, that really doesn't get impacted. What you could see and what we are seeing today is that our risk retirements are obviously dependent upon complete -- successful completion of the test program. And so that will -- could limit our ability to take profit adjustments on a Lot 15-17 program. But as I've said in the past, we are performing and expect to continue to perform profitability stronger on 5 Lot 15-17 than we did on Lot 12-14. And so we might see some short-term limitations on our ability to take profit rate adjustments, we still expect and have confidence will drive higher profitability on this contract locked in the prior one.OperatorAnd the next question is from the line of Cai von Rumohr from TD Cowen.Cai von RumohrYes. So Jay, I think recently, you made a comment about gravity on margins, and you haven't provided a guide for '24. But I think one of the issues that kind of you mentioned has been the classified missile program at MFC, where you have some LRIP options coming up. Could you maybe give us some color in terms of the status of that and how that impacts -- could impact next year? And any other items we should be watchful of that might exert gravity on margins?Jesus MalaveSure, Cai. Thanks. So yes, I mean, that's the question we've talked about. It's been a headwind. It's something that we've talked about for the upcoming number of years, including next year. And in fact, we are seeing some of the headwind this year, and it really -- it's dependent upon an analysis really the timing of recognition of these losses. And there are certain things that need to be met from a performance standpoint on the program. And then it becomes an assessment on the probability of an option being exercised. And so there's just variability in that timing. It could be as early as, frankly, as this quarter, or into next quarter. What we could find ourselves in a situation is that we're recording multiple lots in 2024, which would put some downward pressure on next year's margins. So we'll have a better feel for that next year, and it could be in the range of anywhere between 25 to 50 basis points of headwind from where we are and where we end today or this year from a margin perspective. So hopefully, that provides a little bit of color on the impact of that program. Is that as far as any others, look, we -- if you look at this year, we had lower profit adjustments this year. We expect there to be in the low 20s in 2023. We're evaluating what that means for 2024 in general. But again, I think, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're expecting the underlying business to be pretty much flattish, which would include recurring margins as well as profit rate adjustments in 2024.James D. TaicletYes. And Cai, it's Jim. Just to add on the classified program. First of all, given my Air Force pilot experience, I can tell you that this is a really important capability for the country. It should continue on as an important capability for many, many years and even decades, assuming the program is successful, which we think we're on track to be and it will be massively NPV positive over that longer time frame. So we're working our way through the schedule and the performance in the early phases of the contract, but at the end of the day, it will be worth it for the country and the company. But we will keep you all updated as Jay just did on the path to get there.OperatorAnd our next question is from the line of Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley.Kristine LiwagSo maybe an F-35 question. We've seen a lot of new countries express interest in the F-35 and current partners like Israel, have indicated plans to add to existing orders. What are your thoughts on expanding capacity to meet all the international demand? And is there demand from the customers to potentially bring forward their deliveries? And should you increase capacity, what level of investments?James D. TaicletSo Kristine, it's Jim. I'll start off and Jay can maybe speak to the required investment level. We're in sync with our joint program office customer, which represents the international cohort indirectly of the F-35 customer base and directly the U.S. services. We've all settled on the [$156 billion] per year rate as the joint investment that we're all willing to make, given the demand that's out there. There is the annual sort of slotting priorities discussion that happens within the joint program office and the international partners, and that will keep the line full for many, many years. If we were to get significantly more international orders that might motivate us jointly, and I mean us meaning the government and industry, including our suppliers, by the way to make an incremental investment. But I think that, that would have to be a significant increase in the order book above what we see today. So Jay, any other color on that.Jesus MalaveYes. I mean, the investments, it's probably in the low hundreds of millions. It's manageable. But again, to Jim's point, it needs to be coordinated with the customer.OperatorOur next question is from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.George D. ShapiroYes. Jay, on the F-35, can you discuss a little bit where we stood in the quarter in terms of sustainment revenue versus production because the decremental margin on the production was pretty high at 22%? And I'll sneak in one other one, which isn't RMS, the implication is that you'd have a 14% margin in Q4 to meet your guide, yet revenues would be relatively flat. So if you can just kind of tell us what's going on to cause that to occur.Jesus MalaveOkay. I'll start with the second one first on RMS margins and then come back on the F-35. On the margins for RMS, you're right, George, we're expecting an increase in profitability there. It's really a twofold function of higher profit adjustments. And there are -- and I think I've talked about this in the past, we do have some mix benefits through some delivery -- program deliveries here in the fourth quarter, which will give them some lift.As far as the F-35, just really from a sales perspective in the quarter, production was down pretty substantially, really close to 20%. Development was up quite substantially and sustainment was up in the high teens. So with solid there on sustainment, that's been strong all year long. We expect that to grow for the year around 10%.OperatorAnd our next question is from the line of Ron Epstein. One moment, please.James D. TaicletLois, are you still there?OperatorYes. One moment. We're opening his line. I'm sorry, the next person that we will go to is David Strauss from Barclays.David Egon StraussJay, I think the IRS came up with some recent updated guidance around Section 174. I want to see what your interpretation of that was, whether it's supported your position or your peers that are taking, I think, higher levels of -- or a higher associated with Section 174. And then any updated thoughts on where pension might come out for you guys next year given what appears to be much higher discount rates and weak asset returns?Jesus MalaveSure. Thank you, David. The first one on the R&amp;D capitalization, the draft guidelines that came out. We view those as promising. We believe that they support our position of continuing to deduct the costs associated with cost plus contracts. And just as you remember, we treat that and view it as a cost of sale, not really as an R&amp;D activity. The risk is really borne by the acquirer of those services. The rights are short-lived and they're also restricted. And so we believe the draft language is, at least thus far, appears to be consistent with our approach. And so we view it positively. As far as pension, a couple of things going on with pension I'll go on the P&amp;L. FAS pension will see a significant reduction next year. We're going to go from about $375 million of income in '23 to about $50 million of loss in 2024. It's a function of 2 things. One is the returns. And the second is essentially the expiration of benefits that we're amortizing since -- from the 2014 salary plan freeze. And so those run out, and so we'll see a significant increase. As you know, that's pretty much noncash, but it will affect EPS. On the CAS side of it, we'll see a little bit of a slight reduction anywhere between $25 million to $50 million reduction. But again, the biggest piece there is on FAS. From a cash contributions, we talked about anywhere between $500 million to $1 billion of contributions required starting in 2025. Right now, given where things are, we would expect that to be in the higher range, if not higher for 2025. And if we stay where we are, it could trigger some contributions in 2024. But I will say, when you think about cash contribution to pension and what that means, we've got an enviable position in our balance sheet. We've demonstrated that we're willing to use it. And so I wouldn't view that higher pension contributions as limiting, otherwise limiting our ability to continue our cash deployment strategies, and that's the key point.OperatorThe next question is from the line of Ken Herbert from RBC Capital Markets.Kenneth George HerbertMaybe, Jay, just to follow up on a comment you made in the prepared remarks. I think you made a comment around the buyback activity in the fourth quarter sort of dependent upon timing of the fiscal '24 budget and whether or not there is a shutdown potentially. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about the timing of the '24 budget, but very specifically, if there's any sort of shutdown, how much does that put at risk sort of the buyback activity expected in the fourth quarter? Or if it's very short, does that not impact? And maybe you can walk through how you're viewing sort of the risks around that and impact on the fourth quarter cash deployment?Jesus MalaveSure. So to date, we've done $3 billion with this new guide at $6 billion, that's $3 billion in the fourth quarter. We're monitoring the status of the budget discussions and resolution of that. If we do find ourselves in a shutdown scenario would cause us to take a pause in another relook at that share repurchase. And what we would probably do is just defer it, so it would be more of an issue of timing versus anything else until such time that the budget gets clarified. So history tells us, these things are fairly short-lived. We believe that we'll be able to get through it here in the fourth quarter. If not, then it would just push probably into the first quarter and the like and really won't see a meaningful impact there. But again, in a shutdown scenario, you just take a look at what does that mean? It does -- you can't have new starts. It could be disrupted to programs. It could also put us in a situation where we're doing some self-funding to keep programs on track. And to the extent that occurs, it could be a limiting factor on share repurchase.Maria Ricciardone LeeLois, are you still there?OperatorYes. The next question will come from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Sheila's line did drop from the Q&amp;A. So we'll move to Rob Stallard and he's from Vertical Research.Robert Alan StallardA question for Jim or Jay. On the balance sheet, you noted that you're returning more than 100% of free cash flow to shareholders at the moment. But we do have this ongoing U.S. budget uncertainty and you're going to put more money into the pension fund. So how sustainable do you think it is to be returning more than 100% to shareholders going forward?Jesus MalaveIt's a good question. If you look at just the profile with this incremental authorization that we have, the way we're looking at it is $6 billion here in 2023, $4 billion in 2024 and then essentially $3 billion in '25 and $3 billion in '26, which puts us equal to free cash flow in that ballpark, assuming kind of a $6 billion placeholder offer free cash flow in those given years. And so that's the way we're viewing it, Rob. So over time, over the next few years, it will revert back to more of a 100% of free cash flow. But again, we'll look at it year-by-year. As you've seen in the last 2 years, we did increase it here in the fourth quarter, and we'll continue to evaluate those opportunities as they present themselves, the reality of what happens with actual pension funding, what progress we make in our working capital reduction initiatives and all those will go into the mix master and provide the inform what we formally do in any given year.OperatorThe next question will come from the line of Richard Safran from Seaport Research Partners.Richard Tobie SafranSo if we take an optimistic scenario here on what happens with the budget outlook, I wanted to know if you could discuss the 2024 bookings and the opportunity set both classified and unclassified. Again, if we assume no shutdown and we assume to get funding, I'm interested in what the major competitions are next year is what was -- how you see backlog growth and the book-to-bill is better than 1?Jesus MalaveRichard, we've got a pretty decent line of sight to continuing growth in our backlog. There's a lot of activity happening in classified, which I can't speak to specifics about, but we do see some award decisions next year there. We'll continue to see orders strength in MFC over this time period. And we've talked about orders between 2023 and 2027, of $10 billion. We have not seen all of those orders come to fruition yet. So we would expect those to be continued opportunities for us. We'll continue to have F-35, so Lot 18 next year is probably something that we should probably consider coming into the backlog in 2024. In addition to the performance-based logistics program on the F-35 program, we've our proposal to the customer. We continue to have dialogue. And we're cautiously optimistic that we can get under contract in the first half of next year. So those are some key awards to think about for 2024.OperatorThe next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies.Sheila Karin KahyaogluCan you guys hear me?James D. TaicletYes. We can hear you fine, Sheila.Sheila Karin KahyaogluSo just wanted to ask Jim and Jay, you're a pretty confident management team just given your big backlog, $150 billion. You're returning 150% to shareholders, which is a big number. So you've talked about low single-digit growth and 11% margins for some time. So I just kind of wanted to know what's changed given the backdrop is seemingly better, is it just a budget uncertainty? Is it supply chain? Is it F-35? Maybe if you can just comment on that.Jesus MalaveWell, not much has really changed, to be honest, we talked about low single digits for a while now. We -- I talked about that in my prepared remarks. On the margins, underlying margin is generally flattish because we could be in a situation next year where we have multiple lots of the classified program, that could cause some variability. But that doesn't fundamentally alter what we've been really talking about. Same thing with free cash flow. We've been targeting mid-single-digit free cash flow per share growth. And we still see a path there. We know there are some headwinds, whether it's pension and the like, but we still believe that, that we have a line of sight to be able to do that. And that's what we're going to be working through on a year-by-year basis and starting with 2024 over the next couple of months. We'll work through solidify our plans, and we'll present them formally to you in January.James D. TaicletYes. In the longer term, there are some things that are changing significantly. One is the global threat environment and the geopolitical situations getting more concerning and challenging. That's refocusing the U.S. and certainly our allies around the world on national defense an increasing manner. The second big trend that's going on is the continued evolution of both physical and digital technology at a rate never seen before serving human history, frankly.And so the opportunity for our company to take the leadership role in integrating those technologies, whether they're hypersonics, hypersonic defense, space technologies that are advanced as well as 5G, distributed cloud, artificial intelligence, we're investing in all those technologies to try to drive them in and pull through using this 21st Century concept, the technology driving concept we have is to pull through our platforms and enable them quickly on the open architecture that we're advocating for that will be quickly and widely adoptable making our platforms more compelling as we go forward in time. And then the third thing is the notion that we have international defense strategy, and I think our allies are increasingly embracing is international cooperation, which drives interoperability and also linking command and control systems, all of which comport with our strategy. So I think there are some megatrends that are going on over a longer term that won't necessarily affect us quarter-to-quarter as Jay was stating, but will give us opportunities that I think the company is uniquely positioned to take advantage of over that long term.OperatorAnd our next question is from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan.Seth Michael SeifmanMaybe, Jay, one quick housekeeping question and then one broader question for both of you. The mid-single-digit growth you talked about for free cash flow per share next year. Did that assume any kind of pension contribution next year? And how big might that be or not? And then just more broadly, when you guys talk about seeking out additional suppliers of Solid, is that something for maybe developing hypersonics programs for late in the decade and into the 2030s? Or is that about replacing your suppliers on kind of today's existing programs?James D. TaicletI'll talk to Solid Rocket Motors and Jay can take the free cash flow for share part of your question there. So our objective is to bring antifragility into our own supply chain first and to broadly apply that to the DoD in partnership with them as well. And so when it comes to solid rocket motors, I mean we're actually starting with GMLRS, for example, a legacy technology where we want to augment our existing supplier and have a dual source, frankly. And then that will extend into other systems, large and small and legacy in advance. So this is not a onetime objective. This is a broad in a way, campaign like approach to strengthening our own supply chain and enabling multiple sources really for even beyond our company for our industry, which I think is important. So I do think that this is not a one-shot deal. We're in negotiations and discussions with a counterparty. We think we can start us off with on this journey, but it's going to be a long journey, and we'll probably have additional participants and programs as the years and even decades roll on.Jesus MalaveOn the question of the free cash flow per share for 2024, Seth, what I mentioned is that we're setting up internal targeting and internal actions to be able to arrive at that incremental pension contribution would obviously put pressure on that. And we'll go through that over the next coming months and determine what the art of what's possible and what our plans would be, and again we'll present that in January.OperatorAnd the next question is from Myles Walton from Wolfe Research.Myles Alexander WaltonJay, a quick clarification and then a question for Jim. The clarification on the margins for next year, 25 to 50 basis points of risk, I guess, is what you're seeing on the MFC. Should we anticipate that there's a way around that? Or is that the base case? And then, Jim, in the press release, you talked about digital services revenue over time. And I'm just curious, maybe you could touch on your vision of what digital services revenue is today and where you want to take it over the next several years?James D. TaicletSo digital services will be a wide range, but we're starting with this notion of trusted, reliable mission systems engineering for command and control and battle management systems. That is a business we're already in, actually. It is largely digital already. And it's these kind of programs like defensive farm. We have a program in the UAE that's based on this technology as well. Call it, DIAMONDShield. We're using that core technology to then expand into other programs like AIR6500. So we're already in that business. It's in, I think, the mid-low to mid-single-digit billions at this point. And we're going to try to ramp that up in and of itself, add other technologies to that for networking, connecting again our platforms as well as other platforms from other OEMs to provide mission solutions for the DoD. So the digital and the physical technologies will ultimately come together in a way that can advance mission capability for our customers in, say, air-to-air combat, surface, warfare, et cetera, and air and missile defense integration. Those kinds of missions, we want to advance every 3 to 6 months of the combination of digital and physical technologies of our own and from others, partners, et cetera, that we will work with. So this is, again, long-term broad approach, but we've already got a very, very good starting point that's material in the command and control and battle management systems that we have today and how we're augmenting them and modernizing those for the future.Jesus MalaveOkay. Going back to the question on margins for next year. Just as I mentioned, underlying margins, and let me for sake of clarity, margins, excluding the impact of the MFC program, we expect to be flattish. The MFC programs, it will provide a drag on the margins next year, and it's a question of timing. So it could be anywhere between 25 to 50 basis points. And again, we'll have a lot more clarity on that as we close out the year.OperatorThe next question is from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.Noah PoponakJay, I guess I also wanted to ask about margins, and you sort of did there, but I don't know if you would just state where you expect the MFC margin to shake out for the year, next year or what it looks like in the quarters with the more concentrated losses? And then I just wondered if you could talk about how -- a little bit more about how this got here. I know you've talked about having the fixed price LRIPs with prices fixed a little while ago. Was -- is that something that's been going on longer than I realized? I know you also -- my understanding is you also no bid missile program that was awarded recently because it had fixed price development. Is the customer shifting the risk a little bit towards the contractor? Or am I overreading what I'm seeing out there?Jesus MalaveWell, let me maybe take the second part of it and then circle back. There are really 2 different programs. The -- I think you're referring to the standard attack weapon award and that was a fixed price development program that we decided not to pursue because of the risk posture over there. Each program and pursuit really stands on its own, and we review those individually. In this case, we thought the risk profile was just too much. And so we backed off. On this particular program, on the classified program, that was a cost-plus development program. So there really was not much risk associated what the development cycle. There are these production low rate initial production lots that were priced pretty aggressively. And hence, we're starting -- we're going to start to see the headwinds associated with that. As Jim mentioned, these are -- this would be a long-term program. And we know what it takes to make sure that we provide accretive NPV on these types of programs. And so we track that and monitoring that, and we're confident over the long term, we'll be able to deliver that. So again, these are case-by-case type of situations that we pursue. On the -- we'll probably have to get back to you on the specific MFC margins for next year. I think we can back into 25 to 50 on the total company, you can back into what that impact is for MFC. But I just don't have it in front of me.James D. TaicletAnd Noah, just to give you context here, the approach we're taking no matter what the customer's initiative is on risk balancing or imbalancing, the approach that Jay and I are taking here, as we look at programs going forward and opportunities is really a holistic one where we do take the long-term total program value into account, but we also take -- we'll take into account seriously short and midterm risk management. .And especially when it comes to fixed price either development or initial rate production because if you look at the concept of fixed price initial rate production on a program this technology is not settled in the first place yet because the development hasn't been done, we would ascribe a higher risk factor to that I think, going forward here based on both experience and just our own perspectives on these kinds of things.Maria Ricciardone LeeOkay. And Lois, I think we have time for 1 more as we approach the top of the hour.OperatorAnd that question come from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi.Jason GurskyJim, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, the idea of a supplemental for Taiwan. I'm wondering if you wouldn't do us a favor, just kind of remind us of what you're shipping into Taiwan today. And in the context of a supplement to what kinds of things do you think are going to be in high demand and would lead to more revenue for you all Jay, related to international here. I was wondering if you could just give us a quick update on the margin profile of your international business, kind of writ large today outside the F-35 program. If international is growing faster, is the expectation here that we would, all else be equal see margin expansion in light of international historically being higher margin than domestic business?James D. TaicletSo Jason, on Taiwan, I think the signature program that everybody is aware of is F-16 in both production and modernization. So that's ongoing. But we also provided a kind of comprehensive defensive Taiwan, like a Defense of Guam award we won last year, approach to integrating these digital technologies with the aircraft available that we provide and others, the missile systems that we provide and others and integrate them into sort of the approach to defending Taiwan just like we're designing for Guam. So there could be a wide range of digital and physical products that would come with this over time. The U.S. government will help define with the Taiwanese government. What -- when if any of those will be procured and released for export to Taiwan to the FMS program and other vehicles. So I can't speak for the government as to what that will look like. But I think it's, again, a possibility that given the rising tensions there could be supplementals for Taiwan in addition to, as we said, Israel and Ukraine.Jesus MalaveAnd on the international margins, historically, the margins have been higher than they are for U.S. government customers. But in this case, it's so what I would expect the base business to continue this higher margin. But a lot of the incremental opportunities that we've been talking about are really going through foreign military sales contracting which are more like U.S. DoD-type margins. And so while we will see kind of a net blended margin profile that's probably higher than the kind of base U.S. DoD, it will be limited -- at least the incremental business is going to be limited because they are FMS.Maria Ricciardone LeeAll right. Great. Thanks, everybody. So I think we're at the top of the hour. I'll turn the call back over to Jim for some final thoughts.James D. TaicletSure. Thanks, Maria. I think before we conclude today, I do want to thank all of our employees around the world and across the country for their continued dedication. They're supporting our signature programs. They're going after new pursuits, advancing these digital technologies. And all that together will really enhance deterrents globally, especially in the more sort of dangerous world we live in. I want to really congratulate and thank our teams for everything they're doing. We also want to make sure that you the shareholders are reminded yet again that everything we're doing here is designed to deliver a compelling value to you all for many years to come. Jay and I really focus on free cash flow per share, along with the dividend to make sure that you're getting an interesting return over time, and we're trying to expand the business as we go as well. So thank you again for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with all of you on our next earnings call in January. And Lois, that concludes the call for this morning. Bye-bye.OperatorThank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&amp;T Event Conference, and you may now disconnect.]"

Even when using conservative assumptions, News Corp has an opportunity to create significant shareholder value through a separation of certain assets.”Shares in News Corp rose 2pc to just over $22, giving the company a market capitalisation of roughly $12.8bn. Starboard did not disclose the size of its holding.The activist assault comes a month after Mr Murdoch announced he was standing down as chairman of both News Corp and Fox, handing over the reins to son Lachlan. The media mogul has taken up the role of chairman emeritus of both companies.The Murdoch family trust still controls around 40pc of News Corp voting shares, making it hard for any activist to push through change.The Murdochs have previously clashed with investors over News Corp’s value. In January, the family called off a troubled effort to merge News Corp and Fox following a backlash from shareholders, who said the enlarged group would be undervalued.Story continuesRupert and Lachlan Murdoch acknowledged that the deal, which would have reunited the media empire a decade after it was split, was “not optimal for shareholders”.In a further blow the following month, News Corp also abandoned a deal to sell real estate business Move Inc to CoStar Group in a reported $3bn deal.Mr Smith, dubbed the “most feared man in corporate America”, is known for activist campaigns at software companies including Salesforce and GoDaddy. In June, Starboard took a stake in Cambridge-based biotech firm Abcam.A spokesman for News Corp said the company had “always maintained an active and engaged dialogue with our investors and are committed to driving shareholder value”.He added: “We remain focused on executing our strategic plan, which has helped us set records in profitability over the past three years.

And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the News Corporation (NASDAQ:NWSA) share price is up 67% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 53% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 36% in the last year , including dividends .Since it's been a strong week for News shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals. View our latest analysis for News There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During the five years of share price growth, News moved from a loss to profitability. That would generally be considered a positive, so we'd expect the share price to be up.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that News has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? Take a more thorough look at News' financial health with this free report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for News the TSR over the last 5 years was 78%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that News has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 36% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 12% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand News better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - News has   3 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.But note: News may not be the best stock to buy.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 24, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis largest U.S. cellphone carrier is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.17 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -11.4%.Revenues are expected to be $33.39 billion, down 2.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.16% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Verizon?For Verizon, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.38%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Verizon will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Verizon would post earnings of $1.17 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.21, delivering a surprise of +3.42%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Verizon doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Wireless National industry, AT&amp;T (T), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.63 per share for the quarter ended September 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -7.4%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $30.2 billion, up 0.5% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for AT&amp;T has been revised 1.7% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 3.54%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that AT&amp;T will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Price and EPS SurpriseRoper Technologies, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseRoper Technologies, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Roper Technologies, Inc.

In exchange, Rite Aid will make faster payments on new drug shipments and ensure that new deliveries are paid for before it pays other creditors.Rite Aid is working to finalize the settlement and will submit it to the court for approval, Sussberg told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Michael Kaplan, who is overseeing the case.While the agreement only covers the period that Rite Aid remains in bankruptcy, it and McKesson will continue to negotiate toward a longer-term solution, Sussberg said.Rite Aid, which has more than 2,000 retail stores in the U.S., filed for bankruptcy with a plan to close underperforming stores, sell its pharmacy benefit company Elixir and resolve lawsuits over its sale of addictive opioid medications.The lawsuit against McKesson alleged that the distributor improperly attempted to terminate the drug supply agreement on Saturday, just before Rite Aid declared bankruptcy. Rite Aid had accused McKesson of threatening to cut off its drug supply unless it immediately paid $700 million for amounts due under the contract.A McKesson spokesperson confirmed that the dispute has been resolved and that the company will continue to make shipments during Rite Aid's bankruptcy.Rite Aid has relied on McKesson for its drugs for 20 years, and paid McKesson $9 billion under the contract in 2023, according to court filings. Rite Aid said it maintains very low drug inventory, forcing it to rely on daily deliveries from McKesson. (Reporting by Dietrich Knauth, Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Bill Berkrot)]"

The settlement ensures that Rite Aid’s stock of prescription drugs won’t be impacted during its Chapter 11 case, the lawyers said.The deal avoids a potentially costly fight that could have hindered Rite Aid’s restructuring efforts. Rite Aid claimed McKesson was threatening to walk away from the supply agreement unless it paid for new goods when delivered, describing the effort as “a cynical ploy for negotiating leverage” over the retailer. McKesson argued the long-term supply deal ended prior to the bankruptcy.Rite Aid lawyer Josh Sussberg said the retailer has now agreed to pay McKesson within seven days of receiving new products, versus 19 days previously. Terms of the proposed settlement must be documented and the agreement might be challenged by other Rite Aid creditors, he added. Any settlement must be approved by Judge Michael Kaplan, who is overseeing Rite Aid’s Chapter 11 case.Read More: Rite Aid Rushes Sale of Unit Over Objection of Mystery SuitorMcKesson said in a Monday court filing that its supply agreement automatically terminated either before Rite Aid filed bankruptcy — because the pharmacy chain was already insolvent — or when the retailer filed Chapter 11. McKesson claimed Rite Aid already owes more than $720 million under the supply agreement, and was demanding more products worth as much as $1 billion without any assurance of payment, according to court papers.Story continuesDespite the impending bankruptcy, the company told Rite Aid it was willing to continue supplying products so long as the retailer paid for the goods upon delivery, according to McKesson Senior Vice President James Justin Bowers. Rite Aid refused those terms, and said McKesson would be responsible for damages associated with terminating the agreement, Bowers said in a court filing.Rite Aid’s lawsuit disputed McKesson’s characterization of risks associated with continuing the supply agreement, and accused McKesson of threatening to halt the supply of prescription drugs.“McKesson’s gambit — threatening to immediately stop the supply of hundreds of thousands of prescriptions per day if Rite Aid will not accede to McKesson’s demands — is opportunism and corporate greed in its basest form,” Rite Aid said in its lawsuit. “And it is plainly illegal.”Rite Aid said in court papers that it buys all of its branded pharmaceuticals and most of its generic drugs from McKesson.The case is Rite Aid Corp., 23-18993, US Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWall Street’s Surprising Quest for Ways to Finance Coal AgainThe New Middle East Is an All-Too-Familiar NightmareAd-Free Versions of Facebook and Instagram Have One Audience in Mind: RegulatorsThe K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTSIntroducing The Businessweek Show With Max Abelson©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

The optimism led by a solid second-quarter 2023 performance and its solid foothold in the broader MedTech space are expected to contribute further. However, dependence on third-party suppliers and global climate change-related concerns continue to bother the company.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has gained 34.2% against the 0.8% decline of the industry it belongs to. The S&amp;P 500 has witnessed 18% growth in the said time frame.The renowned medical device outsource manufacturer has a market capitalization of $2.53 billion. The company projects 12.1% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. Integer Holdings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an earnings surprise of 8.4%, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Research and Product Development: We are optimistic about Integer Holdings’ position as a developer and manufacturer of medical devices and components. The company focuses on developing new products, improving and enhancing existing products and expanding the use of its products in new or tangential applications. In addition to ITGR’s internal technology and capability development efforts aimed at providing its customers with differentiated solutions, the company also engages outside research institutions for unique technology projects.Solid Foothold in the Broader MedTech Space: We are optimistic about Integer Holdings’ stable footing in the cardiac, neuromodulation, orthopedics, vascular and advanced surgical markets. Its primary customers include large, multi-national original equipment manufacturers and their affiliated subsidiaries.ITGR has been focusing on its sales efforts to increase its market penetration in the Cardio &amp; Vascular, Neuromodulation and Non-Medical Electrochem markets. The company is also making strategic initiatives to maintain its leadership position in the cardiac rhythm management market.Story continuesStrong Q2 Results: Integer Holdings’ robust second-quarter 2023 results raise our optimism. The company registered strong year-over-year top-line and bottom-line performances. Robust results by both segments and strength in all three product lines of the Medical Sales segment were recorded. The expansion of the adjusted operating margin was also seen.DownsidesGlobal Climate Change: Customer, investor and employee expectations relating to environmental, social and governance (ESG) have been rapidly evolving and increasing. In addition, government organizations are enhancing or advancing legal and regulatory requirements specific to ESG matters. The heightened stakeholder focus on ESG issues related to ITGR’s business requires the continuous monitoring of various and evolving laws, regulations, standards and expectations and the associated reporting requirements.

andthe effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on the Company’s business are uncertain, and court decisions or legislative changes that take place after the Company issues its policies can result in an unexpected increase in the number of claims.Financial, Economic and Credit Risksa period of financial market disruption or an economic downturn;the Company’s investment portfolio is subject to credit and interest rate risk, and may suffer reduced or low returns or material realized or unrealized losses;the Company is exposed to credit risk related to reinsurance and structured settlements, and reinsurance coverage may not be available to the Company;the Company is exposed to credit risk in certain of its insurance operations and with respect to certain guarantee or indemnification arrangements that it has with third parties;a downgrade in the Company’s claims-paying and financial strength ratings;

andthe Company may be unable to protect and enforce its own intellectual property or may be subject to claims for infringing the intellectual property of others.Regulatory and Compliance Riskschanges in regulation, including higher tax rates; andthe Company’s compliance controls may not be effective.In addition, the Company’s share repurchase plans depend on a variety of factors, including the Company’s financial position, earnings, share price, catastrophe losses, maintaining capital levels appropriate for the Company’s business operations, changes in levels of written premiums, funding of the Company’s qualified pension plan, capital requirements of the Company’s operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, other investment opportunities (including mergers and acquisitions and related financings), market conditions, changes in tax laws (including the Inflation Reduction Act) and other factors.Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release or as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements. For a more detailed discussion of these factors, see the information under the captions ""Risk Factors,"" ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" and ""Forward Looking Statements"" in the quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on October 18, 2023, and in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 16, 2023, in each case as updated by our periodic filings with the SEC.GLOSSARY OF FINANCIAL MEASURES AND RECONCILIATIONS OF GAAP MEASURES TO NON-GAAP MEASURESThe following measures are used by the Company’s management to evaluate financial performance against historical results, to establish performance targets on a consolidated basis and for other reasons as discussed below. In some cases, these measures are considered non-GAAP financial measures under applicable SEC rules because they are not displayed as separate line items in the consolidated financial statements or are not required to be disclosed in the notes to financial statements or, in some cases, include or exclude certain items not ordinarily included or excluded in the most comparable GAAP financial measure. Reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures also follow.In the opinion of the Company’s management, a discussion of these measures provides investors, financial analysts, rating agencies and other financial statement users with a better understanding of the significant factors that comprise the Company’s periodic results of operations and how management evaluates the Company’s financial performance.Some of these measures exclude net realized investment gains (losses), net of tax, and/or net unrealized investment gains (losses), net of tax, included in shareholders’ equity, which can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends.Other companies may calculate these measures differently, and, therefore, their measures may not be comparable to those used by the Company’s management.RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME TO CORE INCOME AND CERTAIN OTHER NON-GAAP MEASURESCore income (loss) is consolidated net income (loss) excluding the after-tax impact of net realized investment gains (losses), discontinued operations, the effect of a change in tax laws and tax rates at enactment, and cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles when applicable. Segment income (loss) is determined in the same manner as core income (loss) on a segment basis. Management uses segment income (loss) to analyze each segment’s performance and as a tool in making business decisions. Financial statement users also consider core income (loss) when analyzing the results and trends of insurance companies. Core income (loss) per share is core income (loss) on a per common share basis.Reconciliation of Net Income to Core Income less Preferred DividendsThree Months EndedSeptember 30,Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,($ in millions, after-tax)2023202220232022Net income$404$454$1,365$2,023Adjustments:Net realized investment losses507274165Core income$454$526$1,439$2,188Three Months EndedSeptember 30,Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,($ in millions, pre-tax)2023202220232022Net income$472$528$1,352$2,367Adjustments:Net realized investment losses659394211Core income$537$621$1,446$2,578Twelve Months Ended December 31,AverageAnnual($ in millions, after-tax)202220212020201920182005 - 2017Net income$2,842$3,662$2,697$2,622$2,523$3,074Less: Loss from discontinued operations—————(34)Income from continuing operations2,8423,6622,6972,6222,5233,108Adjustments:Net realized investment (gains) losses156(132)(11)(85)(93)(37)Impact of changes in tax laws and/or tax rates (1) (2)—(8)———10Core income2,9983,5222,6862,5372,4303,081Less: Preferred dividends—————2Core income, less preferred dividends$2,998$3,522$2,686$2,537$2,430$3,079(1) Impact is recognized in the accounting period in which the change is enacted(2) 2017 reflects impact of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA)Reconciliation of Net Income per Share to Core Income per Share on a Diluted BasisThree Months EndedSeptember 30,Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,2023202220232022Diluted income per shareNet income$1.74$1.89$5.83$8.34Adjustments:Net realized investment losses, after-tax0.210.310.320.68Core income$1.95$2.20$6.15$9.02Reconciliation of Segment Income (Loss) to Total Core IncomeThree Months EndedSeptember 30,Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,($ in millions, after-tax)2023202220232022Business Insurance$468$471$1,626$1,806Bond &amp; Specialty Insurance265242702687Personal Insurance(193)(111)(648)(79)Total segment income5406021,6802,414Interest Expense and Other(86)(76)(241)(226)Total core income$454$526$1,439$2,188RECONCILIATION OF SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY TO ADJUSTED SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY AND CALCULATION OF RETURN ON EQUITY AND CORE RETURN ON EQUITYAdjusted shareholders’ equity is shareholders’ equity excluding net unrealized investment gains (losses), net of tax, included in shareholders’ equity, net realized investment gains (losses), net of tax, for the period presented, the effect of a change in tax laws and tax rates at enactment (excluding the portion related to net unrealized investment gains (losses)), preferred stock and discontinued operations.Reconciliation of Shareholders’ Equity to Adjusted Shareholders’ EquityAs of September 30,($ in millions)20232022Shareholders’ equity$19,978$19,906Adjustments:Net unrealized investment losses, net of tax, included in shareholders’ equity6,4666,317Net realized investment losses, net of tax74165Adjusted shareholders’ equity$26,518$26,388As of December 31,AverageAnnual($ in millions)202220212020201920182005 - 2017Shareholders’ equity$21,560$28,887$29,201$25,943$22,894$24,794Adjustments:Net unrealized investment (gains) losses, net of tax, included in shareholders’ equity4,898(2,415)(4,074)(2,246)113(1,335)Net realized investment (gains) losses, net of tax156(132)(11)(85)(93)(37)Impact of changes in tax laws and/or tax rates (1) (2)—(8)———22Preferred stock—————(49)Loss from discontinued operations—————34Adjusted shareholders’ equity$26,614$26,332$25,116$23,612$22,914$23,429(1) Impact is recognized in the accounting period in which the change is enacted(2) 2017 reflects impact of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA)Return on equity is the ratio of annualized net income (loss) less preferred dividends to average shareholders’ equity for the periods presented. Core return on equity is the ratio of annualized core income (loss) less preferred dividends to adjusted average shareholders’ equity for the periods presented. In the opinion of the Company’s management, these are important indicators of how well management creates value for its shareholders through its operating activities and its capital management.Average shareholders’ equity is (a) the sum of total shareholders’ equity excluding preferred stock at the beginning and end of each of the quarters for the period presented divided by (b) the number of quarters in the period presented times two. Adjusted average shareholders’ equity is (a) the sum of total adjusted shareholders’ equity at the beginning and end of each of the quarters for the period presented divided by (b) the number of quarters in the period presented times two.Calculation of Return on Equity and Core Return on EquityThree Months EndedSeptember 30,Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,($ in millions, after-tax)2023202220232022Annualized net income$1,615$1,815$1,820$2,697Average shareholders’ equity20,91621,39021,89224,267Return on equity7.7%8.5%8.3%11.1%Annualized core income$1,818$2,104$1,919$2,917Adjusted average shareholders’ equity26,46326,48126,61326,673Core return on equity6.9%7.9%7.2%10.9%Twelve Months EndedDecember 31,AverageAnnual($ in millions, after-tax)202220212020201920182005 - 2017Net income, less preferred dividends$2,842$3,662$2,697$2,622$2,523$3,072Average shareholders’ equity23,38428,73526,89224,92222,84324,818Return on equity12.2%12.7%10.0%10.5%11.0%12.4%Core income, less preferred dividends$2,998$3,522$2,686$2,537$2,430$3,079Adjusted average shareholders’ equity26,58825,71823,79023,33522,81423,446Core return on equity11.3%13.7%11.3%10.9%10.7%13.1%RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME TO UNDERWRITING GAIN EXCLUDING CERTAIN ITEMSUnderwriting gain (loss) is net earned premiums and fee income less claims and claim adjustment expenses and insurance-related expenses. In the opinion of the Company’s management, it is important to measure the profitability of each segment excluding the results of investing activities, which are managed separately from the insurance business. This measure is used to assess each segment’s business performance and as a tool in making business decisions. Underwriting gain, excluding the impact of catastrophes and net favorable (unfavorable) prior year loss reserve development, is the underwriting gain adjusted to exclude claims and claim adjustment expenses, reinstatement premiums and assessments related to catastrophes and loss reserve development related to time periods prior to the current year. In the opinion of the Company’s management, this measure is meaningful to users of the financial statements to understand the Company’s periodic earnings and the variability of earnings caused by the unpredictable nature (i.e., the timing and amount) of catastrophes and loss reserve development. This measure is also referred to as underlying underwriting gain, underlying underwriting margin, underlying underwriting income or underlying underwriting result.A catastrophe is a severe loss designated a catastrophe by internationally recognized organizations that track and report on insured losses resulting from catastrophic events, such as Property Claim Services (PCS) for events in the United States and Canada. Catastrophes can be caused by various natural events, including, among others, hurricanes, tornadoes and other windstorms, earthquakes, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions and other naturally-occurring events, such as solar flares. Catastrophes can also be man-made, such as terrorist attacks and other intentionally destructive acts including those involving nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological events, cyber events, explosions and destruction of infrastructure. Each catastrophe has unique characteristics and catastrophes are not predictable as to timing or amount. Their effects are included in net and core income and claims and claim adjustment expense reserves upon occurrence. A catastrophe may result in the payment of reinsurance reinstatement premiums and assessments from various pools.The Company’s threshold for disclosing catastrophes is primarily determined at the reportable segment level. If a threshold for one segment or a combination thereof is exceeded and the other segments have losses from the same event, losses from the event are identified as catastrophe losses in the segment results and for the consolidated results of the Company. Additionally, an aggregate threshold is applied for international business across all reportable segments. The threshold for 2023 ranges from $20 million to $30 million of losses before reinsurance and taxes.Net favorable (unfavorable) prior year loss reserve development is the increase or decrease in incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses as a result of the re-estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at successive valuation dates for a given group of claims, which may be related to one or more prior years. In the opinion of the Company’s management, a discussion of loss reserve development is meaningful to users of the financial statements as it allows them to assess the impact between prior and current year development on incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses, net and core income (loss), and changes in claims and claim adjustment expense reserve levels from period to period.Reconciliation of Net Income to Pre-Tax Underlying Underwriting Income (also known as Underlying Underwriting Gain)Three Months EndedSeptember 30,Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,($ in millions, after-tax, except as noted)2023202220232022Net income$404$454$1,365$2,023Net realized investment losses507274165Core income4545261,4392,188Net investment income(640)(505)(1,791)(1,639)Other (income) expense, including interest expense7969237202Underwriting income (loss)(107)90(115)751Income tax expense (benefit) on underwriting results(29)25(294)136Pre-tax underwriting income (loss)(136)115(409)887Pre-tax impact of net (favorable) unfavorable prior year reserve development154(20)(11)(464)Pre-tax impact of catastrophes8505122,8661,418Pre-tax underlying underwriting income$868$607$2,446$1,841Reconciliation of Net Income to After-Tax Underlying Underwriting Income (also known as Underlying Underwriting Gain)Three Months EndedSeptember 30,Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,($ in millions, after-tax)2023202220232022Net income$404$454$1,365$2,023Net realized investment losses507274165Core income4545261,4392,188Net investment income(640)(505)(1,791)(1,639)Other (income) expense, including interest expense7969237202Underwriting income (loss)(107)90(115)751Impact of net (favorable) unfavorable prior year reserve development122(16)(8)(367)Impact of catastrophes6694042,2621,118Underlying underwriting income$684$478$2,139$1,502Twelve Months Ended December 31,($ in millions, after-tax)20222021202020192018201720162015201420132012Net income$2,842$3,662$2,697$2,622$2,523$2,056$3,014$3,439$3,692$3,673$2,473Net realized investment (gains) losses156(132)(11)(85)(93)(142)(47)(2)(51)(106)(32)Impact of changes in tax laws and/or tax rates (1) (2)—(8)———129—————Core income2,9983,5222,6862,5372,4302,0432,9673,4373,6413,5672,441Net investment income(2,170)(2,541)(1,908)(2,097)(2,102)(1,872)(1,846)(1,905)(2,216)(2,186)(2,316)Other (income) expense, including interest expense2772352322142481797819315961171Underwriting income1,1051,2161,0106545763501,1991,7251,5841,442296Impact of net (favorable) unfavorable prior year reserve development(512)(424)(276)47(409)(378)(510)(617)(616)(552)(622)Impact of catastrophes1,4801,4591,2746991,3551,2675763384623871,214Underlying underwriting income$2,073$2,251$2,008$1,400$1,522$1,239$1,265$1,446$1,430$1,277$888(1) Impact is recognized in the accounting period in which the change is enacted(2) 2017 reflects impact of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA)COMBINED RATIO AND ADJUSTMENTS FOR UNDERLYING COMBINED RATIOCombined ratio: For Statutory Accounting Practices (SAP), the combined ratio is the sum of the SAP loss and LAE ratio and the SAP underwriting expense ratio as defined in the statutory financial statements required by insurance regulators. The combined ratio, as used in this earnings release, is the equivalent of, and is calculated in the same manner as, the SAP combined ratio except that the SAP underwriting expense ratio is based on net written premiums and the underwriting expense ratio as used in this earnings release is based on net earned premiums.For SAP, the loss and LAE ratio is the ratio of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses less certain administrative services fee income to net earned premiums as defined in the statutory financial statements required by insurance regulators. The loss and LAE ratio as used in this earnings release is calculated in the same manner as the SAP ratio.For SAP, the underwriting expense ratio is the ratio of underwriting expenses incurred (including commissions paid), less certain administrative services fee income and billing and policy fees and other, to net written premiums as defined in the statutory financial statements required by insurance regulators. The underwriting expense ratio as used in this earnings release, is the ratio of underwriting expenses (including the amortization of deferred acquisition costs), less certain administrative services fee income, billing and policy fees and other, to net earned premiums.The combined ratio, loss and LAE ratio, and underwriting expense ratio are used as indicators of the Company’s underwriting discipline, efficiency in acquiring and servicing its business and overall underwriting profitability. A combined ratio under 100% generally indicates an underwriting profit. A combined ratio over 100% generally indicates an underwriting loss.Underlying combined ratio represents the combined ratio excluding the impact of net prior year reserve development and catastrophes. The underlying combined ratio is an indicator of the Company’s underwriting discipline and underwriting profitability for the current accident year.Other companies’ method of computing similarly titled measures may not be comparable to the Company’s method of computing these ratios.Calculation of the Combined RatioThree Months EndedSeptember 30,Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,($ in millions, pre-tax)2023202220232022Loss and loss adjustment expense ratioClaims and claim adjustment expenses$7,149$6,088$20,335$16,930Less:Policyholder dividends14143631Allocated fee income4238124112Loss ratio numerator$7,093$6,036$20,175$16,787Underwriting expense ratioAmortization of deferred acquisition costs$1,604$1,406$4,585$4,081General and administrative expenses (G&amp;A)1,3121,1933,8873,607Less:Non-insurance G&amp;A9983286252Allocated fee income7066200195Billing and policy fees and other28278481Expense ratio numerator$2,719$2,423$7,902$7,160Earned premium$9,718$8,615$27,788$24,946Combined ratio (1)Loss and loss adjustment expense ratio73.0%70.1%72.6%67.3%Underwriting expense ratio28.0%28.1%28.4%28.7%Combined ratio101.0%98.2%101.0%96.0%Impact on combined ratio:Net (favorable) unfavorable prior year reserve development1.6%(0.2)%(0.1)%(1.9)%Catastrophes, net of reinsurance8.8%5.9%10.3%5.7%Underlying combined ratio90.6%92.5%90.8%92.2%(1) For purposes of computing ratios, billing and policy fees and other (which are a component of other revenues) are allocated as a reduction of underwriting expenses. In addition, fee income is allocated as a reduction of losses and loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses. These allocations are to conform the calculation of the combined ratio with statutory accounting. Additionally, general and administrative expenses include non-insurance expenses that are excluded from underwriting expenses, and accordingly are excluded in calculating the combined ratio.RECONCILIATION OF BOOK VALUE PER SHARE AND SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY TO CERTAIN NON-GAAP MEASURESBook value per share is total common shareholders’ equity divided by the number of common shares outstanding. Adjusted book value per share is total common shareholders’ equity excluding net unrealized investment gains and losses, net of tax, included in shareholders’ equity, divided by the number of common shares outstanding. In the opinion of the Company’s management, adjusted book value per share is useful in an analysis of a property casualty company’s book value per share as it removes the effect of changing prices on invested assets (i.e., net unrealized investment gains (losses), net of tax), which do not have an equivalent impact on unpaid claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. Tangible book value per share is adjusted book value per share excluding the after-tax value of goodwill and other intangible assets divided by the number of common shares outstanding. In the opinion of the Company’s management, tangible book value per share is useful in an analysis of a property casualty company’s book value on a nominal basis as it removes certain effects of purchase accounting (i.e., goodwill and other intangible assets), in addition to the effect of changing prices on invested assets.Reconciliation of Shareholders’ Equity to Tangible Shareholders’ Equity, Excluding Net Unrealized Investment Losses, Net of Tax and Calculation of Book Value Per Share, Adjusted Book Value Per Share and Tangible Book Value Per ShareAs of($ in millions, except per share amounts)September 30, 2023December 31, 2022September 30, 2022Shareholders’ equity$19,978$21,560$19,906Less: Net unrealized investment losses, net of tax, included in shareholders’ equity(6,466)(4,898)(6,317)Shareholders’ equity, excluding net unrealized investment losses, net of tax, included in shareholders’ equity26,44426,45826,223Less:Goodwill3,9553,9523,922Other intangible assets278287287Impact of deferred tax on other intangible assets(64)(60)(54)Tangible shareholders’ equity, excluding net unrealized investment losses, net of tax, included in shareholders’ equity$22,275$22,279$22,068Common shares outstanding228.4232.1234.3Book value per share$87.47$92.90$84.94Adjusted book value per share115.78114.00111.90Tangible book value per share, excluding net unrealized investment losses, net of tax, included in shareholders’ equity97.5396.0094.17RECONCILIATION OF TOTAL CAPITALIZATION TO TOTAL CAPITALIZATION EXCLUDING NET UNREALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES), NET OF TAXTotal capitalization is the sum of total shareholders’ equity and debt.

Net written premiums reflect gross written premiums less premiums ceded to reinsurers.For Business Insurance and Bond &amp; Specialty Insurance, retention is the amount of premium available for renewal that was retained, excluding rate and exposure changes. For Personal Insurance, retention is the ratio of the expected number of renewal policies that will be retained throughout the annual policy period to the number of available renewal base policies. For all of the segments, renewal rate change represents the estimated change in average premium on policies that renew, excluding exposure changes. Exposure is the measure of risk used in the pricing of an insurance product. The change in exposure is the amount of change in premium on policies that renew attributable to the change in portfolio risk. Renewal premium change represents the estimated change in average premium on policies that renew, including rate and exposure changes. New business is the amount of written premium related to new policyholders and additional products sold to existing policyholders. These are operating statistics, which are in part dependent on the use of estimates and are therefore subject to change. For Business Insurance, retention, renewal premium change and new business exclude National Accounts. For Bond &amp; Specialty Insurance, retention, renewal premium change and new business exclude surety and other products that are generally sold on a non-recurring, project specific basis. For each of the segments, production statistics referred to herein are domestic only unless otherwise indicated.Statutory capital and surplus represents the excess of an insurance company’s admitted assets over its liabilities, including loss reserves, as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices.Holding company liquidity is the total funds available at the holding company level to fund general corporate purposes, primarily the payment of shareholder dividends and debt service.

The focal point of the electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer’s earnings release will be its vehicle production and deliveries. Though third-quarter deliveries beat our model estimates, they declined sequentially.Notably, Tesla surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing 10 quarters. Will it be able to maintain the beat streak this time? Before we delve into the factors that are set to shape its upcoming results, here’s a brief snapshot of its second-quarter 2023 earnings report.(Also read: Here's What to Expect From Tesla This Earnings Season)Q2 HighlightsTesla reported second-quarter 2023 earnings of 91 cents per share, which rose from the year-ago figure of 76 cents and outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 83 cents. This marked the 10th consecutive earnings beat for the company. Record deliveries and revenues, which topped expectations, resulted in this outperformance. Total revenues came in at $24,927 million, witnessing year-over-year growth of 47%. The top line exceeded the consensus mark of $24,884 million.Tesla’s second-quarter production totaled 479,700 units (460,211 Model 3/Y, and 19,489 Model S/X), up 86% year over year and surpassing our estimate of 452,602 units. Deliveries also exceeded our forecast on stronger-than-expected demand despite high interest rates. Tesla offered discounts and other incentives in the United States to increase affordability, which translated to robust deliveries. Additionally, all trims of the Model 3/Y vehicles qualified for the full $7,500 federal tax credit under the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States during the second quarter, which bolstered sales. The company delivered 466,140 vehicles, reflecting a year-over-year jump of 83% and topping our estimate of 434,736 units.Tesla had cash/cash equivalents and long-term debt and finance leases of $23,075 million and $872 million, respectively, as of Jun 30, 2022. The firm generated a free cash flow of $1,005 million during second-quarter 2023, which surged 62% year over year.Story continuesQ3 Deliveries Rise Y/Y But Fall Q/QAfter achieving record deliveries in the first two quarters of 2023, Tesla experienced a sequential decline in its third-quarter deliveries. The company delivered a total of 435,059 vehicles worldwide in the third quarter, surpassing our model estimate of 428,141 and representing a 26.5% increase compared to the previous year. Nevertheless, these deliveries marked a 6.6% sequential decrease from 446,140 vehicles delivered in the second quarter of 2023 due to planned factory shutdowns for an upgrade.Tesla’s models 3 and Y are the company’s most successful EVs, accounting for most of its sales. For the quarter, Tesla delivered 419,074 of those, surpassing our forecast of 411,075 units. Also, third-quarter 2023 deliveries of models S and X came in at 15,985 units, lower than our estimate of 17,066 units.As for production, Tesla produced 430,488 (416,800 Model 3/Y, and 13,688 Model S/X) vehicles during the quarter, up 17.6% on a yearly basis but down from 479,700 units produced in the second quarter of 2023. The metric, however, topped our projection of 415,645 units.We expect total automotive revenues of around $21,092 million, which marks a 12.8% increase year over year but a decline from $21,268 million in the second quarter of 2023.Additionally, Tesla slashed prices on its inventory vehicles and existing models throughout the third quarter, which is expected to have put pressure on its gross margins. We expect gross profit from the automotive segment to decline 26.4% year over year and 6.5% sequentially.Our projection for TSLA’s third-quarter automotive gross margin stands at 18.2%, implying a decline of 1 percentage point from the second quarter of 2023 and 9.7 percentage points on a yearly basis.Overall Earnings &amp; Revenue ProjectionsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Tesla as it doesn’t have the right combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.The company has an Earnings ESP of -2.74% as the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged 2 cents lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Tesla currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings is pegged at 73 cents per share, indicating a contraction of 30.5% on a year-over-year basis. The consensus mark has moved south by 5 cents a share over the past 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24.38 billion for sales indicates a 13.64% rise on a year-over-year basis.Stocks With the Favorable CombinationWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for Tesla, here are a few players from the auto space, which, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat for the quarter to be reported:PACCAR PCAR will release third-quarter 2023 results on Oct 24.

(AP) — Disney attorneys want to question a previous administrator of the governing district that provides municipal services to Walt Disney World as part of its defense against a state lawsuit brought by a board made up of appointees of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.Disney attorneys said in court papers Monday that they have subpoenaed John Classe, the former administrator of what was previously called the Reedy Creek Improvement District for 55 years until it was renamed the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District earlier this year during a takeover by DeSantis and the Republican-controlled Florida Legislature. The takeover of the district, which was previously controlled by Disney allies, came after the company publicly opposed a state law banning classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades.Following the takeover, Classe was replaced by DeSantis ally, Glen Gilzean.Classe was in charge of the district when the governing body signed agreements with Disney which shifted control over design and construction at Disney World to the company and prohibited the district from using the likeness of Disney characters or other intellectual property without Disney’s permission. The agreements were signed in February before the district takeover by the DeSantis appointees, who claim the contracts neutered their powers. The appointees are now suing Disney in state court in an attempt to void the deals.Among the records the Disney attorneys are seeking from Classe are documents used to adopt the contracts, documents that support the district's authority to enter the contracts and information about how the agreements were publicized, according to the court documents filed Monday. One of the arguments the DeSantis appointees make about why the agreements should be voided is that they weren't properly publicized.Disney has filed counterclaims in the state lawsuit which include asking the state court to declare the agreements valid and enforceable. Disney has sent a notice to DeSantis’ office demanding internal communications, including text messages and emails, and documents. DeSantis currently is running for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination.Story continuesDisney and DeSantis and his allies also are battling in federal court, where the company has sued DeSantis, claiming the governor violated its free speech rights by punishing it for expressing opposition to the law. DeSantis and the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District have asked a federal judge to throw out Disney’s First Amendment lawsuit, calling it meritless.___Follow Mike Schneider on X, formerly known as Twitter: @MikeSchneiderAP.]"

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Right now, Hawaiian Electric is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Exelon has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that HE has an improving earnings outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.HE currently has a forward P/E ratio of 7.34, while EXC has a forward P/E of 17.07. We also note that HE has a PEG ratio of 1.76. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. EXC currently has a PEG ratio of 2.71.Another notable valuation metric for HE is its P/B ratio of 0.61. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, EXC has a P/B of 1.59.Based on these metrics and many more, HE holds a Value grade of A, while EXC has a Value grade of C.Story continuesHE sticks out from EXC in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that HE is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

328,48ed3df3-3ed2-3d74-a7ed-60b5dbab4317,OKE,2023-10-18,Here's Why We Think ONEOK (NYSE:OKE) Is Well Worth Watching,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-think-oneok-nyse-120043374.html,1697544043,STORY,['OKE'],"[Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like ONEOK (NYSE:OKE). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide ONEOK with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. View our latest analysis for ONEOK How Fast Is ONEOK Growing?Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Recognition must be given to the that ONEOK has grown EPS by 41% per year, over the last three years. While that sort of growth rate isn't sustainable for long, it certainly catches the eye of prospective investors.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Unfortunately, ONEOK's revenue dropped 10% last year, but the silver lining is that EBIT margins improved from 12% to 19%. That falls short of ideal.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of ONEOK's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Story continuesAre ONEOK Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Investors are always searching for a vote of confidence in the companies they hold and insider buying is one of the key indicators for optimism on the market. Because often, the purchase of stock is a sign that the buyer views it as undervalued. However, small purchases are not always indicative of conviction, and insiders don't always get it right.The good news is that ONEOK insiders spent a whopping US$1.8m on stock in just one year, without so much as a single sale. The shareholders within the general public should find themselves expectant and certainly hopeful, that this large outlay signals prescient optimism for the business. We also note that it was the President, Pierce Norton, who made the biggest single acquisition, paying US$1.5m for shares at about US$60.96 each.On top of the insider buying, it's good to see that ONEOK insiders have a valuable investment in the business. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$212m. This comes in at 0.5% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.While insiders are apparently happy to hold and accumulate shares, that is just part of the big picture. That's because on our analysis the CEO, Pierce Norton, is paid less than the median for similar sized companies. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like ONEOK, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$12m.The ONEOK CEO received US$8.1m in compensation for the year ending December 2022. That comes in below the average for similar sized companies and seems pretty reasonable. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when it's reasonable, that gives a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.Does ONEOK Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?ONEOK's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. What's more, insiders own a significant stake in the company and have been buying more shares. This quick rundown suggests that the business may be of good quality, and also at an inflection point, so maybe ONEOK deserves timely attention. It's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 3 warning signs  with ONEOK , and understanding these should be part of your investment process.There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. So if you like the sound of ONEOK, you'll probably love this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

The comparatively higher provisions for credit losses in the most recent two quarters compared with the third quarter of 2022 reflect a softening of commercial real estate values. Net charge-offs totaled $96 million in 2023's third quarter, compared with $127 million in 2023's second quarter and $63 million in the year-earlier quarter reflective of variability in the timing and amount of commercial real estate charge-offs.Nonaccrual loans were $2.34 billion at September 30, 2023, $94 million lower than June 30, 2023 and $87 million lower than September 30, 2022. Those declines are reflective of lower levels of hospitality-related commercial real estate nonaccrual loans. Noninterest IncomeChange3Q23 vs.Change3Q23 vs.($ in millions)3Q232Q232Q233Q223Q22Mortgage banking revenues$105$107-2%$8326%Service charges on deposit accounts1211192%1155%Trust income155172-10%187-17%Brokerage services income27257%2128%Trading account and non-hedging derivative gains917-44%585%Gain (loss) on bank investment securities—1—(1)—Other revenues from operations143362-61%153-7%Total$560$803-30%$563-1%Noninterest income in the third quarter of 2023 decreased $244 million, or 30%, as compared with 2023's second quarter.Other revenues from operations decreased $219 million reflecting a $225 million gain on sale of the Company's Collective Investment Trust (""CIT"") business in the second quarter of 2023.Trust income declined $17 million, predominantly reflective of one month of revenues associated with the CIT business recognized prior to its sale in the second quarter of 2023.Trading account and non-hedging derivative gains decreased $7 million from the second quarter due to a decline in customer interest rate swap revenues and market conditions.Noninterest income decreased $3 million, or less than 1%, as compared with the year-earlier third quarter.Trust income decreased $31 million reflecting lower revenues associated with the CIT business as a result of its sale in April 2023.Other revenues from operations declined $11 million due to lower insurance income reflecting the sale of M&amp;T Insurance Agency in December 2022.Mortgage banking revenues increased $21 million due to higher servicing income related to the bulk purchase of residential mortgage loan servicing rights in the first quarter of 2023 and higher gains on sales of residential mortgage loans. The Company returned to originating for sale the majority of its newly originated residential mortgage loans in the first quarter of 2023.  Noninterest ExpenseChange3Q23 vs.Change3Q23 vs.($ in millions)3Q232Q232Q233Q223Q22Salaries and employee benefits$727$738-1%$736-1%Equipment and net occupancy1311292%1273%Outside data processing and software1111064%9516%FDIC assessments29285%284%Advertising and marketing2328-19%217%Printing, postage and supplies1414-2%15-5%Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets1515—18-19%Other costs of operations228235-3%239-4%Total$1,278$1,293-1%$1,279—Noninterest expense aggregated $1.28 billion in the recent quarter, down from $1.29 billion in the second quarter of 2023.

Noninterest operating expenses aggregated $1.21 billion in the third quarter of 2022 after excluding $53 million of merger-related expenses associated with the People's United acquisition and $18 million of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets. Noninterest operating expenses increased $55 million, or 5%, from the prior year third quarter inclusive of the following:Other costs of operations increased $23 million resulting from the amortization of the bulk purchase of residential mortgage loan servicing rights purchased in March 2023 and losses associated with certain retail banking activities, partially offset by lower professional and other outside services expenses reflecting lower sub-advisory fees as a result of the sale of the CIT business.Outside data processing and software costs increased $18 million, or 19%, primarily due to higher software maintenance costs, offshore processing and data processing fees.  Average Earning AssetsChange3Q23 vs.Change3Q23 vs.($ in millions)3Q232Q232Q233Q223Q22Interest-bearing deposits at banks$26,657$23,61713%$30,752-13%Federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities———29-100%Trading account136151-9%1314%Investment securities27,99328,623-2%23,94517%Loans and leases, net of unearned discountCommercial, financial, etc.44,62544,531—38,32116%Real estate - commercial44,23044,944-2%46,282-4%Real estate - consumer23,57323,781-1%22,9623%Consumer20,18920,289—19,9601%Total loans and leases, net132,617133,545-1%127,5254%Total earning assets$187,403$185,9361%$182,3823%Average earning assets increased $1.5 billion, or 1%, from the second quarter of 2023.Average interest-bearing deposits at banks increased $3.0 billion due to increased liquidity from a rise in average deposits and a decline in average loan and investment securities balances.Average loans and leases decreased $928 million primarily reflective of a $714 million decline in average balances of commercial real estate loans.Average investment securities declined $630 million primarily due to pay downs of fixed rate mortgage-backed securities.Average earning assets increased $5.0 billion, or 3%, from the year-earlier third quarter.Average loans and leases increased $5.1 billion predominantly due to higher average outstanding balances of commercial and industrial loans and leases reflecting lending activities to financial and insurance industry customers and motor vehicle and recreational finance dealers, partially offset by a $2.1 billion decline in average commercial real estate loans.Average investment securities increased $4.0 billion due to the purchases of additional investment securities in the fourth quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023.Average interest-bearing deposits at banks decreased $4.1 billion reflecting lower deposits, incremental loan balances and purchases of investment securities, partially offset by higher borrowings.  Average Interest-bearing LiabilitiesChange3Q23 vs.Change3Q23 vs.($ in millions)3Q232Q232Q233Q223Q22Interest-bearing depositsSavings and interest-checking deposits$89,274$87,2102%$89,360—Time deposits19,52816,00922%5,050287%Total interest-bearing deposits108,802103,2195%94,41015%Short-term borrowings5,3467,539-29%913485%Long-term borrowings7,2407,516-4%3,281121%Total interest-bearing liabilities$121,388$118,2743%$98,60423%Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $3.1 billion, or 3%, from the second quarter of 2023.Average interest-bearing deposits increased $5.6 billion, including a $3.3 billion increase in average non-brokered deposits.Average borrowings decreased $2.5 billion predominantly due to lower levels of short-term borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank (""FHLB"") of New York.Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $22.8 billion, or 23%, from the third quarter of 2022.Average interest-bearing deposits increased $14.4 billion, including a $5.3 billion increase in average non-brokered deposits.Average borrowings increased $8.4 billion predominantly due to issuances of long-term senior notes totaling $3.5 billion in the first quarter of 2023 and increases in short-term borrowings from the FHLB of New York.  Capital3Q232Q233Q22CET110.94%(1)10.59%10.75%Tier 1 capital12.27%(1)11.91%12.13%Total capital13.99%(1)13.71%13.96%Tangible capital – common7.78%7.63%7.70%(1)September 30, 2023 capital ratios are estimated.M&amp;T's capital ratios remained well above the minimum set forth by regulatory requirements.

We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Akamai Technologies'  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Akamai Technologies How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Akamai Technologies is:11% = US$478m ÷ US$4.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.11.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of Akamai Technologies' Earnings Growth And 11% ROETo begin with, Akamai Technologies seems to have a respectable ROE. Be that as it may, the company's ROE is still quite lower than the industry average of 16%. Akamai Technologies was still able to see a decent net income growth of 12% over the past five years. We reckon that there could be other factors at play here. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place. However, not to forget, the company does have a decent ROE to begin with, just that it is lower than the industry average. So this also does lend some color to the fairly high earnings growth seen by the company.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Akamai Technologies' net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 23% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for AKAM? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Akamai Technologies Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Akamai Technologies doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which explains the fair bit of earnings growth the company has seen.ConclusionIn total, it does look like Akamai Technologies has some positive aspects to its business. Particularly, its earnings have grown respectably as we saw earlier, which was likely achieved due to the company reinvesting most of its earnings at a decent rate of return, to grow its business. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. With that in mind, we've noticed some promising trends at Helmerich &amp; Payne (NYSE:HP) so let's look a bit deeper.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Helmerich &amp; Payne, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.13 = US$512m ÷ (US$4.3b - US$433m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).So, Helmerich &amp; Payne has an ROCE of 13%.  That's a pretty standard return and it's in line with the industry average of 13%. See our latest analysis for Helmerich &amp; Payne roceIn the above chart we have measured Helmerich &amp; Payne's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Helmerich &amp; Payne.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsWe're pretty happy with how the ROCE has been trending at Helmerich &amp; Payne. We found that the returns on capital employed over the last five years have risen by 35,897%. The company is now earning US$0.1 per dollar of capital employed. Interestingly, the business may be becoming more efficient because it's applying 34% less capital than it was five years ago. If this trend continues, the business might be getting more efficient but it's shrinking in terms of total assets.Story continuesOur Take On Helmerich &amp; Payne's ROCEFrom what we've seen above, Helmerich &amp; Payne has managed to increase it's returns on capital all the while reducing it's capital base. And since the stock has fallen 11% over the last five years, there might be an opportunity here. With that in mind, we believe the promising trends warrant this stock for further investigation.On a final note, we've found   1 warning sign for Helmerich &amp; Payne  that we think you should be aware of.While Helmerich &amp; Payne isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

Annualized SaaS revenues increased 11% and represented 37% of ARR.Anti-Financial Crime revenue increased 21% compared to the third quarter of 2022.

Other revenues include revenues associated with the European power trading and clearing business which is pending sale. Adena Friedman, Chair and CEO said, “Our third quarter 2023 results reflect Nasdaq’s solid execution amid a continued dynamic economic and capital markets backdrop. We experienced some improvement in the IPO environment by welcoming marquee IPOs, we continued to broaden our Anti-Financial Crime clientele, and we introduced new innovations to our products and services.Story continuesWe have completed the antitrust review process for our announced acquisition of Adenza and we expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter of 2023. With Adenza, we are excited to deepen our client relationships as we expand our role as a leading financial technology provider to the global financial system.”Ann Dennison, Executive Vice President and CFO said, “We delivered broad-based revenue growth in the third quarter and had particularly strong performance in our Index and Anti-Financial Crime businesses.With our continued strong cash flows, we are fully prepared to execute our capital plan to pay down debt, continue to increase our dividend, and repurchase shares in the coming quarters to achieve our financial goals with the announced Adenza acquisition.”FINANCIAL REVIEWThird quarter 2023 net revenues were $940 million, an increase of $50 million, or 6%, from $890 million in the prior year period. Net revenues reflected a $47 million, or 5%, positive impact from organic growth, including positive contributions from all Solutions Businesses and a $4 million increase from the impact of changes in FX rates, partially offset by a $1 million decrease from the impact of a divestiture.Solutions Businesses revenues were $694 million in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of $55 million, or 9% with organic growth of 8%. ARR, which reflects the majority of the Solutions Businesses revenues and excludes the AUM and transaction licensing components of our Index business, increased 6% from the prior year period.Trading Services net revenues were $236 million in the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of $3 million, or 1%. The decrease reflects a 2% organic decline, partially offset by a positive impact from changes in FX rates.Third quarter 2023 GAAP operating expenses increased $17 million, or 3%, versus the prior year period. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher restructuring expenses associated with the launch of our divisional alignment program in the fourth quarter of 2022, higher employee compensation costs, and an increase in computer operations and data expense partially offset by lower general and administrative expense and a decline in merger and strategic initiatives costs.Third quarter 2023 non-GAAP operating expenses increased $32 million, or 8% versus the prior year period. The increase primarily reflects increased expenses associated with the continued investment in our people and our businesses to drive long term growth, higher computer operations and data costs and increased general and administrative expense.The company returned $108 million to shareholders through dividends, and did not repurchase any shares in the third quarter of 2023. As of September 30, 2023, there was $2.0 billion remaining under the board authorized share repurchase program, following an approval by Nasdaq’s board of directors in September 2023 to increase the authorized amount of the share repurchase program to an aggregate of $2.0 billion.2023 EXPENSE AND TAX GUIDANCE UPDATE5The company is updating its 2023 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to a range of $1,785 million to $1,805 million and its 2023 non-GAAP tax rate guidance to be in the range of 24.5% to 25.5%.STRATEGIC AND BUSINESS UPDATESNasdaq made strong progress in completing the acquisition of Adenza. Nasdaq reached an important milestone in the acquisition of Adenza with the completion of the antitrust review process for the transaction. Nasdaq expects to close the deal in the fourth quarter of 2023 as it expands its capabilities in solving its customers largest challenges.Nasdaq expanded its portfolio of market-based solutions to support clients' ability to execute on their environmental sustainability strategies. Nasdaq launched Nasdaq Metrio and Nasdaq eVestment ESG Analytics, designed to enable greater visibility in environmental sustainability metrics and disclosure for corporates, asset owners, and asset managers. Nasdaq’s majority-owned Puro.earth platform, a leading platform for engineered carbon removal, announced a partnership with Xpansiv, in which Puro.earth's CO2 removal certificates (CORCs) would be listed for trading on Xpansiv's spot marketplace​, CBL. Anti-Financial Crime achieves continued strong revenue growth. Nasdaq is partnering with a growing number of financial institutions to manage the increasing risks and complexity of financial crime. Surveillance solutions delivered solid growth in new Trade Surveillance customers while Verafin signed 47 new small and medium customers and had an expansion with an existing Tier 2 customer who adopted our complex investigations solution. Index performance a primary contributor to top-line growth in the quarter. Index revenues increased 15% year-over-year and reflect growth in average AUM in products linked to Nasdaq-100 Indexes and options-based strategies. AUM growth resulted from the combination of strong market performance and $24 billion in net inflows in the trailing-twelve-month period, including $5 billion in net inflows in the third quarter.Nasdaq achieved a new record for third quarter U.S. cash equities closing cross volumes. U.S. cash equities revenue and revenue capture benefited from third quarter closing cross volumes, including a special rebalance of Nasdaq-100 that had approximately 500 million shares and $70 billion notional traded.Nasdaq maintained its listings leadership in the U.S and launched a revamped MarketSite. Nasdaq led U.S. exchanges for operating company IPOs with a 84% total win rate during the first nine months of 2023 and has a growing pipeline of companies on file to list on Nasdaq. Year to date through the third quarter, four of the five largest U.S. operating company IPOs by capital raised chose to list with Nasdaq. Seven companies switched to Nasdaq in the third quarter, including Roper Technologies and DoorDash. Nasdaq hosted these leading company listing events at its newly revamped MarketSite in Times Square. The new space includes a state-of-the-art broadcast and production studio and a dedicated IPO Center for first trade celebrations. Nasdaq continued its innovation in AI and received regulatory approval for its first AI-powered order type​. In September, Nasdaq received SEC approval to launch Dynamic Midpoint Extended Life Order (M-ELO). Dynamic M-ELO uses an AI model to monitor real-time changes to holding periods for M-ELO participants and in testing has achieved an over 30% improvement in average combined volume-weighted order fill rates.____________1 Represents revenues less transaction-based expenses.2 Constitutes revenues from our Capital Access Platforms and Anti-Financial Crime segments and Marketplace Technology business within Market Platforms.3 Refer to our reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP net income, diluted earnings per share, operating income, operating expenses and organic impacts included in the attached schedules.4 Annualized Recurring Revenue (ARR) for a given period is the annualized revenue derived from subscription contracts with a defined contract value. This excludes contracts that are not recurring, are one-time in nature or where the contract value fluctuates based on defined metrics. ARR is currently one of our key performance metrics to assess the health and trajectory of our recurring business. ARR does not have any standardized definition and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those items. ARR is not a forecast and the active contracts at the end of a reporting period used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers.5 U.S. GAAP operating expense and tax rate guidance are not provided due to the inherent difficulty in quantifying certain amounts due to a variety of factors including the unpredictability in the movement in foreign currency rates, as well as future charges or reversals outside of the normal course of business.ABOUT NASDAQNasdaq (Nasdaq: NDAQ) is a global technology company serving corporate clients, investment managers, banks, brokers, and exchange operators as they navigate and interact with the global capital markets and the broader financial system.

Management uses this non-GAAP information internally, along with U.S. GAAP information, in evaluating our performance and in making financial and operational decisions. We believe our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and supplemental data relating to our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of results as the items described below in the reconciliation tables do not reflect ongoing operating performance.These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, U.S. GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate such measures differently, which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. This information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant as a substitute for our operating results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We recommend investors review the U.S. GAAP financial measures included in this earnings release. When viewed in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide greater transparency and a more complete understanding of factors affecting our business than U.S. GAAP measures alone.We understand that analysts and investors regularly rely on non-GAAP financial measures, such as those noted above, to assess operating performance. We use these measures because they highlight trends more clearly in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on U.S. GAAP financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our ongoing operating performance.Organic revenue and expense growth, organic change and organic impact are non-GAAP measures that reflect adjustments for: (i) the impact of period-over-period changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and (ii) the revenues, expenses and operating income associated with acquisitions and divestitures for the twelve month period following the date of the acquisition or divestiture. Reconciliations of these measures are described within the body of this release or in the reconciliation tables at the end of this release.Foreign exchange impact: In countries with currencies other than the U.S. dollar, revenues and expenses are translated using monthly average exchange rates. Certain discussions in this release isolate the impact of year-over-year foreign currency fluctuations to better measure the comparability of operating results between periods. Operating results excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations are calculated by translating the current period’s results by the prior period’s exchange rates.Divisional alignment program: In October 2022, following our September announcement to realign our segments and leadership, we initiated a divisional alignment program with a focus on realizing the full potential of this structure. In connection with the program, we expect to incur pre-tax charges principally related to employee-related costs, consulting, asset impairments and contract terminations over a two-year period. We expect to achieve benefits in the form of both increased customer engagement and operating efficiencies. Costs related to the divisional alignment program will be recorded as “restructuring” in our consolidated statements of income. We will exclude charges associated with this program for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures as they are not reflective of ongoing operating performance or comparisons in Nasdaq's performance between periods.CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSInformation set forth in this communication contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Nasdaq cautions readers that any forward-looking information is not a guarantee of future performance and that actual results could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking information.

These factors include, but are not limited to, Nasdaq’s ability to implement its strategic initiatives, economic, political and market conditions and fluctuations, geopolitical instability, government and industry regulation, interest rate risk, U.S. and global competition. Additionally, with respect to Nasdaq’s proposed acquisition of Adenza, these risks and uncertainties include Nasdaq’s ability to secure regulatory approvals on the terms expected, in a timely manner or at all, Nasdaq’s ability to successfully integrate Adenza’s operations, Nasdaq’s ability to implement its plans, forecasts and other expectations with respect to Adenza’s business after the completion of the transaction and realize expected synergies, the ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the proposed transaction, including the possibility that the expected benefits from the proposed transaction will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period, the impact of Adenza’s business model on Nasdaq’s ability to forecast revenue results, disruption from the transaction making it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships, risks related to diverting management’s attention from Nasdaq’s ongoing business operations, the negative effects of the announcement or the consummation of the proposed transaction on the market price of Nasdaq’s common stock or on Nasdaq’s operating results, significant transaction costs, unknown liabilities, the risk of litigation or regulatory actions related to the proposed transaction, future levels of Nasdaq’s indebtedness, including additional indebtedness that will be incurred in connection with the proposed transaction, and the effect of the announcement or pendency of the transaction on Adenza’s business relationships, operating results, and business generally. Further information on these and other factors are detailed in Nasdaq’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including its annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q which are available on Nasdaq’s investor relations website at http://ir.nasdaq.com and the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.

338,e6c5d0e0-56cc-3de0-911d-fb3ec84f3f20,CL,2023-10-18,"Oil prices surge, Brent near $92 as Israel-Hamas tensions worsen",Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-prices-surge-brent-near-203907906.html,1697575147,STORY,"['UCO', 'NYF', 'CL', 'SCO', 'CL=F']","[Investing.com - After another uncertain start to a week, oil bulls got a reversal of fortunes again as crude prices jumped 2% Wednesday on government data showing a weekly drop in both US crude and fuel stockpiles.The bombing of a Gaza hospital filled with hundreds of Palestinians also repriced political risk into crude, with analysts citing as many uncertainties about the movement of oil from and around the Middle East versus the fact that the warring parties themselves weren’t major producers or shippers of the commodity.New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude for delivery in November settled up $1.66, or almost 2%, at $88.32 per barrel. The US crude benchmark dipped 0.9% on Monday and settled Tuesday flat after a near 6% climb last week.London-traded Brent crude for the most-active December contract finished Wednesday’s session at $91.50, up $1.60, or 1.8%. It finished the first two days of this down by a net 1.1%. Last week, the global crude benchmark gained 7.5%.Two wars supporting crude prices, in a season known for weak oil demand The Israel-Hamas war has given a new impetus to the oil trade in the fall, or autumn, season, which is typically known for weak oil demand. The 20-month old Ukraine war also remains supportive to crude market sentiment in a smaller way despite the sanctions on Russian oil.“It is clear that now that we have two wars that are putting oil supplies at risk, which means European and Asian buyers will become more interested with US crude,” said Ed Moya, analyst at online trading platform OANDA.The crude export component was what led to the supportive weekly inventory data released by the US Energy (NASDAQ:USEG) Information Administration, or EIA.Crude stockpiles in the United States fell by 4.5 million barrels last week as exports accelerated from overseas market share gained by US oil firms, while supply cuts by OPEC+ resulted in lesser imports, a government report showed Wednesday.Story continuesDeclines were also recorded in inventories of gasoline, the premier US fuel product, and distillates — a raw material for diesel and heating fuel, the Weekly Petroleum Status Report of the Energy Information Administration, or EIA, showed.Typically at this time of year, demand for fuels is softer in the United States as fewer families do road trips, with children back in school or college. But with the US refining industry on one of its seasonal maintenance periods, larger-than-usual declines in fuel stocks aren’t unusual either with limited replenishments coming in.US crude and fuel stockpiles down across the boardThe US crude inventory balance fell by 4.491 million barrels during the week ended October 13, according to the EIA. That contrasted with a 10.176 million jump in the prior week to October 6, led largely by a sharp decline in exports.In the latest week though, crude exports regained their mantle to reach 5.301 million barrels versus the prior daily rate of 3.067 million.Imports, meanwhile, fell 387,000 barrels per day, amounting to a weekly total of 2.709 million.OPEC+ is a 23-nation alliance that groups the 13-member Saudi-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries with 10 independent oil producers that include Russia.Moscow and Riyadh announced previously that they would hold back a joint 1.3 million barrels per day of their regular production till the end of the year, with 300,000 of that coming from Russia and the balance 1.0 million from the Saudis. The OPEC+ cutbacks have allowed US oil exports to make inroads into markets underserved by the Saudi-Russian cuts.“Within this bullish story for oil is a bearish story of less market share growth for the Saudi and Russian crude versus US,” said John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital.Russia’s unwillingness to commit to how much oil it may produce from November onwards is also raising questions on how well the OPEC+ collaboration is working out for Vladimir Putin’s government.Moscow and Riyadh announced previously that they would hold back a joint 1.3 million barrels per day of their regular production till the end of the year, with 300,000 of that coming from Russia and the balance 1.0 million from the Saudis. But supply deficiencies within Russia and the Kremlin’s need to maximize oil revenues — despite a 30% gain in crude prices in the third quarter — could force Moscow to revisit those plans, say those in the know.Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak reinforced those suspicions when he told reporters on Tuesday that “it is still too early to talk about (an) OPEC+ decision in November”. To add to the trade’s consternation, Russia’s central bank has also announced that OPEC+, at its next meeting, will discuss a possible oil output increase in early 2024“ in the event that global oil deficit worsens”.Aside from the headline draw for US crude reported by the EIA for the week ended Oct. 13, the agency also noted a 758,000-barrel decline at the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery point for crude committed to exchange-traded futures contracts, on top of the previous week’s draw of 547,000.That was the lowest for Cushing storage levels since October 2014, historical EIA data showed. Oil held in Cushing has dropped sharply this year, prompting concerns that it might reach such critical lows to complicate operations at the storage hub.On the fuel side, the EIA reported a gasoline inventory slide of 2.37 million barrels and distillates stockpile drop of 3.185 barrels. In the prior week, gasoline saw a 1.3134-million barrel build while distillates experienced a 1.837 million drop.(Ambar Warrick contributed to this item)Related ArticlesOil up 2% on US crude draw, Middle East risk after Gaza hospital blastOil up about 2% on big US crude storage draw, Middle East tensionUS invests $3.5 billion to bolster power grid, deploy clean energy]"
339,5d48303e-bcb5-3786-b6b7-6e666457ad23,CL,2023-10-18,Will Smoke-Free Products Fuel Philip Morris' (PM) Q3 Earnings?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smoke-free-products-fuel-philip-124700465.html,1697546820,STORY,"['PM', 'SAM', 'CL']","[Philip Morris International Inc. PM is ready to report third-quarter 2023 earnings on Oct 19. It is worth taking a closer look at the company’s smoke-free product business, which constituted 35.4% of its net revenues in the second quarter of 2023. We believe the smoke-free product segment is likely to have played a key role in determining Philip Morris’ performance in the quarter under review.Smoke-Free Products’ Prospects Look PromisingGrowing inclination toward health and wellness has pushed consumers toward low-risk, reduced-risk products (RRPs). Philip Morris has been progressing well with its business transformation. PM is well-placed to become a majority smoke-free company by 2025. To this end, the company’s IQOS, a heat-not-burn device, counts among one of the leading RRPs in the industry. These high-quality next-generation devices have been aiding adult smokers in switching from traditional cigarettes to smoke-free options.In the second quarter of 2023, revenues from smoke-free products (excluding Wellness and Healthcare) jumped 35.3% to $3,101 million (up 18.3% organically). In the quarter, Philip Morris witnessed continued strength in IQOS performance and pricing power. Total IQOS users at the end of the second quarter were estimated at roughly 27.2 million (including nearly 19.4 million who switched to IQOS and stopped smoking).Philip Morris International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePhilip Morris International Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Philip Morris International Inc. QuoteFor the third quarter, management expects heated tobacco unit (HTU) shipment volumes of 31-33 billion units. We expect a 26.1% jump in smoke-free product revenues (excluding Wellness and Healthcare) in the third quarter. Further, our model suggests total HTU shipment volume growth of 17.9% to 32.4 billion units in the third quarter.Speaking of the Wellness and Healthcare unit, Philip Morris’ buyouts of Vectura Group plc, Fertin Pharma A/S and OtiTopic were consolidated to form a Wellness and Healthcare category on Mar 31, 2022. Management expects net revenues of about $300 million for the Wellness and Healthcare segment for 2023.Among other initiatives, Philip Morris became the majority owner of Swedish Match on Nov 11, 2022. Management expects a robust performance from Swedish Match’s existing operations in 2023 due to expectations of strong ZYN volumes in the United States. This also bodes well for the quarter under review.Further, on Jan 30, 2023, Philip Morris unveiled a long-term partnership with KT&amp;G to continue commercializing the innovative smoke-free devices and consumables of the latter on a unique, worldwide basis (excluding South Korea). This may have contributed to results in the to-be-reported quarter.Story continuesOther TrendsPM has been battling cost-related headwinds for a while now. On its last earnings call, management highlighted its intentions to make additional growth-oriented investments, including the commercialization of ILUMA. These may have impacted margins in the quarter under review. Further, soft cigarette shipment volumes have been a concern.However, Philip Morris has been benefiting from its strong pricing power. Though higher pricing might lead to a possible decline in cigarette consumption, it is seen that smokers tend to absorb price increases due to the addictive quality of cigarettes.How Are Estimates Shaping Up?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $9.2 billion, suggesting a rise of 14.3% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for quarterly earnings has risen by 1.3% in the past seven days to $1.61 per share, implying growth of 5.2% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. PM has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 7.6%, on average.Philip Morris carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has an Earnings ESP of -0.31%. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is not the case here.

The company is likely to register bottom-line growth when it reports third-quarter 2023 numbers.

The new Juniper Connected Security Distributed Services Architecture uniquely integrates Juniper’s unified security management paradigm with best-in-class routing and AI-Predictive Threat Prevention to bring much-needed operational simplicity and scale to data center security. In addition, four new high-performance firewall platforms deliver unmatched performance in a compact footprint that minimizes cost, space and power consumption.With the adoption of edge computing, multicloud, 5G and IoT, business data is increasingly distributed across geographically dispersed locations, making it harder to secure and manage. To adapt to this changing environment, organizations need a new modern data center architecture that delivers reliability through automated data center operations, scalable performance to support the most stringent workloads (e.g., AI model training) and comprehensive data security, regardless of where the data resides.The newest enhancements to Juniper’s Connected Security portfolio provide a secure bridge for customers to facilitate their transition to a modern data center, at their own pace. This is achieved via the following unique innovations:Juniper’s Connected Security Distributed Services Architecture: Juniper is the first in the industry to deliver an architecture design that fully decouples the forwarding and security services layers that have traditionally been combined in a single firewall appliance. By decoupling these layers, customers can utilize their existing Juniper MX series routers as an intelligent forwarding engine and load balancer. This unique design gives customers independent scaling flexibility without chassis limitations, multi-path resiliency and cost efficiency. When coupled with Juniper Security Director Cloud, the operational experience is as simple as managing one logical element, regardless of the quantities and form factors of any additional firewall engines added to the architecture.Story continuesAI-Predictive Threat Prevention: Building on Juniper’s Adaptive Threat Profiling and Encrypted Traffic Insights, AI-Predictive Threat Prevention automatically generates custom signatures unique to the customer’s environment through a proxy-less architecture. Coupled with AI, customers gain even more effective malware prevention at line rate. Additionally, the enhanced URL filtering solution provides more granular control, with more than 200 categories to choose from and support for up to 200 languages, as well as a new portal for better insights on web content and easy recategorization. The AI-powered security solution enables customers and partners to predict and find real threats faster, leaving human experts to focus on more strategic security tasks.Four new best-in-class high-performance firewalls: The new Juniper Networks SRX firewalls (SRX1600, SRX2300, SRX4300, SRX4700) are 1RU in size, scale up to 1.4 Tbps and include built-in Zero Trust capabilities, delivering the industry’s highest firewall throughput performance per rack unit. The new platforms feature wire-speed MACsec along with natively embedded TPM 2.0 chips and cryptographically signed device IDs that allow security administrators and network operators to easily verify the trust posture of devices remotely and mitigate the risks of supply chain attacks. These new firewalls, like the whole SRX family, support industry-standard EVPN-VXLAN Type 5 integration, providing full fabric awareness to security operators and allowing them to respond to threats faster.When combined with Juniper’s Connected Security Distributed Services Architecture, these additions to the Juniper SRX series family offer customers even more options to build and expand their data center architectures securely and with sustainability objectives top of mind.Supporting Quotes:""As new distributed data center architectures create more blind spots and operational complexity, it is vital to have advanced security capabilities that can adapt with the transformation. Leveraging our expertise in both security and data center operations, Juniper is thrilled to deliver our Connected Security Distributed Services Architecture, AI-Predictive Threat Prevention and new high-performance firewalls to enable our customers to enhance their security posture across their evolving data centers.""Shishir Singh, SVP and GM, Core Technologies and Security, Juniper Networks""A new modern data center architecture is needed that delivers reliable automated operations and high-performing connectivity, all without sacrificing security within and between data center locations. By combining these new connected security capabilities with our world-class networking hardware and unique Apstra software for multivendor fabric management and automation, Juniper is setting the bar for secure and reliable data centers that deliver the best operator and end-user experiences.""Praveen Jain, SVP and GM, AI Clusters and Cloud-Ready Data Center, Juniper Networks""Data center infrastructures are getting more complex and distributed. Traditional firewalls need to become more easily extensible to dynamically align with how the infrastructure is evolving. Juniper’s new security fabric meets market demands by allowing customers to integrate existing routers and firewalls.""Mauricio Sanchez, Sr. Research Director, Enterprise Networking and Security, Dell’Oro Group""Applications and data have become highly distributed in modern design, which poses a significant challenge to traditional firewall architectures. Juniper’s new offerings tackle those challenges head-on by directly addressing the need for the operational distribution of protection services without sacrificing performance or security efficacy. I believe Juniper has a strong approach to solving this challenge and am looking forward to the benefits it will bring to our deployment.""Jason Philp, Principal Architect Global Network Security, Carnival Cruise Lines""At Vivo, we’re committed to protecting our environment and users—and their data and apps—from cyberattacks, whilst delivering the fast and reliable services that they are always looking for. We are very pleased to work with Juniper, given its consistent track record of delivering both carrier-grade performance and industry-leading security efficacy. Juniper’s new solution to secure the modern data center underlines its thorough understanding of the operator’s operational imperatives and challenges coupled with the end user’s expectations of a secure yet fast experience every time.""Sergio Moraes, Infrastructure Executive, Vivo (Telefónica Brazil)Additional Resources:Launch Blog: Juniper Networks Evolves Modern Data Center Security with the Industry’s First Distributed Security Services ArchitectureProduct &amp; Solution Pages:Juniper SecuritySecure Data CenterJuniper Networks® SRX Series FirewallsConnected Security on The FeedAbout Juniper NetworksJuniper Networks is dedicated to dramatically simplifying network operations and driving superior experiences for end users.

To see more such companies, go directly to Jim Cramer's 5 Best AI Stocks.Jim Cramer made some important comments earlier this year when he talked about the importance of investing in individual stocks. There has been a rise popularity of investing in index funds over the past few years. Beginner investors often get advised that investing in individual names is too risky and they are far better off investing in broader market funds. Cramer said in his program that while he recommends investing in index funds, he also urges investors to invest in individual stocks if they really want to make money in the stock market. But Cramer said investing in individual stocks requires care and deep study. In the same program Jim Cramer talked about the importance of investing in AI stocks and named some big companies working on AI products, including Meta Platforms.AI's GoPro Moment?Jim Cramer is also deeply aware of the hype around AI and how companies are excessively using the AI buzzword to boost their stock prices and rally investors. About a month ago, Jim Cramer on his program wondered whether AI was about to have its “GoPro moment,” drawing a comparison between the hype GoPro enjoyed during its early days and the AI boom of today. Cramer said that there was a time when GoPro stock touched high $90s before tumbling and plunging to new lows and today the stock is trading in single digits ($2.82 as of October 16, to be exact). Cramer said that “I have to find out” when companies would stop rolling out AI stories to boost their stock prices.Our MethodologyFor this article we went through several programs of Jim Cramer and picked AI stocks he’s bullish on. With each stock we have linked to the video in which Cramer talked about the company in question. Some top names Cramer likes include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).Story continuesJim Cramer's Best AI StocksJim Cramer's 10 Best AI Stocks10. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72Jim Cramer in a program earlier this year said Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) has got the “mojo” when it comes to AI. Cramer specifically likes Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)’s partnership with Google to provide AI chips. However, a report from The Information in September, citing sources familiar with the matter, said Google wants to cut its reliance on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) for AI-accelerating TPU chips as early as 2027.Jim Cramer also said that Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is “not an expensive stock.” He also referred to price target upgrades and bullish ratings on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) from BMO, JPMorgan and Evercore.ClearBridge Multi Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“While the ClearBridge Multi Cap Growth Strategy has limited mega cap exposure, which has been a recent headwind to relative performance, we own several companies that stand to benefit from the explosive growth in generative AI. These holdings play key roles in building out the necessary infrastructure and helping customers leverage capabilities enabled by this emerging technology.Semiconductor and software solutions provider Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), for example, is an important supplier of networking chips that power ethernet switches and routers for connectivity between AI servers. The company sees quarterly revenue from this part of their business exceeding $1 billion in their fiscal third quarter, on a trajectory toward doubling over the course of the year.”9. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 84In the “Lightning Round” on his program on CNBC, Jim Cramer, a couple of months ago, answering a question about Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), recommended investors to buy more ORCL stock. Cramer pointed to Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)’s quarterly earnings earlier this year and the stock’s relative underperformance after that. Cramer at the time said that “right here” is when you should buy Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL). Cramer said by right here he meant $113, $112, $110. As of October 16 Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is trading at $108. Cramer also believes Oracle is the “star of the show” in AI.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 84 hedge funds out of the 910 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) during this period was Jean-Marie Eveillard’s First Eagle Investment Management which owns a $2.2 billion stake in the company.Like ORCL, Cramer also loves Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)’s CTO Larry Ellison in an earnings call earlier this year talked about AI opportunities for Oracle and said:“Well, you can’t build any of these AI models without enormous amounts of training data. So if anything, what AI — generative AI has shown that the big issue about training one of these models is just getting that — this vast amount of data ingested into your GPU supercluster. It is a huge data problem in the sense you need so much data. To train — OpenAI to train ChatGPT 3.5, they read the entire public Internet, they read all of Wikipedia, they read everything, they ingested everything. And to specialize, and you take something like ChatGPT 4.0 and you want to specialize it, you need specialized training data from electronic health records to help doctors diagnose and treat cancer, let’s say, and we are partners.Imaging for example, that is ingesting huge amounts of image data to train their AI models. We have our own — another partner of ours in AI, ingesting huge amounts of electronic health records to train their models. AI doesn’t work without getting access to and ingesting enormous amounts of data. So in terms of a shift away from data or a change in gravities at AI, AI is utterly dependent upon vast amounts of training data. Trillions of elements went into building ChatGPT 3.5, multiple times that for ChatGPT 4.0 because you have to deal with all the image data and ingest all of that to train image recognition. So we think this is very good for our database business, and Oracle’s new Vector database will contain highly-specialized training data like electronic health records, while keeping that data anonymized and private, yet still training the specialized models that can help doctors improve their diagnostic capability and their treatment prescriptions for cancer and heart disease and all sorts of other diseases.""Read the full earnings call transcript here.Oakmark Global Fund made the following comment about Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) (U.S.), a global software company, was the Fund’s top contributor for the fiscal year, with its share price rising primarily after reporting its fiscal fourth-quarter results. More recently, Oracle announced fiscal first-quarter results, which were in line with consensus expectations. The drivers of the core business are performing well, in our view, and management expressed confidence that annual revenue growth will accelerate as planned based on demand trajectory and its strong bookings trends. For the quarter, total revenue increased 8% in constant currency (9% reported), and operating income grew 12% with margins showing improvement. Cloud and support revenue grew 11% in constant currency, powered by Fusion +20% and Netsuite +21%. The “strategic back office cloud” is now up to $6.9 billion in run-rate revenue. Infrastructure cloud and support revenue grew 14% in constant currency, powered by infrastructure cloud services +72% ex-legacy hosting services to $5.6 billion in run-rate revenue. Momentum is continuing to build as Oracle signed several deals for its cloud business greater than $1 billion in total value during the quarter and booked an additional $1.5 billion in the first week of the second quarter. We continue to believe Oracle is an attractive holding and undervalued due to our perception of its intrinsic value.”8. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 109Jim Cramer said in a program that Adobe is using the best use of AI and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is more responsive than any other company when it comes to AI.Analysts are praising Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)’s AI features across the board. Baird recently said it is “incrementally positive” on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)’s artificial intelligence strategy and leadership position.“We expect the product roadmap to continually evolve over time with additional GenAI announcements, Baird’s Rob Oliver and Patrick Schulz, who have a $540 price target on Adobe, said.7. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112Earlier this year Jim Cramer said that he’s been recommending Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) since the stock was trading at $5. Cramer praised Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)’s latest AI chips announcements and said that it was bad news for China since Chinese semiconductor companies seem to be struggling to keep up with innovation and American companies won’t be allowed to export AI chips to China.In May 2023, Cramer also talked about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)’s partnership with Microsoft for AI chips and said the deal could have major implications.In May, Bloomberg reported that Microsoft was joining hands with Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) to help the semiconductor firm expand into AI, where Nvidia currently dominates.Artisan Global Opportunities Fund made the following comment about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Among our top contributors were Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), NU Holdings and Netflix. AMD’s data center CPUs are used in the cloud service provider (CSP) servers. In addition to the broader secular tailwind from cloud adoption, the company has a performance and pricing advantage over Intel, which we believe will enable it to continue capturing market share. However, the recent stock price rally was due to growing excitement around the company’s AI exposure. It will launch its new MI300 graphics processing unit (GPU) chip later this year to compete against the dominant market leader NVIDIA. Similar to its approach that won market share from Intel within the CPU market, AMD’s product will aim to provide similar performance at a more attractive price. AMD is already working with Microsoft and Meta, while Amazon publicly stated that it is evaluating AMD’s inferencing chips. Using assumptions around the total GPU market size, potential market share gains and price points, our research indicates this could be a $20 billion opportunity for AMD. That would nearly double its revenue. While the company has not historically missed many deadlines, there is execution risk as it works to manufacture and distribute these complex chips at scale, which, combined with an elevated valuation after the stock’s strong performance run, led us to trim the position.”6. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 122Jim Cramer in September interviewed Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)’s CEO Marc Benioff at Salesforce’s Dreamforce, where the company revealed several AI offerings. Benioff highlighted the role of Slack, which Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) acquired for about $27.7 billion, when it comes to AI.“The big news is Slack is really starting to wake up with its own AI. It holds so much data for our customers. I think Slack is going to be the promise of AI for a lot of our most important customers. If you go talk to any of these great, new AI companies they are all Slack-first companies; they all built their product with Slack.”Cramer is bullish on Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). His charitable trust has a position in Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). Cramer recently said during his program that Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) will have a “dynamite” 2024.Harding Loevner Global Equity Strategy made the following comment about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), a company we’ve owned since 2019, recently added ChatGPT-like capabilities onto its existing Al module, Einstein, to support its internal sales efforts and customer-facing software. For example, Einstein GPT can help generate marketing emails tailored to specific clients by using Salesforce’s customer database and past email correspondence to learn the most effective approach for each client. Einstein GPT is also different from off-the-shelf LLMS in three important ways: It keeps personal identifiable information private and secure, compared with external tools that retain anything a user enters. It employs the latest data in Salesforce’s system, as opposed to the sometimes-stale public data that train generic models. And generative Al capabilities can be integrated with other Salesforce offerings; the company has already introduced Slack GPT and Tableau GPT, Al-equipped versions of its workplace collaboration and analytics tools.”Some other stocks Cramer likes because of their AI potential include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Click to continue reading and see Jim Cramer's 5 Best AI Stocks. Suggested articles:12 Best Upwork Alternatives for Freelancers and EmployersTop 20 Countries With Most Natural Resources in the World23 High-Paying Trade and Vocational Jobs in 2023Disclosure: None.

It is the latest in a string of business software firms such as Microsoft, LinkedIn and Adobe seeking to use generative AI - which can read and write human-like text after a short prompt - to add new features.In NetSuite's case, some of the new features are aimed at automating the mundane day-to-day tasks of a finance department.Evan Goldberg, one of NetSuite's co-founders, said the feature can automatically compose emails such as collections letters to include data from various parts of NetSuite's systems, such as how much is owed, how many days late the payment is and a reminder that the customer can get a discount in the future for paying earlier.""They don't have to think about that stuff because we've already pointed the system to the right things in the context in which you're using the generative of AI,"" Goldberg said.Other new NetSuite features are aimed at reading and analyzing financial data to generate summaries and reports. Goldberg said the company believes the features will be used to help boost productivity rather than eliminate jobs.""This is a new type of automation, but we've been working on automation forever and somehow white-collar workers have survived that revolution,"" Goldberg said. ""I tend to think optimistically that this is really about putting more power into the hands of individuals.""NetSuite said the ""Text Enhance"" features will roll out over the next six months. The company said typical use levels of the new features, which rely on a new supercomputer built by Oracle, will be included in existing subscription prices, but further new AI features or higher use levels may include additional costs.(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Will Dunham)]"

This compares to earnings of $0.23 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -87.10%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this telecommunications company would post earnings of $0.33 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.46, delivering a surprise of 39.39%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Amer Movil , which belongs to the Zacks Wireless Non-US industry, posted revenues of $11.95 billion for the quarter ended September 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.19%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $10.6 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Amer Movil shares have lost about 5.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 13.9%.What's Next for Amer Movil?While Amer Movil has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Amer Movil: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.31 on $11.83 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.56 on $46.77 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly. Top 5 Upgrades: Goldman Sachs upgraded Dollar Tree (DLTR) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $137, down from $150. The firm sees strong earnings growth potential supported by continued market share gains from improving traffic trends with ""sticky"" new customers, an improving discretionary cash flow outlook for lower- and middle-income consumers in 2024, and better shopability after recent investments.Exane BNP Paribas upgraded Mondelez (MDLZ) to Outperform from Neutral with a $75 price target. The firm says the company's lower exposure to the U.S. market is likely a positive.Citi upgraded Progressive (PGR) to Neutral from Sell with a price target of $158, up from $120. The firm believes the case for an inflection in personal auto margins has strengthened.Mizuho last night upgraded Lennox (LII) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $460, up from $340. The firm says the company's earnings potential ""too pronounced to ignore.""Wolfe Research upgraded FIS (FIS) to Outperform from Peer Perform with a $65 price target. The upgrade is driven by the stock's relative valuation and expected sentiment upon the Worldpay sale and underlying RemainCo fundamentals, the firm says.Top 5 Downgrades:Citi downgraded SunPower (SPWR) to Sell from Neutral with a price target of $4.50, down from $10. The firm expects residential solar to have ""another tough quarter"" and sees risk to the guidance from SunPower. Morgan Stanley also downgraded SunPower to Underweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $5, down from $8.Goldman Sachs downgraded BJ's Wholesale (BJ) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $73, down from $75. The firm sees limited earnings upside to consensus estimates for fiscal 2024, and sees a full valuation at current share levels.Barclays downgraded NOV Inc. (NOV) to Underweight from Equal Weight with an unchanged price target of $20. The firm says NOV is at a ""structural disadvantage"" this cycle as service companies restrain capex and drilling contractors consolidate, as opposed to the build out of equipment and assets in the prior cycle.Cantor Fitzgerald downgraded Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP) to Neutral from Overweight. Crispr owns 40% of exa-cel, an ex vivo autologous cell therapy being developed by partner Vertex (VRTX), and Cantor expects exa-cel to become the leading therapy for sickle cell disorder, though it could take time to break down the many potential barriers to adoption.Baird downgraded H.B. Fuller (FUL) to Neutral from Outperform with an unchanged price target of $80. The firm cites year-to-date outperformance against a backdrop of ""rapid volatility that has severely weighed on other portions of our coverage,"" stating that its margin expansion thesis for H.B. Fuller ""has unfolded.""Top 5 Initiations: Loop Capital initiated coverage of Microsoft (MSFT) with a Buy rating and $425 price target. The company's growth is set to accelerate driven by its two most strategic businesses, Azure and generative artificial intelligence products, the firm tells investors in a research note.Cantor Fitzgerald initiated coverage of Bluebird Bio (BLUE) with a Neutral rating and no price target. Cantor expects Bluebird's lovo-cel to be approved on or around its PDUFA date and believes its profile is more similar than different from Vertex and Crispr's exa-cel, but feels cell therapies face multiple barriers to penetrating the sickle cell disorder market.Deutsche Bank initiated coverage of ViaSat (VSAT) with a Hold rating and $22 price target. The firm believes positives are overshadowed by ViaSat's recent satellite anomalies and high leverage, ""which is further exacerbated by big capex spending plans.""Craig-Hallum initiated coverage of Potbelly (PBPB) with a Buy rating and $15 price target. Potbelly has significant momentum and vastly improved operations driven by an experienced management team positioned to succeed, the firm says.Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of TripAdvisor (TRIP) with a Buy rating and $22 price target. The firm sees upside to Street estimates on the back of faster revenue growth at Viator/Experiences and operating efficiencies leading to better profitability.]"

On Sunday, the franchise stated again that it was donating meals, ""to all those who are involved in the defence of the state, hospitals, and surrounding areas.""Around 1,300 Israelis were killed by Palestinian militant group Hamas on Oct. 7.

""Neither global McDonald's nor us nor any other country had a role or relationship with that decision, neither directly nor indirectly.""McDonald’s is a global chain but its franchises are often owned locally and operate autonomously.McDonald's Corp declined to comment but a source close to the company in the U.S. said the Israel franchise was an independent business that licensed McDonald's brand.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) — which has counted McDonald's as a member since 1985 — is off slightly during the same timespan.Zoom out, and you will see the selling pressure in McDonald's (MCD) the most acutely in the last three months — shares have dropped 15.2%.The stock hit a 52-week low of $246.19 on Oct. 12.""You have to go back more than 20 years … all the way back to the 2002 lows … to find a time when McDonald's was more oversold on its RSI [Relative Strength Index] chart than it was at its early October lows!"" Miller Tabak chief market strategist Matt Maley told Yahoo Finance by email.So what gives with the often safe-haven play in McDonald's? This is usually a blue chip stock that investors eat up when the world becomes more volatile, as is currently the case with fresh Middle East tensions.Blame Wall Street's obsession with the longer-term impact of weight loss drugs (formally known as GLP-1 drugs) such as Ozempic on companies that sell anything with extra sugar, extra fat, and extra processed ingredients.The sell-off has blasted shares of everyone from McDonald's to soda kings Coca-Cola (KO) and PepsiCo (PEP) to Slim Jim selling Conagra Brands (CAG).Indeed the concern in the marketplace isn't totally misplaced.Data from IMS/IQVIA suggests around 10.6 million shots of obesity drug doses were officially sanctioned by Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY) in the US in May 2023.Dividing this figure by 4.5 weeks in a month suggests that the user base was around 2.4 million adults in May.""The concerns surrounding the impact that the weight loss drugs will have on [McDonald's] has caused its stock to drop,"" Maley contends.Story continuesA Deliveroo rider stands beside a bicycle outside a McDonald's restaurant in London, Dec. 10, 2021. (May James/REUTERS) (May James / reuters)While the sell-off in the Golden Arches has been brutal for the bulls, the Street has been hesitant to toss in the towel and serve up rating downgrades.""The recent weakness of the MCD stock screams unfairness. After all, many investors bought the stock for its resilience under any macro scenarios and protection against market volatility,"" said Citi analyst Jon Tower in a client note.Analysts like Tower point to several favorable attributes to the McDonald's business model that may be getting lost in the intense focus on weight loss drugs.They include a mostly franchised business model that lends itself to higher profit margins, efforts by management to accelerate the opening of new restaurants, and a push to digital in drive-through orders and on mobile devices.Adds Tower, ""While the GLP-1 risk is hard to measure, the current multiple may not fully reflect McDonald's wider appeal led by greater digital, delivery and drive through investments coupled with more craveable options and improved marketing execution.""Whether investors will view a discounted McDonald's stock as craveable before year end, the verdict is out.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Jill Sawyer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Jill. You may begin.Story continuesJill SawyerThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance, and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or other SEC filings. Additionally, our third quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP. And in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. I'd like to welcome Tim Arndt, our CFO, who will cover results, real-time market conditions and guidance. Hamid Moghadam, our CEO and our entire executive team are also with us today. With that, I'll hand the call over to Tim.Timothy D. ArndtThanks, Jill. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our call. The third quarter marked the continuation of themes we've been anticipating for more than a year, namely growing supply translating to increased market vacancy, continued moderation of demand and market rent growth that will slow until the low levels of new starts drive reduced availability over time. We've operated in accordance with these views in both our approach to leasing as well as timing of new development. What's incremental to our forecast is that continued hawkish posture from central banks and the impact it's had on rates is delaying decision-making and willingness to take expansion space early. The geopolitical backdrop has clearly become more troubling as well, amounting to a lack of clarity that will likely weigh on demand. In the meantime, and also playing out to our expectations, is that our existing lease mark-to-market will drive durable earnings growth as it did in delivering record rent change this quarter as well as strong earnings and same-store growth. We remain focused on the fact that we own assets critical to the supply chain with long-term secular drivers that remain intact. Further, the outlook for future supply will continue to face structural barriers, ultimately driving occupancy rents and values. In terms of our results, we had an excellent quarter with core FFO, excluding net promoter income, of $1.33 per share. This result includes approximately $0.03 of onetime items related to interest and termination income as well as the timing of expenses, which we can address in Q&amp;A. Occupancy ticked up over the quarter to 97.5%, aided by retention of 77%. Net effective rent change was a record 84% of our share, with notable contributions from Northern New Jersey at 200%, Toronto at 187% and Southern California at 165%. Same-store growth on a net effective and cash basis was 9.3% and 9.5%, respectively, driven predominantly by rent change. We saw market rents grow roughly 60 basis points during the quarter, the slower pace embedded in our forecast. In combination with the strong build of in-place rents, our lease mark-to-market recalculates to 62% as of September. We raised approximately $1.4 billion in new financings at an average interest rate of 3.2%, comprised principally of $760 million within our ventures as well as a recast of our yen credit facility, increasing our aggregate line availability. In combination with our cash position, we ended the quarter with a record $6.9 billion of liquidity. Finally, it's noteworthy that our debt-to-EBITDA has remained very low and essentially flat all year, hovering in the mid-4x range despite our increased financing activity, a demonstration of the tremendous growth in our nominal EBITDA. Turning to our markets. While rising, vacancy remains historically very low in the U.S., Mexico and Europe. Market vacancy increased approximately 70 basis points during the quarter in the U.S. driven by low absorption as well as recently delivered but unleased completions. Europe experienced similar dynamics with an overall increase in market vacancy of 50 basis points. At the macro level, our expectations for the U.S. are for completions to outpace net absorption by a cumulative 150 million to 200 million square feet over the next 3 quarters. Then over the subsequent 3 quarters, we see that trend reversing with demand exceeding supply and recovering to net 75 million to 125 million square feet. That trend may extend further into 2025 as we believe development starts over the next several quarters are likely to remain low. Whatever the precise path, we expect that as vacancy normalizes over the long term, our portfolio will outperform the market due to both its location and quality as well as the strength of our relationships and operating platform. In this regard, our portfolio has been largely resilient to moderating demand. Our teams would describe the depth of our leasing pipeline as consistent with the last few quarters. And coming fresh off of 1 of our customer advisory board sessions, it's clear that our customers have plans to continue to expand their footprint, increasing capacity and resiliency. However, what's also clear is that they are slowing such investments until there is more clarity in the economic environment. In the U.S., rents increased in most of our markets with the strongest located in the Sunbelt, Mid-Atlantic and Northern California region. Europe and Mexico were also bright spots for growth in the quarter. Rents across our Southern California submarkets declined approximately 2% as it continues to adjust to higher levels of vacancy. While the markets and outlooks are mixed, we remain confident in continued market rent growth in the U.S. and globally over the coming year, albeit at a slower pace while the pipeline continues to get absorbed. From our appraisals, U.S. values declined approximately 3% while European values remain stable, in fact, having a very modest write-up. The difference isn't too surprising as the Fed's language around inflation and the economy has had more effect in the U.S. capital markets, driving the 10-year up 100 basis points since our last earnings call compared to the [bun] at just 50 basis points. We believe that this is likely another instance as we saw 1 year ago where U.S. appraisals at the end of the quarter have not had sufficient time to react to the increase in rates and we are thus pausing on appraisal-based activity in USLF for at least 1 quarter. Elsewhere values in Mexico are up 8.5%, while China experienced its first meaningful decline of 6.5%, a write-down that we don't believe has fully run its course. Our funds experienced their first quarter of net positive inflows with approximately $180 million of new commitments versus new redemption requests of $115 million. Given other activity in the quarter, the net redemptions have been reduced from their height of $1.6 billion to approximately $700 million or roughly 2% of third-party AUM. In terms of our own deployment development starts ramped up during the quarter, crossing $1 billion, over half of which is related to a data center opportunity in our central region, a testament to our higher and better use strategy and strategically located land bank. Also notable is the acquisition of $118 million of land, including a strategic parcel in Las Vegas, which will build out an additional 10 million square feet over time and brings our total build-out of land globally to over $40 billion. We are laser-focused in identifying and executing on value creation in our core business, our energy business and their adjacencies. Combined with the debt capacity and liquidity we've worked hard to build and preserve, we see the environment as rich with opportunity. Moving to guidance. We are increasing average occupancy to range between 97.25% and 97.5%. As a result, we are increasing our same-store guidance to a range of 9% to 9.25% on a net effective basis and 9.75% to 10% on a cash basis. We're maintaining our strategic capital revenue guidance, excluding promotes, to a range of $520 million to $530 million and adjusting G&amp;A guidance to range between $390 million and $395 million. Our development start guidance has increased to a new range of $3 billion to $3.5 billion at our share, driven primarily from the data center start mentioned earlier. We have $500 million of contribution and disposition activity during the quarter. And given our commentary on USLF valuations, we are pausing our planned contributions into that vehicle this quarter and reducing our combined contribution and disposition guidance to a range of $1.7 billion to $2.3 billion. In the end, we are adjusting guidance for GAAP earnings in the range of $3.30 to $3.35 per share. We are increasing our core FFO, including promotes guidance, to a range of $5.58 to $5.60 per share and are increasing core FFO, excluding promotes, to range between $5.08 and $5.10 per share, growth of nearly 10.5%. I know that many of you are focusing on 2024, so I'd like to take an opportunity to remind you that the Duke portfolio will be entering the same-store pool in 2024, which will widen the recently observed delta between net effective and cash same-store growth. This is, of course, because Duke rents were mark-to-market at close 1 year ago, so its contribution to net effective same-store growth and earnings will be minimal even though the cash rent change will be on par with the rest of the Prologis portfolio. In closing, we are navigating the current environment assured that whatever the economy brings in the short term, we are positioned to outperform over the long term. This stems from not only the premier logistics portfolio and customer franchise with one of the best balance sheets amongst corporates, but also highly visible earnings and portfolio growth ahead of us. We know that turbulent times can bring opportunity for those who are prepared, and that's been central to our strategy and management as a company. I'd like to also remind you of our upcoming Investor Forum on December 13 in New York, our first in 4 years. We're looking forward to spending the day with you sharing more about our business, outlook and opportunities ahead. Additional information is available on our website and in our earnings press release. And with that, I will hand it back to the operator for your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And the first question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS.Michael GoldsmithI mean, Tim, can you help us reconcile some of the comments from the prepared remarks? You talked about maybe softer demand, but then there's -- you're calling for accelerating the number of build-to-suit developments. At the same time, occupancy has been stronger than anticipated, and that's before the lower development start hit the market. So how should we think about all of these moving pieces and just the trajectory of the supply-demand dynamics as we exit '23 and into 2024?Hamid R. MoghadamSure. Demand is definitely softer. It's closer to normal, maybe even a little bit below normal at this instance. There is a lot of latent demand that large companies having large requirements are continuing to talk to us about build-to-suits, but they're reluctant to pull the(technical difficulty)OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with Citi.Craig Allen MailmanLet me get some color here because I'm having trouble here. But I just wanted to touch on the data center build-to-suits in the quarter and see if you guys could break out what the yields on those were relative to the blended yield on the overall development starts. And maybe just give a little bit more color about the opportunity with your partner on this one, the plan on whether you're going to hold this or anticipate selling upon completion of them, just a little bit more about the capacity within the land bank to do more of these data center sales?(technical difficulty)OperatorLadies and gentlemen, please remain on the line. We're just having a little technical difficulty here.Hamid R. MoghadamI'm sorry, we're having some technical difficulties here, and I can't really explain it. Can you guys hear me?OperatorHello. We can hear you.Hamid R. MoghadamYes, you can hear me again. Okay. So let me finish the first question and then I'll go through the second question to the extent I heard it, which wasn't great. On the first question, what I wanted to say is that the data centers account for a pretty significant volume of the build-to-suits and that's why they're higher. But industrial logistics build-to-suits are kind of on par and in line with our expectations. The reason occupancy is higher, it's unique to the quality of our portfolio and just a natural role of leases, but market occupancy is slightly lower. So we're outperforming the market by more than we did before. I think that covers the first question. The second question was how should we think about the build-to-suits in terms of its effect on our going in yields and the like. And for that, I'm going to turn it over to Dan here. But generally, we -- the build-to-suit strategy of ours is an extension of our higher and best use strategy. We own a lot of high-quality land in markets that are in the path of development and our popular data center markets. And while we may occasionally buy land for data centers, our primary strategy is converting our existing portfolio to data center product. To the extent they have power availability, we're getting a lot of people knocking on our door for those opportunities. And we think going forward, it's going to be a pretty significant part of our activity, although it's lumpy and less prone to precise predictions like the logistics business, but you'll hear more about that. Now strategically, this is important to understand, we funded our business without issuing any equity basically since 2012. Last 10 or 11 years, we have not issued any equity. How we finance our business is by disposing of real estate that was nonstrategic to us, logistics real estate. And we've done a lot of dispositions. You can think of the data center strategy as a way of funding our growth. That's where the growth capital is going to come from. We are not, at the moment, interested in being in that business in terms of long-term ownership. It's more of a development and harvest strategy. And that capital that comes out of the margins of those deals will be a substantial contributor to our growth going forward. Dan, do you want to talk about the initial yields on the data center?Daniel Stephen LetterWell, what I would say is on this particular data center, we're under a strict confidentiality so we can't be speaking about any particular deal points by any means. But what I would say is we've been building capabilities internally to ensure that we hit the market for these deals, and you'll see those play out as we announce more data centers going forward.Hamid R. MoghadamWhat I would say generally, though, without getting specific on this opportunity, we think the margins that come out of our data center business, by definition based on our historic cost of land or even the market value of land, will be orders of magnitude higher than they would be on their logistics build-out. So multiples of a normal margin.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.Stephen Thomas SakwaI just wanted to follow up on the development and just make sure I understand. On the fourth quarter, I think you've got something like $1.9 billion of planned starts given that you've done about $1.4 billion year-to-date. So just curious, does that include other data centers? Or is that all traditional industrial? And if so, what is the mix between spec and build-to-suit on that fourth quarter starts volume?Daniel Stephen LetterSure, Steve, this is Dan. So the lion's share of our Q4 starts are logistics starts. We have 1, maybe 2 smaller data center starts that we have forecasted. But Overall, it's about 50-50, build-to-suit and spec. And let me just highlight that we've been calling for a back-end loaded forecast for about 4 quarters now. As you -- as we talk about, market development starts now at 65 -- I guess, down 65% from the peak. This is playing out exactly as we expected, and we've been gearing up all year for a really heavy Q4 start volume.Hamid R. MoghadamYes. The portion of build-to-suits is obviously a lot higher than that if you include the data centers. What that meant was a mix of logistics and -- logistics spec versus build-to-suit.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.Todd Michael ThomasQuestion, as you think about 2024, Tim, you mentioned that market rent growth increased 60 basis points relative to last quarter. That's down from 2.5% last quarter. I think you indicated that market rent growth is expected to be positive in the year ahead. As we think about the trajectory of rent growth and what you're anticipating, do you see potential for sequential or year-over-year decreases in market rents in the U.S. or globally over the next few quarters as deliveries outpace absorption? Or do you expect rent growth to stay positive throughout that period during that time frame?Christopher N. CatonTodd, it's Chris Caton. Thanks for the question. Yes, we expect rent growth to remain positive throughout that time period. Market conditions are stable. And there are a handful of markets that we've talked about that are softer, but by and large, markets are proving resilient with rent growth in line or ahead of inflation.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs.Caitlin BurrowsMaybe we could talk about property acquisitions a little. I know it's not as large of an activity as developments, but guidance for this year increased while transaction volumes, at an industry level, are down significantly. You did the $3 billion acquisition midyear. So what sorts of acquisitions are most interesting to you today? Could you talk a little bit about who you're buying from, maybe why they're selling and how you get comfortable and what the right price should be?Hamid R. MoghadamSure. It's a dynamic market, and I think that's the essence of your question. It's really hard to get a handle on what the returns should be and how we look at acquisitions. But here is a model for thinking about it. First of all, we are even pickier than we have been with respect to quality and fit with our portfolio. We're not -- before, you had to buy the good with the great in portfolios, and we had to go through the massive exercise of disposing of the properties that we didn't want, which we did actually quite successfully in a declining cap rate environment, and we actually made money on it. But we don't expect that to be the case going forward. So we're really being picky about what we buy. The portfolios that we're going to buy are almost virtually 100% home portfolios. Secondly, if you really think that -- look at where treasuries are, 150 basis points have gone to, call it, 4.5%, 300 basis points increase. Those kinds of properties, core properties, were trading in the high 5s, low 6 IRRs, let's stay away from cap rates because of a mark-to-market complexity of talking about cap rates, but call it 6%. So just adjusting for the change in treasury yields, simplistically, you would have to see a 9% unleveraged IRR. And that's if supply and demand of capital were sort of in equilibrium, we get a sense that there's going to be more opportunities coming our way, and it is in a capital-constrained environment. And we happen to be in the fortunate position of having a really good balance sheet and able to take advantage of those. I don't think there's going to be distress in the terms of post savings and loan crisis or any of the downturns. But I think the opportunity set is going to exceed the available capital, and I think we'll be taking advantage of that. So I would say unleveraged IRRs that are -- have a 9 handle on them and maybe as much as 9.5, depending on the circumstances. And we are seeing that supply loosen up and come to the market. So expect to see more transactions in the next 6 months. Dan, do you have anything to add?Daniel Stephen LetterThe only thing I would add is our teams around the globe are literally turning over every stone daily. And this is land acquisitions, this is core acquisitions, it's value-add acquisitions and the teams turned too opportunistic right now. And so it's really hard to peg exactly where we're going to land our acquisition volume for the year, which is why you saw us move it up a couple of hundred million after this Phoenix transaction. But overall, I think our teams are going to continue to find opportunistic transactions consistent with what Hamid just said on the returns.OperatorAnd the next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.John P. KimI just wanted to clarify. So you're expecting over the next few quarters a significant demand shortfall. And I'm wondering if during that time period, are you planning to be more aggressive on rents and concessions to try to hold occupancy? Or are you going to hold rates just given supply is going to start to come down after that? And also, if you could provide an update on the market rental forecast for 2023.Hamid R. MoghadamYes. On the rental forecast, I'm afraid you're going to have to wait for that when we issue guidance, and we get into that. And one thing we're going to stay away from is quarter-by-quarter forecasting of rent. It's hard enough to guess what it is on an annual basis, much less on a quarter-to-quarter forecast. So what was the first part of the question? Occupancy, trade-off. It depends on the actual markets. There are about 20% of the markets that I can see us driving for occupancy and about 80% of the markets that are still in equilibrium or tighter. But the key to your question is what you asked in the middle of it, which is, how do you expect that to change? And the reason we're not going to get super aggressive on rents is because we have a belief that -- I mean, just look at the starts, they're down 65%. And even with moderating demand, we're going to get something like 60% or 70% of that shortfall that we're going to encounter in the next 3 quarters shortfall of demand. We're going to get it back in the subsequent 3 quarters. So there's no sense really going cheap. It's just -- but I would say 20% of our markets were going to be more focused on occupancy.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Nicholas Yulico with Scotiabank.Nicholas Philip YulicoJust a 2-parter on Southern California. So I guess, first, I want to see if you're seeing any benefit in your portfolio since September in terms of the port being resolved, the worker's strikes impacting L.A. Basin or Inland Empire, are you seeing any benefit there and pickup in activity? And then secondly, just wanted to hear latest thoughts on why you think some of the weakness that you've cited there in rents in Southern California, what that dynamic is out there that would be different than other markets, meaning that Southern California is not a leading indicator for other parts of your portfolio.Hamid R. MoghadamWell, Southern California is very geared towards basically inflows. 40% of the inflows into this country came through Southern California, and that number dropped dramatically because of the labor issues. It's too soon to see any recovery because we're also going into the Christmas season and anything that's going to be in the store for Christmas has already been on the water and through the ports and all that. So I think you're going to see the effects of that next year in terms of recovery of flows.About half of what used to come through L.A. used to stay in the L.A. Basin, Southern California and half of it was shipped elsewhere. We think the half that stays in Southern California for sure will stay there or come back. And some of the rest will also revert back to Southern California. I'm not smart enough to know whether we're going to get half of it back or 3/4 of it back, but we'll get a pretty substantial portion of it back. It will be more into the first or second quarter of next year before you see them in the numbers. Chris, do you want to add anything?Christopher N. CatonYes, I'll build on that by saying is the market is digesting the demand and supply picture that Hamid described, we are beginning to see some differentiation in submarkets where L.A., Orange County is proving more resilient and Inland Empire is a bit softer.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Camille Bonnel with Bank of America.Jing Xian Tan BonnelFirst, a clarification that I want to get your thoughts on guidance. Can you clarify if the SoCal market rent change in the opening remarks is on a sequential or annual basis? And then I appreciate majority of your leasing for 2023 has been addressed and there's little that could change your core outlook from here. But I want to better understand the level of conservatives being factored into guidance looking into year-end, what could change your views more positively or negatively?Timothy D. ArndtCamille, it's Tim. Yes, just a clarification on the first part, that was a quarter-over-quarter number in SoCal, the 2% decline. And then in terms of what could change in the fourth quarter, the answer is very little at this point. Certainly on the rent change side of things, most all of that leasing is already inked. We could have some surprises very moderate, I would say, on the occupancy side, but I actually don't expect that. We have a pretty tight range on occupancy, as you know. So I don't think you'll see anything take us outside of our [guidance].OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Ron Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.Ronald KamdemJust a quick 2-parter follow-up. Just one on the development starts and the data centers, which is intriguing. Any way to put some numbers on that on how many starts can be done annually? Is it $200 million? Is it $500 million? Like how big can this get, is the follow-up, number one. And then number two, on sort of the rent growth, I appreciate we want to stay away from sort of specific numbers. But as you're sort of thinking about next year, what are sort of the key markets, Southern California being one potentially being sort of a headwind? Maybe you can you talk about what are some of the neutral or potential tailwinds in terms of markets for next year?Hamid R. MoghadamOkay. Your first question was great advertising for our Investor Day because that's what we're going to devote the time to is understanding our Essentials business, our data center business, and all those things. So let me defer answering that question to that date. And by the way, even on that date, you're not going to get as specific an answer as you would like. I just tell you that in advance because these are very lumpy, and it depends what quarter or what your year a deal lands in. Chris, do you want to address the second part?Christopher N. CatonYes, absolutely. I might start by just saying one way to think about rent growth going forward is to think about the replacement cost math. We have really seen construction costs prove resilient and replacement costs prove resilient. And the interest rate dynamic that Hamid described earlier, translates to the rents that are required to warrant new development. So over a medium-term horizon a couple of years, that's going to play one of the most important factors into evaluating rent growth.As it relates to different markets, which was your question, I think it's probably fair to point to Tim's comments on the markets that have proved the strongest so far this year. Mid-Atlantic, Sunbelt, Northern California are markets that stand out in my mind in the U.S. And there is a range of them globally, whether it's Toronto, Mexico, Germany and the Netherlands. So that's what I would look to.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell with Barclays.Anthony Franklin PowellI guess, one more on market rent growth. I think last quarter, you gave a 2023 forecast of 7% to 9%. I don't know if you updated that today. And are you going to be providing those kind of updated on a quarterly basis going forward?Christopher N. CatonSo hey, the view is 7% in the United -- globally and in the U.S. We're about mid-6s so far this year. So that implies growth in the fourth quarter, as we described earlier. And then as it relates to forward guidance, I'd like to underline our upcoming Investor Day in December as the time to look for new information.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.Michael Albert CarrollHow does the 150 million to 200 million square feet gap between supply and demand over the next 3 quarters compare to your expectation for all of 2023? Now correct me if I'm wrong, I believe that you highlighted that there's going to be about 150 million square foot gap in '23. I mean is that still a fair assumption? Or has this delay in demand due to the market uncertainty has kind of wind that out a little bit?Christopher N. CatonThanks for the question. Again, it's Chris. So just to give you the total numbers, we are on pace to see 490 million square feet of deliveries in the United States this year against 195 million square feet of net absorption. So that gap is wider. And some of that relates simply not so much to the softness in demand that you're describing, but the timing of deliveries of the pipeline. If anything, our view of where the pipeline is going has come down, not gone up over the last 90 days related to the trend in starts. And so really, it's really timing as it relates to that gap.Hamid R. MoghadamYes. But I would say our previous forecast did not anticipate the sudden jump in rates that has come in the last 1.5 months. We thought that treasuries were going to settle in the mid-3s, not mid-4s, maybe mid- to high 3s and not mid 4s or approaching 5. So that, I think, has taken and shifted some of the demand out. But the thing that encourages me and we'll have to see -- wait to see this, is that companies are not shutting down their dialogue with us in terms of their long-term needs. And our build-to-suit discussions are every bit as good as they've been across most cycles.But they're not pulling the trigger just yet given that those things generally involve major capital expenditures, and those are all being scrutinized by the C-suite pretty tightly these days.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho.Vikram L. MalhotraI just wanted to get a better sense of, you talked about deferring growth, I guess, across -- in rent growth across SoCal, Mid-Atlantic, I think you referenced Sunbelt. Can you just give us a better sense of the magnitude of this dispersion? And I guess, Chris, do you expect this dispersion to continue over the next, call it, 6 to 12 months?Christopher N. CatonSo the magnitude of the dispersion. So just to be clear, in terms of strength versus weakness because I want to be sure that wasn't conflated. The strong markets include the Mid-Atlantic, Sunbelt, Northern California. And really, there are only a handful of soft markets. SoCal we've talked about. [India] is a market that's been flat all year. In terms of dispersion, there is a fair amount of saneness in the trend, whether you look at it on a quarterly or a calendar year basis. So rents are trending in the annualized rate from the third quarter that Tim discussed with some markets moderately ahead like the strong market that I described and then just really 1 or 2 markets that are notably weaker. So I guess, I suppose there's that dispersion.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.Michael William MuellerI know you've used land in the past for higher and better uses. But do you think you'd be looking at the development -- the data center developments to the same degree that you would be looking at them if you weren't seeing a normalizing of the traditional industrial demand?Hamid R. MoghadamAbsolutely because the margins embedded in the data center development, Mike, are orders of magnitude higher. Certainly on the basis of market value under industrial use or purchase products under industrial use. So we would be doing that even if the market was tight as a drum, and by the way, let's not get carried away. The market is in the high 4s occupancy -- I mean vacancy, sorry. That is -- absent '21 and '22, I would have said that would be my Christmas present would be vacancy rates that are sub-5% in any part of the cycle other than the last couple of years.So the markets are strong, but the data center opportunities, if you can get the power, the demand is there and it's been sort of boosted by AI and a bunch of other things. So we see sort of a rush of the large players, and they're all big credit players into the business, and they can't get enough of this stuff to keep up with demand.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Bill Crow with Raymond James.William Andrew CrowTwo quick questions. First of all, on the economy, I'm wondering if you're seeing any changes to your watch list among your tenants or any sectors in particular that are starting to show weakness. And the second question is really in order to get the kind of 9%, the returns on acquisitions, do you have to target longer walls? Or how do you get that if we don't see distress among current holders or owners?Hamid R. MoghadamSo our credit issues are fairly modest, and they usually involve retailers, and we have a built-in 85% plus mark-to-market on those leases that we've identified as potential risks. And we've actually captured some of those spreads and already improved our position by buying out those leases or just getting them back and re-leasing the space in a short period of time. So I don't think credit is a particularly important consideration in this cycle.Timothy D. ArndtAnd then the second question on the extended walls being necessary for the kind of IRRs we're targeting in acquisitions.Hamid R. MoghadamWe're using the same lease terms and acquisitions than we always have been. There's not -- I mean, if you look at 30 years of history, I mean, our walls have been between 4.5 years and 6 years or something like that on average in our leases. So it doesn't move around that much.Daniel Stephen LetterYes. Then I would just pile on there that we look at these opportunities of whether it be 1- to 3- or 4-year years of negative leverage as an opportunity really. We look at total return on every deal. And again, we take it through our filters of quality, mark-to-market and -- whether we want to hold it long term or not. And then we layer that on with our potential Essentials revenues and synergies and otherwise. So while it's one consideration, so are all these other factors.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo.Blaine Matthew HeckJust wanted to follow up on guidance. You touched on this a little bit. The guidance implies a decrease in FFO in the fourth quarter. Can you just talk a little bit more specifically about some of the moving pieces there and onetime items that are influencing the numbers in the third or fourth quarters and whether any of that noise is going to persist into 2024?Timothy D. ArndtYes, I'll answer the last part. No, I don't expect anything into 2024. Basically, of the $0.03, a couple of pennies that were related to termination income from some leases that were canceled and then higher interest income there's about $0.02 there, I would call that, that's permanent to the year. And then the other $0.01 in the quarter, I would say it was more of a timing issue, specifically in taxes. We'll see some lower taxes in the third quarter but higher again in the fourth quarter. So if you take that with regard to the role, if you take that $0.03 out you're basically rolling from, let's call it, $1.30 to $1.28 in the fourth quarter is what's implied in our guidance.And basically, you would roll NOI forward. We're going to probably add $0.02 from just base same-store growth quarter-over-quarter. And then the declines are going to come from mainly ramping of development. We see much more investment in land and CIP starting to build. And you should be aware in your models, our cost of funding development in the short term is essentially 6%. Think of that as SOFR plus our line rate. We're capping interest at our in-place debt is how this works. That's at 3%.So in the short term, that's a drag on core FFO seen mainly in interest expense. Obviously, over the long term, the margin and value creation is there. But we will see that drag pick up as developments ramp.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities.Ki Bin KimTwo quick ones here. First, on the utilization rate that ticked down a little bit this quarter. I was wondering if you can provide any more color on that? And second, if you look at the larger development landscape, and look at competitors that are developing, I would assume that the pressure for them to lease up space and maybe they have to pay back the loans to banks, probably increases as we move forward. I'm not sure how big these developers are or how much capital they have behind them. But is there any risk that as these developers look to secure tenants that could drive rental rates lower going forward?Christopher N. CatonKi Bin, I'll take the utilization question. Thanks for it. As you see on the page and supplemental, there are multiple metrics on the page and we look at all of them in totality and additional ones that are not included in the supplemental. So we have a range of proprietary data, whether it's our IBI survey, tenants in the market, customer decision-making time frames, our sales pipeline. Specific to the utilization data, that lags, that does not lead economic and real estate cycles. We've seen that over time. And so what I think, this is best understood in the context of today's retail sales numbers, which shows a resilient consumer that is outperforming expectations and leading to lower utilization levels.Hamid R. MoghadamYes. On the second issue of opportunities, there are a lot of merchant developers that were bank financed and active in the market. And they are just about completing their projects now. They have some interest reserve, obviously built in into their lease-up plans, but their lease-up plans are going to get extended. So actually, I think what's going to happen is that they can't really be -- afford to rent the space at the lower rate. I think they're more likely to actually sell their positions to people with stronger balance sheets. And we've already seen and taken advantage of a couple of instances like this.So don't be surprised to see us buy some vacant completed shelves at discounts to replacement costs because -- it's because of our view on demand and supply with 65% decline in supply, we think if you get into late '24, early '25, we're going to be in a pretty strong market. So this is where our balance sheet matters. This is where the quality of location and product matters. And we're going to be very selective about the projects that I described, but that's why we've been building our balance sheet and keeping our leverage around 20% all this time. This is when we put it to work.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street.Vince James TiboneI have a follow-up on an earlier comment about 20% of your markets, you're managing for occupancy, now pushing rents. So what are those markets where industrial landlords have less pricing power today?Christopher N. CatonSure, Vince. We covered a couple of them, talked about Southern California, point to Houston, Indianapolis and then outside the U.S., the softest market might be Poland and China. And I think I'd offer now that market vacancies are beginning to gap out again, I think we're going to see quality make a bigger difference in terms of portfolio mix.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho.Vikram L. MalhotraJust wanted to get your thoughts to just clarify one thing more broadly. Two trends, I guess, one, just the whole reshoring theme that we're hearing more and more about. And then second, just Amazon, as they've put a lot of capital into the course and across the country. I'm just wondering sort of when you marry those 2 things together, is there sort of greater investment kind of moving towards the Midwest or more manufacturing pockets? Is that sort of an opportunity for PLD going forward?Hamid R. MoghadamSo generally speaking, I would say, on where manufacturing is taking place, in Asia, there's a lot of manufacturing still in Asia. It's not all in China, and it has been gradually declining in China in the last couple of years anyway. It was first moving to Western China, and then it was spreading to other places in Southeast Asia. But there are going to be strong flows still from those places. It's just not going to be all from China, but the container doesn't care whether it's coming from somewhere else or China. It lands in the same ports. Secondly, demand is -- in our product is mostly driven by consumption and not manufacturing. In manufacturing, the finished product ends up in a container and on a truck or a ship, so the warehouse is a truck order ship. So that manufacturing per se doesn't generate a lot of demand. When those containers land in places where consumption takes place, that's when the demand is generated for deconsolidation.Now those markets happen to be in populous parts of the country because that's where the consumption is. And those markets tend to be high barrier to entry markets. So we don't think the dynamic of onshoring, to the extent that it exists, is going to change things around all that much. The biggest beneficiary of onshoring has been actually near shoring and it's been in Northern Mexico. Northern Mexico markets are 100% occupied, and there's insatiable demand for product in those markets. And most of that is for -- are basically distribution buildings that are used for manufacturing purposes.So that's where we've seen the material demand. If there's more demand coming for manufacturing in the U.S., a, we haven't really seen it. And if we do see it, we'll be the beneficiary of it because we're well positioned in those central markets as well.OperatorAnd our last question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo.Blaine Matthew HeckHamid, just a bigger picture question for you. Can you talk about how you're thinking about managing exposure to geopolitical risk and instability? And maybe to what extent the latest turmoil in the Middle East could impact your operations, if at all?Hamid R. MoghadamYes. I think the effect is going to be indirect because the Middle East is not obviously a source of product or exports or we're not active in any of those markets. So it will be a second order effect on the macro economy. And if the Fed remains very aggressive on rates, if you believe their talk, and all of a sudden, we have some drop-off in demand because people -- that conflict expands and the nightmare scenario would be that a couple of tankers get sunk in the Persian Gulf at the narrow end and oil goes to $200 a barrel. I mean the bets are off.But boy, if we see that scenario, I can't think of a better business to want to be in. I hate to see that scenario happen. But actually, on a relative basis, it should be good for our business because it will mean that people will -- first of all, inventory becomes really important. And it means that it's yet one more uncertainty like the pandemic, like the earthquake, like all these other disruptions that we've seen that will push the general posture of companies from just in time to just in case. So I hate to say, it would be good because it's an awful situation that's going there. And before this is all over, a lot of innocent people are going to get killed, and I don't want to see this happen. But I don't think its impact on the business on a relative basis is going to be terrible.I'm honestly more worried about the Fed overdoing it than that conflict escalating. But those things are very hard to predict. I think that was our last question. So we really appreciate your participation. We really look forward to seeing all of you at our upcoming Investor Day, and I promise it will be really good. So take care.OperatorThis concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day.]"

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)Logistics real estate investment trust Prologis pointed to geopolitical unrest and rising interest rates as factors weighing on customer decisions around investment in warehousing space.Prologis (NYSE: PLD) beat third-quarter expectations Tuesday, posting core funds from operations (FFO) of $1.30, which was 5 cents ahead of the consensus estimate but 43 cents lower year over year (y/y).The company expects project completions to outpace net absorptions by 150 million to 250 million square feet over the next three quarters. At that point, however, the trend is expected to reverse with demand outstripping supply by 75 million to 125 million square feet over a three-quarter period. The forecast is rooted in a lack of macroeconomic clarity, which is expected to result in a lower level of development starts over that time frame.“Demand is definitely softer — it’s closer to normal, maybe even a little bit below normal at this instant,” co-founder and CEO Hamid Moghadam told analysts on a Tuesday call. He noted “a lot of latent demand” among customers and said that most are reluctant to “pull the trigger.”Portfolio occupancy remained high at 97.1% in the quarter but was 60 basis points lower y/y. Net effective rent change (over the entire lease term) increased more than 2,400 bps to 84%. The company said rent growth was the strongest in the Sun Belt, mid-Atlantic and Northern California regions but fell 2% in Southern California as vacancy rates have ticked up in that market.The company said rent growth continues to stay positive by an amount that is in line with or outpacing inflation. For the full year, rent growth is expected to shake out 7% higher in the U.S., which implies a slight acceleration from a year-to-date mid-6% increase.Prologis plans to provide more color on future rents at an investor day in December.Table: Prologis’ key performance indicatorsMarking existing leases to current market rents across Prologis’ entire portfolio (over the full lease term) equaled 62% at the end of September.Story continuesPrologis commenced leases on 46.4 million square feet of space during the third quarter, which was a 9% y/y decline. It said appraised values on its U.S. properties were down 3% in the period, largely due to changes in interest rates and an overall weakening in the market.The company had nearly $1 billion in development starts in the period and raised the full-year outlook for starts by $500 million to a range of $3 billion to $3.5 billion. However, it noted that built-to-suits for data centers is driving demand while industrial-related demand is closer to flat.Management said a loosening market is expected to provide it with more acquisition opportunities in the coming months.Prologis raised the front end of its guidance range by 2 cents.

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly. Top 5 Upgrades: Goldman Sachs upgraded Dollar Tree (DLTR) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $137, down from $150. The firm sees strong earnings growth potential supported by continued market share gains from improving traffic trends with ""sticky"" new customers, an improving discretionary cash flow outlook for lower- and middle-income consumers in 2024, and better shopability after recent investments.Exane BNP Paribas upgraded Mondelez (MDLZ) to Outperform from Neutral with a $75 price target. The firm says the company's lower exposure to the U.S. market is likely a positive.Citi upgraded Progressive (PGR) to Neutral from Sell with a price target of $158, up from $120. The firm believes the case for an inflection in personal auto margins has strengthened.Mizuho last night upgraded Lennox (LII) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $460, up from $340. The firm says the company's earnings potential ""too pronounced to ignore.""Wolfe Research upgraded FIS (FIS) to Outperform from Peer Perform with a $65 price target. The upgrade is driven by the stock's relative valuation and expected sentiment upon the Worldpay sale and underlying RemainCo fundamentals, the firm says.Top 5 Downgrades:Citi downgraded SunPower (SPWR) to Sell from Neutral with a price target of $4.50, down from $10. The firm expects residential solar to have ""another tough quarter"" and sees risk to the guidance from SunPower. Morgan Stanley also downgraded SunPower to Underweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $5, down from $8.Goldman Sachs downgraded BJ's Wholesale (BJ) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $73, down from $75. The firm sees limited earnings upside to consensus estimates for fiscal 2024, and sees a full valuation at current share levels.Barclays downgraded NOV Inc. (NOV) to Underweight from Equal Weight with an unchanged price target of $20. The firm says NOV is at a ""structural disadvantage"" this cycle as service companies restrain capex and drilling contractors consolidate, as opposed to the build out of equipment and assets in the prior cycle.Cantor Fitzgerald downgraded Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP) to Neutral from Overweight. Crispr owns 40% of exa-cel, an ex vivo autologous cell therapy being developed by partner Vertex (VRTX), and Cantor expects exa-cel to become the leading therapy for sickle cell disorder, though it could take time to break down the many potential barriers to adoption.Baird downgraded H.B. Fuller (FUL) to Neutral from Outperform with an unchanged price target of $80. The firm cites year-to-date outperformance against a backdrop of ""rapid volatility that has severely weighed on other portions of our coverage,"" stating that its margin expansion thesis for H.B. Fuller ""has unfolded.""Top 5 Initiations: Loop Capital initiated coverage of Microsoft (MSFT) with a Buy rating and $425 price target. The company's growth is set to accelerate driven by its two most strategic businesses, Azure and generative artificial intelligence products, the firm tells investors in a research note.Cantor Fitzgerald initiated coverage of Bluebird Bio (BLUE) with a Neutral rating and no price target. Cantor expects Bluebird's lovo-cel to be approved on or around its PDUFA date and believes its profile is more similar than different from Vertex and Crispr's exa-cel, but feels cell therapies face multiple barriers to penetrating the sickle cell disorder market.Deutsche Bank initiated coverage of ViaSat (VSAT) with a Hold rating and $22 price target. The firm believes positives are overshadowed by ViaSat's recent satellite anomalies and high leverage, ""which is further exacerbated by big capex spending plans.""Craig-Hallum initiated coverage of Potbelly (PBPB) with a Buy rating and $15 price target. Potbelly has significant momentum and vastly improved operations driven by an experienced management team positioned to succeed, the firm says.Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of TripAdvisor (TRIP) with a Buy rating and $22 price target. The firm sees upside to Street estimates on the back of faster revenue growth at Viator/Experiences and operating efficiencies leading to better profitability.]"

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 24, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis truck maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.06 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +40.1%.Revenues are expected to be $7.98 billion, up 19.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.77% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Paccar?For Paccar, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +3.34%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Paccar will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Paccar would post earnings of $2.14 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.33, delivering a surprise of +8.88%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Paccar appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

The report found that 98% of organizations are in the middle of their cloud journey, with three out of four reporting workloads stored on-premises, highlighting the need for a unified approach to hybrid multi-cloud architectures and continued innovation in both on-premises all-flash storage and public cloud storage to enable AI adoption at scale.""Enterprises face a complex technology landscape fraught with security risks and pressures to keep up with emerging technologies like AI while reducing environmental impacts,"" said Sandeep Singh, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Enterprise Storage at NetApp. ""The Data Complexity Report underscores that amidst this complexity, innovative cloud-enabled Flash storage solutions are needed to address the evolving demands of AI, enhance efficiency, and bolster resilience against the escalating cyber threats within the data ecosystem.""Cloud Adoption: Organizations are in the Middle of Their JourneyMigration to the cloud hasn’t been a linear journey for many businesses, according to the report. Of all tech executives with plans to migrate workloads to the cloud, three out of four still have most of their workloads stored on-premises. However, AI adoption is the biggest driver for cloud migration, and cloud is a major enabler for AI adoption. Seventy-four percent of respondents said they’re using public cloud services for AI and analytics. Tech executives globally (39%) say their top need for Flash innovation is to optimize AI performance, cost and efficiency.AI is Driving Further Need for Cloud AdoptionThe enterprise continues to embrace AI, with 72 percent of respondents already using generative AI and 74 percent leveraging public cloud AI and analytics services. However, AI deployment comes with its own set of complex challenges. According to the study, data security (57 percent), data integration (50 percent), and talent scarcity (45 percent) persist as barriers.Story continuesMeanwhile, IT leaders continue to make a case for more funding, as nearly two-thirds (63 percent) of AI budgets come from new funding rather than reallocated budgets, and 65 percent of C-suite and IT leaders expect to engage new vendors as AI’s influence within their infrastructure expands.Data Security Concerns Cause Further ComplexitySecurity threats continue to loom large among C-level executives and IT decision makers in the era of AI. According to the report, 87 percent of C-suite and board members cited ransomware as a high or top priority, while more than half of C-suite and board-level executives (55 percent) stated ransomware attack mitigation as the top priority in their company. Forty percent of respondents ranked security threats and data privacy among the top causes of complexity in their storage infrastructure.Further, nearly half (48 percent) of respondents also predicted that it would take days or weeks for their company to recover from cyberattacks, representing a potentially devastating risk to their business.""Cyberattacks are only intensifying and C-Suite and board-level executives recognize the critical need to both protect against these attacks while being prepared to recover from ransomware should one succeed,"" said Jeff Baxter, Vice President of Product Marketing at NetApp. ""While ransomware protection requires a cyber-resilient full-stack architecture, leaders are increasingly demanding storage vendors that offer guarantees for recovery of data after a ransomware attack.""Sustainability is a Top Concern in Technology InnovationReducing environmental impact is no longer a nice-to-have – it is now informing key technology decisions in the enterprise. According to the study, 83 percent of respondents cited sustainability as an important deciding factor when choosing storage vendors. Further, more than half (50 percent) recognize that reducing energy and carbon footprint is central to responsible AI, while 84 percent agree that reducing their company’s carbon footprint is an important part of sustainability initiatives.These Challenges are Uniquely Addressed by Cloud-Enabled Flash StorageLooking to the future of Flash storage, the impact of AI on both buying decisions and expectations for innovation is undeniable. According to the study, 39 percent of respondents want Flash storage solutions that optimize AI performance.Security and data privacy are also top of mind when it comes to storage innovation. Sixty-one percent of tech executives cited either data security or data privacy among their top choices for where they want to see Flash storage design breakthroughs in the next three years.Sustainability was a third area of expected innovation with calls for more energy efficient hardware and software and automated recommendations for reducing energy and CO2 topping the list.""Modern workloads demand Flash storage built for speed, scale, security, and sustainability,"" added Singh. ""More than ever, we must prepare for an environment capable of integrating seamlessly with AI, sparking the need for technology leaders to drive innovation and rethink everything.""MethodologyNetApp partnered with Wakefield Research to conduct a quantitative research study from September 29, 2023, to October 5, 2023, among 1,000 C-levels, tech and data executives at businesses in 6 markets: US, EMEA (France, Germany, the UK), and APAC (India, Japan).Additional Resource2023 Cloud Complexity ReportAbout NetAppNetApp is a global, cloud-led, data-centric software company that empowers organizations to lead with data in the age of accelerated digital transformation.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. View our latest analysis for NetApp NetApp's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingGenerally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. It certainly is nice to see that NetApp has managed to grow EPS by 18% per year over three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Despite consistency in EBIT margins year on year, NetApp has actually recorded a dip in revenue. This does not bode too well for short term growth prospects and so understanding the reasons for these results is of great importance.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for NetApp.Story continuesAre NetApp Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$16b company like NetApp. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Given insiders own a significant chunk of shares, currently valued at US$64m, they have plenty of motivation to push the business to succeed. This should keep them focused on creating long term value for shareholders.Does NetApp Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?For growth investors, NetApp's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. This EPS growth rate is something the company should be proud of, and so it's no surprise that insiders are holding on to a considerable chunk of shares. Fast growth and confident insiders should be enough to warrant further research, so it would seem that it's a good stock to follow. You still need to take note of risks, for example - NetApp has   2 warning signs  (and 1 which is a bit concerning)  we think you should know about.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want. But if you prefer to focus on stocks that have demonstrated insider buying, here is a list of companies with insider buying in the last three months.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

Dividends are currently distributed on a quarterly basis. Below is a chart showing annual Dividends Per Share for tracking historical trends.Pentair PLC's Dividend AnalysisBreaking Down Pentair PLC's Dividend Yield and GrowthAs of today, Pentair PLC currently has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.35% and a 12-month forward dividend yield of 1.37%. This suggests an expectation of increased dividend payments over the next 12 months.Over the past three years, Pentair PLC's annual dividend growth rate was 5.30%. Extended to a five-year horizon, this rate decreased to -8.90% per year. And over the past decade, Pentair PLC's annual dividends per share growth rate stands at -3.10%.Story continuesBased on Pentair PLC's dividend yield and five-year growth rate, the 5-year yield on cost of Pentair PLC stock as of today is approximately 0.85%.Pentair PLC's Dividend AnalysisThe Sustainability Question: Payout Ratio and ProfitabilityTo assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-06-30, Pentair PLC's dividend payout ratio is 0.29.Pentair PLC's profitability rank, offers an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers. GuruFocus ranks Pentair PLC's profitability 7 out of 10 as of 2023-06-30, suggesting good profitability prospects. The company has reported net profit in 9 years out of past 10 years.Growth Metrics: The Future OutlookTo ensure the sustainability of dividends, a company must have robust growth metrics. Pentair PLC's growth rank of 7 out of 10 suggests that the company's growth trajectory is good relative to its competitors.Revenue is the lifeblood of any company, and Pentair PLC's revenue per share, combined with the 3-year revenue growth rate, indicates a strong revenue model. Pentair PLC's revenue has increased by approximately 12.80% per year on average, a rate that outperforms than approximately 67.42% of global competitors.The company's 3-year EPS growth rate showcases its capability to grow its earnings, a critical component for sustaining dividends in the long run. During the past three years, Pentair PLC's earnings increased by approximately 11.30% per year on average, a rate that outperforms than approximately 49.36% of global competitors.Lastly, the company's 5-year EBITDA growth rate of 31.50%, outperforms than approximately 85.24% of global competitors.Next StepsIn conclusion, while Pentair PLC's dividend payments have seen a decline in growth rate over the past five years, the company's strong profitability, low payout ratio, and robust growth metrics indicate a sustainable dividend. The company's consistent record of net profit and promising growth rank further bolster the sustainability of its dividends. As such, Pentair PLC presents an attractive option for investors seeking reliable dividend income.

PNR’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year in the last reported quarter.The company has an impressive earnings surprise history. Pentair beat earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 8.8%.Pentair plc Price and EPS Surprise Pentair plc price-eps-surprise | Pentair plc QuoteQ3 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $990 million, indicating a decline of 6.2% from the year-ago reported figure. Core revenues are expected to fall 8.8%.The consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at 87 cents per share, suggesting a year-over-year decline of 12.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings has been unchanged over the past 60 days.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Pentair. this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here, as you can see below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: Pentair has an Earnings ESP of -0.22%. Zacks Rank: Pentair currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3.Key Factors to NotePNR has been clearing out its inventory. This ongoing optimization of inventory levels is expected to have impacted volumes in the third quarter. We, thus, expect volume to fall 10.1% year over year in the third quarter.Pentair has been witnessing a tight supply of raw materials, such as metals, resins and electronics, along with rising logistics costs. While it has been implementing pricing actions and focusing on productivity improvements that may have negated these headwinds, supply-chain pressures and inflationary costs are likely to have weighed on the quarter’s performance.Story continuesHowever, PNR has been focusing on productivity improvements, which is likely to have contributed to earnings in the quarter. We expect the price to rise 3.4% year over year in the quarter.Gains from the Manitowoc Ice acquisition and benefits from the Transformation program are expected to have helped offset the impacts of higher costs and low volumes in the second quarter. Our model predicts acquisitions to have a positive impact of 0.6% on third-quarter revenues.The company has been witnessing weak demand in the pool business recently. Reflecting this, we expect the Pool segment’s sales to be $295 million, indicating a year-over-year decline of 24.5%. The downside is driven by the ongoing inventory reduction. The segment’s operating income is expected to fall 19.8% year over year to $87.6 million.Our model predicts the Water Solutions segment’s net sales to increase 3.7% year over year to $285 million in the quarter. The operating income is expected to increase 30.9% to $64.5 million.We expect Industrial &amp; Flow Technologies’ revenues to be $401 million, indicating an improvement of 2.9% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for this segment’s operating profit is expected to be $67.1 million, suggesting growth of 2.1% from the year-ago reported figure.Price PerformanceShares of PNR have gained 55.4% in the past year compared with the industry’s growth of 3.6%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Stocks to ConsiderHere are some stocks with the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.ESAB Corporation ESAB, scheduled to release earnings on Nov 1, has an Earnings ESP of +0.81% and sports a Zacks Rank of 1 at present.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 24, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.87 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -12.1%.Revenues are expected to be $990.01 million, down 6.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.23% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Pentair plc?For Pentair plc, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.22%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Pentair plc will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Pentair plc would post earnings of $0.95 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.03, delivering a surprise of +8.42%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Pentair plc doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But Lum has gotten more than that out of her membership: She's also learning how to communicate better with her colleagues, making her a stronger performer at work.""English is not my native language,"" says Lum. ""When I get nervous, my accent may come out and I often speak faster in meetings. It makes it challenging for people to understand what I'm saying.""With the support of her ERG, though, she's picked up tips for sidestepping such language barriers. ""We focus on slowing down during public speaking,"" she says. ""Taking a moment to reset can really help you to facilitate a meeting better and to articulate things in a better way.""Through two recent initiatives in particular, HOLA is working to ensure that all employees at Boston Scientific have the resources they need to feel they belong, and can succeed, at the company.Breaking down language barriersThe HOLA Coaching program was launched two years ago to help employees improve their language skills through six sessions a year with Laura Mathis, an executive communications coach. Discussion topics include speaking persuasively and how to be more concise.The program fulfills a pressing need in the Boston Scientific community: The company has many employees who do not speak English as their first language, not only at its many sites around the world, but also in the United States.""When English is not your first language, there can be a lot to learn about pronunciation,"" says Lorena Trujillo Castillo, a packaging graphics specialist based in Heredia, Costa Rica. ""Through this program, I've improved my presentation skills. I've learned that I should speak a little louder and not be afraid to show my personality in meetings.""Story continuesEach hour-long ""Learning Café"" held by Mathis is recorded and made available to all Boston Scientific employees. The opportunity to make a difference at the company worldwide inspired Castillo to get involved with the program beyond simply participating: In 2023, she ran the Coaching program.""I wanted to help others whose first language is not English - not just the Latin community, but also people in regions across the globe,"" she explains.Being empowered to learn and growIn 2022, HOLA started a mentoring program exclusively for the ERG's group leads, who are all employee volunteers. The aim was to help them feel confident in their roles and own their paths to leadership within the company.This year, the program has opened to all company employees, but the goal remains the same: providing people with educational seminars and mentoring to foster career growth.In each of six sessions a year, attendees learn about a key development area - from building your brand to learning to delegate - from a Boston Scientific leader. They then split up into groups to meet with mentors who have significant experience at the company. Mentees are encouraged to continue relationships with their mentors outside of these sessions.While the skills covered are pertinent to all employees, many of the experiences shared by company leaders have particularly resonated with the program's Hispanic participants, says program leader and engineer Brian Luis, whether they involve dealing with imposter syndrome or determining the best next steps in their career.""We've had Jeff Lemaster, vice president of VarithenaTM sales and marketing, talking about living on the border between Texas and Mexico and how that has affected his professional experiences,"" says Luis. ""Ebony Travis, director of Global Well-being and HR Policy, spoke of learning to own both the Black and Latina sides of her identity, including at work. This program wouldn't be possible without our senior leaders and their willingness to reveal personal insights. It shows they really care about this company, and it makes our mentees feel not just empowered, but valued, heard and seen.""Boston Scientific is committed to fostering a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace where all our employees can bring their authentic selves to work and thrive personally and professionally.

""We're banding together to ensure the long-term viability of our being able to continue to serve the best customers in Maine. Fairness, consistency and predictability shouldn't be a whole lot to ask for when it comes to being able to have the tools necessary to provide our customers the experience they want and deserve.""Coffee By Design baristas cited low wages by industry standards, uneven hours that make benefits inconsistent, and an ad-hoc disciplinary system and working conditions that are incongruent with best practices as the impetus for forming a union. They say that only by speaking with a unified voice can change take place.""The free and fair choice to form a union shouldn't be up for debate,"" barista Valen Doe said. ""With so many of us standing in solidarity for a better, more collaborative way forward, we trust that the ownership and management will see that working together is far more efficient and cost effective than the alternative.""Jason J. Shedlock, the regional organizer and secretary for Local 327, said about 20 baristas work full- and part-time shifts at Coffee by Design's three locations on Congress Street, Diamond Street and India Street. Coffee by Design announced on Friday that it was temporarily closing its Congress Street location because of a staff shortage.If Coffee By Design's owner, Mary Allen Lindemann, does not voluntarily agree to enter into collective bargaining negotiations with her staff, Shedlock said he will file a petition to hold an election with the National Labor Relations Board. That election, he estimated, could take place within three to six weeks, but he is hopeful that there will be no need to file a petition.Story continues""I've been impressed with these workers. They really love their customers. They treat them as though they were family,"" he said.Coffee By Design opened its first coffeehouse in 1994 in Congress Street in the middle of what was known then as the city's ""porn district,"" according to a brief history posted on the company's website. Coffee By Design said the store helped lead to a revitalization of the neighborhood and ""has led to the thriving Arts District we enjoy today.""This story will be updated.]"

TRIKAFTA® was previously approved by Health Canada for use in people with CF 6 years and older with at least one F508del mutation.Vertex (CNW Group/Vertex Pharmaceuticals (Canada) Inc.)""With this approval, approximately 330 Canadian children are for the first time eligible for a medicine that treats the underlying cause of their CF,"" said Michael Siauw, General Manager at Vertex Pharmaceuticals (Canada) Incorporated. ""We are working closely with private and provincial payers to secure coverage as quickly as possible for this expanded indication of TRIKAFTA.""This label expansion was supported by a 24-week Phase 3 open-label study which enrolled 75 children with CF ages 2 to 5 years old with at least one copy of the F508del mutation to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of TRIKAFTA®. The regimen was generally well-tolerated, with a safety profile consistent with that observed in older age groups, and led to improvements in sweat chloride concentration, a measure of CFTR function, and lung function.""Clinical trials have demonstrated that treatment with TRIKAFTA results in significantly improved health outcomes for many children and adults living with CF, most recently in those as young as 2 years of age,"" said Dr. Jonathan Rayment, Investigator and Respirologist at British Columbia Children's Hospital, Clinical Assistant Professor in the UBC Department of Pediatrics, and Trial Investigator in the TRIKAFTA 2-to-5-year-old clinical trial. ""Hopefully, intervention in the early phases of CF will slow the progression of the disease, allowing these children to live their lives to the fullest.""Story continuesVertex has submitted this indication to both the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) and the Institut national d'excellence en santé et en services sociaux (INESSS) in Québec for Health Technology Assessments.About Cystic FibrosisCystic fibrosis (CF) is a rare, life-shortening genetic disease affecting more than 88,000 people globally. CF is a progressive, multi-organ disease that affects the lungs, liver, pancreas, GI tract, sinuses, sweat glands and reproductive tract. CF is caused by a defective and/or missing CFTR protein resulting from certain mutations in the CFTR gene. Children must inherit two defective CFTR genes — one from each parent — to have CF, and these mutations can be identified by a genetic test. While there are many different types of CFTR mutations that can cause the disease, the vast majority of people with CF have at least one F508del mutation. CFTR mutations lead to CF by causing CFTR protein to be defective or by leading to a shortage or absence of CFTR protein at the cell surface. The defective function and/or absence of CFTR protein results in poor flow of salt and water into and out of the cells in a number of organs. In the lungs, this leads to the buildup of abnormally thick, sticky mucus, chronic lung infections and progressive lung damage that eventually leads to death for many patients. The median age of death is in the early 30s.About PrTRIKAFTA® (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor)In people with certain types of mutations in the CFTR gene, the CFTR protein is not processed or folded normally within the cell, and this can prevent the CFTR protein from reaching the cell surface and functioning properly. TRIKAFTA® (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor) is an oral medicine designed to increase the quantity and function of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. Elexacaftor and tezacaftor work together to increase the amount of mature protein at the cell surface. Ivacaftor, which is known as a CFTR potentiator, is designed to facilitate the ability of CFTR proteins to transport salt and water across the cell membrane. The combined actions of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor help hydrate and clear mucus from the airways.TRIKAFTA® (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor) is a prescription medicine used for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 2 years and older who have at least one copy of the F508del mutation, or another mutation responsive to TRIKAFTA®, in the CFTR gene. Patients should talk to their doctor to learn if they have an indicated CF gene mutation. It is not known if TRIKAFTA® is safe and effective in children under 2 years of age.About VertexVertex is a global biotechnology company that invests in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for people with serious diseases. The company has multiple approved medicines that treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (CF) — a rare, life-threatening genetic disease — and has several ongoing clinical and research programs in CF. Beyond CF, Vertex has a robust clinical pipeline of investigational small molecule, mRNA, cell and genetic therapies (including gene editing) in other serious diseases where it has deep insight into causal human biology, including sickle cell disease, beta thalassemia, APOL1-mediated kidney disease, acute and neuropathic pain, type 1 diabetes and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.Founded in 1989 in Cambridge, Mass., Vertex's global headquarters is now located in Boston's Innovation District and its international headquarters is in London. Additionally, the company has research and development sites and commercial offices in North America, Europe, Australia and Latin America.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, could be a great candidate to consider.When looking at the last two reports, this drugmaker has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 2.21%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the last reported quarter, Vertex came out with earnings of $3.89 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.85 per share, representing a surprise of 1.04%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $2.95 per share and it actually produced earnings of $3.05 per share, delivering a surprise of 3.39%.For Vertex, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Vertex has an Earnings ESP of +1.25% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on November 6, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) — which has counted McDonald's as a member since 1985 — is off slightly during the same timespan.Zoom out, and you will see the selling pressure in McDonald's (MCD) the most acutely in the last three months — shares have dropped 15.2%.The stock hit a 52-week low of $246.19 on Oct. 12.""You have to go back more than 20 years … all the way back to the 2002 lows … to find a time when McDonald's was more oversold on its RSI [Relative Strength Index] chart than it was at its early October lows!"" Miller Tabak chief market strategist Matt Maley told Yahoo Finance by email.So what gives with the often safe-haven play in McDonald's? This is usually a blue chip stock that investors eat up when the world becomes more volatile, as is currently the case with fresh Middle East tensions.Blame Wall Street's obsession with the longer-term impact of weight loss drugs (formally known as GLP-1 drugs) such as Ozempic on companies that sell anything with extra sugar, extra fat, and extra processed ingredients.The sell-off has blasted shares of everyone from McDonald's to soda kings Coca-Cola (KO) and PepsiCo (PEP) to Slim Jim selling Conagra Brands (CAG).Indeed the concern in the marketplace isn't totally misplaced.Data from IMS/IQVIA suggests around 10.6 million shots of obesity drug doses were officially sanctioned by Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY) in the US in May 2023.Dividing this figure by 4.5 weeks in a month suggests that the user base was around 2.4 million adults in May.""The concerns surrounding the impact that the weight loss drugs will have on [McDonald's] has caused its stock to drop,"" Maley contends.Story continuesA Deliveroo rider stands beside a bicycle outside a McDonald's restaurant in London, Dec. 10, 2021. (May James/REUTERS) (May James / reuters)While the sell-off in the Golden Arches has been brutal for the bulls, the Street has been hesitant to toss in the towel and serve up rating downgrades.""The recent weakness of the MCD stock screams unfairness. After all, many investors bought the stock for its resilience under any macro scenarios and protection against market volatility,"" said Citi analyst Jon Tower in a client note.Analysts like Tower point to several favorable attributes to the McDonald's business model that may be getting lost in the intense focus on weight loss drugs.They include a mostly franchised business model that lends itself to higher profit margins, efforts by management to accelerate the opening of new restaurants, and a push to digital in drive-through orders and on mobile devices.Adds Tower, ""While the GLP-1 risk is hard to measure, the current multiple may not fully reflect McDonald's wider appeal led by greater digital, delivery and drive through investments coupled with more craveable options and improved marketing execution.""Whether investors will view a discounted McDonald's stock as craveable before year end, the verdict is out.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

403,3d39efad-0075-3492-8104-36685d11dbd6,KO,2023-10-18,Coca-Cola (KO) Reports Next Week: What to Know Ahead of the Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coca-cola-ko-reports-next-140103118.html,1697551263,STORY,['KO'],"[Coca-Cola (KO) is expected to deliver flat earnings compared to the year-ago quarter on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 24, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis world's largest beverage maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.69 per share in its upcoming report, which represents no change from the year-ago quarter.Revenues are expected to be $11.46 billion, up 3.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.59% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Coke?For Coke, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.09%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Coke will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Coke would post earnings of $0.72 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.78, delivering a surprise of +8.33%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Coke doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

By combining their expertise and global reach, both companies are poised to set a new standard for quality, taste and convenience.The inspiration for this RTD cocktail stems from the popular mixer choices among consumers. It is worth noting that vodka is the favored base for alcoholic RTD beverages and lemon-based soft drinks are frequently used as mixers in pre-mixed cocktails.Shares of Coca-Cola have lost 5.4% in the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 0.4%. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company fared better than the sector’s fall of 6.9%. The S&amp;P 500 gained 16.7% in the same period.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research The Perfect Blend: Absolut Vodka Meets SpriteThe innovative offering combines Pernod’s international premium vodka, Absolut, with Coca-Cola’s world-renowned lemon-lime flavored sparkling soft drink, Sprite. The combination promises a refreshing and convenient cocktail experience for consumers looking for a taste of sophistication on the go.The Absolut Vodka &amp; Sprite RTD cocktail offers a harmonious blend of flavors. The citrus notes from Sprite enhance the natural vibrancy of Absolut Vodka, creating a well-rounded and enjoyable drinking experience.

This diversity ensures that consumers with varying taste preferences can indulge in the perfect blend of flavors.The initial launch is slated for early 2024, with select European countries in the spotlight. The U.K., the Netherlands, Spain and Germany will be among the first to experience this innovative concoction. This strategic rollout allows both companies to gauge consumer reception and refine their approach before expanding further.The global benchmark for alcohol beverage volume will be set at 5%, although this may vary by market. The companies have made it a priority to ensure responsible marketing practices and packaging. Cans will feature clear responsibility symbols, emphasizing that the drink is intended solely for consumers of legal drinking age.The Absolut Vodka &amp; Sprite RTD cocktail is poised to revolutionize the RTD beverage market, offering consumers a premium and convenient option for on-the-go indulgence. With its exquisite flavor profile and commitment to sustainability, this partnership between Coca-Cola and Pernod is not just about a beverage; it is about setting a new standard for consumer satisfaction and industry innovation.Story continuesConclusionCompanies in the beverage space are expected to benefit from the expansion into newer and adjacent categories, including capturing market share in the fast-growing RTD alcoholic beverage category through collaborations. RTD has emerged as the fastest-growing category since 2018.Coca-Cola has lately been focusing on diversifying its portfolio to tap into the rapidly growing RTD alcohol beverages category as part of its innovation strategy. Some of the company’s notable collaborations to launch RTD beverages include those with Molson Coors TAP and Brown-Forman (BF.B).Coca-Cola tied up with Molson Coors to launch Topo Chico Hard Seltzer and later launched the Simply Spiked Lemonade in early 2022. It launched another spirit-based drink, FRESCA Mixed cocktails, in collaboration with Corona brewer Constellation Brands in 2022.In June 2022, Coca-Cola collaborated with Brown-Forman to introduce the iconic Jack &amp; Coke cocktail. The RTD pre-mixed cocktail is made using Brown-Forman’s Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey and Coca-Cola. The companies launched the cocktail initially in Mexico and later made it available in markets worldwide. Jack &amp; Coke cocktail marks its fourth new alcoholic drink in less than two years, thus strengthening its presence in the alcoholic beverage space.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

406,a7b74fd3-95b3-3cf1-b924-9fd9185de587,WM,2023-10-18,Waste Management (WM) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/waste-management-wm-earnings-expected-140050610.html,1697551250,STORY,['WM'],"[The market expects Waste Management (WM) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 24. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis garbage and recycling hauler is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.61 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +3.2%.Revenues are expected to be $5.26 billion, up 3.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.02% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Waste Management?For Waste Management, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.31%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Waste Management will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Waste Management would post earnings of $1.54 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.51, delivering a surprise of -1.95%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Waste Management doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with SYK.As of 2023-10-17, Stryker Corp's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $114.89. It's currently trading at a price of $264.09. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -129.86%. The company is significantly overvalued.Stryker Corp: An Exploration into Its Intrinsic ValueThe modelThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Stryker Corp's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.AssumptionsTermValueExplanationEPS without NRI$7.08GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.Discount Rate11%An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.76%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.Growth StageGrowth rate (g1) = 10.20% Years of Growth Stage = 10We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.Terminal StageGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.CalculationGrowth Stage=EPS without NRI*[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)*(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=68.05Terminal Stage=EPS without NRI*(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10*[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)+(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=46.84Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)=Growth Stage+Terminal Stage=114.89Discounted Free Cash Flow ModelGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $82.49. This valuation indicates that the Stryker Corp is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -220.15%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.Story continuesThe Bottom LinePlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation.  Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.Navigating with GuruFocus:Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

One such stock that merits attention is DaVita Inc (NYSE:DVA). The stock, which is currently priced at 76.58, recorded a gain of 2.7% in a day and a 3-month decrease of 28.12%. The stock's fair valuation is $128.59, as indicated by its GF Value.Understanding GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with DVA.The GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at, GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of the business performance.Is DaVita (DVA) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapDaVita's Potential RisksHowever, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with DaVita should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of 1.31. These indicators suggest that DaVita, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Understanding Altman Z-scoreBefore delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Company OverviewDaVita is the largest provider of dialysis services in the United States, boasting market share that eclipses 35% when measured by both patients and clinics. The firm operates over 3,000 facilities worldwide, mostly in the U.S., and treats over 240,000 patients globally each year. Government payers dominate U.S. dialysis reimbursement. DaVita receives about two thirds of U.S. sales at government (primarily Medicare) reimbursement rates, with the remainder coming from commercial insurers. However, while commercial insurers represented only about 10% of the U.S. patients treated, they represent nearly all of the profits generated by DaVita in the U.S. dialysis business.Story continuesIs DaVita (DVA) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapDaVita's Low Altman Z-Score: A Breakdown of Key DriversA dissection of DaVita's Altman Z-score reveals DaVita's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress. The Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio provides insights into a company's capability to reinvest its profits or manage debt. Evaluating DaVita's historical data, 2021: 0.08; 2022: 0.04; 2023: 0.03, we observe a declining trend in this ratio. This downward movement indicates DaVita's diminishing ability to reinvest in its business or effectively manage its debt. Consequently, it exerts a negative impact on its Z-Score.ConclusionIn conclusion, despite its seemingly attractive valuation, DaVita (NYSE:DVA) might be a potential value trap based on its low Altman Z-Score and declining Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio. This underlines the importance of comprehensive due diligence in investment decision-making.

To skip the detailed analysis of the renewable energy sector and the green movement, go directly to the 5 Best Green Stocks To Invest In 2023.Renewable energy and its associated sources like wind and solar have become significant subjects of discussion, not only among everyday consumers but also within the realms of businesses, investors, and financial experts. With global warming escalating each moment, there is a growing fixation within the global community to mitigate the impact of rapid climate change and preserve the planet and its resources for future generations. The adoption of renewable energy is on the rise, emerging as the fastest-growing energy source globally. As such, a number of companies and countries have set their sights on achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050.Recent advancements have shown encouraging signs, with 2022 marking a record-breaking year for new renewable electricity capacity. As an illustration, approximately 340 gigawatts (GW) of capacity was added during the year. The implementation of significant policies in 2022, such as REPowerEU in the European Union, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in the United States, and China’s 14th Five-Year Plan for Renewable Energy, will provide added impetus to expedite the deployment of renewable electricity in the upcoming years. Notably, in 2022, China accounted for nearly half of all investments in green energy. Their investment in clean energy amounted to $546 billion, surpassing the United States, which invested $141 billion during the same period. Additionally, the European Union recently secured a provisional agreement to increase the proportion of renewable energy to 42.5% by 2030, up from the current 32%. That said, the United States isn't lagging behind by any means. In the next decade, the nation's yearly renewable energy capacity has the potential to triple, reaching 110 gigawatts (GW), propelled by advancements in clean-energy legislation spurring increased investments in the sector.Story continuesIn addition, the International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts a 3% annual increase in global electricity demand from 2023 to 2025, surpassing the growth rate seen in 2022. The firm highlights that over 70% of this surge will likely originate from China, Southeast Asia, and India. Concurrently, developed economies are striving to boost electricity production and decrease dependence on fossil fuels, particularly in heating and transportation sectors. The IEA also forecasts that renewable energy sources like solar and wind power, along with nuclear energy, will collectively cater to over 90% of the additional global demand by 2025.To take advantage of the growth of the global renewable energy industry, investors can look towards notable names within the industry that reign as some of the best clean energy stocks, including the likes of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), and NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE).11 Best Green Stocks To Invest In 2023Our MethodologyFollowing an extensive analysis of the renewable energy sector, we identified 11 of the best clean energy stocks with the highest hedge fund ownership during the second quarter of 2023.

422,bc27cf35-bad3-3dfa-8086-474fd830f174,GE,2023-10-18,Analysts Estimate 3M (MMM) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-3m-mmm-report-140051775.html,1697551251,STORY,"['MMM', 'GE']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when 3M (MMM) reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 24, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis maker of Post-it notes, industrial coatings and ceramics is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.33 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -13.4%.Revenues are expected to be $7.96 billion, down 7.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.81% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for 3M?For 3M, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.31%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that 3M will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that 3M would post earnings of $1.65 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.17, delivering a surprise of +31.52%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.3M doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Diversified Operations industry, General Electric (GE), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.56 per share for the quarter ended September 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +60%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $15.51 billion, down 18.7% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for GE has been revised 0.6% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 2.47%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), this Earnings ESP indicates that GE will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK)'s data indicates that healthcare stocks exhibited 23% less volatility compared to the overall market in the past year. Additionally, throughout the last seven recessions, the healthcare sector consistently outperformed the broader market by an average margin of 10%. Moreover, during the past six recessions, the industry experienced an average earnings growth of 21%.The healthcare sector stands as a robust sanctuary during economic downturns, given that personal well-being is a non-negotiable priority for most individuals, irrespective of financial constraints. The demand for healthcare remains steadfast, evidenced by the fact that as of 2023, one in three adults globally grapple with chronic conditions such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. Concurrently, approximately one in four individuals is projected to encounter a form of mental health disorder during their lifetime. Deloitte, in this regard, estimates an economic loss of $16.3 trillion over a 20-year period due to mental health issues, underscoring the significant impact on the global economy.Rising healthcare expenses in the nation have rendered it nearly impossible to bear the costs independently, highlighting the vital role of health insurance. In 2021, private health insurance accounted for a substantial portion of the $4.26 trillion spent on healthcare, surpassing Medicare and Medicaid, with a coverage worth $1.21 trillion. Out-of-pocket payments for healthcare amounted to just $433 billion. Across the board, over 300 million Americans had some degree of health insurance coverage in 2022, marking a 40% rise since 1990. As of 2023, the US health insurance exchanges, established under the Affordable Care Act in 2014, are celebrating their tenth year of operation. Over this decade, the individual market has remained dynamic, witnessing shifts in insurer involvement, pricing, and plan offerings on an annual basis. Global research and consultancy firm McKinsey states that consumer engagement notably surged by 25% between 2020 and 2022, reaching around 16 million participants. This increase aligned with the elongated enrollment periods and improved subsidies introduced by the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, later prolonged through 2025 by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.Story continuesThe global health insurance industry stands to experience substantial growth in the future. Projections indicate that the global health insurance market is anticipated to achieve a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 9.9% from 2022 to 2030, as outlined by Straits Research. By 2030, this growth is expected to propel the market to a value of $5.28 trillion. In that same vein, some of the best health insurance stocks in the industry include UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), and Elevance Health, Inc.

The consolidated value of these stakes is over $1.73 billion. With over 1.5 million shares, Millennium Management was the company’s leading stakeholder in Q2.8. Centene Corporation (NYSE:CNC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57Centene Corporation (NYSE:CNC), headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, is a publicly traded managed care firm serving as an intermediary for both government-sponsored and privately insured healthcare programs. The company primarily focuses on the Medicaid market, with a significant proportion of its membership consisting of traditional participants, including those in programs like Children’s Health Insurance Program and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, who require regular monitoring. Medicaid plans account for nearly two-thirds of Centene Corporation (NYSE:CNC)’s total revenue, making it a vital revenue stream. However, the company is experiencing even faster revenue growth in its Medicare segment.On July 28, Centene Corporation (NYSE:CNC) revealed its Q2 non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.10 and reported a revenue of $37.61 billion. The revenue surpassed market estimates by $1.07 billion, demonstrating robust performance, and the earnings outperformed Street expectations by $0.05.According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 57 hedge funds were bullish on Centene Corporation (NYSE:CNC). This number was 61 in the previous quarter. Quentin Koffey’s Politan Capital had the largest position in the stock, with 12.13 million shares worth $818.65 million.Oakmark Funds made the following comment about Centene Corporation (NYSE:CNC) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“Centene Corporation (NYSE:CNC) is one of the largest health insurers in the U.S. The company specializes in three major government-sponsored programs: Medicaid, Marketplace and Medicare Advantage. Each of these benefits from long-term secular tailwinds. In Medicaid, states are steadily outsourcing their programs to managed care companies, like Centene, as it helps states reduce costs and improve care quality. Indeed, Managed Medicaid penetration has increased from 25% of total Medicaid spend in 2010 to 60% today, and we expect further gains over time. In Marketplace, growth is driven by the trend toward more individuals buying health insurance. Centene holds the #1 market share in both of these programs and is well positioned to capitalize on their continued growth. The stock trades for 10x consensus 2024 EPS, but this doesn’t tell the whole story. Past missteps in Centene’s Medicare business will result in that segment losing $0.80 per share next year. We believe Centene can turn Medicare around and generate positive earnings in the next few years. This could increase EPS by more than $1 per share and reduce the P/E ratio to just 8.5x. We think that’s good value for a business that generates healthy returns on capital and is capable of growing EPS at a low double-digit rate.”7. The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) is a prominent American insurance company that offers automobile and health insurance solutions. By the latter part of 2022, Progressive had achieved the status of being the largest motor insurance carrier in the United States.

PGR continues to increase auto policies in force, but recent costs were higher than expected. To combat weaker than expected margins, PGR is reducing advertising spending and increasing prices on insurance. Looking ahead, we believe PGR remains well positioned reflecting its more flexible pricing platform and tech solutions that monitor and price for distracted driving. While near-term costs were higher than expected, PGR has a great track record of profitability and conservative underwriting philosophy.”6. Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) is a company focused on health and well-being, providing healthcare benefits to medical and specialty members.

(NYSE:HUM) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“A new position in the portfolio is the US health insurer Elevance Health. This sector is quite familiar to us. In fact, we also have shares of another health insurer, Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), in our portfolio, which we first bought in 2009. The sector has been very attractive over the long term and its structure favours big players, which both Humana and Elevance Health are. Because each of these two companies also has some specific risk, we decided to increase our investment in the sector by acquiring this second position. Both companies are high-growth in terms of profitability and we expect their above-average growth to continue for quite some time.""Humana Inc.

Potbelly has significant momentum and vastly improved operations driven by an experienced management team positioned to succeed, the firm says.Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of TripAdvisor (TRIP) with a Buy rating and $22 price target.

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company to watch right now is PBF Energy (PBF). PBF is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), as well as an A grade for Value. The stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 4.95, which compares to its industry's average of 7.56. Over the past year, PBF's Forward P/E has been as high as 7.08 and as low as 1.56, with a median of 4.51.Another notable valuation metric for PBF is its P/B ratio of 0.93. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 2.03. Over the past year, PBF's P/B has been as high as 1.24 and as low as 0.75, with a median of 0.99.Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. PBF has a P/S ratio of 0.14. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.35.Story continuesFinally, investors will want to recognize that PBF has a P/CF ratio of 1.65.

Over the past year, PBF's P/CF has been as high as 2.09 and as low as 1.10, with a median of 1.62.Valero Energy (VLO) may be another strong Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing stock to add to your shortlist. VLO is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value grade of A.Shares of Valero Energy currently holds a Forward P/E ratio of 6.95, and its PEG ratio is 1.16.

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on UnitedHealth Group's  ROE.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for UnitedHealth Group is:24% = US$22b ÷ US$94b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.24 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.UnitedHealth Group's Earnings Growth And 24% ROETo begin with, UnitedHealth Group has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 11% which is quite remarkable. This probably laid the groundwork for UnitedHealth Group's moderate 11% net income growth seen over the past five years.Story continuesNext, on comparing UnitedHealth Group's net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 11% over the last few years.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is UNH fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is UnitedHealth Group Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?UnitedHealth Group has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 30% (or a retention ratio of 70%) and a respectable amount of growth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making efficient use of its profits.Besides, UnitedHealth Group has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 25%. As a result, UnitedHealth Group's ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 24% for future ROE.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with UnitedHealth Group's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. The latest industry analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to maintain its current growth rate. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the healthcare industry and its developments, go ahead and click on the 5 Best Health Insurance Stocks to Buy.Amidst a backdrop of economic uncertainty worldwide, the healthcare industry has shown impressive resilience. Over time, the demand for healthcare goods and services has proven to be relatively stable. This resilience of the healthcare sector was particularly evident during the equity downturn of 2022, where, for example, the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund greatly outperformed the Nasdaq, S&amp;P 500, and Dow Jones. BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK)'s data indicates that healthcare stocks exhibited 23% less volatility compared to the overall market in the past year. Additionally, throughout the last seven recessions, the healthcare sector consistently outperformed the broader market by an average margin of 10%. Moreover, during the past six recessions, the industry experienced an average earnings growth of 21%.The healthcare sector stands as a robust sanctuary during economic downturns, given that personal well-being is a non-negotiable priority for most individuals, irrespective of financial constraints. The demand for healthcare remains steadfast, evidenced by the fact that as of 2023, one in three adults globally grapple with chronic conditions such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. Concurrently, approximately one in four individuals is projected to encounter a form of mental health disorder during their lifetime. Deloitte, in this regard, estimates an economic loss of $16.3 trillion over a 20-year period due to mental health issues, underscoring the significant impact on the global economy.Rising healthcare expenses in the nation have rendered it nearly impossible to bear the costs independently, highlighting the vital role of health insurance. In 2021, private health insurance accounted for a substantial portion of the $4.26 trillion spent on healthcare, surpassing Medicare and Medicaid, with a coverage worth $1.21 trillion. Out-of-pocket payments for healthcare amounted to just $433 billion. Across the board, over 300 million Americans had some degree of health insurance coverage in 2022, marking a 40% rise since 1990. As of 2023, the US health insurance exchanges, established under the Affordable Care Act in 2014, are celebrating their tenth year of operation. Over this decade, the individual market has remained dynamic, witnessing shifts in insurer involvement, pricing, and plan offerings on an annual basis. Global research and consultancy firm McKinsey states that consumer engagement notably surged by 25% between 2020 and 2022, reaching around 16 million participants. This increase aligned with the elongated enrollment periods and improved subsidies introduced by the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, later prolonged through 2025 by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.Story continuesThe global health insurance industry stands to experience substantial growth in the future. Projections indicate that the global health insurance market is anticipated to achieve a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 9.9% from 2022 to 2030, as outlined by Straits Research. By 2030, this growth is expected to propel the market to a value of $5.28 trillion. In that same vein, some of the best health insurance stocks in the industry include UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), and Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV), among others listed below.Best Health Insurance Stocks to BuyPhoto by martha-dominguez-de-gouveia on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo compile our list of the best health insurance stocks to buy, we scoured through Insider Monkey's Q2 2023 database to identify the leaders in the health insurance industry based on hedge fund sentiment. The following companies, ranked according to the number of hedge funds that hold their shares, all offer health insurance services within the United States, and/or internationally.12. Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL) is a financial services company headquartered in Texas, offering a range of insurance coverage options. The company specializes in supplemental health insurance products, including cancer insurance, ICU insurance, critical illness coverage, and hospital insurance. Notably, Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL) provides Medicare supplemental insurance plans that assist in covering expenses like deductibles, co-insurance, co-payments, and cost-sharing for outpatient hospital services.In a bid to expand its healthcare business, Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL) completed its acquisition of Evry Health, a business-to-business health insurance company based in Dallas, Texas, on October 16.Cumulatively, 29 of the 910 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey’s Q2 2023 database had invested in Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL), up from 24 in the previous quarter.Much like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), and Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV), Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL) ranks as one of the best health insurance stocks to invest in.11. Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:MOH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:MOH) is a managed care company based in Long Beach, California, United States. The company offers health insurance to individuals through government programs like Medicaid and Medicare.Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:MOH) announced its GAAP earnings per diluted share of $5.35 and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $5.65 for the second quarter of 2023.

(NYSE:MOH) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here is what it said:“Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:MOH) also performed well as sentiment toward health maintenance organizations improved, both as a relatively defensive investment during uncertain times, and as the bear case on the stock was partially debunked with an extension of expanded enrollment for government health insurance programs.”10. MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, better known as MetLife Inc. (NYSE:MET), is among the largest global providers of insurance, annuities, and employee benefit programs, with more than 90 million customers in over 60 countries.On October 10, MetLife Inc. (NYSE:MET) declared a $0.52 per share quarterly dividend, the same as the previous dividend amount, which will be distributed to shareholders on December 14, of record on November 9. The company’s dividend yield on October 16 stood at 3.28%.As of Q2 2023, 40 hedge funds were long MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) with collective stakes of $1.17 billion in the insurance giant. Richard S. Pzena’s Pzena Investment Management is MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET)’s largest investor, owning a $261.9 million stake through 4.63 million shares.9. Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50Chubb Limited (NYSE: CB) is a multinational insurance corporation providing a diverse array of insurance and reinsurance offerings to individuals, businesses, and various entities worldwide. On August 10, the company announced a quarterly dividend of $0.86 per share, maintaining its consistent dividend track record.

The consolidated value of these stakes is over $1.73 billion. With over 1.5 million shares, Millennium Management was the company’s leading stakeholder in Q2.8. Centene Corporation (NYSE:CNC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57Centene Corporation (NYSE:CNC), headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, is a publicly traded managed care firm serving as an intermediary for both government-sponsored and privately insured healthcare programs. The company primarily focuses on the Medicaid market, with a significant proportion of its membership consisting of traditional participants, including those in programs like Children’s Health Insurance Program and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, who require regular monitoring. Medicaid plans account for nearly two-thirds of Centene Corporation (NYSE:CNC)’s total revenue, making it a vital revenue stream. However, the company is experiencing even faster revenue growth in its Medicare segment.On July 28, Centene Corporation (NYSE:CNC) revealed its Q2 non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.10 and reported a revenue of $37.61 billion. The revenue surpassed market estimates by $1.07 billion, demonstrating robust performance, and the earnings outperformed Street expectations by $0.05.According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 57 hedge funds were bullish on Centene Corporation (NYSE:CNC). This number was 61 in the previous quarter. Quentin Koffey’s Politan Capital had the largest position in the stock, with 12.13 million shares worth $818.65 million.Oakmark Funds made the following comment about Centene Corporation (NYSE:CNC) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“Centene Corporation (NYSE:CNC) is one of the largest health insurers in the U.S. The company specializes in three major government-sponsored programs: Medicaid, Marketplace and Medicare Advantage. Each of these benefits from long-term secular tailwinds. In Medicaid, states are steadily outsourcing their programs to managed care companies, like Centene, as it helps states reduce costs and improve care quality. Indeed, Managed Medicaid penetration has increased from 25% of total Medicaid spend in 2010 to 60% today, and we expect further gains over time. In Marketplace, growth is driven by the trend toward more individuals buying health insurance. Centene holds the #1 market share in both of these programs and is well positioned to capitalize on their continued growth. The stock trades for 10x consensus 2024 EPS, but this doesn’t tell the whole story. Past missteps in Centene’s Medicare business will result in that segment losing $0.80 per share next year. We believe Centene can turn Medicare around and generate positive earnings in the next few years. This could increase EPS by more than $1 per share and reduce the P/E ratio to just 8.5x. We think that’s good value for a business that generates healthy returns on capital and is capable of growing EPS at a low double-digit rate.”7. The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) is a prominent American insurance company that offers automobile and health insurance solutions. By the latter part of 2022, Progressive had achieved the status of being the largest motor insurance carrier in the United States. The company's origins trace back to 1937 when it was co-founded by Jack Green and Joseph M. Lewis. Its headquarters are located in Mayfield Village, Ohio.During July of 2023, The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) experienced a stock price surge after J.P. Morgan analyst Jimmy Bhullar upgraded the rating from Neutral to Overweight. This upgrade happened despite The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) reporting recent disappointing financial results. Bhullar emphasized that despite subpar margins over the past two years, he holds an optimistic long-term outlook for the personal auto market, considering it a structurally superior business compared to commercial lines or reinsurance.As of the end of the first quarter of 2023, 64 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR).The London Company Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) – PGR underperformed during Q2 due to concerns about additional price hikes needed to maintain its targeted profitability ratio. PGR continues to increase auto policies in force, but recent costs were higher than expected. To combat weaker than expected margins, PGR is reducing advertising spending and increasing prices on insurance. Looking ahead, we believe PGR remains well positioned reflecting its more flexible pricing platform and tech solutions that monitor and price for distracted driving. While near-term costs were higher than expected, PGR has a great track record of profitability and conservative underwriting philosophy.”6. Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) is a company focused on health and well-being, providing healthcare benefits to medical and specialty members. The range of services includes fully-insured medical and specialty health insurance benefits such as vision, dental, supplemental health benefits, and administrative services only (ASO products) for individuals and employer groups. The company also offers healthcare services catering to retired and active duty military personnel and their dependents. These services encompass pharmacy solutions, clinical care services, provider services, as well as predictive modeling and informatics services.On August 8, after an as-expected quarter and an upward revision in guidance, Bernstein chose to increase its price target for Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) from $568 per share to $599 per share. This adjustment highlights Bernstein's optimistic reevaluation of Humana Inc.'s potential stock value, indicating a more positive outlook for the company's market performance. While raising the price target, Bernstein retains its “Market Perform” rating.By the end of this year’s second quarter, 70 among the 910 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey’s research had bought Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM)’s shares. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is its biggest stakeholder since it owns $1.3 billion worth of shares.Vltava Fund made the following comment about Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“A new position in the portfolio is the US health insurer Elevance Health. This sector is quite familiar to us. In fact, we also have shares of another health insurer, Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), in our portfolio, which we first bought in 2009. The sector has been very attractive over the long term and its structure favours big players, which both Humana and Elevance Health are. Because each of these two companies also has some specific risk, we decided to increase our investment in the sector by acquiring this second position. Both companies are high-growth in terms of profitability and we expect their above-average growth to continue for quite some time.""Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) joins the ranks of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), and Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV) as one of the best health insurance stocks investors should keep on their radars. Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Health Insurance Stocks to Buy. Suggested articles:12 Best Upwork Alternatives for Freelancers and EmployersTop 20 Countries With Most Natural Resources in the World23 High-Paying Trade and Vocational Jobs in 2023Disclosure: None. 12 Best Health Insurance Stocks to Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

436,449ac6de-0911-38ef-b90c-76b10a9875e4,UNH,2023-10-18,UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unitedhealth-group-incorporated-unh-attracting-130012585.html,1697547612,STORY,['UNH'],"[UnitedHealth Group (UNH) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this largest U.S. health insurer have returned +10.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.6% change. The Zacks Medical - HMOs industry, to which UnitedHealth belongs, has gained 10% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.UnitedHealth is expected to post earnings of $6.08 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.6%.The consensus earnings estimate of $24.88 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +12.1%. This estimate has changed +0.4% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $27.83 indicates a change of +11.9% from what UnitedHealth is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for UnitedHealth.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of UnitedHealth, the consensus sales estimate of $91.94 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +11.1%. The $368.14 billion and $391.35 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +13.6% and +6.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUnitedHealth reported revenues of $92.36 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.2%. EPS of $6.56 for the same period compares with $5.79 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $91.43 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.02%. The EPS surprise was +3.63%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.UnitedHealth is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about UnitedHealth. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Check out our latest analysis for Automatic Data Processing How Fast Is Automatic Data Processing Growing?Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Automatic Data Processing managed to grow EPS by 13% per year, over three years. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Not all of Automatic Data Processing's revenue this year is revenue from operations, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers used in this article might not be the best representation of the underlying business. Automatic Data Processing shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 23% to 25%, and revenue is growing.

Given insiders own a significant chunk of shares, currently valued at US$85m, they have plenty of motivation to push the business to succeed. That's certainly enough to let shareholders know that management will be very focussed on long term growth.It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? Our quick analysis into CEO remuneration would seem to indicate they are. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to Automatic Data Processing, with market caps over US$8.0b, is around US$12m.Automatic Data Processing offered total compensation worth US$11m to its CEO in the year to June 2023. That is actually below the median for CEO's of similarly sized companies. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when it's reasonable, that gives a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making.Does Automatic Data Processing Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?One positive for Automatic Data Processing is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. The fact that EPS is growing is a genuine positive for Automatic Data Processing, but the pleasant picture gets better than that. Boasting both modest CEO pay and considerable insider ownership, you'd argue this one is worthy of the watchlist, at least. Of course, just because Automatic Data Processing is growing does not mean it is undervalued. If you're wondering about the valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Although Automatic Data Processing certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares. If you like to see insider buying, then this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying, could be exactly what you're looking for.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

One of his recent big investments appears to reflect that strategy. Against a backdrop of rising mortgage rates, declining home sales and various industry headwinds, during Q2, Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway opened a new position in D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI), which happens to be the US’s biggest homebuilder. Buffett purchased 5,969,714 DHI shares, which at the current share price are worth almost $625 million.It’s safe to say that given Buffett’s unrivalled decades-long success in the investing world, his own reasons for making new purchases are based on plenty of in-depth research and he does not need anyone’s seal of approval, yet his evidently bullish sentiment is being echoed right now by banking giant Goldman Sachs.Firm analyst Susan Maklari has been reassessing her stance on DHI and has come to some positive conclusions.“In our view,” the analyst said, “limited for-sale inventory, constrained affordability, and greater velocity in mortgage rates should drive increased consumer preference for quick move-in homes. We look for D.R. Horton to leverage its operating acumen against this, driving upside to results. More specifically, we highlight the focus on the entry level, while maintaining a steady starts pace, allowing for share gains.”Not to mention, further mitigating risk, Maklari notes that the company also options 75% of lots, the highest in her coverage, and within the broader peer group, second only behind NVR.“Although macro uncertainty and seasonality will likely be a near-term overhang,” Maklari goes on to add, “we believe this is fully reflected in the valuation.”As such, Maklari upgraded her rating on DHI from Neutral to Buy and set a $131 price target, implying a potential upside of 25% from current levels. (To watch Maklari’s track record, click here)Elsewhere on the Street, based on an additional 11 Buys, 4 Holds and 1 Sell, the stock claims a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average target is higher than Maklari will allow, and at $142.13, suggests shares will surge ~36% in the year ahead.

448,d33b7f91-5bf2-43af-aba6-e55131284516,DHI,2023-10-18,Homebuilders feel lousy about housing conditions — except for maybe the biggest ones,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/homebuilder-confidence-drops-140045859.html,1697551245,STORY,"['DHI', 'PHM']","[Homebuilder pessimism deepened this month as mortgage rates reached 23-year highs. But the downcast outlook may not be shared equally among developers.More builders again classified housing conditions as poor rather than good in October, according to a monthly sentiment index from the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) and Wells Fargo Housing. The index reading dropped to 40 from a downwardly revised 44 in September, marking the second straight month it fell below the crucial breakeven measure of 50 — and the lowest point since January.While the results underscore the chilling effect rising mortgage rates are having on housing activity, the index may not reflect the experiences of the largest builders, which are better capitalized to take advantage of the odd dynamics in the market.""The tone will be pessimistic, [but] I would say it is a better indicator for small to mid-sized builders,"" Jody Kahn, senior vice president of research and surveys at John Burns Research and Consulting, told Yahoo Finance before the index was released. ""It’s about the haves and have-nots when it comes to capital.""Other index measures this month were also weak.The gauges for current sales conditions, sales expectations in the next six months, and traffic of prospective buyers all dropped month over month. All readings sit below 50, indicating that more builders believe those particular conditions are bad than good. Buyer traffic was especially poor, coming in at a reading of 26.Housing conditions in the four regions covered by the index all worsened in October with three of four — the Midwest, South, and West — posting readings below 50. The Northeast’s index measure teetered at 50.The widespread decline in sentiment came as mortgage rates remained above 7% for nine straight weeks, with some experts warning that they could reach 8% this year.Read more: Mortgage rates at 20-year high: Is 2023 a good time to buy a house?Story continues""Builders have reported lower levels of buyer traffic, as some buyers, particularly younger ones, are priced out of the market because of higher interest rates,"" NAHB chairman Alicia Huey, a custom homebuilder and developer from Birmingham, Ala., said in a statement.As a result, builders reached into their pockets to attract buyers.Read more: How to buy a house in 2023The index found that 32% of builders cut home prices in October, the same share as September and the highest rate since December 2022. Overall, 62% of homebuilders provided some kind of sales incentives this month, up from 59% and also the highest since December 2022.And that’s where the divergence in moods among homebuilders may come in. The well-financed builders can negate rising interest rates with specific inducements, while also offering near-ready inventory for buyers frustrated by the dearth of properties on the resale side.""Those two factors are really driving sales,"" Kahn said.Homebuilders now are serving more entry-level buyers than normal because of the supply shortage among existing homes. (Homeowners are reluctant to sell and buy a home at such high mortgage rates when they have such a low one currently.)For instance, 42% of new single-family homebuyers were first timers in 2023, up from 27% in 2018, which was a more normalized market, the NAHB found.Read more: First-time homebuyer in 2023: What you need to knowThese are also more budget-conscious buyers with smaller down payments and who are sensitive to rapid changes in mortgage rates, which can make a monthly payment unworkable.Bigger can do it better? Homes under construction in Las Vegas. (Photo: Chase Stevens/Las Vegas Review-Journal) (Las Vegas Review-Journal via Getty Images)Larger builders with mortgage lending arms or joint ventures with lenders can afford to pinch their margins some to buy the rate down on mortgages for the entirety of the term for these borrowers. So instead of a 7.75% rate for 30 years, these buyers get a home loan at 5.75%, Kahn said.Smaller builders largely can swallow only a temporary buy-down, which lowers the rate for one or two years. But if a buyer can’t qualify for the higher monthly payment after the buy-down expires — a requirement put in place after the Great Recession — the deal is dead.These buyers also want to close quicker because a shorter window is a way to protect themselves from future rate increases, Kahn said, and it mimics the transaction timing on the resale side.Having inventory that’s 30 to 60 days from completion provides that assurance and timeframe, but that’s a scenario mostly well-capitalized builders can offer. Smaller developers don’t have the financing to hold incomplete and unsold properties on their books.""These two things are significant in supporting the sales,"" Kahn said. ""Smaller builders don’t have the capacity to do those things.""(Credit: John Burns Research &amp; Consulting)That goes a long way toward explaining why the sentiment reading from the NAHB — whose membership skews toward those that develop fewer than 100 homes a year — could be echoing the experiences of those homebuilders over the biggest private and public ones. (The panel of builders surveyed for the NAHB index is proportionate in size and geography to NAHB's membership composition, a spokesperson said.)In fact, John Burns conducts its own regular surveys of builders throughout the year and the most recent one — results Kahn has yet to publish — showed a considerable gap between how smaller builders and larger ones answered survey questions, she said.That’s a key consideration for investors looking toward a number of third quarter results from seven of the top 10 publicly traded homebuilders in the next few weeks, including D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI) and PulteGroup Inc. (PHM).""The biggest builders are making those earnings reports,"" Kahn said, ""and they definitely have all the advantages.""Janna Herron is the personal finance and real estate editor for Yahoo Finance.

To skip our detailed analysis of the airline industry, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Airline Stocks To Buy According To Wall Street Analysts.Geopolitical Tensions On The RiseAirline stocks have had a rough couple of years primarily because of the pandemic and its aftermath. For some, 2023 seemed to be the year airline stocks returned to full strength, but current geopolitical tensions and other issues have been creating a significant dent in the progress of some of the best airline stocks this year. The primary issue of concern these days is the ongoing Israel-Palestine crisis, with attacks from both sides creating panic among travelers and travel providers in the region alike.Major American airline services providers, including United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:UAL), American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL), and Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) have scrubbed service to Israel. Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) has issued a notification stating that all flights to Tel Aviv through October 31 will be canceled, and bookings for flights between Israel and the US will also be suspended. However, the company is providing waivers and refunds for customers who have already booked their flights. Companies like these are currently considering the security environment and making adjustments in their flight schedules to ensure the safety of their passengers and staff. The financial impact of these necessary measures is still unclear, but it is something investors in top airline stocks should keep an eye on as the situation develops further.At the same time, current issues surfacing in the US are also impacting airline stocks. Strikes led by Hollywood talent and autoworkers in the US are significantly impacting the demand for business travel in the country, and major airline companies are beginning to feel the lag caused by these developments. According to a CNBC article published on October 12, Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL), in particular, is exposed to the ramifications of these strikes because of its high exposure to the automotive and entertainment industries since it has over 70% of the market share at the Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport and about 20% of the market share at the Los Angeles International Airport. The company's President, Glen Hauenstein, noted in an earnings call on October 12 that the entertainment and automotive sectors impact Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) the most in terms of business travel, making these strikes a serious issue for the company.Story continuesAirline Stocks Continue to PersevereDespite the above developments, we do see some of the biggest airline companies, like Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL), pulling through in the second half of 2023. On October 12, Ed Bastian, the CEO at Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL), joined CNBC's ""Earnings Alert"" to discuss the company's increase in profit during the third quarter, spearheaded by strong travel demand in the summer. He also noted some factors of concern for the company and its investors. Here are some of his comments:""We had a strong quarter, a really great quarter, and I'm pleased with the progress that our team is making over the course of these last few months. It's been a hard quarter. The volatility that you see in the environment, fuel prices up, the demand has been really strong. Another record-breaking set of revenues for the third quarter, which drove a 35% increase in profits, so I don't think that was disappointing.""Bastian noted that the rising fuel prices have, however, made it necessary for the company to narrow the company's guidance to the lower end of the range it had set earlier in July. The July earnings guidance forecasted adjusted full-year earnings of $6 to $7, yet in the October report, the guidance was lowered to $6 to $6.25 per share. Despite this, Bastian noted that airline companies have to play a ""long game,"" which may indicate to investors that the company still expects to perform well while playing it safe. All in all, though, airline stocks have been holding on in the volatile market environment, which may signal to investors that now may be a good time to enter this area. We have thus compiled a list of some of the best airline stocks to buy in 2023, according to Wall Street analysts. We have also included some of the top undervalued airline stocks in our list.Best Airline Stocks To Buy According To Wall Street AnalystsPixabay/Public DomainOur MethodologyWe selected airline stocks that have positive ratings from Wall Street analysts and have upside potential as of October 15, according to data from TipRanks.

It is worth considering American Airlines (AAL), which belongs to the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry.This world's largest airline has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 23.26%.For the last reported quarter, American Airlines came out with earnings of $1.92 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.58 per share, representing a surprise of 21.52%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.04 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.05 per share, delivering a surprise of 25%.Thanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for American Airlines lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.American Airlines has an Earnings ESP of +2.83% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on October 19, 2023.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 24, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis parent company of Hawaiian Airlines is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.79 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -426.7%.Revenues are expected to be $743.1 million, up 0.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 214.29% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Hawaiian Holdings?For Hawaiian Holdings, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -26.12%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Hawaiian Holdings will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Hawaiian Holdings would post a loss of $0.55 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.47, delivering a surprise of +14.55%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Hawaiian Holdings doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry, American Airlines (AAL), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.26 per share for the quarter ended September 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -62.3%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $13.52 billion, up 0.4% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for American Airlines has been revised 68.2% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 2.83%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that American Airlines will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.

Her doctor said it was good that she came in for this important screening, because the cancer was found just months before it had reached stage three. She immediately posted her experience on Facebook to make others aware of the importance of getting regular wellness checks.Seeing this, Nikki's friend Becky was reminded to go in for her colonoscopy, which also showed that she had colon cancer. Because of Nikki's reminder, they caught it early, and today, she is cancer free.According to the recent Aflac Wellness Matters Survey, about half of adults have avoided at least one common health screening, including tests for certain diseases and other exams. At the same time, 51% of respondents who have had cancer said their diagnosis came as a result of a routine checkup or screening.

However, softer demand from China and global economic concerns weighed on copper prices during the second quarter.Copper prices, however, picked up in the third quarter amid expectations that demand in China will improve, backed by stimulus measures from the government. Our estimate for average realized price for copper for the third quarter is pegged at $3.90 per pound compared with $3.84 per pound reported in the prior quarter and $3.50 per pound in the year-ago quarter.The company is also likely to have benefited from improved costs in the September quarter. It is seeing improving trends for several of its commodity-based input costs and remains focused on managing costs and improve productivity. Our estimate for third-quarter consolidated net cash costs per pound of copper currently stands at $1.61, which indicates a year-over-year decrease of 8%.Moreover, improved performance at PT Freeport Indonesia and efforts to increase operating rates at Cerro Verde and El Abra mines are likely to have aided the company’s copper volumes in the quarter to be reported. FCX is expected to have witnessed improved volumes in its Grasberg operations in the September quarter on the resumption of shipments following delays associated with the renewal of PT-FI's export license in the second quarter.Story continuesThe company is also expected to have benefited from higher mining rates in South America. Our estimate for consolidated copper sales for the third quarter is 1,030 million pounds, compared with 1,029 million pounds reported in the prior quarter. Freeport-McMoRan Inc.

460,7e72b177-0ca5-3808-aa1d-b4f011a18b2e,PEP,2023-10-18,A Look Into PepsiCo's (NASDAQ:PEP) Impressive Returns On Capital,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-pepsicos-nasdaq-pep-impressive-110030068.html,1697626830,STORY,['PEP'],"[Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics. Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. That's why when we briefly looked at PepsiCo's (NASDAQ:PEP) ROCE trend, we were very happy with what we saw.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for PepsiCo, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.20 = US$13b ÷ (US$100b - US$33b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).So, PepsiCo has an ROCE of 20%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Beverage industry average of 15%. View our latest analysis for PepsiCo roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for PepsiCo compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Can We Tell From PepsiCo's ROCE Trend?It's hard not to be impressed by PepsiCo's returns on capital. The company has employed 25% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 20%. Now considering ROCE is an attractive 20%, this combination is actually pretty appealing because it means the business can consistently put money to work and generate these high returns. You'll see this when looking at well operated businesses or favorable business models.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On PepsiCo's ROCEIn summary, we're delighted to see that PepsiCo has been compounding returns by reinvesting at consistently high rates of return, as these are common traits of a multi-bagger. Therefore it's no surprise that shareholders have earned a respectable 68% return if they held over the last five years. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we still believe the stock deserves further research.On a separate note, we've found   2 warning signs for PepsiCo   you'll probably want to know about.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: PepsiCo PEP, Lifeway Foods LWAY and NexPoint Residential Trust NXRT.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:3 Top Stocks to Gain as Inflation Still Runs HotPrice pressures within the U.S. economy continue to remain stubbornly high lately. Thanks to a rise in the price of food and housing, inflation scaled northward more than anticipated in September.Per the Labor Department, the consumer price index (CPI) increased 0.4% month over month in September. The CPI jumped 3.7% for the same period last year, matching August’s reading.Core CPI, which tends to eliminate the volatile food and energy prices advanced 0.3% month over month and climbed 4.1% on a yearly basis in September.Nonetheless, the rise in consumer prices indicates that the Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary policies are yet to tame price pressures that are now becoming huge burdens for most U.S. households. This relentless rise in inflation had already impacted several worker’s paychecks in September.A spike in oil prices primarily due to the Middle East tensions increased energy costs. But it’s the increase in housing costs that predominantly drove the broader inflation higher last month.The cost of rent increased by 0.6% month over month and 7.2% on an annual basis. Food prices also went up for the third consecutive month, with grocery costs increasing 0.1% month over month and 2.4% from last year.Consumer price pressures, thus, may have declined immensely from the peak of 9.1% but continue to hover well above the central bank’s desired target of 2%.At the same time, wholesale inflation also remains quite high. The producer price index (PPI) rose 0.5% month over month in September and is up 2.2% compared to last year. The headline PPI has now registered its highest annual rate since April. The so-called core PPI also edged up monthly and yearly in September.Story continuesOf course, the rise in inflation impacts the purchasing power of your dollars. This leads to a decline in consumer spending, derails economic growth, and spurs volatility in the stock market. However, investors should invest in companies that remain unfazed by price pressures.Primary among them are stocks that belong to the consumer staples sector. Unlike discretionary items, staple products are cyclical, or in other words, whose demand remains constant irrespective of market conditions.Similarly, real estate prices gain in times of inflationary pressure. Landlords also charge more rent, resulting in higher rental income. Real estate can be easily purchased through investments in real estate investment trusts (REIT).Hence, amid such inflationary pressure, one should consider investing in the following three stocks that carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.PepsiCo is one of the leading global food and beverage companies.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PEP’s current-year earnings has moved up 0.7% over the past 60 days. PEP’s expected earnings growth rate for the next five-year period is 8.3%. Its shares have already gained 5.3% over the past five years.Lifeway Foods produces Kefir, a drinkable product similar to, but distinct from yogurt.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LWAY’s current-year earnings has moved up 76.5% over the past 60 days. LWAY’s expected earnings growth rate for the next year is 28.3%. Its shares have already gained 74.7% over the past five years.NexPoint Residential Trust is engaged in acquiring, owning, operating, and selectively developing multifamily properties. It operates primarily in the Southeastern United States and Texas.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NXRT’s current-year earnings has moved up 0.3% over the past 60 days.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) — which has counted McDonald's as a member since 1985 — is off slightly during the same timespan.Zoom out, and you will see the selling pressure in McDonald's (MCD) the most acutely in the last three months — shares have dropped 15.2%.The stock hit a 52-week low of $246.19 on Oct. 12.""You have to go back more than 20 years … all the way back to the 2002 lows … to find a time when McDonald's was more oversold on its RSI [Relative Strength Index] chart than it was at its early October lows!"" Miller Tabak chief market strategist Matt Maley told Yahoo Finance by email.So what gives with the often safe-haven play in McDonald's? This is usually a blue chip stock that investors eat up when the world becomes more volatile, as is currently the case with fresh Middle East tensions.Blame Wall Street's obsession with the longer-term impact of weight loss drugs (formally known as GLP-1 drugs) such as Ozempic on companies that sell anything with extra sugar, extra fat, and extra processed ingredients.The sell-off has blasted shares of everyone from McDonald's to soda kings Coca-Cola (KO) and PepsiCo (PEP) to Slim Jim selling Conagra Brands (CAG).Indeed the concern in the marketplace isn't totally misplaced.Data from IMS/IQVIA suggests around 10.6 million shots of obesity drug doses were officially sanctioned by Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY) in the US in May 2023.Dividing this figure by 4.5 weeks in a month suggests that the user base was around 2.4 million adults in May.""The concerns surrounding the impact that the weight loss drugs will have on [McDonald's] has caused its stock to drop,"" Maley contends.Story continuesA Deliveroo rider stands beside a bicycle outside a McDonald's restaurant in London, Dec. 10, 2021. (May James/REUTERS) (May James / reuters)While the sell-off in the Golden Arches has been brutal for the bulls, the Street has been hesitant to toss in the towel and serve up rating downgrades.""The recent weakness of the MCD stock screams unfairness. After all, many investors bought the stock for its resilience under any macro scenarios and protection against market volatility,"" said Citi analyst Jon Tower in a client note.Analysts like Tower point to several favorable attributes to the McDonald's business model that may be getting lost in the intense focus on weight loss drugs.They include a mostly franchised business model that lends itself to higher profit margins, efforts by management to accelerate the opening of new restaurants, and a push to digital in drive-through orders and on mobile devices.Adds Tower, ""While the GLP-1 risk is hard to measure, the current multiple may not fully reflect McDonald's wider appeal led by greater digital, delivery and drive through investments coupled with more craveable options and improved marketing execution.""Whether investors will view a discounted McDonald's stock as craveable before year end, the verdict is out.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

465,dd069dfe-ade9-3e2e-95ae-05cec5079574,UNP,2023-10-18,Analysts Estimate Canadian National (CNI) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-canadian-national-cni-140102074.html,1697551262,STORY,['UNP'],"[Canadian National (CNI) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 24. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis railroad is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.28 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -21.5%.Revenues are expected to be $3.05 billion, down 11.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.53% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for CN?For CN, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.42%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that CN will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that CN would post earnings of $1.37 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.31, delivering a surprise of -4.38%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.CN doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry, Union Pacific (UNP) is soon expected to post earnings of $2.45 per share for the quarter ended September 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -23.2%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $6 billion, down 8.6% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Union Pacific has been revised 0.9% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.41%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Union Pacific will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis medical laboratory operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.19 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -7.2%.Revenues are expected to be $2.26 billion, down 9.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.23% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Quest Diagnostics?For Quest Diagnostics, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.05%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Quest Diagnostics will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Quest Diagnostics would post earnings of $2.23 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.30, delivering a surprise of +3.14%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Quest Diagnostics doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

467,af9fcc6d-d196-30fb-869b-b4799b491cfc,AMP,2023-10-18,Possible Bearish Signals With Ameriprise Financial Insiders Disposing Stock,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/possible-bearish-signals-ameriprise-financial-110057985.html,1697626857,STORY,['AMP'],"[Many Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE:AMP) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Ameriprise Financial Ameriprise Financial Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chairman &amp; CEO, James Cracchiolo, for US$14m worth of shares, at about US$353 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$335. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.In the last year Ameriprise Financial insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Ameriprise Financial Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Ameriprise Financial. In total, insiders sold US$3.1m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesDoes Ameriprise Financial Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that Ameriprise Financial insiders own 0.4% of the company, worth about US$135m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Ameriprise Financial Insiders?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Ameriprise Financial you should be aware of.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

(NYSE:GPS) share price has gained 29% in the last three months. But if you look at the last five years the returns have not been good. In fact, the share price is down 54%, which falls well short of the return you could get by buying an index fund.While the last five years has been tough for Gap shareholders, this past week has shown signs of promise. So let's look at the longer term fundamentals and see if they've been the driver of the negative returns. See our latest analysis for Gap To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Gap became profitable within the last five years. Most would consider that to be a good thing, so it's counter-intuitive to see the share price declining. Other metrics may better explain the share price move.The most recent dividend was actually lower than it was in the past, so that may have sent the share price lower. The revenue decline of 1.0% per year wouldn't have helped. So it seems weak revenue and dividend trends may have influenced the share price.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-and-revenue-growthIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. This free report showing analyst forecasts should help you form a view on GapWhat About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Gap's TSR for the last 5 years was -45%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Gap shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 26% over one year. And that does include the dividend. There's no doubt those recent returns are much better than the TSR loss of 8% per year over five years. This makes us a little wary, but the business might have turned around its fortunes. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Gap better, we need to consider many other factors. Even so, be aware that  Gap is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...But note: Gap may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with past earnings growth (and further growth forecast).Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

Businesses can implement measures such as bias audits to regain consumer trust.Only half of regular Generative AI users say they are refraining from entering personal or confidential information into Gen AI applications.SAN JOSE, Calif., Oct. 18, 2023 /PRNewswire/ - Today, Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) published its 2023 Consumer Privacy Survey*, an annual global review of consumers' perceptions and behaviors on data privacy. This year's survey highlights how younger consumers are taking deliberate action to protect their privacy, as 42% of consumers aged 18-24 exercise their Data Subject Access Rights, compared with just 6% for consumers 75 and older. Many say they have lost trust in organizations because of their use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and 50% of respondents look to the government to set rules and enforce privacy protections. The survey also provides early insights on Generative AI (Gen AI), revealing that only 12% of respondents identify as regular users.Cisco Consumer Privacy Survey 2023 - Report previewArtificial Intelligence and Privacy Concerns  From shopping to streaming services and to healthcare, 48% of survey respondents agree that AI can be useful in improving their lives. A majority of respondents (54%) said they are willing to share their anonymized personal data to help improve AI products and decision-making.Nevertheless, 62% of surveyed consumers expressed concern about how organizations are using their personal data for AI today, with 60% saying that they have already lost trust in organizations because of their AI use. Organizations can implement measures to (re)gain customer trust, such as auditing products and solutions for bias, being more transparent and explaining how the AI works, ensuring human involvement, and instituting an AI Ethics Management Program.Story continues""The world is watching how companies will approach AI in a responsible way,"" said Dev Stahlkopf, Cisco Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer. ""For Cisco, this means keeping a keen focus on respecting privacy and human rights as we incorporate AI technology.""Generative AI: The Privacy Contradiction  The survey also provides an early snapshot of the use of Gen AI and some of the potential risks and privacy challenges. Generative AI is still relatively new to most people. Over half (52%) of survey respondents said they were not aware of it.Of those that use Gen AI regularly (12%), only half indicated that they were refraining from entering personal or confidential information into Gen AI applications. It is notable that the other 50% may indeed be entering personal or confidential information. This is despite 88% of respondents indicating that they would be ""Somewhat"" or ""Very"" concerned if their data entered in Gen AI were to be shared.Young Consumers Championing Data Privacy  This year, 33% of respondents qualify as ""Privacy Actives"": they care about privacy, are willing to act to protect it, and have acted, for example by switching companies or providers because of their data policies or data sharing practices. Younger consumers are the most willing to take action to protect their privacy. Forty-two percent of consumers, aged 18-34, are Privacy Actives, a percentage that steadily decreases with age.The percentage of consumers requesting data deletions or change rose to 19%, up from 14% last year. Again, this is highly correlated with age: thirty-two percent of consumers aged 18-24 make data deletion or change requests compared to only 4% of older consumers.Public awareness of privacy laws continues to be relatively low with 46% of respondents aware of their country's privacy law. Those who are aware of the law are more likely to feel they can adequately protect their data: only 40% of those unaware of their country's law feel they can protect their data compared to 74% of those who are aware of the law. Sixty-eight percent of consumers aged 18-24 feel they can protect their data, and this gradually declines to 47% of consumers over age 65 saying so.Role of Laws and Governments  Many consumers look to the government to set the standard of care and enforce privacy protections. Half (50%) of respondents said national or local government should have the primary role in protecting data, whereas 21% said private companies should be primarily responsible for protecting data.""As governments pass laws and companies seek to build trust, consumers must also take action and use technology responsibly to protect their own privacy,"" says Harvey Jang, Cisco Vice President, Deputy General Counsel and Chief Privacy Officer. Consumers are split on the value of data localization. Most have heard about such requirements, and 76% indicated initially that data localization might be good. However, when considering the cost associated with it, thereby making products and services more expensive, only 44% were in favor of data localization.Additional resourcesCisco 2023 Consumer Privacy SurveyGeneration Privacy, blog by Robert Waitman, author of the reportData Privacy: Young Consumers Leading the Way (Cisco Newsroom)Global data infographicAbout Cisco Cisco (Nasdaq: CSCO) is the worldwide technology leader that securely connects everything to make anything possible.

Its share price has risen more than 4% since September 21 to $215, compared with the $229 cash offer, getting an extra boost in the last few months from Amgen’s success. That leaves the gap between the two prices near its narrowest level yet. Another boon for merger arb traders was Seagen’s reporting positive results from a late-stage cancer drug candidate, supporting the company’s stock price even if the acquisition doesn’t go through.As traders plow more money into deals, they got a reminder on Tuesday of the potential risks. VMware Inc. which is going through regulatory reviews for its $69 billion takeover by Broadcom Inc., saw its shares fall as much as 12.1% after a report said Chinese regulators, one of the last remaining hurdles to the deal closing, could take longer to approve the transaction than previously expected. A spokesperson for VMware said the company continues to expect the deal to close on Oct. 30.Story continuesThe difference between VMware’s share price and the value of Broadcom’s cash-and-stock offer, or the spread for deal, gapped out to more than $16 on Tuesday morning, from around $6 as of Monday’s close. Bill Gross, who has grown vocal about merger arbitrage strategy, said on Friday that the stock might have benefited from the cash freed up by the Activision purchase.Arbs are also looking at pending transactions further down the line, especially those likely to wrap up next year. Shale oil maker Pioneer Natural Resources Co, software developer Splunk Inc. and biotechnology supplier Abcam Plc are among their popular picks, according to an informal Bloomberg news survey of five specialists.Between the Microsoft and Amgen transactions, and recent gains on Seagen shares, the second half of the year is generating strong returns for the merger arbitrage strategy, said Aaron Glick at TD Cowen. These gains come amid relatively light acquisition volume this year, giving arbs fairly limited situations to trade in, Glick said. Year-to-date value of deals announced in North America have fallen about 22% to $810 billion from a year ago, data compiled by Bloomberg show.Here’s a breakdown of other deals that are capturing traders’ attention:Exxon-PioneerExxon Mobil Corp. this month agreed to buy Pioneer Natural Resources Co. for $59.5 billion, the oil major’s largest takeover in more than two decades. While the deal is expected to close in the first half of 2024, a key question is whether it will face lengthy antitrust scrutiny. The Biden administration had toughened its review of oil and gas industry deals and asked FTC to investigate high gas prices. But the gap between Pioneer shares and the price Exxon’s paying, known as the spread excluding dividends, is just about $7 as of Monday’s close. That amounts to a difference of 2.7%, signaling investor optimism that the deal will be completed.Cisco-SplunkCisco Systems Inc. in September said it plans to buy Splunk in a deal valued at about $28 billion. It represents the networking giant’s biggest acquisition yet and a massive push into software and artificial intelligence-powered data analysis. Cisco CEO believed the transaction would close within nine to 12 months. Splunk’s shares were at $148.25 at Monday’s close, about 5.6% below the cash offer of $157, a relatively narrow spread implying that investors see a high probability of the transaction closing.Danaher-AbcamDanaher Corp. said it’s buying Abcam, a maker of laboratory products including immune proteins used in drug discovery, for $5.7 billion in August. The deal is expected to close in mid-2024. One wrinkle is the company’s founder, Jonathan Milner, who’s been trying to persuade investors to reject the bid. He owns about a 6.2% stake. But top Abcam holder HBK Capital, which has amassed a 7.5% stake, has voiced support. Abcam’s shares rose 1.55% to close at $22.96 on Monday, about 4.3% below the $24 offer.(Updates with comment from VMware in fifth paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWall Street’s Surprising Quest for Ways to Finance Coal AgainAd-Free Versions of Facebook and Instagram Have One Audience in Mind: RegulatorsThe K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTSIntroducing The Businessweek Show With Max AbelsonHas Bob Iger Lost the Magic?©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"
