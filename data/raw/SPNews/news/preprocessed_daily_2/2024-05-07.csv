""While Schwab clients were net buyers of equities, the investor enthusiasm that characterized the March results began to wane in April, pushing down the STAX score for the month.

U.S. flat-rolled steel prices found a bottom at the close of March and proceeded to move sideways. HRC prices saw a modest increase but ultimately closed the month at $838 per short ton. Meanwhile, HRC Midwest Futures saw a strong decline throughout April, which saw the delta between MetalMiner HRC prices and futures narrow to a mere $1 per short ton as of May 1. This signals that markets expect the sideways steel price trend to continue near current levels.', 'Two major steelmakers recently announced new initiatives to publish HRC spot prices. Nucor led the market, publishing weekly prices on Monday, April 8. Cleveland-Cliffs followed Nucor, releasing a monthly “Cliffs Hot Rolled Market Price” on Friday, April 26. According to reports from World Steel Dynamics, Steel Dynamics (SDI) does not intend to follow moves by Nucor or Cliffs.', 'By Friday, May 3, Nucor’s price stood at $825 per short ton, while Cliffs stood at $850 per short ton. Meanwhile, HRC prices currently stand at $826 per short ton. Both Nucor and Cliffs cited increased “market transparency” as the rationale for the moves. Nucor stated its published pricing aimed to reduce market volatility and they did not intend it to replace other HRC indexes.', 'A few takeaways:', 'It remains safe to assume that Nucor and Cliffs do and will continue to operate in their own best interest. While both companies stated that their weekly published pricing would benefit customers, the mills likely hope to influence HRC indexes at the very least.', 'Nucor’s first published price ($825 per short ton) stood at the bottom of the market. Opening at a lower cost was likely part of a plan to boost the credibility of its newly published steel prices. However, this could shift over time as establishing an inflated market floor would benefit domestic mills.', 'Increased control over domestic prices may indeed help reduce volatility, which has been apparent over recent years. However, it is worth noting that Nucor’s decision came immediately following a nearly 26% quarterly decline in steel prices as mills lost control of the price trend. This suggests that mills appear primarily concerned with steel price volatility to the downside.', 'Other major domestic producers, particularly SDI and U.S. Steel, declined to publish their own prices. However, this will allow both to fall in line with Nucor and Cliffs without risking the legal implications of price fixing.', 'It remains unclear to what extent negotiations will impact the prices buyers pay. Historically, larger buyers have greater bargaining power. Nonetheless, the ability of mills to influence market conditions will continue to require them to manage the supply-demand balance through capacity discipline.', 'Q1 2024 saw mixed results among steel mills with steel prices. Overall, shipments from the four leading domestic producers trended up from the previous quarter. Both Nucor and SDI saw an increase in total shipments, which offset quarterly declines from both U.S. Steel and Cleveland-Cliffs.', 'Historically, Q1 typically sees an uptick in steel shipments, so the increase is unsurprising. However, shipments fell across all mills from Q1 2023. This suggests weaker conditions on an annual basis. Despite the nearly 3% decrease in shipments from Q1 2023 to Q1 2024, the average Q1 MetalMiner HRC price rose 8.62% year over year.', 'Source: MetalMiner Insights,', 'The future of U.S. Steel remains in limbo as election-year politics continue to see Nippon’s potential acquisition draw ire from both sides of the aisle. Once the crown jewel of American manufacturing, U.S. Steel shrunk from its place as the world’s largest steel producer and corporation. By 2022, U.S. Steel’s position fell to the 24th-largest steel producer following years of underperformance.', 'Trump promised to block the sale if elected, while President Biden vowed to keep U.S. Steel a “totally American company.” Although there is no guarantee that either candidate will fulfill their campaign promises, the mill remains a bargaining chip that could derail Nippon’s plans.', 'Recently, the U.S. Department of Justice opened an antitrust investigation into the takeover. By early May, the ongoing investigation triggered Nippon to delay the closing of the acquisition despite approval from U.S. Steel’s shareholders. The company now expects closing to occur in December, after previous expectations that it would be complete by September. However, this new timeline would push the deal beyond November’s presidential election.', 'After losing the initial bidding war for U.S. Steel, Cliffs remains interested should the deal fall apart. In fact, Cliffs CEO Lourenco Goncalves continues to critique the sale. During the steelmaker’s Q1 earnings call, the outspoken CEO stated, “It still baffles me to this day that the clueless individuals representing Nippon Steel in this embarrassing event felt that they could do this without union support.” He noted later that the White House “has different ways to terminate the Nippon transaction, and we believe that will be done sooner rather than later.”', 'The sale’s blockage would seemingly guarantee a domestic buyer. This would increase mill consolidation in the U.S., which has historically given domestic producers greater control over prices. The ongoing challenges could also cause Nippon to look for a U.S. partner in the deal, although this remains merely speculative.', 'Want to know more about changing steel prices?

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Biggest Real Estate Companies in the US in 2024.', 'The US real estate market has long been subject to high mortgage rates and soaring home prices. As reported by CNBC on April 30, home prices in February increased 6.4% year over year. With all-time high prices in major cities including San Diego, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and New York, affordability concerns continue to arise. Regarding housing affordability, we have also discussed the least affordable metros for homebuyers in the US.', 'Monthly price appreciation has been reported in expensive West Coast metros where the inventory remains restricted and has not yet recovered since the pandemic. The highest monthly home value growth from February to March was recorded at 3.3% for San Jose, 2.7% for San Francisco, 2.4% for Seattle, 2.1% for San Diego, and 2% for Los Angeles. These are the five US metros where homeowners are most subject to a mortgage rate lock-in effect, which is when existing homeowners feel reluctant to sell their homes since they will have to purchase at higher rates. Buyers tend to compete for fewer choices in such markets with limited supply. On the other hand, existing inventory has improved in the Southern metros thereby easing the rapid price appreciation. New construction has also added to the choices in these housing markets. Some of the affordable, promising cities to buy real estate in 2024 have been previously covered.', 'As of March, total inventory has increased by 12.2% year over year. However, the inventory levels are still 36.4% lower as compared to the pre-pandemic period. New listings have also gone up by 3.7% since 2023, still falling behind the pre-pandemic levels by 25.4%. Therefore, strong demand and tight supply continue to drive home values up in the US.', 'Some of the dominant real estate companies in the US include Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX), Prologis, Inc.

Transaction volumes and activity have ticked up in recent weeks and pricing has certainly improved. As always, we are actively looking at acquisition opportunities across all of our markets, but our focus remains on the development of our land bank, which provides an opportunity for over $38 billion of build out with a return on incremental capital of approximately 8.5%. In terms of guidance, in light of our views on demand and leasing pace in the coming quarters, we are reducing our average occupancy guidance to range between 95.75% and 96.75% of the 75 basis point adjustment from the midpoint.”', 'Keller Williams Realty operates as the world’s largest real estate franchise by agent count.

(NYSE: ARE), the first, preeminent, longest-tenured and pioneering owner, operator and developer of collaborative life science mega campuses in AAA innovation cluster locations, is leveraging its unique position at the vanguard and heart of the $5 trillion secularly growing life science industry and coalescing its world-class life science and healthcare networks to drive forward action- and solutions-oriented corporate responsibility initiatives aimed at prioritizing the devastating and pervasive mental health crisis. During Mental Health Awareness Month, a time dedicated nationally to increase awareness of the challenges faced by millions of Americans living with mental health conditions, Alexandria reaffirms its mission-critical goals to meaningfully address the urgent need to (1) break the stigma around mental illness and addiction, (2) promote mental health as essential to overall health and (3) help accelerate the development of innovative new treatments.', '""Our nation is grappling with an unprecedented mental health crisis. For context, if you were standing in a packed stadium that represented our country, 1 out of every 5 adults and 1 out of every 6 youth (aged 6–17) would have recently experienced depression, anxiety or another mental health condition, yet only about half of them would have received treatment,"" said Lynne Zydowsky, PhD, chief of science at Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. and Alexandria Venture Investments. ""During Mental Health Awareness Month, we call for increased attention and policy action at the federal, state and local levels to transform the way we diagnose, treat and discuss mental illness. Mental health touches everyone in some way, and we must ensure all Americans, especially our youth, have access to the care they need while we work to cultivate partnerships and impact policy to accelerate innovation that saves lives.""', ""Reducing the stigma of mental illness and addiction is critical in empowering people to seek lifesaving help. The mental health stigma is particularly relevant for military personnel and veterans. Approximately 60% of military personnel with mental health concerns do not seek treatment, and on average over 17 veterans are lost to suicide each day in the United States. Since 2010, Alexandria has been partnering with the Navy SEAL Foundation and enabling it to meet the specific mental health needs of these elite warriors. Alexandria played an instrumental role in the establishment of the foundation's Warrior Fitness Program West Coast facility in San Diego, which provides Navy SEAL warriors and veterans with access to evidence-based support, advanced performance and fitness technology and expert personnel to help them physically and mentally recover and rebuild from injuries and trauma. Additionally, the comorbidity of individuals with severe mental disorders and substance use is roughly 50%. In 2017, Alexandria and Verily pioneered OneFifteen, a first-of-its-kind evidence-based comprehensive care model for treating addiction. OneFifteen has treated over 7,500 patients since opening in 2019. Drug overdose deaths reached 111,000 last year, largely due to the increasing influx of fentanyl, highlighting the immense need for a sustainable approach to address addiction."", 'Never has it been more essential to recognize the importance of mental health to overall health. Studies have shown that the presence of mental disorders increases the risk of numerous comorbidities such as diabetes and obesity. The life science industry has displayed a resurgence of commercial interest and progress in developing medicines for mental health disorders, as demonstrated by the recent advancement of multiple paradigm-shifting psychiatric medicines. These advances include the first FDA-approved oral treatment for postpartum depression from Alexandria tenants Biogen and Sage Therapeutics and recent positive clinical data from Alexandria tenant Intra-Cellular Therapies for an adjunctive therapy to antidepressants for the treatment of major depressive disorder.', 'Alexandria continues to convene key life science industry influencers and policymakers to help accelerate the development of innovative new psychiatric medicines to address vast unmet need. The company, in partnership with former congressman Patrick J. Kennedy and The Kennedy Forum, has held two mental health-focused Alexandria Summit® events, including its most recent summit in Washington, D.C. this February. As a tangible outcome of its inaugural mental health summit in 2023, Alexandria has been leading the creation of a public-private partnership (PPP) on biomarkers for depression through the formation of a dedicated working group consisting of government, industry, academic, non-profit and patient advocacy leaders. This proposed PPP aims to utilize a biomarker-driven approach with potential to revolutionize clinical trials by identifying patient populations who are most likely to demonstrate meaningful responses in a trial and also developing modernized, data-driven measures that will accelerate the development of innovative new treatments with greater precision.', 'Alexandria is committed to catalyzing meaningful change for the millions of individuals struggling with mental illness.

So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We note that Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) does have debt on its balance sheet. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?"", ""Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together."", ' View our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific ', 'As you can see below, Thermo Fisher Scientific had US$35.4b of debt, at March 2024, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. However, it also had US$7.25b in cash, and so its net debt is US$28.2b.', 'The latest balance sheet data shows that Thermo Fisher Scientific had liabilities of US$13.9b due within a year, and liabilities of US$37.5b falling due after that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$7.25b and US$9.35b worth of receivables due within a year. So it has liabilities totalling US$34.9b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.', ""Given Thermo Fisher Scientific has a humongous market capitalization of US$218.9b, it's hard to believe these liabilities pose much threat. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time."", ""In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses."", ""Thermo Fisher Scientific's net debt is 2.6 times its EBITDA, which is a significant but still reasonable amount of leverage. However, its interest coverage of 17.5 is very high, suggesting that the interest expense on the debt is currently quite low. Importantly Thermo Fisher Scientific's EBIT was essentially flat over the last twelve months. Ideally it can diminish its debt load by kick-starting earnings growth. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Thermo Fisher Scientific can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts."", ""Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Thermo Fisher Scientific generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 81% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so."", ""Thermo Fisher Scientific's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. But, on a more sombre note, we are a little concerned by its net debt to EBITDA. When we consider the range of factors above, it looks like Thermo Fisher Scientific is pretty sensible with its use of debt. That means they are taking on a bit more risk, in the hope of boosting shareholder returns. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Thermo Fisher Scientific   you should know about."", ""At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

We have also discussed the state of labor unions and occupational fatal rates in the US that have direct implications for workers. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Worst States to Work in the US.', 'In 2022, the United States witnessed 5,486 fatal work injuries with a 5.7% increase from the previous year. This equated to a worker dying approximately every 96 minutes due to a work-related injury, highlighting a concerning trend. Violence and other injuries by persons or animals increased by 11.6%, with homicides accounting for a significant portion of these fatalities, representing an 8.9% increase from the previous year. Furthermore, unintentional overdoses reached a series high of 525 fatalities, reflecting a continuing trend of annual increases since 2012.', 'Transportation incidents remained the most frequent type of fatal event, constituting 37.7% of all occupational fatalities. Workers in transportation and material moving occupations experienced the highest number of fatal work injuries in 2022, followed closely by construction and extraction workers. Despite consecutive increases in 2021 and 2022, transportation incidents were still down 2.6 percent from pre-pandemic levels in 2019. However, roadway incidents involving motorized land vehicles reached a series high.', 'In 2023, the United States witnessed a concerning trend in labor union membership, with rates hitting record lows despite headline-grabbing strikes across various sectors. Despite efforts to bolster membership, the union membership rate dropped to 10.0%, down from the previous record low of 10.1% in 2022. However, the number of union members increased slightly to 14.4 million, although this growth was overshadowed by the overall rise in employment among wage and salary workers. This decline in membership rates underscores a broader challenge facing organized labor in the country.', 'While there were some successes in union organizing, particularly among people of color, the private sector continues to face issues. Private-sector union membership remained stagnant at a record-low 6%, indicating ongoing difficulties in organizing efforts. Additionally, the erosion of the wage premium traditionally enjoyed by union members is a cause for concern. Over the years, the weekly pay gap between union and non-union workers has narrowed, highlighting the changing dynamics of the labor market and the challenges faced by unions in negotiating favorable terms for their members. To read more about unions, see States That Have America’s Strongest Unions.', 'Despite these challenges, unions still wield political influence, particularly in key states like Michigan and Pennsylvania. However, declining membership rates and ongoing struggles to maintain wage premiums suggest a need for labor unions to adapt to changing economic realities and employer tactics. The surge in strikes and organizing efforts in 2023 demonstrates a growing discontent among workers, but the effectiveness of these actions in reversing the decline in union membership remains uncertain.', 'To read more about the best states for jobs, see the best states for job seekers right now. It is also worth highlighting that California and New York are known to be two of the best states in USA for working whereas Utah and Massachusetts are popular to be two of the best states to live in the US.', 'Let’s talk about companies that are providing several career opportunities in 2024.', 'Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) recently announced the opening of applications for its 2024 grants through the Amazon Literary Partnership. Since its establishment, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been instrumental in supporting writers and their narratives.

In 2023 alone, they provided close to $1 million in funding to 93 literary organizations across the United States. These grants aim to empower writers by facilitating publication opportunities, educational initiatives, and platforms for diverse voices in storytelling.', 'Furthermore, the Amazon Literary Partnership collaborates with esteemed organizations such as the Academy of American Poets and the Community of Literary Magazines and Presses (CLMP) to administer grants like the Poetry Fund and the Literary Magazine Fund. These partnerships reflect Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s promise to support a vibrant literary landscape by supporting organizations that champion underrepresented authors and storytellers. Applications for the 2024 grants are open until April 15, offering opportunities for nonprofit literary organizations to secure funding and continue their invaluable work in the literary community.', 'On the other hand, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) is embarking on an ambitious expansion plan that will largely impact employment opportunities across America. Over the next five years, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) aims to build or convert more than 150 stores, creating hundreds of jobs with each new store opening. Additionally, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) plans to remodel 650 existing locations in the next 12 months alone, a decision that will generate tens of thousands of jobs to support these renovation projects.

Firstly, we considered the union affiliation rank, which was determined by the percentage of employed individuals represented by unions. These percentages were sourced from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, with the lowest percentage receiving a rank of 1. Secondly, we incorporated fatality ranks of workers in each state, based on data from AdvisorSmith’s report, where the highest fatality rate was assigned a rank of 1. By averaging these ranks, we obtained an overall average rank for each state, with the list arranged in ascending order."", 'The choice of these metrics was based on their direct impact on the working conditions and safety of employees within each state. Union affiliation rates reflect the level of collective bargaining power and protection afforded to workers, while fatality rates provide insight into the overall safety measures and workplace conditions within a state.

An ABR of 1.45 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.', 'Of the 30 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 21 are Strong Buy and four are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 70% and 13.3% of all recommendations.', 'Brokerage Recommendation Trends for WMT', 'Check price target & stock forecast for Walmart here>>>While the ABR calls for buying Walmart, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information.

As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.', ""This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements."", ""Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision."", 'Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR', 'In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.', 'The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', 'Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.', 'On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.', 'In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.', ""Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements."", 'Is WMT a Good Investment?', 'Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Walmart, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $2.36.', ""Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Walmart.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Biggest Real Estate Companies in the US in 2024.', 'The US real estate market has long been subject to high mortgage rates and soaring home prices. As reported by CNBC on April 30, home prices in February increased 6.4% year over year. With all-time high prices in major cities including San Diego, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and New York, affordability concerns continue to arise. Regarding housing affordability, we have also discussed the least affordable metros for homebuyers in the US.', 'Monthly price appreciation has been reported in expensive West Coast metros where the inventory remains restricted and has not yet recovered since the pandemic. The highest monthly home value growth from February to March was recorded at 3.3% for San Jose, 2.7% for San Francisco, 2.4% for Seattle, 2.1% for San Diego, and 2% for Los Angeles. These are the five US metros where homeowners are most subject to a mortgage rate lock-in effect, which is when existing homeowners feel reluctant to sell their homes since they will have to purchase at higher rates. Buyers tend to compete for fewer choices in such markets with limited supply. On the other hand, existing inventory has improved in the Southern metros thereby easing the rapid price appreciation. New construction has also added to the choices in these housing markets. Some of the affordable, promising cities to buy real estate in 2024 have been previously covered.', 'As of March, total inventory has increased by 12.2% year over year. However, the inventory levels are still 36.4% lower as compared to the pre-pandemic period. New listings have also gone up by 3.7% since 2023, still falling behind the pre-pandemic levels by 25.4%. Therefore, strong demand and tight supply continue to drive home values up in the US.', 'Some of the dominant real estate companies in the US include Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX), Prologis, Inc.

Transaction volumes and activity have ticked up in recent weeks and pricing has certainly improved. As always, we are actively looking at acquisition opportunities across all of our markets, but our focus remains on the development of our land bank, which provides an opportunity for over $38 billion of build out with a return on incremental capital of approximately 8.5%. In terms of guidance, in light of our views on demand and leasing pace in the coming quarters, we are reducing our average occupancy guidance to range between 95.75% and 96.75% of the 75 basis point adjustment from the midpoint.”', 'Keller Williams Realty operates as the world’s largest real estate franchise by agent count.

A favorable macroeconomic backdrop is expected to revive its investment banking (IB) business, thereby further strengthening the company’s financials.Analysts are also optimistic about the stock’s earnings growth potential. Over the past seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for both 2024 and 2025 has moved 1% and 1.2% north, respectively. MS currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Over the past three months, shares of Morgan Stanley have rallied 24%, underperforming the industry’s growth of 32.1%.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Let’s dive deeper into the reasons that make MS stock a lucrative bet now.Earnings Growth: Morgan Stanley witnessed earnings growth of 4.7% over the past three to five years, driven by decent top-line growth and strategic buyouts.\xa0With the operating backdrop turning favorable for the investment banking segment, growth in wealth management and investment management segments and strategic expansion, the company’s earnings are expected to continue the upward momentum. Hence, we expect earnings to grow at the rate of 23.6%, 11.2% and 4.1% in 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively.Revenue Strength: Morgan Stanley remains focused on its revenue growth. The company’s net revenues witnessed a CAGR of 6.2% in the last five years (2018-2023), primarily attributable to growth in investment management and wealth management segments as the company lowers its reliance on capital markets-driven revenues. This also helped it mitigate volatility in the top line.Additionally, the recent rebound in the IB business after two years of subdued performance is expected to support Morgan Stanley’s revenues going forward. The demand for both advisory and underwriting businesses will likely tick up as corporates realize that higher interest rates are here to stay for a longer period.Our estimate for total net revenues implies 6.3%, 4.2% and 2% growth in 2024, 2025 and 2026 revenues, respectively.Strategic Expansion Efforts: MS has undertaken strategic expansion initiatives over the past few years, driven by its strong liquidity and balance sheet position. This has also helped the company expand internationally, mainly in Europe and Canada.In July 2023, Morgan Stanley announced plans to merge its certain operations with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. (MUFG) to further expand its presence in Japan. This MUFG deal aims to combine Japanese equity research, sales and execution services for institutional clients with underwriting business to be rearranged between two brokerage units. Besides that, the opportunistic buyouts of Eaton Vance, E*Trade Financial and Shareworks poise Morgan Stanley well for future growth.Strong Balance Sheet: As of Mar 31, 2024, Morgan Stanley had a long-term debt of $266.2 billion, with roughly $19.7 billion set to mature over the upcoming 12 months. Further, the company’s cash and cash equivalents were $102.3 billion. Given the investment-grade ratings and stable outlook from rating agencies, along with solid earnings strength, the company will be able to meet its debt obligations even if the economic situation worsens.Steady Capital Distributions: Morgan Stanley’s capital distribution activities remain encouraging. Following the 2023 stress test results, the company hiked its dividend by 10% to 85 cents per share in July. Concurrently, the company re-authorized the repurchase of shares worth up to $20 billion, effective in third-quarter 2023. As of Mar 31, 2024, $16.2 billion remained under the buyback authorization.Given a robust capital and liquidity position and earnings strength, the company is expected to continue efficient capital distributions, thus enhancing shareholder value.Stock Seems Undervalued:\xa0 Morgan Stanley’s stock seems undervalued as its price-to-earnings (F1) and price-to-book ratios of 13.69 and 1.68, respectively, are well below industry averages of 17.28 and 2.39.', 'A couple of other stocks from the financial services space worth a look are Interactive Brokers IBKR and Stifel Financial SF.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Interactive Brokers’ current-year earnings has been revised 4.9% north over the past 30 days.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Yaki Faitelson. Jackie?"", 'Yakov Faitelson', ""Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us to discuss the first quarter is those who should have presented storm stuff through the year. In addition to discussing the results, I would like to have you assessed transition bogus in the key drivers of our business for this year. But first, let me remind you, Laurie, it's exist in the problems we saw.\\ Data is valuable, which is why the doctors want to steal it. Company is investing security to protect the data, but security is very difficult to only solves the problem by helping companies locate those sensitive data. You guys who has access to the lockdown can detect and respond to Flextronics. And because of the sophisticated automation that we've made into only SaaS platform customer spend very little time and effort to protect their data in now, we MDDR will reduce this even though this allows companies to collaborate safety in the most value from their data while managing risk. First quarter results reflect sustained momentum for SaaS transition in the positive reception of our managed data detection and response service for what we refer to as MDDR, ARR grew 17% to $560.3 million, and we generated $56.4 million free cash flow this quarter versus $35.7 million last year. Saas ARR now represent approximately 70%, total ARR. Guy will review our Q1 results in our updated guidance in more detail, I want to express how proud I am biomass had stabilized. It remains challenging in the Varonis team executed well during the first quarter, and I believe that we are only scratching the surface. What lies ahead for us. The transition to SaaS delivery model continues to show momentum because of the many benefits that our customers realize and I will quickly remind you of a few customers can achieve automated outcome, which means they can show the data is protected with very little effort. U.s. is quicker to deploy in operationalize because of significantly lower infrastructure and personnel investments. It's easier to maintain and upgrade. Additionally, still thinking benefits that we realigned the El Salto since I can knowledge of initial land margin benefit over time. In addition to our SaaS transition, I would like to discuss with three additional divestments of the business that I mentioned last quarter. We show our MD of service adoption of Enterprise generated the I think, increasing compliance requirements today like to focus on NGTL Ingenia. Last quarter, we introduced our MDDR service, which is the first managed service for monitoring and protecting critical data. It is a paid service that builds upon our port acting incident response offering by providing service level agreements and a round the clock coverage. It is important to note that this service is only possible for our SaaS customers because of the visibility and automation built into our such, we just began selling this offering in the first quarter, and we have already started to see great momentum with it. So let me explain why this is already happening and why we view this is an NGO for content. And video is a natural evolution of our platform in still a significant unmet need in the market. More of the challenges tissue space that they don't save people money to investigate sellouts fast enough now is MDD out. We did this burden on customers and put it on us. If we see a threat and well within our MDR customer base, we can stop it simply notify the customer after the problem has been solved. We can do this because we pioneered the use of machine learning for data security and user behavior analysis, giving us years of experience building highly acurate break models. Our team leverages the significant automation plus our unique method, the telemetry, such as data sensitivity for Access Event and permissions that allow us to detect if data is under attack into cut straight. M missed by others. I've also been asked to clarify the value of MDDR service provides to customers that already have an endpoint detection and response service for Managed Detection and Response service. The answer is actually very simple on the perimeter phase. We believe that we are best positioned to save companies because we have been monitoring the data inside the perimeter ever since we started companies, sometimes pain means for other third detection and response services. But when an incident happens, this service says that don't focus on data can only show you during the attack begun this target. To answer the most important question was any data stolen. MBRs and ADRs can reveal how a bad actor gained access in what tactics used to getting that cannot tell a customer if any data was taking? The situation has discovered in the bank was Rob, that hedging no sales. Thinking about the most important elements where there are many was stolen from all the Volt remains secure. This blindness. My organization's is sophisticated security stocks can still still victim to data breaches in side effects or tax bypass the perimeters. Without Varonis Data in usually power to accessible to anyone or anything inside the perimeter and isn't closely monitor. This means more data is likely to be breached in companies that how the time quantifying what was taking doing Enbridge making reliability much higher Ronnie customers automatically shrink the blast radius, which reduces the potential damage that an insider can do in passive bad actors tool, Colorado, to get to sensitive data, giving us more opportunities to catchments will MDR who often such bad actors before they get data in because we watch the data, we are able to quickly quantify the damage. This means we can stop the bleach in limit the exposure in the potential liability. This is why no matter what platform a customer has. They will still need MDDR to finish our bank, globally example, voice and video. What is the money around the clock in detail, the bank manager for their money sales in the voltage secure. Now I would like to touch on our January viability. This technology presents tremendous productivity opportunities in. But in order to reap the benefits of it, you need strong data security. For example, I can reveal clinical data with their own machines in people because most of the divi to utilize existing access controls, which most organizations Kevin lockdown, leaving them overexposed data from the new large language models and how to leverage this tool is still important data, more easily bottom line. Generally, VI. is forcing organizations. We take a hard look at the data security stack, and this is why can continue to CJ Desai coming up. So many of our customers conversations is organizations trying to understand how they can save the realized productivity benefits. So far, companies are taking a very careful approach thoughtfully considering potential risks before expanding from the pilot phase into organization-wide all else. As a result, we expect near-term adoption of a wide-scale Gen-i to be measured is companies game consoles and how they can secure the day data. Overall, the feedback we are hearing from customers only serves to strengthen the conviction we have in our ability to benefit from this enormous secular telling partnership with Microsoft is progressing well. In one month ago, we announced the industry-first cyber security solution for Microsoft 365 copilot. This will be sold as an add-on to our existing Microsoft 65 staff package and allows organizations to monitor copilot data access in time test of normal copilot interaction and automatically renewed sensitive data sensible by both human agents. In addition to the enhancement to our platform, we are seeing Gen-i, ours is a catalyst for conversation with prospects. And although we aren't yet seeing material ARR, I'm GenAI isolated deals. We are seeing healthy pipeline deals with respect to this opportunity. With that, I would like to briefly discuss a couple of key customer wins from Q1. in our university in the affiliated hospital system with 6,000 employees became in lawn SaaS and MDDR customer. This quarter, it was mandate secure sensitive data led to a risk assessment, so we discovered for medium density workloads into million instances of student inpatient TI. are exposed to everyone in the organ position. Fishing Verisity evaluated several CSPMDSPM. and legacy data security solutions. But ultimately, these loans have package with MDR protection for the UNIX in hybrid Windows environment. With our automation and data centric telemetry bonus, MDR, supplement the existing and VAR and MSSP lenders by providing protection that is focused on security and the most valuable asset, data. You also seeing strong engagement from existing customers, a broadband provider initially became a customer in 2014. So with the goal of identifying and remediating overexposed sensitive data in enhancing the presentation capabilities with our self-hosted offering, this required some customer effort in meaningful infrastructure investments. This customer converted to go on SaaS MDR protection for the hybrid. Doing those environments, they will benefit from our automated remediation, and we will realize infrastructure savings while trading the security team sense. We'll monitor and respond. In summary, there is off to a strong styles driven by the automated outcomes that customers receive from SaaS platform and our recently introduced and the idea of offering, which we believe is a game changer for our company. We are excited to capitalize on the tailwind of MDDR Gen-i interesting data center compliance regulation. We capture significant market opportunity. With that, let me turn the call over to Guy going."", 'Guy Melamed', ""Thanks, Yaki. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We are pleased with how our team performed in the first quarter and the continued momentum have grown Saas furthers our confidence in completing the transition in 2026, one year earlier than our initial time line. At the end of Q1, saas represented approximately 30% of our total company ARR, driven by strong contribution from new logos and existing customer conversions. As Jackie mentioned, the other key driver of our business this quarter was MDDR. This paid offering is an evolution of proactive incident response that comes with an SLA and assurance that bonus will respond. The ransomware attacks within 30 minutes. MDDR has been extremely well received in the first quarter, driving new business, increasing deal sizes and simplifying the conversation with customers. Addition to MDT are nearly every customer conversation we have touches on generated a I which reinforces our view of this secular tailwinds. We're seeing healthy leading indicators with respect to the opportunity, but as we discussed previously, we continue to expect the adoption of G&A. I will be met. As we look ahead of the rest of this year. We're excited to begin Phase 2 in earnest in the second half of 2024, which will be focused on converting our installed base of on-prem subscription customers to our SaaS platform. As a reminder, we expect that the ramp up of this phase will now the linear and momentum should grow in each quarter and further accelerate in 2025 and 2026. In the first quarter, ARR grew 17% year to $560.3 million and we generated $56.4 million of free cash flow, which was up from $35.7 million over the same period last year. These metrics demonstrate our commitment to balancing top line growth with improving cash flow generation during the transition. Turning now to our first quarter results in more detail. A reminder the leading indicators of our transition, are ARR, free cash flow and ARR contribution margin. As we have said many times, the faster we progress through the transition to more headwinds, we will experience to our traditional income statement metrics. So we view this in a positive light. In the first quarter. We continued to see stabilization of the macro environment. Item deal scrutiny persisted. So we are seeing positive momentum, especially with regard to the adoption of SaaS and MDDR Q1, total revenues were [$114 million], up 6% year over year during the quarter as compared to the same quarter last year, we had approximately a 9% headwind to our year-over-year revenue growth rate as a result of having increased SaaS sales in our booking mix, which are recognized ratably versus the upfront recognition of our on-prem subscription product. Because we have done in the past, we are committed to being as transparent as possible throughout the transition, which includes providing you with the key metrics that track our progress during the next phase. This quarter, we're providing SaaS revenue for the first time a metric that we will provide going forward. We will continue to provide that as a percentage of total ARR each quarter until we successfully complete the transition. In the first quarter, SaaS revenues were $34 million. Term license and subscription revenues were $56 million, and maintenance and services revenues were $24.1 million as our renewal rates were again over 90%. Moving down the income statement, I'll be discussing non-GAAP results going forward. Gross profit for the first quarter was $95 million, representing a gross margin of 83.3% compared to 86.5% in the first quarter of 2023. Gross margin continues to track ahead of our expectations, and the change is primarily due to the much higher mix of SaaS revenues versus last year, which caused a revenue headwind due to the ratable recognition of saas versus the upfront recognition of on-prem subscription licenses. The recognition of compute costs associated with our increased SaaS revenues and increased hiring in certain departments within [cost] to service the anticipated strong ramp in MDD are drove the remainder of the change. Operating expenses in the first quarter totaled $105.6 million. As a result, first quarter operating loss was negative $10.6 million or an operating margin of negative 9.3%. This compares to an operating loss of $4.3 million or an operating margin of negative 4% in the same period last year. During the first quarter as compared to the same quarter last year, we had approximately an 8% headwind to our operating margin as a result of having increased Saas sales in our booking mix, which are recognized fully ratable versus the upfront recognition of our on-prem subscription licsenses. Product first quarter a are our contribution margin was 13.7%, up from 5.6% last year. The significant leverage improvement even during the early stages as the transition reflect our ability to drive strong incremental margins while growing ARR and transitioning to SaaS. During the quarter, we had financial income of approximately $8.2 million, driven primarily by interest income on our cash, deposits, and investments in marketable securities. Net loss for the first quarter of 2024, it was negative $3.7 million or negative $0.03 per basic and diluted share compared to net loss of $0.1 million or net loss of $0 per basic and diluted share for the first quarter of 2023. This is based on 110 million and 108.4 million basic and diluted shares outstanding for Q1 2024 and Q1 2023, respectively. As of March 31st, 2024, we had $774.4 million in cash, cash equivalents, short-term deposits and marketable securities. For the three months ended March 31st, 2024, we generated $56.7 billion of cash from operations compared to $36.8 million generated in the same period last year. And CapEx was $0.3 million compared to $1.1 million last year. Turning now to our updated 2024 guidance in more detail. For the second quarter 2024, we expect total revenues of $123 million to $126 million, representing growth of 7% to 9%. Non-GAAP operating loss of negative $6 million, the negative $5 million and non-GAAP net loss per basic and diluted share in the range of negative $0.03 to negative $0.02. This assumes 111.7 million basic and diluted shares outstanding. For the full year 2024, we now expect ARR of $622 million to $628 million, representing growth of 15% to 16%, free cash flow of $70 million to $75 billion. Total revenues, $536 million to $546 million, representing growth of 7% to 9%. Non-GAAP operating income of $9 million to $14 million. Non-GAAP net income (technical difficulty) per diluted share in the range of $0.13 to $0.16. This assumes 128.4 million diluted shares outstanding. In summary, we are encouraged by the continued momentum of our own SaaS and initial reception of MDR. The growing demand for these offerings is strengthening our ARR performance and cash flow generation as we move through the second phase of our transition, which we believe will unlock meaningful value for both our customers and our company. With that, we will be happy to take questions.Operator."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instruction) Saket Kalia with Barclays.', 'Saket Kalia', 'Okay. Great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here and nice start to the year here on ARR.', 'Guy Melamed', 'Thank you.', 'Saket Kalia', ""Josh, I'd lov e to start with MDDR. and maybe the question is, you touched on this a little bit, but what's been the initial feedback that you're getting from from customers on the offering? It seems like it's off to a good start. And the guy just related to that, can you just talk about some what extent is MDDR, Mickey, pulling through more interest in SaaS since it's only available to SaaS customers that make sense?"", 'Yakov Faitelson', ""Definitely. So in terms, the customer feedback in the past with owning a behind the productivity, exceeding our expectation and effectively a tax income from anywhere and any device, but ongoing one, the election, which is the data. So dream security is made no many amazing company. But if you think the probability very high probability that you're going to fail in, once you have an identity, there is no bring in more. You're getting into the data. And we used to modestly me understand how people need to use data and consumable these. They have not made sure that you will notice the data breach in our opinion, the best way to go to date at which you're doing it completely automatically. So just moving extremely well as you have more platforms in a lot of all the way that we bundle fleet age and the other good attractive there to weigh in on Friday, it works. It works extremely well. So customers are loving and we are just on a daily basis sales in stopping them to breaches. And we really believe that the data security platfaam in India, the first thing that the organization needs to do in the last thing that will save you."", 'Guy Melamed', ""And it will depend if it's only offered with the SaaS offering it, it was definitely a key driver for our business this quarter. When you think about the NDDR., it's been an evolution of the proactive incident response, and it comes with an SLA and kind of within 30 minutes. So it's very compelling. And when you look at kind of how it was received this quarter is on driving this increasing deal sizes and simplifying the conversations for our for our customers."", 'Yakov Faitelson', 'Because you have to have a bit about what Guy said when we build our SaaS solution, which will communicate to us. You know, this is a software solution with a little bit to mention to make, too, but we have tremendous both multiplier to our to our on. And so we built a lot of Watson using the way I have to make sure that our people are extremely productive species to almost completely service also have questions.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Mr. Komiya, please rejoin the queue for more questions. Hamza Fodderwala, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.', 'Again, John, on for Honda on. So Yaki, a question for you. How often is Microsoft copilot coming up in your customer conv ersations versus three months ago? And in the expanded partnership with Microsoft copilot driving more pipeline?', 'Yakov Faitelson', ""With front and center in how we can route every conversation. I know Microsoft is still not pushing it still falls to the customer base. You see that a lot of customers experimenting with it. I think I'll work my way into the same customers in Q1. And there is a very consistent theme, the starting the copilot, the evaluation and stopping the inquiries, exposing a lot of the relevant clinical data. So just protecting this. The copilots and they are connecting to many sources is in the coming June each and every conversation. And I think that is just exposing the problem in organizations understand that they need to take data security very seriously in order to benefit from the automation of the, say the copilot. But they are based on LLM and starting to build a good pipeline in the places that we engage with Microsoft. It's also starting to go in the right direction, but remember, Microsoft and we are still pushing through both. I believe that once they will have a quota and push, it will pose, it can have the can has been impact on the business. But you know, in the world wants to benefit from a copay pilots in all the inland Mobilicity will to get the productivity gains, they will need to take it to take your data security come through."", 'Guy Melamed', ""And just to reemphasize what you have you been seeing in terms of the reported numbers for Q1, we didn't see copilot as part of the reported numbers in Q1. But definitely when we look at all the leading indicators, they appear there and we're seeing pipeline increasing them."", 'Yakov Faitelson', 'With the listing of the revenue impact would be starting to see it pipeline impact in a lot of conversions in people are in the initial stages to figure out how to do.', 'Great. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Matt Hedberg with RBC. Please go ahead.', 'Matt Swanson', ""Yes. Thank you. This is actually Matt Swanson on for Matt. We are going to hear some stabilization in the macro deals. I have spent a long time coming for all about you've done a really successful SaaS transition during are really only if the macro Yaki, you mentioned some of the advances of SaaS, the lower end substructure personnel costs easier to maintain it. Can you just want to talk specifically for the SaaS transition, kind of headwinds and tailwinds of a challenging macro, but are there any parts that are actually help the transition? Things are a little tougher."", 'Yakov Faitelson', ""I think that what happens to be seen, what helps boost is the reality breaches almost always not always with almost no data breaches of security industry would be upside down since the spin a fortune on perimeter security and just saying no small value in that you have this massive blast revenues and you're completely exposed thinking about it. It's like to have the two business with the bank that doesn't have the ledger can tell you what happened with the account and just continue is that you have a strong back-to-school and fall well logged into doesn't make sense in the other thing that happens that is primarily due to provide automated outcome increase. Scale is extremely well, took everything we learn from the on-prem and will be a lot of automation, a lot of coverage. The customer with 5%, 10% of the airport can get 10 times more volume. So this is also the way it is also the way it works. And I also think that slowly but surely everyday organization just realize that this is something that we need to do sooner rather than later. I mean, obviously with Ally in all the attacks that we will go into the data organizations and Houston, the two, this is the way to go to a gradual process. But we definitely feel that the technology just picking the reality, you want to make sure that the non-TV data, which mainly the security platforms automated outcome."", 'Operator', 'Fatima Boolani, Citi.', 'Fatima Boolani', ""Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. And then I have a question for you, the ARR I just wanted to dissect a little bit. So [let me start] countable Cherokee, and you're considering or not totally out of the went from a macro. I wanted to better understand why some of this momentum and you're not expecting to increase during the year given the seasonally slow quarter and you have so much more demand and growth in Q1 from October plants and that puts and takes that inventory into the outlook in terms of not growing for were independent upside in this quarter?"", 'Guy Melamed', ""I think that's a great question. And I want to be very clear. We are raising our full year ARR guidance because we feel really good about the rest of the year. And when you look at Canada with you, we raised on ARR purely a mathematical kind of framework. If anything, I would say we feel more confident about Q1 than what we did 90 days ago. So if I walk you through the math of kind of the guidance itself, as you know, we only guide through annual ARR in our 2024 net new ARR guidance was similar to previous year's numbers. So when you look at the net new ARR in Q1 2024 was approximately $4 million higher than last year, which is exactly what we're rolling over for the full year midpoint of ARR guidance. When you look at kind of and I've talked a lot about this in previous quarter. When you look at all the things that are working in our favor, we have a lot of things, whether it's the environment and DDR copilot. So you have to remember, Q1 is still the smallest quarter of the year, and our philosophy has always been not to bake in positivity before we actually see it translate into the numbers. So we want to see how things progress we want to see how things move forward for the rest of the year. And with copilot and the SEC regulation, we have yet to see that positive impact to our reported numbers. With MDDR, we have started to see good momentum, but it's still only one quarter in, which is why we're taking a responsible approach and as we have done in the past and as we see the data that supported, we will be happy to update on guidance."", 'Operator', 'Brian Essex with JP Morgan.', 'Brian Essex', ""Good afternoon and thank you for taking the question. Yaki. I was wondering if you can give us a little bit of an update. I think you talked a little about this last quarter, but you've got a lot of irons in the fire or incremental opportunities with as we kind of at the back end of the year. How do you think about incentivizing the sales force with regard to your number one new lower growth number to put more proactive conversion of your installed base with the kickoff of Phase 2 and a number three expansion versus MDDR and co-pilot, how do you mean anything categorize the magnitude of each of those levers and how you expect that to play out through the rest of the year?"", 'Yakov Faitelson', 'So in our MD&A and the copilot, though, relevant to every once existing customer and prospect move us to gain market share to explain the platform, expand the platform in the base, this is something that is working well for us. But we also have just so many ways to add value to customers with everything that we are doing, the cloud on the SaaS side and on the in the IT side, we see on customer getting extremely fast, these automated outcomes.', 'Guy Melamed', ""And I'll give the color from a commission perspective. And what we have seen from a conversion perspective is that it's happening in the natural way. When you look at the uplift, obviously, it's beneficial for the customers because they're getting a much better product, but it's also beneficial for our field force because anything on top of that renewal goes towards their quota. So at the beginning of this year, we didn't change the incentive for the conversion because it is happening kind of in a natural element, which is great for us and is working great for our customers. What we did do because new logos is such an important component in on fueling our growth in the years ahead as we actually double down on the commission plan from a sense of ensuring that reps are focused on acquiring new customers and in order for them to make real significant monies dinners and they'll be able to make money without it. But in order to make real big money, they have to focus on new customers as well. And and when you look at the offering itself and the SaaS offering is actually eliminated two of the biggest objections that we used to see and that's that customers don't have the people to support the platform. We're companies don't necessarily want to buy the hardware. So in a way, that change of compliant actually works really well with the offering that we have. And when you think about that combination is something that we've seen worked very well for us in Q1."", 'Operator', 'Roger Boyd with UBS.', 'Roger Boyd', ""Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Are a lot of talk on the momentum that's in the pipeline around Microsoft through 65 coal-powered. But Yaki, I'm wondering if you're starting to see interest from the install base around securing other coal pilots and other G&A applications like does and sales force or get hub has come up with a few customers. Just wondering if that's showing up in the pipeline or customer conversations with any sort of momentum. Thanks."", 'Yakov Faitelson', ""So without a doubt and even much more because people understand that the one this copilot for, we almost every platform that they have. And so we see it on the SaaS that makes sense, both Depop G., La Colorado and obviously the net connectors or we don't think that both Google agenda. So you see all these coal piles and even sometimes people have their own, you know, we filed with the instant to opening. I was putting these loans Sherburne to move a lot of value in the other thing that that we are doing, we in copilot, we expect maybe to look at the quote themselves, risky users and all the other Globe. So it's really working for me to welcome from every angle. And we are hoping that was also a supply glut is once you are using this technology, this speed that you're exposing clinical data, it is unbelievable, not exposing and creating a creating clinical data. So we'd say it is definitely very interesting for us and just immediately exposing the problem. And they also enhancing."", 'Operator', 'Shaul Eyal, TD Cowen.', 'Shaul Eyal', ""Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Congrats on the ongoing stat transition and the overall results. Guy or Yaki. And I wanted to ask about the mix between existing customers and new logos this quarter.

And as I said before, SaaS is really opening up new market for us because it's eliminating the two biggest pushbacks. We used to get one being companies don't have the people to support the risk. And number two, they don't want to buy the hardware. And so the changes we made to the comp plan, which I discussed in one of the previous questions, together with the simplicity of the story and the benefits of the products are really working.

And then maybe any early metrics on attach rate?"", 'Guy Melamed', ""Yes, I think that's a great question, and we talk a little bit about it last quarter. We introduced the MDR win. When you think about our goal at the end of the day, three are off, it's really resonating within our customers and the value there is very clear. So at the end of the day, with that value that we provide customers with trying to extract from them and increase customer lifetime value. And there are two ways to do it, either you allow customers to buy additional licenses and then your MDDR pricing is somewhat reduced as long as they buy and increase the ASP or if they only want the MDDR. XenApp pricing of indeed, if there is a stand alone is significantly higher. What we're seeing is the customer are customers are embracing the package itself and they're buying it as part of additional licenses that can give them additional benefit. And that allows us to increase the ASP. It's still very early. So I want to give out numbers and kind of go through a through the exercise of kind of the uplift that we're getting there. But we're seeing now our ASPs increase in a very healthy way and the value that we can provide with that platform is significant."", 'Yakov Faitelson', ""The MDDR.

They really helped us get the SaaS. When you look at kind of SaaS coming a 30% of total ARR and where you look at the number is actually $165.5 million. When we look at it, the metric itself, we didn't talk about the actual dollar value of the conversions because the the metric you should focus on is assay ARR. That is that really measure the progress in completing the trend transition, which is one of our overarching goals. But SaaS ARR was very strong in Q1 and the exisiting listing customer conversions obviously played into that."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Next question comes from the line of [Steven Schwartz] with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.', 'Andrew Nowinski', ""And this is Stephan on for Andy Nowinski. Thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to ask about your focus on new logos, maybe the role that MDDR. complain to that, how much education maybe you need to do to make that a driver of new logos?

When you when you go to a prospect and yet you're talking about an SLA that assures Varonis, you get the customer is interested in a way the whole purpose of MDD. Our is to allow us to help the customer and protect them in a way that doesn't require the same headcount that they had to have if we were selling them the on-prem subscription solutions. So MDD are definitely fit within our offering in the simplicity and kind of doubled down on the SaaS simplicity that we have there. And that allows us to target new customers. And I think that that story together with the way we structured the comp plan where reps in order to make real money need to focus there. I think that's working really well."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Last question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton for such. Please go ahead.', ""So this is Patrick on for Josh. Thanks for taking my question. Sort of piggybacking off of a few questions earlier around the healthy pipeline build with respect to AI sort of asking it a different way. Can you kind of talk about and I know it's early to talk about the sales cycles you sort of expecting to see around the copilot offering? Do you expect them to be sort of in line with what you see with the rest of the business or potentially longer as customers are sort of pushing us adoption of AI thought?"", 'Yakov Faitelson', ""So it's still early.

But Amazon is now knocking on the door of that exclusive club. In fact, it gained admission in April for a brief period before its stock price pulled back.', 'Amazon was founded in 1994 as an e-commerce company, but it has since evolved to build a gargantuan presence in other tech segments including cloud computing, streaming, digital advertising, and now artificial intelligence (AI).', ""Amazon just released its financial results for the first quarter of 2024 (ended March 31), and they were strong across the board. However, AI might be the technology that lifts this company's valuation to $2 trillion (and beyond) on a sustained basis."", ""E-commerce is Amazon's largest source of revenue, and the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform is responsible for the overwhelming majority of the company's operating income (profit). Therefore, Amazon needs both segments firing on all cylinders, and it's currently using AI to drive their success."", ""In his Q1 conference call with investors, CEO Andy Jassy said that more than 100,000 sellers have used at least one of Amazon's generative AI tools to improve product listings and reach more customers. One of its newest tools allows sellers to automatically create detailed and engaging product pages by simply feeding Amazon's AI engine a link to their website. Other AI tools help sellers craft content for their advertisements to increase clicks and improve conversions."", ""On the cloud side, Amazon continued to make progress on its mission to dominate the three core layers of AI. Infrastructure is the bottom layer, and Jassy said demand remained high for AWS's new Trainium 2 chips, which were designed in-house, because of their favorable price and performance relative to competing hardware. They complement AWS's broad selection of data center instances powered by Nvidia's industry-leading graphics chips (GPUs)."", ""The middle layer is home to Amazon Bedrock, which is a service for businesses that don't want to build and train their own AI large language models (LLMs). In Bedrock, they can access a portfolio of ready-made LLMs to accelerate the development of customer-facing AI applications. Those LLMs include some of the industry's most powerful, like Anthropic's Claude 3 and Meta Platforms' Llama 3."", ""Finally, complete AI applications sit at the top layer. AWS developed a powerful AI virtual assistant called Q, which became widely available to customers in the first quarter. It's fully customizable and can be trained to enhance productivity within almost any business using internal data. It's capable of writing, testing, and debugging computer code, which Amazon says can save months of manual work. Plus, it can rapidly analyze mountains of data to spot trends and potential opportunities across an organization."", 'Last year, Amazon split its U.S. fulfillment network into eight separate regions. This allows fulfillment centers to hold increased levels of inventory for products that are popular in their own geographic area, and it also means those goods travel shorter distances to reach customers. The end result is faster delivery times; in March, Amazon said 60% of orders from its Prime members arrived on the same day or the next day across 60 of the largest U.S. metro areas.', ""Amazon's theory is that speeding up delivery times will give customers the confidence to buy from its website more frequently, and Jassy points to the growing everyday essentials segment as evidence the strategy is working. Plus, growth in Amazon's online sales revenue overall appears to be accelerating. It increased by 7% to $54.7 billion during Q1, which was much faster than the 3% growth rate it delivered in the year-ago period."", ""AWS cloud revenue came in at $25 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 17%, which was also an acceleration, both sequentially and compared to the year-ago period. AWS is currently the world's top cloud provider by revenue, and investors have longed for faster growth after a sluggish 2023 when businesses trimmed their spending due to high interest rates. That period of cost optimization appears to be over, according to Jassy, and he says momentum is picking up -- thanks especially to AI demand."", ""Finally, Amazon's digital advertising revenue jumped 24% to $11.8 billion, making it the fastest-growing segment in the entire organization. Amazon.com receives 2.2 billion visits every month, making it the ideal place for merchants to advertise their products. Amazon also introduced ads to the Prime Video streaming service this year, and while it's still early days, this could be a lucrative opportunity as more of the $147.9 billion television ad market shifts to streaming."", ""Across all segments, Amazon's total revenue came in at $143.3 billion during Q1, which was a 13% year-over-year jump. The bigger story was on the bottom line; the company's net income (profit) soared 228% to $10.4 billion as management carefully controlled costs across all divisions."", ""With a market cap of $1.9 trillion, Amazon stock only has to gain another 5.3% to join the $2 trillion club. Membership might be a mere formality at this point considering the company's growth, but there's a big reason Amazon could remain there for the long haul."", ""Amazon generates more revenue than every company in the $2 trillion club. More than $574 billion flowed through its doors in 2023, compared to $394 billion for Apple, which led Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet. However, Amazon stock is cheaper than all of them on the basis of its price to sales (P/S) ratio (which divides a company's market capitalization by its revenue):"", ""Amazon is historically the least profitable company among its big-tech peers, primarily because its e-commerce business runs on razor thin margins. However, the company's net income has surged by triple-digit percentages in the last three quarters, which, in my opinion, should entice investors to pay a higher valuation multiple for Amazon's revenue over time. Its P/S ratio has slowly climbed over the past year, which is proof this is already happening."", ""Therefore, not only will Amazon stock likely rise in the future based on the strong growth across its business, but there might also be a case of multiple expansion in its P/S ratio -- especially considering how far it's lagging behind Alphabet, which is next-to-last in the above chart."", 'Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Our valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $103.28, but it is currently trading at US$72.90 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Another thing to keep in mind is that Starbucks’s share price may be quite stable relative to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. This means that if you believe the current share price should move towards its intrinsic value over time, a low beta could suggest it is not likely to reach that level anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range again.', ""Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio.

We view these declines as transient and are not reflective of longer-term industry competitive dynamics. The Company continues to take market share in the North American pool care business and has maintained excellent profit and return metrics during this post-Covid digestion period. Pool Corp differentiates itself by carrying a large array of industry-specific products compared to mass-market retailers that carry more standardized products or smaller industry competitors that have less availability or narrower selections. This sweet spot positions Pool Corp well in the expanding pool care and development market and the Company should be able to drive double-digit earnings growth over the next several years.”', 'Ex-Dividend Date: May 15', ""A Canada-based media company, Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI) ranks sixth on our list of the best dividend stocks.

One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS)."", ""Over half a decade, Synopsys managed to grow its earnings per share at 18% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 36% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth. This optimism is visible in its fairly high P/E ratio of 59.13."", 'You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).', ""It's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months.

Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 36% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper.

This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. In 2022, PMI acquired Swedish Match – a leader in oral nicotine delivery – creating a global smoke-free champion led by the companies’ IQOS and ZYN brands.

According to a report by Adobe Analytics, BNPL services drove online spending in November 2023, highlighting their significance in sustaining consumer spending resilience. AFRM is poised to capitalize on this momentum in the foreseeable future.', 'Additionally, strategic partnerships with well-established companies such as Evolve, Walmart, and Liberty Travel are anticipated to enhance its market presence further. The company’s improving free cash flow situation, now characterized by sustainable generation of free cash flow, is a major positive. At this rate, it can achieve full-year profitability on an adjusted operating income basis in the near future.', ""Affirm's consistent and disciplined performance in recent quarters has emerged as a catalyst for its network growth. The company continues to benefit from a high-interest environment, which has significantly contributed to its positive top-line performance. Rising active merchant numbers and Gross Merchandise Volume will continue to support its growth trajectory."", 'The growth potential in the BNPL space is bringing more players into the market, boosting competition. For example, Walmart Inc.’s WMT majority-owned fintech startup, One, had reportedly started offering BNPL services for big purchases from last month. The move from the multinational retail giant was big enough to have a negative effect on AFRM shares.', ""During the year-to-date period, AFRM stock experienced a decline of 26.3%, outpacing the industry's 16.4% decrease, while the S&P 500 Index recorded growth of 7.8%. Factors such as limited consumer loan demand in the secondary market and elevated funding costs attributed to high interest rates have the potential to impact AFRM's growth trajectory. Additionally, the company's forward 12-month price-to-sales ratio, currently standing at 4.19X, remains significantly higher than the industry average of 1.30X. This higher valuation may pose a barrier for investors considering ownership."", 'The estimates for the upcoming third-quarter fiscal 2024 results are also not all positive. Although the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s revenues is pegged at $548.1 million, indicating a 43.9% rise from the year-ago reported figure, the same for the bottom line is pegged at a loss of 70 cents per share, 1.5% wider than the year-ago loss. The consensus mark for earnings did not witness any movement in the past week.', 'In the past four quarters, AFRM beat earnings estimates twice and missed on the other occasions, the negative surprise being 26.5%. Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for it this time around. The combination of a positive\xa0Earnings ESP\xa0and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is not the case here.', 'The company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate currently stands at a loss of 70 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. It carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present. You can see\xa0the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.', 'You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our\xa0Earnings ESP Filter.', 'Affirm Holdings, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Affirm Holdings, Inc. Quote', 'While Affirm is well positioned to capitalize from resilient consumer spending and expected to witness continuous expansion in volumes, its unfavorable valuation, rising competition in the market and a lower likelihood of surpassing earnings estimates suggest that investors may want to wait for a more favorable entry point.', 'Here are some companies from the broader Business Services space that have already reported earnings this season.', 'Visa Inc. V reported strong second-quarter fiscal 2024 results, which benefited from expanding payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions. Its earnings per share of $2.51 outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.43 by 3.3%. The bottom line rose 20% year over year.', ""Despite challenges, such as a high interest rate environment, more than average inflation level and concerns about the economic slowdown, resilient consumer spending and strong e-commerce trends supported Visa's performance. However, higher operating expenses and client incentives partially tempered the upside."", ""The Western Union Company WU posted robust first-quarter 2024 results, driven by the Branded Digital business' resilience, growth in transactions, solid Consumer Money Transfer business performance and stabilization of the retail business. However, increased expenses tempered some of the gains."", 'It announced first-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings per share of 45 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 12.5%.

Simon discussed the positive impact of tourism on sales, particularly noting improvements in California and the Northeast, alongside the continued strength in Florida.

Simon also touched on the broader resilience of the mall environment and the diverse consumer base that supports their business model."", ""Q: David, Brian, you provided a same-store guide of at least 3% last quarter.

In response to the retailers, you said that it brings a lot of volatility. Obviously, we all like volatility in the right way. But you can't deny that you guys have made a ton. I guess I could use a French word to describe the tone, but you guys have made a ton of money, billions from these retailer investments. Yes, they are volatile, but they've been lucrative. So I just want to get a better sense, is the express model sort of a future where you guys will participate if you put in no capital?

First-quarter funds from operations were $1.33 billion or $3.56 per share compared to $1.03 billion or $2.74 per share last year. Let me walk you through some highlights for this quarter compared to Q1 of '23."", 'Domestic operations had a very good quarter and contributed $0.09 of growth, driven by higher rental income. Gains from investment activity in the first quarter were approximately $0.75 higher year over year. OPI had a $0.02 after-tax lower contribution compared to last year. Funds from operations from our real estate business was $2.91 per share in the first quarter compared to $2.82 in the prior-year period, 3.2% growth rate.', 'Domestic property NOI increased 3.7% year over year. We have continued leasing momentum. Resilient consumer spending and operational excellence delivered these results that were above our plan for the first quarter. Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties, at constant currency grew 3.9% for the quarter.', 'NOI from OPI in the first quarter includes a $33 million charge in one-time restructuring charges at SPARC and JCPenney. Excluding these one-time charges and a bargain purchase gain from Reebok transaction last year, NOI from OPI improved $5 million year over year and was on plan for the quarter. Remember, these retailers are on a fiscal year-end of January 31st, and the charges were part of the year-end closing process. They were not budgeted.', 'Mall occupancy at the end of the first quarter was 95.5%, an increase of 110 basis points compared to the prior year. Mills was 97.7. Average base minimum rent for our malls and outlets increased 3% year over year. And at the mills, 3.8% increase.', ""Leasing momentum continued, as I mentioned. We signed more than 1,300 leases for approximately 6.3 million square feet. Approximately 25% of our leasing activity in the first quarter was new deal volume. We are approximately 65% complete with our '24 lease expirations, and we continue to see strong broad-based demand from the retail community."", 'Retail sales volume across the portfolio increased 2.3% for the first quarter compared to last year. Our tourist-oriented properties outperformed the portfolio average in the quarter with a 6% increase in sales. Reported retail sales per square foot in the first quarter was $745 a foot for our outlets and malls combined, which was flat year over year, excluding two retailers. Retail sales per square foot from our premium outlet platform reached an all-time high this quarter.', 'Occupancy cost at the end of the first quarter was 12.6%. Now, let me talk about other platform investments, affectionately known as OPI. We sold our remaining interest in Authentic Brands Group during the first quarter for gross proceeds of close to $1.2 billion and recorded a pre-tax and after-tax gain of $415 million and $311 million, respectively. The sale in the first quarter combined with the sale in the fourth quarter yielded gross proceeds of $1.45 billion.', 'We generated substantial value from the ABG investment and a 7x multiple on our net invested capital during our short ownership period. As a result of the sale of ABG and the restructuring charges that I mentioned earlier, one-time in nature, at SPARC and Penney in the first quarter, we now expect FFO contribution from OPI to be around breakeven this year compared to the initial guidance of $0.10 to $0.15. For your reference, we budgeted at OPI the FFO from ABG around $0.08 per share. So, roughly half of that was associated with ABG.', 'Now, moving on to new development and redevelopment, we opened an AC Hotel at St. Johns Center. We are opening Tulsa Premium Outlets this summer. Leasing is going great, and we have a significant expansion at Busan Premium Outlets in South Korea this fall.', ""At the end of the quarter, new development and redevelopment projects were underway across our platforms in the U.S. and internationally as well. With our share of net cost of $930 million at a blended yield of 8%, we expect to start construction on additional projects in the next few months, including just shortly our residential project at Northgate Station in Seattle. What's interesting for us is we're able to build when others need to rely on construction lending market, which is, as you might imagine, very difficult right now."", 'We expect our starts to be around $500 million this year. Now, on our balance sheet, we retired $600 million of senior notes in the quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $11.2 billion of liquidity. Today, we announced our dividend of $2 per share for the second quarter, a year-over-year increase of 8.1%.', ""The dividend is payable on June 28th. And given the transactions for this quarter and our results for this quarter, our current view for the remainder of the year, we're increasing the full range of our full-year guidance of 2024 in the guidance range of $11.85 to -- I'm sorry. Let me restate that. We're increasing our range to $12.75 to $12.90 per share compared to $12.51 last year."", ""This is an increase of $0.90 at the bottom end of the range and $0.85 at the midpoint. Needless to say, I'm very pleased with our first-quarter results and our business. And tenant demand continues to remain strong despite a cloudy macroenvironment. Occupancy is increasing."", ""Property NOI is growing. We made a significant profit on our ABG investment, and everything's kind of moving on all the right directions. Thank you. We're ready for questions."", '', 'Operator', 'Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.', 'Caitlin Burrows -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', ""Hi. Good evening, everyone. Congrats on the solid quarter operationally and execution on the ABG sale. I guess there have been news reports that you could get involved in Express, so whether it's related to Express or Simon's strategy going forward, can you give some insight to your current thinking on having ownership in brands, what type of terms are attractive to you, and how you balance that with the potential earnings volatility?"", 'David Simon -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', ""Well, no one likes earnings volatility unless it's volatility in the right direction, OK? So, Caitlin, thank you for the comments to start, but that's -- I don't like volatility either. Listen, on Express, we were approached by the IP owner. I think it's not overly complicated in the sense that they saw what we had done historically both with ABG and SPARC and offered us to participate with no capital but also add our expertise and our knowledge in -- what we've done in the past with SPARC. And because we have always valued Express as a retailer and as a client, we jumped at the opportunity."", ""So, we don't expect it -- we expect it to be -- it's got to go through bankruptcy process, and that's out of our control. But if WHP does end up getting it, we'd be pleased to participate in the turnaround of Express. And again, we don't expect any capital as part of that participation. So, when we get opportunities like that, we evaluate it."", ""We look at the brand and the value of the brand. In this case, we're comfortable that Express is a good company and is a great brand, and we can add value to it. And given the fact that we were able to hopefully turn around the retailer, save jobs, create value from our investment, we see it as a win-win situation with no capital from our standpoint."", 'Caitlin Burrows -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'Great. Thanks for that.', 'David Simon -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.', 'Lizzy Doykan -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""Hi. This is Lizzy Doykan on for Jeff. I was curious if you could talk a little bit more about the key drivers of retailer sales as we started the year. And it seems like there's been some good outperformance from -- driven by especially your tourism-driven centers."", ""So, I'm just wondering how much that has been a factor into the first quarter of this year and how much upside there is remaining from tourism. Thanks."", 'David Simon -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure. We feel very bullish on our portfolio in general, and obviously, our tourist centers, especially in California and in the Northeast, are starting to finally see the improvement that we have been seeing for quite some time in Florida. And Florida continues to be an unbelievably strong market as well. So, we're finally seeing California/Northeast pick up."", ""Obviously, the strong dollar vis-a-vis for a certain currency does have an effect, kind of an inhibitor effect. But even with that said, domestic tourism continues to excel, and I think people, at the end of the day, when they go on holiday, they love shopping as part of that experience, dining, shopping, being with their families. And as I said earlier, I mean, we feel like the malls made a big comeback. Physical stores are where it's happening."", ""We're seeing a resurgence and reinvigoration of that whole product. So, we're pleased. It's kind of where we're seeing things. So, certainly, the lower-income consumer has been under pressure now for quite some time."", ""We're very focused on that. Obviously, inflation has taken its toll. And even though inflation is moderating, the prices the lower-income consumers are dealing with are quite daunting. So, we'll continue to see volatility in that area, we anticipate."", ""We're hoping that their cost of living moderates and, to some extent, their wages go up or their cost of living goes down, so we can see more discretionary income there. The higher-income consumer continues to spend and visit our properties, and it's good. A good example of that is our traffic for the first quarter, I think, was up around 2% for the year. Right, guys?"", 'Unknown speaker', 'Yes.', 'David Simon -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', ""So, that's also a very good sign. OK."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from the line of Samir Khanal with Evercore.

I guess, how do you feel about that guide today? Thanks."", 'David Simon -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. Look, we don't update that. As you probably know, I think you know, we don't -- that's our goal for the year. We don't update it every quarter as some others might, but we still feel like that's -- even though we've got some unanticipated, to some extent, I mean, we do create bogeys on our rental income stream on retailers that we do feel might come under pressure in the year."", ""So, we do have kind of adjustments in our budgeting process dealing with those. We still feel like our initial guidance on that is very achievable. So, we don't update it every quarter, but if we didn't feel like we could achieve it, I think we would highlight that. But we don't see that even with some of the -- I mean, we might not overachieve as we always want to, but I think we can still deliver the initial guidance."", 'Samir Khanal -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', 'Thank you, David.', 'David Simon -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.

Are there opportunities and appetite to go on offense on sort of buying more assets? Thanks."", 'David Simon -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure. I think we've seen rates more or less stabilized now. There was volatility prior to that where it was hard to predict. Now, we're not anticipating a reduction in rates, but at least we feel like we're in a more or less a stable rate environment."", ""That makes it easier to make investment decisions. So, I would break it up into two buckets, the first bucket being our redevelopment effort, and most of that, frankly, is mixed use in our properties, and we feel very bullish on that. Remember, you're talking about bringing on -- if it's a two- to three-year process, you're talking about bringing on product in two to three years, not going to be any supply. We do a very good job of understanding supply and demand."", ""The new, better product always wins. So, we are unabated in our mixed use, and we'll be doing some multifamily development both in Brea and Orange County. And as I mentioned, we just signed our GMP at Northgate Station to build about 300 units as part of that whole redevelopment. So, that really goes unabated that when you get to the external new deal environment, I would say we have a lot of opportunities ahead of us."", ""And I think our job is just to prioritize, make sure we're valuing the opportunities right, and we don't take our eye off the ball with what we're doing with our existing portfolio. So, long story short, I probably would venture to say that there could be more external opportunities for us, but again, it's got to be great quality at a fair price and assets where we think our expertise can add cash flow growth to them."", 'Ronald Kamdem -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'David Simon -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.', 'Michael Goldsmith -- UBS -- Analyst', 'Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. David, you highlighted the health of the consumer. It seems like doing all right or managing through the environment.', ""Just given your positioning, the occupancy gains and the pricing power that you have, if there was some sort of macro slowdown, do you think -- how do you think you would be able to navigate it? Or maybe said another way, do you think the business has become a little bit less macro-sensitive as you've -- as there's been consolidation and you've kind of become the place where you've reached consumers in that luxury space? Thanks."", 'David Simon -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure. Look, we are -- make no mistake about it. We are not immune to the macro environment. So, we would have to deal with it both from -- if it ultimately led to less consumer spending and more retail client stress, we're not immune to it."", ""However, and this is the big underlying from my standpoint, I have always felt like we've done our best work when others are dealing with the macro environment. And as I mentioned to you, we have $11 billion of liquidity in our comments earlier. So, I think when and if -- frankly, I mean, it's realistic to assume we may go through a reasonable slowdown here coming up. I think that's when we do our best work."", ""That's when others get tired and throw in the towel. That's where we get rejuvenated. Hopefully, we're rejuvenated now, but this is when we really get motivated. And as I think back and I've had the luxury of being in the spot for 30 years, I think we do our very best work when the times get tough."", ""So, I'm not wishing that on us or anyone, but it's a realistic probability. We won't be immune for it, but I think we'll further separate this company from our peers. So, that, I know. That, I have 100% confidence in that."", ""If that does happen, we'll have further separation."", 'Michael Goldsmith -- UBS -- Analyst', 'Thank you very much.', 'David Simon -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.', 'Alexander Goldfarb -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst', ""Hey, good afternoon out there. David, I just want to go back to Caitlin's question. In response to the retailers, you said that it brings a lot of volatility. Obviously, we all like volatility the right way, but you can't deny that you guys have made a ton, I guess I could use a French word to describe the ton, but you guys have made a ton of money, billions from these retailer investments."", ""Yes, they are volatile, but they've been lucrative. So, I just want to get a better sense, is the Express model sort of a future where you guys will participate if you put in no capital? Just trying to understand how you weigh the money that you've made versus the short term or the quarterly earnings volatility because clearly, it's been a source of success for you."", 'David Simon -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. That's a -- it's interesting, Alex. It's a very good question, and I think, honestly, we really focus on -- to the extent we do put in fresh capital, in addition to understanding what it means for our overall business and the totality of our company, it's also absolutely driven by return on investment, just like building a new shopping center. And again, yes, we have volatility, but in the scheme of things, again, and the fact that we've made money, I hope most folks are understanding that the volatility is really on the margin."", ""And I'll just give you a good example of -- and again, FFO, as you know, is net income plus depreciation. Well, the contribution we get from our retailers is net income, which is fully burdened by depreciation. So, there's no add-back. But to give you a simple analysis on just ABG, as an example, we cleared 1.450 billion of cash, and that produced about $0.08 of earnings because we just picked up our share of net income."", ""We only got -- as a shareholder, we only would get tax distribution. It's subchapter S, essentially. So, we'd only get our tax distributions, which amounted to $2 million a quarter, so that's $8 million. And if you take the 1.450 billion and you invest it in the bank at 5.5%, that's $70 million."", ""So, we went from $8 million in cash flow to 70 million just selling that. So, we look at every aspect of it, pre-tax, after tax. What does it mean to the portfolio? We don't want volatility, but we'll certainly accept it if we think it's going to be a good investment. And it all kind of goes into the analysis."", ""We understand the market is not thrilled with it, so we try to also do it in a way that really, really does not make it the story. It is on the margin, and it will always be on the margin. But we do think we can add value to the enterprise by some of these investments. And each investment is so idiosyncratic that it's hard to say."", ""Again, if Express happens, it's hard to say that that's the new model because I don't know that I can say that. I think every one of these things is somewhat idiosyncratic, but we do have the opportunity to do more than lease space in Alabama, someplace. That's what this company is all about. We do more."", ""We're in South Korea. We're in Jakarta. We're building in Tulsa. We're building apartments in Seattle."", ""I mean, I'm waxing a little bit here, we think of ourselves broader than I think the market thinks of us. That's a comment upon us, and I think our disclosures have gotten better over time, I hope you agree, Alex, on OPI. So, you can see it not detract from real estate, but at the same time, we're somewhat different than when you line us up to others that do some of what we do."", 'Alexander Goldfarb -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst', ""And that was the point, that you guys have this special thing. It's sort of like Kimco has their retailer unique thing, and it'd be a shame to do away with it if it was just volatility because clearly, it's made you a lot of cash. So, thank you for the answer."", 'David Simon -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you, Alex.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with Citi. Please proceed with your question.', 'Nick Joseph -- Citi -- Analyst', ""Thanks. It's Nick Joseph here with Craig. David, I just wanted to ask on kind of the opportunity to roll out additional luxury, either VIP suites or retailers. We saw what you did at Woodbury, and I'm just curious on the opportunity for the remainder of the portfolio."", ""What kind of demand do you think that will drive from some of these higher-income clientele that you're seeking?"", 'David Simon -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', ""Listen, I think we've got a great portfolio of real estate that is focused on the very high-income consumer, and I think we need to step up our game in all the services that need to be provided to that consumer. And I think Woodbury, Sawgrass are just the beginning of an effort to really -- I can't think of the right word, but really entertain that consumer to make it really special. And it's all the services that they're accustomed to. It's the fine dining."", ""It's the ease of access. It's having the right retailer mix. So, we probably have around 20 to 25 properties that are -- that have this high -- our centers are really big. So, they obviously appeal to a broader range of consumers, which is the way we like it because that's also -- you diversify the ebbs and flows."", ""But those 20 to 25 centers really need special attention. We've got a great team that's dedicated to them. And in many cases, we're the preferred or certainly a meaningful landlord to the best retailers in the world. And we want to -- we definitely want to stay in that spot."", ""So, a big push for us to step up our game when it's dealing with the very high-end consumer on all sorts of levels. So, I think what happens at Sawgrass with the Oasis and the Colonnade and what already happens at Woodbury, but we're just stepping up our game, will happen at Houston and King of Prussia. And if you saw what we did at Phipps in Atlanta and what's going on at Boca Raton in Florida, just to name a few that jump out at me, is really a high priority for the company."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from the line of Floris Van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please proceed with your question.', 'Floris Van Dijkum -- Compass Point Research and Trading -- Analyst', ""Hey, thanks. David, I was going to ask you about luxury, but I was picked. So, instead, I'm going to ask you about capital recycling. Presumably, your guidance, I mean, you just -- you cleared 1.2 billion on the ABG sale, sitting there in cash, and obviously, you do have some ongoing developments, but those are essentially funded from your retained cash flow, if you will."", ""So, the guidance assumes -- does that cash sit there uninvested, essentially, for the rest of the year? Or is there further upside, I guess, is what I'm getting at, if you were to do something else with that cash to redeploy that into higher-yielding investments."", 'David Simon -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes, very good question. We cleared in two months 1.450 billion, as you know, Floris. So, I just wanted to mention that. But yeah, right now, our guidance just assume it sits in the bank or pays down debt, but that's basically it."", 'So, no real redeployment is contemplated in our numbers at this point. Brian, if you want to add anything?', 'Brian McDade -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. No, that's right. We just assumed that we would hold the cash for the time being, and we have debt maturities coming due here in September and October, and so we could use the cash on hand to fund that. We also are carrying cash from our activities -- our capital markets activities last year."", 'So, the combination of it will address our upcoming maturities.', 'Floris Van Dijkum -- Compass Point Research and Trading -- Analyst', 'Thanks.', 'David Simon -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.', 'Vince Tibone -- Green Street Advisors -- Analyst', 'Hi. Good evening. Could you elaborate on the charges taken in the first quarter related to SPARC and JCPenney? And then possibly related to that, kind of what is your near-term outlook in terms of JCPenney store closures just given foot traffic trends in recent years have not been great? So, just curious how long you think the current store count and fleet is sustainable.', 'David Simon -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. The charges pre-tax were $33 million, so it's kind of funny because most charges are in the hundreds of millions of dollars. So, I think you have to put it in perspective. But with that said, it really dealt with personnel and inventory."", ""So, that were the two primary factors and more, really, on the inventory side because we had some clearance inventory in SPARC. It was really focused on F21 and Penney, just on basically clearing out some inventory. So, Penney, we're pleased with Penney. I'll just talk a moment about the store closings."", ""They're very interesting. Penney is able to produce positive EBITDA even if there's not high sales. I think they do out of the box. So, I don't really -- in fact, I think Penney almost can be a beneficiary opening new stores as opposed to closing stores."", ""I'm sure there will be a few here and there, but most all of their stores are positive EBITDA. And so, they have a very good way of having positive EBITDA out of what I call low-volume stores. And again, this is what's interesting to us. Penney's not public."", ""So, you know what matters to me, Vince? Cash flow, EBITDA, and obviously, sales are important, right? But as long as we're profitable out of the stores, there's no Wall Street pressure that we've got to narrow the store count. I don't necessarily believe shrink to grow. It's very hard to achieve. Maybe you can achieve it."", ""It's my history, not overly long but long enough. I don't care what industry. It's very hard to do. Some have done it, but to me, if it's got positive EBITDA, there's nothing wrong with maintaining that store for the community."", ""You certainly don't want to lower standards of how you operate it, but if you can create cash flow, it doesn't necessarily mean you have to reinvest that much in it, and you can use that cash flow to reinvest in other elements of your business. So, I don't anticipate -- long story short, I really don't anticipate much portfolio real estate activity at the JCP level."", 'Vince Tibone -- Green Street Advisors -- Analyst', ""No, that's really helpful color. Maybe if I just ask a quick follow-up on that. I'm just curious, given the ownership structure, I mean, are you guys able to pursue recapturing some of these boxes at your best properties to unlock mixed use development opportunities, or how would that work given your split ownership with Brookfield?"", 'David Simon -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', ""Well, look, I think as part of the deal originally, first of all, our relationship with Brookfield is excellent. And we're both basically an ABG's -- an investor in there as well. But we very much see eye to eye on JCPenney and how it operates and how we should operate it. And I would say both of us -- and now my memory is a little bit cloudy."", ""But when we did the restructuring, both of us got the opportunity to reclaim certain space from JCPenney that we could redevelop. So, it's a good question. And the fact is we are about to embark upon one that you'll see an announcement in the near future where we are going to ultimately redevelop a JCPenney at one of our centers. And I don't remember the exact count, I don't remember exactly how much Brookfield, but as part of the bankruptcy process and negotiation with each other, we did give each other the right to do that."", ""And so, what happens there is we get notice to the company. It's already documented, and we get the -- in this case, it's a lease. So, there's nothing to pay. We just cancel the lease."", ""Now, obviously, store's a little bit profitable, very profitable for JCPenney, so we're going to have to find them some new opportunities to make up for it. But that's all part of it, part of the deal. So, I think there'll be a handful like that both from us and Brookfield that we'll be able to do, and again, that was all pre-negotiated. To the extent that there's one that wasn't part of that negotiation, that's, given our relationship with Brookfield, pretty straightforward."", 'We come up with a value or they come up with a value. Obviously, the JCPenney management team would have to be part of that.

And in your prepared comments, you talked about sales on a per square foot basis being flat, stripping out two tenants. Just curious on the color of why those two tenants were stripped out, if there's any interesting --"", 'David Simon -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. Let me answer that. I think the two tenants, I mean, even if we didn't, I think it's just color for you to know that generally, the portfolio was flat. We don't like to name tenants, so we don't focus on it."", ""I'd also, I think, point out to you the most important thing we look is total volume. And we were up quarter over quarter. What was the number again? 2.3%. That's really the number we look at."", ""And again, remember, these are reported sales. We can get into this whole diatribe about some of the retailers credit their sales with internet returns. So, it's just information, OK? Do what you want with it, but it's just information. But our sales, if you include the two retailers, the last 12 months was down 1.8% on a rolling 12."", ""But total, because not all those are comp, total was up 2.3%, which is the more important number. Now, we also -- and Brian can add in here. Now that I'm talking, I might as well just finish. We don't -- as part of our discussion, we'll never get into a retailer-specific response."", 'But obviously, bankruptcy for tenants has a lot of -- a lot goes on. Leases have to be rejected and depending on where they were on that and what happens. So, in our comp NOI, we have our bad debt expense. I think I gave you some color.', ""We still feel like it's achievable. But again, I don't think -- and Brian can add. We're not going to really give you a color too much on Express, but we do put in -- when we model our business for the year, we do put in unforeseen circumstances, and we try to budget appropriately for retailers that are under pressure.

First, I wanted to follow up on Floris' question on the uses for the cash from the retail monetization."", ""The stock's $35 or so higher than what you lost back.

And I would just add to that the ABG sale happened -- I don't remember exactly, but near quarter-end, and we were blacked out from that because of Q1 earnings.

The first, the most important one is that we have the history of running a retailer coming out of bankruptcy.

And I think what our potential partner sees on that is that we can bring to the table."", ""So, I wouldn't underestimate that. That's one. Number two is, as part of any bankruptcy, we're going to have a lease negotiation. Some leases will get restructured, some won't, some will pay what the existing rent is, and so on."", ""But that happens regardless of whether or not we're involved or not.

(NYSE:GS) just released its latest first-quarter results and things are looking bullish. It was overall a positive result, with revenues beating expectations by 9.9% to hit US$14b. Goldman Sachs Group also reported a statutory profit of US$11.58, which was an impressive 33% above what the analysts had forecast. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year."", ' View our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group ', ""Taking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for Goldman Sachs Group from 18 analysts is for revenues of US$51.2b in 2024. If met, it would imply a decent 9.6% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to soar 45% to US$37.05. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$51.1b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$36.78 in 2024.

Analysts definitely have varying views on the business, but the spread of estimates is not wide enough in our view to suggest that extreme outcomes could await Goldman Sachs Group shareholders.', ""Looking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. The analysts are definitely expecting Goldman Sachs Group's growth to accelerate, with the forecast 13% annualised growth to the end of 2024 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 6.1% per annum over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 5.7% per year. It seems obvious that, while the growth outlook is brighter than the recent past, the analysts also expect Goldman Sachs Group to grow faster than the wider industry."", ""The most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates."", ""With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Goldman Sachs Group.

Goldman’s stock has been hitting new highs lately, closing at $438.18 on Friday, up 14% for the year and more than 8 times the $53 it sold shares at in May 1999. Its shares have outperformed rivals during its era as a public company, even if the bank has seen its share of twists and turns.', '“Back then it was the dominant firm,” said Tim Ghriskey, who followed Goldman’s IPO as a senior portfolio manager at Dreyfus Corp. at the time. “It was a partnership — they made aggressive bets and more often than not they were successful.”', 'It wasn’t always smooth sailing for the firm. Goldman went public during a heyday for Wall Street amid the dot-com bubble. A decade later, shares tumbled as the confidence was rattled in the US financial system. Goldman was one of several banks that accepted government support in 2008 that helped stabilize the financial system. It also restructured itself into a bank holding company, as did chief rival Morgan Stanley.', 'The IPO, which hewed off a 15% stake of the firm, helped make many people rich. Today, partners own a much smaller portion of Goldman shares. When the bank went public a quarter-century ago, it had less than 14,000 employees and net revenue of about $13 billion. Its workforce now totals more than 44,000 people, who produced more than $46 billion of net revenue in 2023.', '“When I think about how much has changed since then, what’s remarkable is how much has stayed constant: our core values, our partnership ethos, and the caliber of our people,” Chief Executive Officer David Solomon wrote in a post on LinkedIn about the anniversary.', 'Goldman’s recent advance has come alongside management’s decision to back away from consumer lending, which had been a key push under Solomon. Solomon is the third CEO since Goldman went public, following Lloyd Blankfein who handed over the reins in 2018. His predecessor, Henry Paulson, took the company public in 1999 and left to become US Treasury Secretary in 2006.', 'Goldman Sachs has been around since 1869, when an immigrant from Germany opened an office in lower Manhattan.

In the \'long\' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock\'s price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.', 'Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.', 'Below, we take a look at Goldman Sachs (GS), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.', ""It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Goldman Sachs currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period."", 'You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>', 'Set to Beat the Market?', ""Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for GS that show why this investment bank shows promise as a solid momentum pick."", ""Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area."", ""For GS, shares are up 2.48% over the past week while the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry is up 0.87% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 7.38% compares favorably with the industry's 1.63% performance as well."", 'While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Goldman Sachs have risen 14.03%, and are up 33.99% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 3.78% and 27.1%, respectively.', ""Investors should also take note of GS's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, GS is averaging 2,635,439 shares for the last 20 days."", 'Earnings Outlook', 'The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with GS.', ""Over the past two months, 8 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost GS's consensus estimate, increasing from $32.86 to $36.07 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 7 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period."", 'Bottom Line', ""Given these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that GS is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A.

As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.', ""This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement.

In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', 'Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.', 'On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.', 'In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.', ""Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements."", 'Is GS a Good Investment?', 'Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Goldman, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 10.4% over the past month to $36.07.', ""Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Goldman.

As reported by CNBC on April 30, home prices in February increased 6.4% year over year.

Regarding housing affordability, we have also discussed the least affordable metros for homebuyers in the US.', 'Monthly price appreciation has been reported in expensive West Coast metros where the inventory remains restricted and has not yet recovered since the pandemic. The highest monthly home value growth from February to March was recorded at 3.3% for San Jose, 2.7% for San Francisco, 2.4% for Seattle, 2.1% for San Diego, and 2% for Los Angeles. These are the five US metros where homeowners are most subject to a mortgage rate lock-in effect, which is when existing homeowners feel reluctant to sell their homes since they will have to purchase at higher rates. Buyers tend to compete for fewer choices in such markets with limited supply. On the other hand, existing inventory has improved in the Southern metros thereby easing the rapid price appreciation. New construction has also added to the choices in these housing markets.

A ""non-GAAP financial measure"" is defined as a numerical measure of a company\'s financial performance that excludes or includes amounts different from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the statements of operations, balance sheets or statements of cash flows of the Company. Pursuant to the requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company has provided reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures for the following non-GAAP financial measures referred to in this press release:', 'net sales growth on an organic basis, which excludes acquisitions, divested businesses, exited product lines, and the impact of currency,', 'adjusted gross profit,', 'adjusted net income,', 'adjusted operating income,', 'adjusted diluted earnings per share,', 'adjusted operating margin, and', 'adjusted gross margin.', 'These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as supplements to the GAAP reported measures, should not be considered replacements for, or superior to the GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies. The Company presents these non-GAAP financial measures in order to provide transparency to our investors because they are measures that management uses to assess both management performance and the financial performance of our operations and to allocate resources. In addition, management believes that these measures may assist investors with understanding and evaluating our initiatives to drive improved financial performance and enables investors to supplementally compare our operating performance with the operating performance of our competitors including with those of our competitors having different capital structures. While we have excluded certain of these items from historical non-GAAP financial measures, there is no guarantee that the items excluded from non-GAAP financial measures will not continue into future periods. For instance, we expect to continue to experience and report restructuring-related charges associated with continued execution of our strategic initiatives.', ""The Company provides non-GAAP financial measures as additional information that it believes is useful to investors and analysts in evaluating the performance of the Company's ongoing operating trends, facilitating comparability between periods and, where applicable, with companies in similar industries and assessing the Company's prospects for future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude items, such as impairment charges, restructuring charges, and acquisition and integration-related charges, that by their nature affect comparability of operational performance or that we believe obscure underlying business operational trends. The intangible asset amortization excluded from these non-GAAP financial measure represents the entire amount recorded within the Company's GAAP financial statements and is excluded because the amortization, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised. The revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure. The non-GAAP measures the Company provides are consistent with how management analyzes and assesses the operating performance of the Company, and disclosing them provides investor insight into management's view of the business. Management uses these adjusted financial measures for planning and forecasting in future periods, and evaluating segment and overall operating performance. In addition, management uses certain of the profit measures as factors in determining compensation."", ""Non-GAAP measures related to profit measurements, which include adjusted gross profit, adjusted net income, adjusted operating income, adjusted diluted EPS, adjusted gross margin and adjusted operating margin are useful to investors as they provide them with supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the Company's underlying business performance and trends, and enhance the ability of investors and analysts to compare the Company's period-to-period financial results. Management believes that adjusted gross margin and adjusted operating margin are useful to investors, in addition to the reasons discussed above, by allowing them to more easily compare and analyze trends in the Company's peer business group and assisting them in comparing the Company's overall performance to that of its competitors. The Company also discloses net sales growth excluding the impact of currency on an organic basis. The Company believes these supplemental financial measures provide investors with consistency in financial reporting, enabling meaningful comparisons of past and present underlying operating results, and also facilitate analysis of the Company's operating performance and acquisition and divestiture trends."", ""A copy of this press release, including the reconciliations, is available on the

These measurements are not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance. The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that NRG’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.', 'EBITDA represents net income before interest expense (including loss on debt extinguishment), income taxes, depreciation and amortization, asset retirement obligation expenses, contract amortization consisting of amortization of power and fuel contracts and amortization of emission allowances. EBITDA is presented because NRG considers it an important supplemental measure of its performance and believes debt-holders frequently use EBITDA to analyze operating performance and debt service capacity. EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:', 'EBITDA does not reflect cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures, or contractual commitments;', 'EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs;', 'EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on debt or cash income tax payments;', 'Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and', 'Other companies in this industry may calculate EBITDA differently than NRG does, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.', 'Because of these limitations, EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to use to invest in the growth of NRG’s business. NRG compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA only supplementally. See the statements of cash flow included in the financial statements that are a part of this news release.', 'Adjusted EBITDA is presented as a further supplemental measure of operating performance. As NRG defines it, Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA excluding the impact of stock-based compensation, amortization of customer acquisition costs (primarily amortized commissions), impairment losses, deactivation costs, gains or losses on sales, dispositions or retirements of assets, any mark-to-market gains or losses from forward position of economic hedges, adjustments to exclude the Adjusted EBITDA related to the non-controlling interest, gains or losses on the repurchase, modification or extinguishment of debt, the impact of restructuring and any extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring items, plus adjustments to reflect the Adjusted EBITDA from our unconsolidated investments. The reader is encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons NRG considers it appropriate for supplemental analysis. As an analytical tool, Adjusted EBITDA is subject to all of the limitations applicable to EBITDA. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, the reader should be aware that in the future NRG may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this news release.', ""Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and other users of NRG's financial statements in evaluating its operating performance because it provides an additional tool to compare business performance across companies and across periods and adjusts for items that we do not consider indicative of NRG’s future operating performance. This measure is widely used by debt-holders to analyze operating performance and debt service capacity and by equity investors to measure our operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis and to readily view operating trends, as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations, and for evaluating actual results against such expectations, and in communications with NRG's Board of Directors, shareholders, creditors, analysts and investors concerning its financial performance."", 'Adjusted Cash provided by operating activities is a non-GAAP measure NRG provides to show Cash provided/(used) by operating activities with the reclassification of net payments of derivative contracts acquired in business combinations from financing to operating cash flow, as well as the add back of merger, integration, related restructuring costs, changes in the nuclear decommissioning trust liability, and the impact of extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring items. The Company provides the reader with this alternative view of Cash provided/(used) by operating activities because the cash settlement of these derivative contracts materially impact operating revenues and cost of sales, while GAAP requires NRG to treat them as if there was a financing activity associated with the contracts as of the acquisition dates. The Company adds back merger, integration related restructuring costs as they are one time and unique in nature and do not reflect ongoing Cash Flows from Operating Activities and they are fully disclosed to investors. The company excludes changes in the nuclear decommissioning trust liability as these amounts are offset by changes in the decommissioning fund shown in Cash Flows from Investing Activities.', 'Free Cash Flow before Growth Investments is Adjusted Cash provided by operating activities less maintenance and environmental capital expenditures, net of funding and insurance recoveries related to property, plant and equipment, dividends from preferred instruments treated as debt by ratings agencies, and distributions to non-controlling interests and is used by NRG predominantly as a forecasting tool to estimate cash available for debt reduction and other capital allocation alternatives. The reader is encouraged to evaluate each of these adjustments and the reasons NRG considers them appropriate for supplemental analysis. Because we have mandatory debt service requirements (and other non-discretionary expenditures) investors should not rely on Free Cash Flow before Growth Investments as a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures.', ""Free Cash Flow before Growth Investments is utilized by Management in making decisions regarding the allocation of capital. Free Cash Flow before Growth Investments is presented because the Company believes it is a useful tool for assessing the financial performance in the current period. In addition, NRG’s peers evaluate cash available for allocation in a similar manner and accordingly, it is a meaningful indicator for investors to benchmark NRG's performance against its peers. Free Cash Flow before Growth Investments is a performance measure and is not intended to represent Net Income/(Loss), Cash provided/(used) by operating activities (the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure), or liquidity and is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies."", 'View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240506592101/en/', 'Contacts', 'Media Chevalier Gray832.763.3454', 'InvestorsBrendan Mulhern609.524.4767']"

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Having said that, from a first glance at NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look."", ""Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for NextEra Energy, this is the formula:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.058 = US$9.1b ÷ (US$180b - US$25b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).', ""Therefore, NextEra Energy has an ROCE of 5.8%. On its own that's a low return, but compared to the average of 4.7% generated by the Electric Utilities industry, it's much better."", ' View our latest analysis for NextEra Energy ', ""In the above chart we have measured NextEra Energy's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for NextEra Energy ."", ""There are better returns on capital out there than what we're seeing at NextEra Energy. The company has employed 70% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 5.8%. Given the company has increased the amount of capital employed, it appears the investments that have been made simply don't provide a high return on capital."", ""In conclusion, NextEra Energy has been investing more capital into the business, but returns on that capital haven't increased. Since the stock has gained an impressive 64% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward."", ""If you'd like to know more about NextEra Energy, we've spotted   2 warning signs,  and 1 of them doesn't sit too well with us."", ""While NextEra Energy may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

Beef was up in the three-month period but down overall in the second half.', 'The decline in chicken volumes was attributed to six plants that Tyson Foods has closed since last year as part of a factory optimisation drive, which has also included the shutting down of two case-ready beef facilities.', 'Chicken sales fell 8.2% in the second quarter to $4.06bn. CFO John Tyson explained the volume decline was “driven by lower production as we better aligned our supply to customer demand”, even as prices were cut 2.1%.', 'However, he said the forward “momentum” in the chicken segment continued in the second quarter, accompanied by a “significant improvement” in profitability.', 'Consequently, Tyson Foods raised its outlook for adjusted operating income (AOI) for chicken to $700-900m, from the $500-700m provided at the first-quarter results announcement in February.', 'That boosted the group AOI guidance for fiscal 2024 to a range of $1.4-1.8bn, compared to $1-1.5bn previously.

(NYSE:TSN)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-intrinsic-value-tyson-foods-104013435.html,1715078413,STORY,['TSN'],"['Using the Dividend Discount Model, Tyson Foods fair value estimate is US$54.79', 'Current share price of US$58.50 suggests Tyson Foods is potentially trading close to its fair value', ""Our fair value estimate is 13% lower than Tyson Foods' analyst price target of US$63.17"", ""How far off is Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow."", 'Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Tyson Foods ', ""As Tyson Foods operates in the food sector, we need to calculate the intrinsic value slightly differently. In this approach dividends per share (DPS) are used, as free cash flow is difficult to estimate and often not reported by analysts. Unless a company pays out the majority of its FCF as a dividend, this method will typically underestimate the value of the stock. The 'Gordon Growth Model' is used, which simply assumes that dividend payments will continue to increase at a sustainable growth rate forever. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a company's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In this case we used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.4%). The expected dividend per share is then discounted to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.1%. Relative to the current share price of US$58.5, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out."", 'Value Per Share = Expected Dividend Per Share / (Discount Rate - Perpetual Growth Rate)', '= US$2.0 / (6.1% – 2.4%)', '= US$54.8', ""Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Tyson Foods as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business."", 'Strength', 'No major strengths identified for TSN.', 'Weakness', 'Interest payments on debt are not well covered.', 'Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Food market.', 'Opportunity', 'Expected to breakeven next year.', 'Has sufficient cash runway for more than 3 years based on current free cash flows.', 'Good value based on P/S ratio compared to estimated Fair P/S ratio.', 'Threat', 'Debt is not well covered by operating cash flow.', 'Dividends are not covered by cash flow.', 'Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn\'t be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It\'s not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?""

A: (Brady Stewart - Group President, Beef, Pork & Chief Supply Chain Officer, Tyson Foods, Inc.)

The financial tables from the filing highlight a gross profit increase to $866 million from $527 million, and an operating income of $312 million, recovering from a previous operating loss.

We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.', ""It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. PulteGroup currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period."", 'You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>', 'Set to Beat the Market?', ""In order to see if PHM is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this homebuilder holds up."", 'A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.', ""For PHM, shares are up 2.5% over the past week while the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry is up 2.5% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 0.25% compares favorably with the industry's 0.25% performance as well."", 'While any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Over the past quarter, shares of PulteGroup have risen 13.13%, and are up 74.04% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 3.78% and 27.1%, respectively.', ""Investors should also take note of PHM's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, PHM is averaging 1,825,814 shares for the last 20 days."", 'Earnings Outlook', ""The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with PHM."", ""Over the past two months, 6 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost PHM's consensus estimate, increasing from $11.77 to $12.91 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 7 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period."", 'Bottom Line', ""Taking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that PHM is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep PulteGroup on your short list."", 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Though the S&P 500 fell by nearly 4% in April, the index surged by 8.12% this year so far and also recorded its biggest first-quarter gain since 2019. Analysts are also holding a positive stance about the market’s condition this year as they predict that earnings growth for the S&P 500 will pick up speed, reaching 9.7% in the second quarter, as reported by Forbes. They also expect that companies in the index will deliver an impressive 10.8% growth in earnings for the rest of 2024. In addition to this, dividend stocks are also showing a modest performance this year, with the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index gaining 2.07% year-to-date.', 'Also read:', '12 Best Dividend Stocks with High Upside Potential', 'Regardless of market conditions, investors consistently favor dividend stocks as they are known for generating regular income for them. Dividend growth stocks are especially important in this strategy because of their compounding effect and share price appreciation. The S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrat Index tracks the performance of companies that have raised their dividends consistently for at least 20 years. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, between December 31, 1999, and March 31, 2024, the index produced a total return of 915.47% and a price return of 344.83%. The difference of 570.64% between the total return and price return is attributed to the dividends received over the period. The report further mentioned that the dividend growth rate of companies in the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrat Index has also surpassed inflation over the long term. The index’s dollar dividends grew at a compound annual growth rate of 4.96% from 2000 to 2023, exceeding the performance of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) during the same period. Walmart Inc.

The fund manager also expects global dividends to reach their all-time of $1.72 trillion in 2024, showing a nearly 4% growth on a headline basis. Analysts are also optimistic about dividend growth in the US. According to a report by S&P Global Market Intelligence, all 20 sectors within the US market are predicted to boost their regular dividend payouts this year, with an annual average rise of 6%. This growth is partially credited to companies that resumed dividend payments in 2023 following dividend cuts induced by the pandemic of 2020, and a few more are expected to follow suit in 2024.', 'While long-term investors like to hold onto dividend stocks for long-term gains, some aim for maximum returns in the short term through a strategy called dividend capture that involves purchasing a stock just before the dividend is distributed, holding it just long enough to receive the dividends, and then selling it.

During this period, the Zacks Medical - Products industry, which Medtronic falls in, has lost 1.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision."", 'Earnings Estimate Revisions', ""Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements."", 'Medtronic is expected to post earnings of $1.45 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -7.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2%.', 'The consensus earnings estimate of $5.20 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -1.7%.

Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.', ""With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.

It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial."", 'For Medtronic, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $8.44 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -1.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $32.21 billion and $33.51 billion estimates indicate +3.2% and +4% changes, respectively.', 'Last Reported Results and Surprise History', 'Medtronic reported revenues of $8.09 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.7%.

The EPS surprise was +3.17%.', 'The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.', 'Valuation', ""No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance."", ""Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is."", 'The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.', 'Medtronic is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers.

Notably, in all of its materials, the Company has said nothing about the Board and management's abysmal financial performance, why they pursued a capital allocation plan that led to a debt-fueled dividend, or how they let much of the Company's senior-most talent walk out the door with no succession plan. Rather, the only thing this Board can try to do is misrepresent the vast tower industry expertise, experience and skillsets of our nominees and our intentions, while promising the change they have failed to deliver for over a decade. With its repeated strategic failures, poor governance, poor communication and lack of leadership, the Board has proven that it is more focused on entrenchment than complying with its fiduciary duty and cannot be trusted to do the right thing for shareholders.

As reported by CNBC on April 30, home prices in February increased 6.4% year over year. With all-time high prices in major cities including San Diego, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and New York, affordability concerns continue to arise. Regarding housing affordability, we have also discussed the least affordable metros for homebuyers in the US.', 'Monthly price appreciation has been reported in expensive West Coast metros where the inventory remains restricted and has not yet recovered since the pandemic. The highest monthly home value growth from February to March was recorded at 3.3% for San Jose, 2.7% for San Francisco, 2.4% for Seattle, 2.1% for San Diego, and 2% for Los Angeles. These are the five US metros where homeowners are most subject to a mortgage rate lock-in effect, which is when existing homeowners feel reluctant to sell their homes since they will have to purchase at higher rates. Buyers tend to compete for fewer choices in such markets with limited supply. On the other hand, existing inventory has improved in the Southern metros thereby easing the rapid price appreciation. New construction has also added to the choices in these housing markets. Some of the affordable, promising cities to buy real estate in 2024 have been previously covered.', 'As of March, total inventory has increased by 12.2% year over year. However, the inventory levels are still 36.4% lower as compared to the pre-pandemic period. New listings have also gone up by 3.7% since 2023, still falling behind the pre-pandemic levels by 25.4%.

Gossamer has been testing seralutinib as a potential treatment for an uncommon disease known, in short, as PAH, and is currently recruiting patients in a late-stage clinical trial meant to serve as the basis for approval applications.', 'PAH, or pulmonary arterial hypertension, is a form of high blood pressure in the lungs. The pressure makes the heart work harder to pump blood, over time causing the organ to weaken or even fail. The Food and Drug Administration has approved several blood vessel-widening medicines that help alleviate the symptoms of PAH, and more recently cleared a first-of-its-kind therapy from Merck & Co.', 'Unlike other treatments, Merck’s Winrevair inhibits a protein that thickens the walls of blood vessels. The therapy is injected every three weeks, and is seen as a valuable product by both Wall Street and Merck, which acquired it through an $11.5 billion buyout of Acceleron Pharma in 2021. Analysts have predicted Winrevair could generate annual sales anywhere between $1 billion to $8 billion at its peak.', 'Gossamer believes there’s still room in the market for its drug, as it also works differently than available treatment options and comes as an inhaled powder. Results from a smaller PAH study encouraged the company to advance seralutinib into that late-stage trial, titled “Prosera,” which will enroll 350 participants and complete by late 2025.', 'While Gossamer remains confident in its drug, company investors have questioned the strength of those earlier trial results and whether seralutinib can truly compete with Winrevair. Shares of Gossamer lost three-quarters of their value in late 2022, when findings from the smaller study were announced. As of Monday morning, they traded at about 75 cents apiece.', 'Joseph Schwartz, an analyst at investment firm Leerink Partners, wrote in a note to clients that the new deal with Chiesi “could address many of the concerns investors have” with Gossamer. Chief among those concerns, according to Schwartz, is the company’s ability to enroll and fund Prosera.', 'The collaboration “bodes well” for Gossamer “based on the amount of diligence that typically precedes a collaboration,” the analyst wrote.', 'Per deal terms, Gossamer will continue leading the development of seralutinib in PAH as well as another, related indication the companies are interested in: pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease. Though Gossamer and Chiesi will evenly split development costs, the former is responsible for financing Prosera.', 'In the U.S., the partners plan to evenly share commercial profits and losses. Gossamer will helm commercialization efforts for those two diseases, while Chiesi will take the lead for any additional indications.', 'Chiesi will also have the exclusive right to commercialize seralutinib outside of the U.S. Gossamer will get mid-to-high teens royalties on net sales. Chiesi has agreed to pay Gossamer $160 million as a development reimbursement, and may shell out up to $326 million more, provided certain regulatory and sales milestones are achieved.', 'This story was originally published on BioPharma Dive.

It represents the annual contract value of all active recurring revenue contracts at any point in time. Recurring revenue is defined as a revenue stream that is contractual, typically for a period of 12 months or more, and has a high probability of renewal. The probability of renewal is based on historical renewal experience of the individual revenue streams, or management's best estimates if historical renewal experience is not available. Total ARR growth is calculated as the dollar change in ARR, adjusted to exclude the effects of currency, divided by ARR as of the prior period. The effects of currency translation are excluded by calculating Total ARR on a constant currency basis. Total ARR includes acquisitions even if there was no comparable ARR in the prior period. We believe that Total ARR provides useful information to investors because it reflects our recurring revenue performance period over period including the effect of acquisitions. Our measure of ARR may be different from measures used by other companies. Because ARR is based on annual contract value, it does not represent revenue recognized during a particular reporting period or revenue to be recognized in future reporting periods and is not intended to be a substitute for revenue, contract liabilities, or backlog."", 'Organic ARR - Organic ARR growth is calculated as the dollar change in ARR, adjusted to exclude the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, divided by ARR as of the prior period. The effects of currency translation are excluded by calculating Organic ARR on a constant currency basis. When we acquire businesses, we exclude the effect of ARR in the current period for which there was no comparable ARR in the prior period.

While service revenues increased from $1,694 million in Q1 2023 to $1,905 million in Q1 2024, net income available to common stockholders saw a decrease from $926 million to $631 million in the same period. This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as revealed by the latest SEC filings, offering investors a comprehensive view of Williams Companies Inc's market standing and future prospects."", ""Robust Infrastructure and Strategic Acquisitions: Williams Companies Inc's strength lies in its expansive pipeline infrastructure, which includes the Transco and Northwest pipeline systems.

Williams told the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission it was allowing a key construction application to expire, saying it would not seek an extension for it.', 'The decision heartened a wide group of environmental and community groups who had fought the proposal for eight years, saying it would further the burning of fossil fuels and contribute to climate change, while also degrading air and water quality and creating safety concerns in communities along its route.', 'Cindy Zipf, executive director of Clean Ocean Action, called the development ""an extraordinary victory, a David and Goliath moment.""', ""Using the project's acronym, she said, “NESE has gasped its last gassy breath.

Last September, federal regulators suspended authorization to transport liquefied natural gas by rail.', '“The last thing we need is even more dangerous methane gas extracted from Pennsylvania, shipped through our communities by truck, and exported overseas,"" said Patrick Grenter, a campaign director with the Sierra Club. ""This decision is unnecessary and reckless, and the Sierra Club is prepared to continue fighting this project until it is officially canceled.”', 'The companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.', 'But in a filing to the agency on Friday, Bradford said its Wyalusing, Pennsylvania, facility is designed to not need rail cars, and is “unimpacted” by the federal moratorium on such transport.

Instead, those who pointed out shortcomings were sidelined or reprimanded, he said.', 'Boeing has disputed that characterization and pointed to the latest notification as an example of employees doing the right thing.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Biggest Real Estate Companies in the US in 2024.', 'The US real estate market has long been subject to high mortgage rates and soaring home prices. As reported by CNBC on April 30, home prices in February increased 6.4% year over year. With all-time high prices in major cities including San Diego, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and New York, affordability concerns continue to arise. Regarding housing affordability, we have also discussed the least affordable metros for homebuyers in the US.', 'Monthly price appreciation has been reported in expensive West Coast metros where the inventory remains restricted and has not yet recovered since the pandemic. The highest monthly home value growth from February to March was recorded at 3.3% for San Jose, 2.7% for San Francisco, 2.4% for Seattle, 2.1% for San Diego, and 2% for Los Angeles. These are the five US metros where homeowners are most subject to a mortgage rate lock-in effect, which is when existing homeowners feel reluctant to sell their homes since they will have to purchase at higher rates. Buyers tend to compete for fewer choices in such markets with limited supply. On the other hand, existing inventory has improved in the Southern metros thereby easing the rapid price appreciation. New construction has also added to the choices in these housing markets. Some of the affordable, promising cities to buy real estate in 2024 have been previously covered.', 'As of March, total inventory has increased by 12.2% year over year. However, the inventory levels are still 36.4% lower as compared to the pre-pandemic period. New listings have also gone up by 3.7% since 2023, still falling behind the pre-pandemic levels by 25.4%. Therefore, strong demand and tight supply continue to drive home values up in the US.', 'Some of the dominant real estate companies in the US include Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX), Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD), and Keller Williams Realty. Let’s take a look at what these companies have been up to.', 'Equinix, Inc.

These brands, which are integral to the company's portfolio in the outdoor and athletic segments, have faced market pressures that extend beyond internal strategies. These pressures mirror broader market trends influencing consumer spending patterns, highlighting the dynamic challenges faced by the industry.For the first quarter of 2024, Wolverine projects revenues of $360 million, which indicates a substantial decline of 30% from that reported in the prior-year period. This sharp decline is likely to have resulted from several non-recurring factors from the previous year that significantly inflated the figures back then. These extraordinary gains are not expected to have recurred, thus heavily influencing year-over-year revenue comparisons.Additional adjustments contributing to the revenue decline include a $40-million shift in international distributor shipments that previously boosted first-quarter revenues, which are not anticipated to recur. About $13 million in revenue impacts are expected to have occurred due to transitions in business models, notably the shift to licensing models for certain operations. These changes reflect Wolverine's strategic realignment to focus on more profitable and sustainable business practices.Despite the anticipated decline in revenues, Wolverine expects a notable improvement in its gross margin for the first quarter. The gross margin is estimated at 46%, a substantial rise of 480 basis points from the previous year. This improvement is attributed to several factors, including significantly lower supply-chain costs, reduced sales of end-of-life inventory and a better distribution channel mix.For the first quarter, the company anticipates a 3.5% operating margin and breakeven adjusted earnings per share.

As of the first quarter of 2024, the company had 427 million active accounts.\xa0And its system processed over $400 billion in payments during Q1 alone. That's a big platform that's still getting plenty of use."", ""As of this writing, PayPal stock is down nearly 80% from its all-time high and about 14% over the past year. Based on this stock performance, one might conclude that business is poor. But to the contrary, the company's revenue and total payment volume are currently at all-time highs."", ""However, there is one chart that might explain PayPal's current situation better than any other. As the chart below shows, the company's revenue is up 25% over the past three years, which isn't bad at all. However, its gross profit is flat over this same time frame."", 'Therefore, PayPal has grown its business in recent years, which is exactly what investors want to see. However, profit-wise, this growth has been a complete wash, which is troubling.', ""Here's why PayPal's growth hasn't moved the needle at all in recent years."", ""Before PayPal was a publicly traded company, it acquired a fintech company called Braintree for $800 million. Braintree is the behind-the-scenes pipes that many businesses use to receive digital payments. The service is unbranded, meaning there's no PayPal logo slapped anywhere on the page. Therefore, investors could have used PayPal's Braintree without realizing it."", ""Braintree has gained serious momentum in recent years for PayPal. In Q1, the company's unbranded checkout payment volume (mostly Braintree) was up 26% year over year (adjusting for fluctuations in currency exchange rates). Therefore, Braintree was the biggest driver of PayPal's payment-volume growth."", ""Moreover, PayPal's unbranded payment volume now accounts for 37% of its total payment volume. For perspective, unbranded volume made up just 24% of its total payment volume as recently as 2022. These services are clearly catching on and driving payment-volume growth for PayPal."", ""However, this growth has come at a cost. In Q1, PayPal had a transaction margin of 45%. For perspective, the company had a transaction margin of 58% in the same quarter of 2021. Therefore, the inference is simple: As Braintree has grown in importance, PayPal's margins have suffered."", 'This was acknowledged by PayPal\'s new CEO, Alex Chriss. At the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media & Telecom Conference, Chriss said that Braintree was ""Really priced aggressively in order to gain customers over the last few years.""', ""In other words, PayPal has priced its Braintree services really low to gain market share. This has accomplished its purposes of gaining share and growing volume. But from a profitability standout, it's kept the company from making any progress in recent years."", ""Chriss has been PayPal's CEO for about six months. And he's indicated a change of strategy is in the works. Whereas prior management priced Braintree services low to gain market share, Chriss said he's looking to implement a price-to-value strategy -- this approach aims to charge the maximum price customers are willing to pay."", ""According to management, PayPal's built a great product, and its customers should, consequently, be willing to pay more to use it. If true, the company could be on the verge of reinvigorating profit margins. That could go a long way in reversing the negative trend in the chart below."", ""However, PayPal's investors must take this with a grain of salt before getting too excited. The company has essentially positioned itself in the market as a low-cost leader. Transitioning from this to more premium pricing might not happen without substantial pushback from customers. And in the fintech space, there are plenty of other options for PayPal's customers to choose from."", ""Simply put, PayPal will be navigating a delicate situation in 2024. Chriss has a background in working with small and medium-sized businesses, so he's encouragingly a good leader for the job. But investors might want to give this a few quarters to play out before determining whether the impact will be positive or negative for the business."", 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

I era Look a. I is a fundamental technological shift.We believe it will cost $4 trillion of total value to the industry, not all of that to the tech industry, but to the industry at large.All our clients want to tap into that.It's going to cause productivity.It's going to cause revenue gains.It's going to allow them to have more nibble enterprises.So what we are doing is building the A I.That's good for the enterprise efficient, open source in a way that our clients can control the IP and deploy it where they want.That's really what we are about.You talked a lot about that increase in productivity that's likely to come out of a I.Can you talk specifically in these early stages at least how your clients are deploying?A. I absolutely, I think there's three use cases that really, I think, bring life for us.So if you think of contact centres, you know typically, when people are doing customer experience, can you help that person become way more productive, so they might have to navigate amongst three or four screens?If you ever call the bank, you might notice the person on the other side is hesitating.They ask you, Can you hold on for 30 seconds?Well, that's because they're looking something up.Could a generative A I step in and simply get the information by querying the underlying myriad of systems?Can it make that person way more productive?By the way, productive means they get your query as an end user.Answer quicker.You're happier.You're more likely to get a correct answer.The A. I never gets tired or angry or snappy or anything like that.I think that's a great use case.I think that's going to be endemic.Everybody will use it second, quoting making quotas more productive.Everybody has tech debt.Can it help you get rid of the tech debt faster means that every enterprise is going to have more capabilities to offer their end users and their employees.I think these two without a doubt, the third one.We're seeing a lot.We call it digital Labour.In these days of tight job markets, demographics that point to less and less people of working age.Can I get a digital work to augment the human worker?I think these are three great use cases.All our clients are interested in them.We ourselves use them as the first client and it and it's giving us all of those benefits.Warren Buffett, at his annual meeting, talked about how the a I genie is out of the bottle, and he sounded concerned.I love all those things.Please tell me my big bank balance without getting snippy with me.I get it.Are you concerned that a I will have too much power?And what are the risks from a I I actually have no such fear, so I'm putting it black and white.I think there's a lot of people who hypothesise and as you have seen in many technologies, thinking that the rate of progress, which has been 100 times over the last three or four years is going to be another 100 to 1000 times.But just for the current A I we need this much infrastructure and power for it to be 100 to 1000 times.How much more infrastructure and power.I think it's a little.I use the term fantastical to keep predicting that it carries on on an exponential curve.I think it will get widely deployed.I think millions of people will use it across hundreds of processes.That will happen.But to imagine it's going to reach this point of super intelligence.I'm a bit of a sceptical on that topic.One of the big debates that's happening within the big players in a I is open source versus closed source.I know you're shaking your head because you're leading in Alliance, pushing for open source for those who are not necessarily following close source.We're talking about those like open A I as well as Microsoft Google.What is the risk of a closed source?A. I so I think, on any technology for it to get that escape velocity for it to really become ubiquitous.You got to balance between three things.Competition.You need competition because, as we all know, walled gardens tend to generally have very little innovation.So you need competition innovation.But you do need some safety.As you think about those three.I think open source is a great way to achieve a balance on all three points so open source is visible.Everybody can look at it.You can red team it if you want to.By yourself.You don't have to cross the bender to do all of the red teaming.By the way, as we all know, a I is built on data.So in effect, the IP you're capturing is the data you're bringing open source means that somebody can take a model that we might provide.If they add their own data to it, they can keep it.We don't ask for it back.If it's proprietary, in effect, you get it back.So I think it allows for a much faster proliferation while giving transparency back to those who want to get scrutiny.On that issue of transparency, there is a conversation about a I regulation.The US has executive orders in place, but not necessarily a framework for a federal regulation.You've got Europe leading the way.You just had Japan's leader coming in their own framework.Are you concerned about the US pop falling behind in that conversation?I'm not concerned about the US falling behind.What I'm concerned about is that regulators should not regulate the technology.What regulators should regulate is the risk or the use cases.Can you imagine sitting back in 1995?Let's regulate the Internet.So let's regulate dial up modems.How useful would that have been till today?I may not know how to use the computer, so I think that it's really to the point of Warren Buffett saying the genie is out of the bottle.Don't regulate a technology because all you'll do is it will go offshore.These are digital technologies but regulate the use case, so be assured it's being used responsibly.One that I also talk about is make people who develop models accountable for what those models can do.I think those are tools that are classic policy tools and that can be wonderfully applied.The black box.If you open up the box, let people innovate as fast as they can look at the last 18 months, how much innovation has come.There was open a I.Then there was mis.Now there's IBM.An 8 billion parameter model can do what a 200 billion parameter model can do.Let the innovation go.It will make the technology cheaper and ubiquitous.Marvin, it sounds like just listen to you here.IBM is working on some really cool and stuff on a I.Why do you think that the valuation on IBM may not reflect or be on par with some other A I place.So I'm gonna go cup helpful and then address your question directly.First, I think we've had a pretty good run over the last four years.Um, if I look at the last four years, I think we might have added 60 to 80 billion worth of, uh uh, total enterprise value.So I'd say that's good.Now that does not meet our one aspiration.So let me acknowledge that point.But I think that as we begin to make progress, we've got to be more consistent in our overall revenue and cash flow performance.I think our cash flow performance has been pretty consistent, but we've probably got to be a bit more consistent on revenue performance.And as that happens, I think we'll get both the multiple re rating, but also the growth that comes with the underlying cash flow and earnings growth.So I think those are the two pieces.I'm very confident our strategy is in the right place.We are building.We're staying in the places that we have credibility.We work with the Enterprise hybrid Cloud A I and Quantum down the road.And by the way, I don't think quantum or A I is really fully priced and into where we are.But I'll acknowledge Quantum is still 3 to 5 years out and a I is kind of in the early innings.I use a baseball analogy.A. I is kind of in the first innings of a game.Don't quite know how it will go is more like the fifth or sixth inning.So you have a pretty good idea.Not over yet, but a pretty good idea.We like sports analogies here, right?Let's finally talk about sort of bigger picture.You've got a good pulse on where the economy is given just the scale of your client base on your recent earnings call you talked about sort of a pull back and discretionary spending.How is that a pause?Is that a dry up?How would you characterise where that is?What does that tell you about the investments companies are willing to make, particularly in technology?So I'm not an economist.I'm a businessman and an engineer.Let me acknowledge that.But I see are spending and not spending.So I think that what is happening is really down to one reason, and I'm actually quite optimistic about both the US and the global economy, and I'll come back to that.Our interest rates are higher for longer than most people supposed in the middle of last year.So as you take that into account, if interest rates are 2 3% higher for the five and 10 year, then people are thought that means that all of the debt is going to carry an extra price.So I think CFOs are belt tightening against that now.That's not systemic.That's not really secular, but it is a trend that's going to be there for a year or two.If that makes any sense.I think that's the belt tightening.Look at anybody who carries tens of billions of debt.An extra 2 to 3 points is going to cost you an extra few 100 million per year.OK, let's look after what the Treasury spent.Let's not do anything catastrophic.Let's not make long term decisions.Would you go belt tighten against distress projects that's going on now?If I then look at demographic trends, I look at inflation trends, supply chains, cyber.All of that leads to Well, let's spend more on technology.So that's where you kind of see I want more software.I want more infrastructure.I want more a I. I want more cloud.But if I can, I'll kind of tighten on Labour based services.I think that's the two speeds we see and we see that in The software grew below 6% in the first quarter and consulting goes down two at C currency flat at acts.So we see that in our own business and I think it's a reflection of this macroeconomic frame.I wish we had some more time with you, but we don't.You're a busy guy.You're very in demand at this conference.IB MC, O Arvin Krisher Thank you for making time for your finance.We really appreciate it.Pleasure to be here with you guys.""]"

The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Thus, you can purchase International Business Machines' shares before the 9th of May in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 10th of June."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.67 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$6.64 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, International Business Machines stock has a trailing yield of around 4.0% on the current share price of US$165.71. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. As a result, readers should always check whether International Business Machines has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut."", ' View our latest analysis for International Business Machines ', 'Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. International Business Machines paid out more than half (74%) of its earnings last year, which is a regular payout ratio for most companies. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 48% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.', ""It's positive to see that International Business Machines's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Companies that aren't growing their earnings can still be valuable, but it is even more important to assess the sustainability of the dividend if it looks like the company will struggle to grow. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. That explains why we're not overly excited about International Business Machines's flat earnings over the past five years. It's better than seeing them drop, certainly, but over the long term, all of the best dividend stocks are able to meaningfully grow their earnings per share."", ""Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. International Business Machines has delivered an average of 5.7% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments."", ""Is International Business Machines worth buying for its dividend? The payout ratios appear reasonably conservative, which implies the dividend may be somewhat sustainable. Still, with earnings basically flat, International Business Machines doesn't stand out from a dividend perspective. Overall, it's not a bad combination, but we feel that there are likely more attractive dividend prospects out there."", ""If you want to look further into International Business Machines, it's worth knowing the risks this business faces.

We have also discussed the state of jobs in the US. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 States with the Highest and Lowest Resignation Rates.', 'The state of US jobs in recent times has been nothing less than a paradox as the headline job numbers seem to be strong but Americans are struggling to secure jobs. Despite the addition of 275,000 jobs in February 2024 alone, the labor market has become increasingly competitive, with companies exercising caution in hiring given the economic uncertainty.', 'The hiring slowdown can be attributed to various factors, including companies being wary of high interest rates and wages, leading to a more selective hiring process. As a result, the job market has become more challenging for both recent graduates and seasoned professionals alike. Speaking of hiring, see industries hiring rightnow in 2024.', 'It is also true that the current job market is plagued by a mismatch between job openings and the skills and qualifications of job seekers. Despite there being 8.9 million job openings in January, down from a peak of 12 million in March 2022, many positions remain unfilled, while workers struggle to secure employment that matches their qualifications.', ""It is also worth noting that in Monster's “New Year, New Career” 2024 report, 95% of surveyed US workers expressed intent to seek new job opportunities. Despite the widespread desire for change, Monster's findings reveal a cautious sentiment among workers as 68% individuals believe that it will be challenging to secure new employment due to economic conditions."", ""Moreover, employers are faced with mounting pressure to address employee concerns, as indicated by Deloitte's Q4 2023 CFO Survey, which highlights the growing importance of competitive compensation and transparent communication to retain talent. With 45% of workers citing the need for higher income and 64% anticipating salary adjustments to counter inflation, businesses are urged to adapt their strategies to navigate evolving workforce dynamics effectively."", 'It must be noted that in 2024, leisure and hospitality is the industry with the highest resignation rate in the US. On the other hand, information is one of the industries with the lowest turnover rates.', ""Apart from the resignation rates, there are also concerns about layoffs. For example, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)’s recent decision to reduce its workforce in marketing and communications has sparked concern, with reports indicating a major impact on staffing levels. In a brief meeting led by International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)’s Chief Communications Officer Jonathan Adashek, employees were informed of the impending job cuts, adding to the uncertainty surrounding the company's future direction."", 'Throughout the tech industry, job cuts have become increasingly common, with over 200 companies announcing layoffs, affecting nearly 50,000 positions so far this year. International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)’s restructuring efforts align with its strategy to adapt to evolving market demands, particularly in the domain of artificial intelligence. Despite recent growth, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) continues to face challenges in monetizing its AI offerings, facing stiff competition from industry giants like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).', ""On the other hand, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) has adopted a strategy of prudent hiring. In 2023, the company reduced its headcount by 22%, down to 67,317, as part of cost-cutting measures amid challenges in the digital ad market. Despite this reduction, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)’s performance has been impressive, with fourth-quarter sales growing by 25% to $40.1 billion, and net income increased by 201% to $14 billion. The company's operating margin more than doubled to 41%, showcasing its ability to grow while cutting costs."", 'Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) plans to maintain this lean approach to hiring, focusing on high-paying technical roles rather than hyper growth. The company intends to prioritize investments in infrastructure, particularly in artificial intelligence, with total expenses expected to range between $94 billion to $99 billion.

The state's economy heavily relies on agriculture, tourism, and natural resource extraction, which may not offer as many job opportunities as more diversified economies."", 'Resignation Rate: 3.28%', 'Louisiana is facing on of the highest resignation rates primarily due to the staggering economic impact of insufficient childcare. The annual loss of $1.1 billion in productivity, coupled with a $84 million shortfall in tax revenue, sheds light on the severity of the issue. Women and single parents are disproportionately affected and represent 14.6% and 11.1% respectively of those forced to quit jobs due to childcare problems. Additionally, with 50% of households relying on family members for childcare, the burden falls heavily on informal support networks.', 'Resignation Rate: 3.28%', ""West Virginia faces challenges in its labor market due to factors like limited job opportunities, low wages, and inadequate workers' rights protections.

Despite a 23% improvement in the per-capita fatality rate in 2021, Wyoming still ranked worst in the nation. The state's workplace safety track record remains dismal, with incidents ranging from falls and machinery accidents to fatal road incidents and even ice-related tragedies. Worker advocates highlight the urgent need for action, pointing to policies lacking in protection for employees and an attitude that dismisses safety concerns."", 'Resignation Rate: 3.20%', ""The proximity of Delaware to major metropolitan areas like Philadelphia and New York City provides residents with abundant job opportunities, making it easier for them to find new employment, if dissatisfied. Additionally, Delaware's economy is heavily influenced by industries like finance, healthcare, and technology, which often experience higher turnover rates due to competitive job markets and evolving job roles."", 'Resignation Rate: 3.15%', ""Mississippi's high resignation rate stems from multifaceted challenges. Despite offering the nation's lowest cost of living, worker migration remains low due to a workforce lacking in education and productivity. With only 3% employed in STEM fields and 23% holding bachelor's degrees, the state struggles to meet the demands of modern industries. Additionally, its unfriendly business environment, coupled with discriminatory laws, further deter skilled professionals."", 'Resignation Rate: 3.10%', ""The state has chosen not to adopt more generous labor policies compared to the national standards, such as keeping the minimum wage at the federal level and prohibiting local governments from setting higher minimum wages. Additionally, the absence of mandated paid sick and parental leave further exacerbates workers' challenges. The presence of right-to-work laws weakens unions, impacting workers' collective bargaining power. Historical racial dynamics also play a role, with states like North Carolina implementing less generous labor policies."", 'It is also one of the States With the Worst Unemployment Benefits in 2024.', 'Resignation Rate: 3.00%', ""Idaho ranks poorly for work due to several factors. Firstly, it scores 41st in the country for wage policies, mainly because of its low minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, which hasn't changed since 2009. Additionally, Idaho's tipped wage is also low at $3.35 per hour. Secondly, its worker protections rank 27th, lacking mandates for equal pay, paid sick leave, and protections against pay secrecy and shift scheduling changes."", 'Resignation Rate: 3.00%', 'The state of Tennessee is experiencing a shift in its employment landscape as the turnover increase abates. Job openings have declined, particularly in industries like technology and banking, prompting a stabilization in hiring practices. While layoffs are occurring among major corporations, small businesses continue to modestly expand their workforce.', 'Resignation Rate: 2.88%', ""In Kentucky, there's a pressing need for police officers, with hundreds of positions remaining unfilled across the state. Covington Capt. Jonathan Colwell highlights the challenges, citing diminishing incentives such as less appealing retirement packages. Ft. Wright Mayor Dave Hatter echoes this sentiment, attributing recruitment difficulties to changes in the pension system over the years."", 'Resignation Rate: 2.85%', 'Following an increase tied to the pandemic, Arizona\'s resignations are returning to normal.

November saw Arizona\'s resignation rate drop to 2.7 from 3.0 a year prior.', 'Resignation Rate: 2.53%', ""New Mexico's resignations show a moderate rate owing to its economic stability, job opportunities, and workplace satisfaction.

These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company\'s definitions of these non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others. The non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release adjust for specified items that can be highly variable or difficult to predict. The Company generally uses these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate management\'s financial and operational decision-making, including evaluation of the Company\'s historical operating results, comparison to competitors\' operating results and determination of management incentive compensation. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company\'s operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company\'s business. Because non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of items that will increase or decrease the Company\'s reported results of operations, management strongly encourages investors to review the Company\'s consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety.

According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.', 'Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.', ""This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements."", ""Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future.

The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', 'Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations.

Investors have grown more worried as the intermediate-term outlook for stocks has become cloudier.', 'Geopolitical tensions are mounting in the Middle East. This has the possibility of causing a surge in oil and other commodity prices. Domestically, inflation readings continue to come in hotter than expected. This has caused economists to reconsider whether the Federal Reserve can go ahead with planned rate cuts later in 2024.', 'Traders had been betting on a so-called economic soft landing. But that scenario is coming under increasing scrutiny, and investors are taking some chips off the table. Furthermore, it’s currently earnings season.

Up until 2022, it’s worth noting, DG stock had been a tremendous long-term performer, and I believe the company can return to form despite its recent challenges.', 'In addition, one of the company’s major competitors, 99 Cents Only Stores, recently went bust and will be liquidating. This will decrease competition within the discount store space and create a greater opportunity and more market share for Dollar General heading into the next recession.', 'Source: Arne Beruldsen / Shutterstock.com', 'McCormick (NYSE:MKC) is far and away the largest spices and seasonings company in the United States.', 'The company is traditionally known for its McCormick-branded spice bottles, selling goods like black pepper, oregano, cinnamon and vanilla extract.', 'In recent years, McCormick has branched out. It has made a big push into sauces and condiments with the acquisition of brands like French’s and Frank’s Red Hot. McCormick then doubled down on the fast-growing hot sauce market with its Cholula acquisition. Less well-known, McCormick is also a large supplier of store brand spices meaning that McCormick earns money on a large chunk of U.S. spices sales regardless of the particular product labeling.', 'McCormick is a great economic recession pick because spices are a low-cost item that people eat almost every day. People will keep consuming them, regardless of the macroeconomic climate. In fact, in an event where people cook more at home to save money, spice usage could conceivably go up and provide a countercyclical growth opportunity for McCormick during a recession.', 'In addition, younger shoppers have shown interest in unique recipes, flavors and cuisines. So, there should be a longer-term growth tailwind for the company regardless of economic conditions.', 'Stocks such as McCormick tend to outperform during recessions because investors gravitate to companies with steady revenues and profitability. McCormick should fit that description perfectly during the next recession.', 'Source: JL Images / Shutterstock', 'Diageo (NYSE:DEO) is one of the world’s largest spirits companies. It has the number one or number two brand across many spirits categories. Its wide-ranging portfolio includes rum, vodka, tequila, whiskey, and Guinness beer among other items.', 'The case for Diageo is similar to McCormick. People’s alcohol consumption tends to be fairly steady regardless of economic conditions. Historically, the alcohol industry has shown minimal correlation to economic activity; people tend to drink whether they are partying or commiserating.', 'However, the industry did go through a slump due to pandemic, as COVID-19 caused many restaurants, bars, and other on-premise locations to shut down. This was particularly prevalent in Europe, where Diageo is headquartered. The Latin American market also slowed down in 2023, further hitting results.', 'Thus, profitability going forward should improve as the spirits industry continues its recovery from the recent industry upheaval; Diageo is also seeing improvements in supply chain and labor conditions as things normalize.', 'Thus, DEO stock could represent a rare example of a company that should see its profitability increase going forward, even as the economy quite possibly falls into recession.', 'Adding to that, Diageo shares are near their lowest valuation of the past decade, making this a great time to stock up on this recession-proof consumer stock.

Canadian department stores, adding outerwear and shoes to the brand’s 1,400 items, most of which are under $15. Since the partnership launched in March, the brand has been incredibly popular in Canada, Target reported, resulting in a 15% increase in basket size at Hudson’s Bay.', 'Target has no plans to replicate its own-brand expansion in the U.S., but its Cat & Jack expansion is the latest of the company’s tactics to win over consumers in times of slashed discretionary spending. In February, the company launched a new “dealworthy” budget brand of under-$10 home goods. That’s after 2023 saw a 1.7% drop in sales to $105.8 billion.', 'Target has failed to make the same inroads as rival Walmart, where sales are steadily growing, though their strategies have converged. Last week, Walmart launched a store-brand grocery line, and in March, Target launched its paid reward program Target Circle 360, parroting Amazon Prime and Walmart+.', 'It should be no surprise that retailers are growing their private-label brands. About 60% of shoppers say they buy private labels at least somewhat frequently, per a September 2023 CivicScience report. And according to market research firm Circana, sales of own brands grew 6% in 2023 to $217 billion. But while retailers are taking cues from each other and consumers to line their shelves with own-brand items, Target is taking a more unconventional route, experts say.', 'Braden Douglas, founder and CEO of marketing agency Crew Marketing Partners, told Fortune that Target’s play to expand its private brands beyond its own stores isn’t a popular gambit.', ""“It's not very common because most other retailers don't want to help another competitor increase revenue,” he said."", 'The tough economic climate means that big-box retailers are more likely to take strategic risks to attract consumers. For Target, the move makes sense, Douglas argued: Target has a solid supply chain that allows it to be nimble and expand, but is limited by its own geography that’s almost exclusively in the U.S. Target made its debut in Canada in 2013, purchasing the leases of over 200 Zellers, a failed retail chain, from Hudson’s Bay. Because of Target’s rapid expansion, the venture wasn’t expected to be profitable until 2021, and the company pulled the plug on all of its Canadian chains less than two years later. Expanding offerings for Hudson’s Bay could offer Target a do-over of its rocky experiment up north.', ""“There's still great demand from that,” Douglas said. “I like that they’re [going to] dip their toe back into the water.”"", 'While Target’s private-label strategy is uncommon, that doesn’t mean it’s unheard of, argued Katrijn Gielens, professor of marketing at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s Kenan-Flagler School of Business. Even Target carries products from competitors’ private-label brands, including No7, the skincare line from pharmacy chain Boots. Gielens has seen similar moves from national grocery chains successfully putting health-conscious private-label brands in smaller, regional stores.', 'Gielens agreed with Douglas that competitors will not frequently put their own-brand products in each others’ stores. But she added that expanding private brands to new geographies or to appeal to specific demographics is a cheap way to build exposure, because buying and distributing private brands on a larger scale often has cost-saving advantages.', ""“You need a certain reputation; you need to have certain expertise and knowledge,” she said. “It's not easy to pull off.”"", 'The practice of expanding private-label brands beyond their originating retailer grew more common from 2008 to 2012, and the trend tends to emerge in times of economic unease, Gielens said. Not only do private brands offer an effective sales strategy during times of recession, but interest in those brands is usually sustained in the years that follow. From 2008 to 2022, private brands across retailers made an estimated $35 billion, Forbes reported, using data from Nielsen and Information Resources, Inc.', ""As inflation remains stubborn and consumer confidence still lower than it was pre-pandemic, Gielens expects to see companies making moves similar to Target's, even riskier ones, to take advantage of private-brand favorability."", ""“This is when people are more open to explore and to also consider things that come with a slightly lower price point,” she said. “It's the right window of opportunity.”"", 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

Region-wise, digital sales were up 4% in North America, 12% in Europe and 25% in Asia.In accordance with the “Next Great Chapter” plan, it completed the transition of Chaps to a licensed business, thus concluding its portfolio realignment. This enables it to focus on core brands, as part of the “Next Great Chapter” elevation strategy. In addition, the company’s strategy of product elevation, personalized and targeted promotion, disciplined inventory management and favorable channel and geographic mix, bode well.For fiscal 2024, management projects constant-currency revenues to rise in the low single digits. The company expects the gross margin increase in the band of 140-180 basis points (bps) in constant currency, gaining from favorable freight costs, a favorable channel and geographic mix, thus more than offsetting continued product cost inflation.

(NASDAQ:ADI) can tell us which group is most powerful. With 89% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).', 'Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.', ""Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Analog Devices, beginning with the chart below."", ' See our latest analysis for Analog Devices ', 'Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.', ""Analog Devices already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Analog Devices' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story."", 'Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Analog Devices is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.2% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.8% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.2% of the company stock.', 'Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 24 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.', ""While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future."", 'While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.', 'Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.', 'Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Analog Devices, Inc. in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$369m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. ', ""The general public-- including retail investors -- own 11% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders."", 'While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.', 'I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can access this interactive graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow, for free.', 'But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do.

GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with SBAC.', ""On May 6, 2024, SBA Communications Corp (NASDAQ:SBAC) filed its 10-Q report, providing a detailed account of its financial performance for the first quarter of the year. As a leading owner and operator of wireless communications infrastructure, SBAC's financial tables reveal a company with a solid foundation in tower assets across diverse geographical locations. With a significant portion of its revenue stemming from the United States, the company's financial health is reflected in its long-lived domestic assets valued at $5.4 billion. Internationally, SBAC's assets in Brazil, its largest market outside the U.S., are valued at $2.0 billion. The company's strategic focus on site leasing, characterized by long-term contracts and high operating margins, continues to drive its financial stability and growth prospects."", ""Extensive Infrastructure Network: SBA Communications Corp's vast array of nearly 40,000 cell towers is a formidable asset. The company's strategic placement of towers, particularly in the U.S. and Brazil, ensures a strong foothold in key markets. This extensive network not only facilitates significant leasing revenue but also positions SBAC as an indispensable partner for wireless service providers looking to expand and upgrade their coverage, especially in the era of 5G technology."", ""High-Quality Site Leasing Contracts: The company's site leasing business is its crown jewel, boasting long-term contracts with built-in rent escalators. These contracts provide a predictable revenue stream with high operating margins and low churn rates. SBAC's ability to add tenants to existing towers at minimal incremental costs further enhances its profitability and underpins a stable financial outlook."", ""Customer Concentration Risk: SBAC's revenue is highly concentrated, with the majority generated by a few top mobile carriers in each market. This concentration poses a risk, as the loss of a major customer or industry consolidation could significantly impact revenue streams. The company must navigate this concentration carefully to maintain its competitive edge and financial health."", ""Exposure to Industry Consolidation: The wireless industry is prone to consolidation, which could lead to non-renewed or canceled leases. While SBAC has historically experienced low tenant lease terminations, the potential for consolidation remains a looming threat that could disrupt the company's revenue and growth trajectory."", ""5G Deployment and Spectrum Utilization: The ongoing rollout of 5G technology presents a significant opportunity for SBAC. As wireless carriers deploy unused spectrum and expand their networks, the demand for SBAC's towers is expected to rise. This technological advancement could lead to increased leasing activity and higher revenues for the company."", ""International Expansion: SBAC's international presence, particularly in emerging markets like Brazil, offers room for growth. As these markets develop their wireless infrastructure, SBAC can capitalize on the increasing demand for tower space, driving its international revenue and diversifying its income sources."", ""Rising Interest Rates: The current economic climate, marked by increasing interest rates to combat inflation, poses a threat to SBAC's growth. Higher interest rates could affect the capital expenditure capabilities of wireless service providers, potentially slowing down network expansion and, consequently, the demand for tower leases."", 'Foreign Exchange Risks: With operations across North America, South America, and Africa, SBAC faces foreign exchange risks. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates can impact operating expenses and profitability, particularly in countries where revenues and expenses are denominated in local currency.', ""In conclusion, SBA Communications Corp (NASDAQ:SBAC) exhibits a strong foundation with its extensive infrastructure network and high-quality site leasing contracts. However, the company must remain vigilant in managing its customer concentration risk and industry consolidation exposure. Opportunities for growth are abundant with the 5G rollout and potential international expansion, but these are tempered by threats from rising interest rates and foreign exchange risks. Overall, SBAC's strategic positioning in the wireless infrastructure market, coupled with its financial prudence, suggests a resilient outlook with the capacity to navigate through industry challenges and capitalize on emerging opportunities."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

As reported by CNBC on April 30, home prices in February increased 6.4% year over year. With all-time high prices in major cities including San Diego, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and New York, affordability concerns continue to arise. Regarding housing affordability, we have also discussed the least affordable metros for homebuyers in the US.', 'Monthly price appreciation has been reported in expensive West Coast metros where the inventory remains restricted and has not yet recovered since the pandemic. The highest monthly home value growth from February to March was recorded at 3.3% for San Jose, 2.7% for San Francisco, 2.4% for Seattle, 2.1% for San Diego, and 2% for Los Angeles. These are the five US metros where homeowners are most subject to a mortgage rate lock-in effect, which is when existing homeowners feel reluctant to sell their homes since they will have to purchase at higher rates. Buyers tend to compete for fewer choices in such markets with limited supply. On the other hand, existing inventory has improved in the Southern metros thereby easing the rapid price appreciation. New construction has also added to the choices in these housing markets. Some of the affordable, promising cities to buy real estate in 2024 have been previously covered.', 'As of March, total inventory has increased by 12.2% year over year. However, the inventory levels are still 36.4% lower as compared to the pre-pandemic period. New listings have also gone up by 3.7% since 2023, still falling behind the pre-pandemic levels by 25.4%.

Transaction volumes and activity have ticked up in recent weeks and pricing has certainly improved. As always, we are actively looking at acquisition opportunities across all of our markets, but our focus remains on the development of our land bank, which provides an opportunity for over $38 billion of build out with a return on incremental capital of approximately 8.5%.

AFRM as the company prepares to announce its third-quarter fiscal 2024 results on May 8, prior to the market opening. Some investors are deliberating whether to purchase shares of this prominent payment network before its earnings report or await a potentially more advantageous entry point.', 'As a prominent player in the buy now, pay later (BNPL) sector, AFRM holds a distinctive advantage to benefit from the thriving industry. According to a report by Adobe Analytics, BNPL services drove online spending in November 2023, highlighting their significance in sustaining consumer spending resilience. AFRM is poised to capitalize on this momentum in the foreseeable future.', 'Additionally, strategic partnerships with well-established companies such as Evolve, Walmart, and Liberty Travel are anticipated to enhance its market presence further. The company’s improving free cash flow situation, now characterized by sustainable generation of free cash flow, is a major positive. At this rate, it can achieve full-year profitability on an adjusted operating income basis in the near future.', ""Affirm's consistent and disciplined performance in recent quarters has emerged as a catalyst for its network growth. The company continues to benefit from a high-interest environment, which has significantly contributed to its positive top-line performance. Rising active merchant numbers and Gross Merchandise Volume will continue to support its growth trajectory."", 'The growth potential in the BNPL space is bringing more players into the market, boosting competition. For example, Walmart Inc.’s WMT majority-owned fintech startup, One, had reportedly started offering BNPL services for big purchases from last month. The move from the multinational retail giant was big enough to have a negative effect on AFRM shares.', ""During the year-to-date period, AFRM stock experienced a decline of 26.3%, outpacing the industry's 16.4% decrease, while the S&P 500 Index recorded growth of 7.8%. Factors such as limited consumer loan demand in the secondary market and elevated funding costs attributed to high interest rates have the potential to impact AFRM's growth trajectory. Additionally, the company's forward 12-month price-to-sales ratio, currently standing at 4.19X, remains significantly higher than the industry average of 1.30X.

Freelancers equipped with these skills are observing higher earnings and engaging in more complex projects. Moreover according to a report by Lightcast, the demand for generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) skills has skyrocketed by 1,848% since 2022.

Despite the prestige and hype associated with tech jobs, there has also been increasing fear due to persistent tech lay offs. Let’s look at what exactly went wrong and if a career in tech is an insecure option to consider.', 'In the past few months, the economy has seen excellent growth alongside noteworthy layoffs in the US and around the globe. Since recent job reductions have primarily occurred in select sectors like technology, finance, and media, it has raised eyebrows about the rising insecurity within tech jobs. It is also worth highlighting that the overall job creation has increased in the US, averaging 248,000 new positions monthly over the last six months. With the unemployment rate standing at just 3.7%, these layoffs are overshadowed by strong hiring as well.', ""While layoffs can disrupt individuals' lives, they don't necessarily reflect economic weakness. Companies may trim their workforce for various reasons, such as adjusting to shifts in their business strategy or optimizing profit margins. For instance, many tech firms hired aggressively during the pandemic but misjudged future demand, prompting them to scale back. Despite these layoffs, overall economic indicators suggest a healthy job market, supported by consistent hiring across different industries."", ""Visa Inc (NYSE:V) has currently 345 jobs postings available on its website for technology careers.

This approach also mirrors a trend observed in other tech giants like Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL), which have started avoiding hiring in high-salary cities such as New York and San Francisco.

This strategic focus on innovation is likely to have bolstered customer engagement and loyalty.The escalating demand for New York customer tools reflects a global trend of tightening regulations and increasing sanctions by governments worldwide. This trend is likely to have continued in the quarter to be reported, further fueling the company's expansion efforts.The integration of OPIS and CMA has garnered significant traction across various industries, including metal, sustainability, carbon plastics, renewables and biofuels. This integration is expected to have driven higher yields and maintained steady retention rates, underscoring the company's commitment to delivering value across diverse sectors.However, challenges persist in the Book Publishing segment, where lower sales due to decreased consumer demand and underperformance in frontlist titles have hurt revenues. Despite these headwinds, a resurgence in physical book sales and improved returns are expected to have positively impacted top-line growth. Notably, in the fiscal second quarter, the segment recorded revenues of $550 million, marking a 4% year-over-year increase.In navigating the dynamic digital real estate landscape, NWSA remains focused on optimizing its Digital Real Estate segment.

The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$297 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$262. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Snap-on's current trading price of US$275 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Snap-on’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change."", ' View our latest analysis for Snap-on ', 'Good news, investors! Snap-on is still a bargain right now. According to our valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $344.87, but it is currently trading at US$275 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. What’s more interesting is that, Snap-on’s share price is theoretically quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to move to its intrinsic value, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.', ""Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Though in the case of Snap-on, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting earnings growth of 5.1%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term."", 'Are you a shareholder? Even though growth is relatively muted, since SNA is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on SNA for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy SNA. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.', ""In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Snap-on you should know about."", 'If you are no longer interested in Snap-on, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.', 'Have feedback on this article?

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Fastest Growing Cities in New York State.', 'As reported by the US Census Bureau, 42 US states and the District of Columbia experienced a rise in their populations in 2023 as compared to 31 states and the District of Columbia in 2022. While net international migration going back to pre-pandemic levels contributed to this trend, a decrease in net domestic outmigration for some states was another contributing factor. Based on numeric population growth, Texas, Florida, and North Carolina ranked as the top states. These numeric growths were recorded at 473,453 for Texas, 365,205 for Florida, and 139,526 for North Carolina in 2023.', 'An analysis of the metropolitan and the micropolitan statistical areas in the country indicated that population growth was witnessed in 73% of the 387 metro areas between 2022 and 2023. During the same period, the population increased in 58% of the U.S. micro areas. In terms of annual numeric growth, Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington and Houston-Pasadena-The Woodlands ranked at the top with their respective growths of 152,598 and 139,789. Some of the most prominent percentage gains in population were recorded in Florida metros, in Wildwood-The Villages by 4.7%, in Lakeland-Winter Haven by 3.8%, in Ocala by 3.4%, and in Port St. Lucie by 3.1%. Myrtle Beach-Conway-North Myrtle Beach also recorded a growth of 3.7% and ranked third among the fastest-growing US metro areas.', 'As reported by the NYC Department of City Planning, the population of New York City was estimated to be 8.26 million in July 2023. This represents a decrease of 546,000 since the April 1, 2020 Census and a decline of 78,000 since July 1, 2022. Therefore, population losses have been recorded in the state from 2020 to 2023.', 'On March 14, The New York Times reported that the aforementioned NYC population losses of 78,000 residents in 2023 and more than 126,000 residents in 2022 do not take into account the migrants and those living in shelters and dorms. Since the spring of 2022, the city welcomed 180,000 migrants. It has been projected that population growth in the city will resume in the years to come and has stabilized since the pandemic.', 'Net domestic migration tends to significantly impact population change. Net domestic migration in NYC has been negative which implies that more people tend to leave the city than move into the city. Large net domestic outflows following 2020 have also led to population losses in NYC. On November 21, 2023, The US Census Bureau reported that people who moved between the states increased from almost 7.9 million people in 2021 to nearly 8.2 million people in 2022. Movers left highly populated states for their neighboring states for example people moving from New York to New Jersey. New York and California were the two top states that had the highest share of people who moved out of them out of the total number of movers. Many New Yorkers migrated to cheaper states such as New Jersey where they could easily commute to work. Some of them resorted to a warmer state such as Florida.', 'Demographic data demonstrates that those struggling have been leaving the most. In 2023, 4 out of the 5 boroughs saw a decline in their populations. Affordability and housing issues tend to force lower- and middle-income residents to move out. This is evident from the fact that families earning between $32,000 and $65,000 left the city at the fastest rate in 2022. You can also take a look at the 16 best places to live in Upstate New York for families. The poorest borough, The Bronx, lost more than 25,000 residents while Brooklyn saw a loss of more than 28,000 residents. More than 26,000 left Queens as well. Commuter areas around New York City also recorded a loss in residents. On the other hand, the population grew in Manhattan, the richest borough, by nearly 3,000 residents in 2023.', 'A recent survey from The Citizens Budget Commission reveals that New Yorkers have rated the quality of life and quality of city services as low. Only 30% of New Yorkers rate the quality of life as excellent or good while one-third rate the quality of life as poor. The residents have also rated the city’s neighborhoods better. Simultaneously, just 24% rated the quality of government services as good or excellent as compared to 44% in 2017. Wealthier households with incomes over $200,000 were also found to be more satisfied with the quality of life in their neighborhoods.', 'Despite the population dynamics showing underprivileged people moving out of New York, the state has long been regarded as a dominant business and economic hub. The state is home to leading multinationals including PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ).', 'The multinational PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP) is headquartered in Harrison, New York. The company’s products are consumed more than one billion times daily in more than 200 countries and territories. PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP) was capable of generating more than $91 billion in net revenue in 2023. Simultaneously, PepsiCo Beverages North America (PBNA) made more than $27 billion in net revenue during the year. It offers more than 300 beverage choices and renowned brands such as Pepsi, Gatorade, bubbly, and Mountain Dew.', 'JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) is an American multinational finance company. The company operates as one of the largest employers in New York. While the firm contributes $29.8 billion annually to New York City’s economy, it plans to further commit to the city. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) reported the construction of its new state-of-the-art global headquarters in Midtown Manhattan. During the project building, more than 8,000 construction jobs will be created thereby driving additional economic activity of $3.6 billion for New York State.

The US economy experienced growth at an annualized rate of 4% in the second half of the year, leading experts to maintain a positive outlook on the country’s economic prospects. In fact, data from the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) indicates that recessions have become increasingly less frequent in the US. From 1990 to 2023, the US economy endured 36 months of recession, with the most recent recession occurring in 2020 and lasting for only two months. Their analysis further suggested that recessions were more common as we go further back in time.', 'While the likelihood of a recession is uncertain at the moment, investors have consistently maintained their focus on dividend stocks whenever concerns about a recession arise. In addition to dividends, analysts also recommend investing in industries that are known for their resilience and stability to ensure prudent investment choices. For example, industries such as healthcare, utilities, consumer staples, and telecommunications are considered less vulnerable to economic shifts, making them reliable for navigating through a recession. According to a report by Business Insider, the consumer staples sector outperformed the market by 49% over a 25-year period ending in 2015. The report further mentioned that a significant portion of this outperformance was observed during recessionary periods.', 'Investors favor these industries because they not only offer dividends to shareholders but have also raised their payouts over the years. According to data collected from Janus Henderson, global healthcare dividends grew from $94.5 billion in 2017 to nearly $135 billion in 2023. Similarly, dividends from the energy sector also jumped from $104.6 billion in 2017 to $173.7 billion last year. Dividend stocks have shown strong performance during recessionary periods.', 'Following the major recession of 2008, investors became more mindful of their investment strategies and recognized that dividend stocks are a reliable approach for sailing through economic downturns. Nova Southeastern University conducted research and found that during both the recovery and recessionary phases of 2001 and 2008 recessions, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of some of the best dividend stocks that have grown their payouts for at least 25 years, showed significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500. In particular, during the recovery phase of the 2008 recession, the index outpaced the broader market by 0.01% daily or an annualized rate of 4.59%. Moreover, during the recessionary phase of 2008, the dividend aristocrats outperformed the S&P 500 by 0.06% daily or an annualized rate of 23.7%.', 'Some of the best dividend stocks to consider for a recession include The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

But Amazon is now knocking on the door of that exclusive club. In fact, it gained admission in April for a brief period before its stock price pulled back.', 'Amazon was founded in 1994 as an e-commerce company, but it has since evolved to build a gargantuan presence in other tech segments including cloud computing, streaming, digital advertising, and now artificial intelligence (AI).', ""Amazon just released its financial results for the first quarter of 2024 (ended March 31), and they were strong across the board. However, AI might be the technology that lifts this company's valuation to $2 trillion (and beyond) on a sustained basis."", ""E-commerce is Amazon's largest source of revenue, and the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform is responsible for the overwhelming majority of the company's operating income (profit). Therefore, Amazon needs both segments firing on all cylinders, and it's currently using AI to drive their success."", ""In his Q1 conference call with investors, CEO Andy Jassy said that more than 100,000 sellers have used at least one of Amazon's generative AI tools to improve product listings and reach more customers. One of its newest tools allows sellers to automatically create detailed and engaging product pages by simply feeding Amazon's AI engine a link to their website. Other AI tools help sellers craft content for their advertisements to increase clicks and improve conversions."", ""On the cloud side, Amazon continued to make progress on its mission to dominate the three core layers of AI. Infrastructure is the bottom layer, and Jassy said demand remained high for AWS's new Trainium 2 chips, which were designed in-house, because of their favorable price and performance relative to competing hardware. They complement AWS's broad selection of data center instances powered by Nvidia's industry-leading graphics chips (GPUs)."", ""The middle layer is home to Amazon Bedrock, which is a service for businesses that don't want to build and train their own AI large language models (LLMs). In Bedrock, they can access a portfolio of ready-made LLMs to accelerate the development of customer-facing AI applications. Those LLMs include some of the industry's most powerful, like Anthropic's Claude 3 and Meta Platforms' Llama 3."", ""Finally, complete AI applications sit at the top layer. AWS developed a powerful AI virtual assistant called Q, which became widely available to customers in the first quarter. It's fully customizable and can be trained to enhance productivity within almost any business using internal data. It's capable of writing, testing, and debugging computer code, which Amazon says can save months of manual work. Plus, it can rapidly analyze mountains of data to spot trends and potential opportunities across an organization."", 'Last year, Amazon split its U.S. fulfillment network into eight separate regions. This allows fulfillment centers to hold increased levels of inventory for products that are popular in their own geographic area, and it also means those goods travel shorter distances to reach customers. The end result is faster delivery times; in March, Amazon said 60% of orders from its Prime members arrived on the same day or the next day across 60 of the largest U.S. metro areas.', ""Amazon's theory is that speeding up delivery times will give customers the confidence to buy from its website more frequently, and Jassy points to the growing everyday essentials segment as evidence the strategy is working. Plus, growth in Amazon's online sales revenue overall appears to be accelerating. It increased by 7% to $54.7 billion during Q1, which was much faster than the 3% growth rate it delivered in the year-ago period."", ""AWS cloud revenue came in at $25 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 17%, which was also an acceleration, both sequentially and compared to the year-ago period. AWS is currently the world's top cloud provider by revenue, and investors have longed for faster growth after a sluggish 2023 when businesses trimmed their spending due to high interest rates. That period of cost optimization appears to be over, according to Jassy, and he says momentum is picking up -- thanks especially to AI demand."", ""Finally, Amazon's digital advertising revenue jumped 24% to $11.8 billion, making it the fastest-growing segment in the entire organization. Amazon.com receives 2.2 billion visits every month, making it the ideal place for merchants to advertise their products. Amazon also introduced ads to the Prime Video streaming service this year, and while it's still early days, this could be a lucrative opportunity as more of the $147.9 billion television ad market shifts to streaming."", ""Across all segments, Amazon's total revenue came in at $143.3 billion during Q1, which was a 13% year-over-year jump. The bigger story was on the bottom line; the company's net income (profit) soared 228% to $10.4 billion as management carefully controlled costs across all divisions."", ""With a market cap of $1.9 trillion, Amazon stock only has to gain another 5.3% to join the $2 trillion club. Membership might be a mere formality at this point considering the company's growth, but there's a big reason Amazon could remain there for the long haul."", ""Amazon generates more revenue than every company in the $2 trillion club. More than $574 billion flowed through its doors in 2023, compared to $394 billion for Apple, which led Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet. However, Amazon stock is cheaper than all of them on the basis of its price to sales (P/S) ratio (which divides a company's market capitalization by its revenue):"", ""Amazon is historically the least profitable company among its big-tech peers, primarily because its e-commerce business runs on razor thin margins. However, the company's net income has surged by triple-digit percentages in the last three quarters, which, in my opinion, should entice investors to pay a higher valuation multiple for Amazon's revenue over time. Its P/S ratio has slowly climbed over the past year, which is proof this is already happening."", ""Therefore, not only will Amazon stock likely rise in the future based on the strong growth across its business, but there might also be a case of multiple expansion in its P/S ratio -- especially considering how far it's lagging behind Alphabet, which is next-to-last in the above chart."", 'Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

After initial encouraging quarterly results, despite companies still navigating ongoing macroeconomic headwinds, there has been a reversal in the performances. The sector’s quarterly earnings are projected to decline year over year, primarily due to worldwide geopolitical issues and healthcare labor shortages.', 'The latest Earnings Preview indicates that 55% of the companies in the Medical sector, constituting nearly 78% of the sector’s market capitalization, reported earnings until May 1. Of these, 75.8% beat earnings and revenue estimates. Earnings declined 31.2% year over year despite 4.4% higher revenues. 93.9% of the companies beat earnings, while 75.8% beat revenue estimates, which were already down because of the ongoing macroeconomic issues.', 'Overall, first-quarter earnings of the Medical sector are expected to decline 25.1% despite a 7.1% sales increase. This compares with fourth-quarter earnings decline of 17.1% despite a 7% reported revenue growth. Per the latest trends, the Medical sector is one of the five sectors that are predicted to earn less in the first quarter of 2024 compared with the year-ago period.', 'Integral to the broader Medical sector, the Medical Device or Zacks-defined Medical Products companies’ collective business growth is likely to have stabilized despite the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds in the United States as well as internationally. With the pandemic-related crisis gone, the industry is experiencing a rise in care visits, thereby driving demand for therapies and other healthcare services. Meanwhile, the rapid adoption of generative Artificial Intelligence (genAI) and digital therapies is helping more efficient and patient-friendly services.

Robinson Technology Breaks a Decades-Old Barrier to Automation in the Logistics Industry,Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/c-h-robinson-technology-breaks-120000694.html,1715083200,STORY,['CHRW'],"['Artificial intelligence now reads and replies to 2,000 emailed quote requests a day', 'EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn., May 07, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--In another industry-leading innovation, C.H. Robinson has automated transactions that many shippers still conduct by email. It breaks a long-standing barrier to automation and gives shippers who use email the same speed-to market and cost savings as shippers who are more digitally connected.', 'Using artificial intelligence, C.H. Robinson’s new technology classifies incoming email, reads it and replicates the steps a person would take to fulfill a customer’s request. For example, shippers often still choose to send an email asking for a price quote rather than log into a digital platform. On an average business day, the global logistics company receives over 11,000 emails from customers and carriers requesting pricing on truckload freight.', '""Our customers can get instant price quotes through our Navisphere platform or any of the 35 largest TMS or ERP systems we’re integrated with. But for someone like a busy warehouse manager with unexpected spot freight or freight in a new lane, an email can just feel easier. Email works the same for everybody. It doesn’t ask for your password. There are no fields to fill in,"" said Mark Albrecht, Vice President for Artificial Intelligence. ""Before generative AI, replying to that email request defied automation. Customers had to wait for a human just to pass along a quote from our Dynamic Pricing Engine. Now, our new technology reads the email and supplies the quote in an average 2 minutes 13 seconds. C.H. Robinson is doing this at scale, leaving our people more time to help those same customers with more complex requests.""', 'While the technology is replying to 2,000 customer quote requests a day, it opens the door to automating other transactions shippers and carriers choose to do by email. The large language model (LLM) the technology uses can be trained to identify an email about a load tender, a pickup appointment or a shipment tracking update.', 'For spot quotes, C.H. Robinson has already trained the model to differentiate between a quote request for truckload, less-than-truckload (LTL), intermodal or air freight.', 'So far, 2,268 of C.H. Robinson’s truckload customers are getting the benefits of automated email quotes. The faster a shipper gets a price quote and secures a carrier to pick up their freight, the less likely they’ll need to pay a premium. Speed matters in the spot market because most carriers are regional and only so many are working a given shipping lane on a given day. MIT research shows that shippers delayed in getting to the spot market can end up paying 23% to 35% extra on their shipment.', 'C.H. Robinson developers are now working on applying the technology to LTL price requests, which will be especially valuable to the company’s portfolio of small-business customers that rely on email. A pilot using AI for price requests on expedited freight is also under way, with automotive customers that ship parts critical to just-in-time manufacturing.', '""After automating so many other types of customer transactions, you could call email the last mile,"" said Arun Rajan, Chief Operating Officer. ""We’d been exploring how to automate email requests for a couple of years through natural language processing and machine learning, but it would’ve been insanely hard and expensive. Then generative AI arrived, and we developed this automation technology so fast because we already had training data ready to go. The good news for our customers is that they still get what they need using email, while our supply chain experts are freed up to do work that’s higher value for them, our customers and our company’s growth.""', 'About C.H. Robinson', 'C.H. Robinson solves logistics problems for companies across the globe and across industries, from the simple to the most complex.

This reconciliation captioned ""Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" can be found on the Investor Relations section of Akamai\'s website.', ""Akamai provides forward-looking statements in the form of guidance during its quarterly earnings conference calls. This guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis and cannot be reconciled to the closest GAAP measures without unreasonable effort because of the unpredictability of the amounts and timing of events affecting the items we exclude from non-GAAP measures. For example, stock-based compensation is unpredictable for Akamai's performance-based awards, which can fluctuate significantly based on current expectations of the future achievement of performance-based targets. Amortization of intangible assets, acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs are all impacted by the timing and size of potential future actions, which are difficult to predict. In addition, from time to time, Akamai excludes certain items that occur infrequently, which are also inherently difficult to predict and estimate. It is also difficult to predict the tax effect of the items we exclude and to estimate certain discrete tax items, such as the resolution of tax audits or changes to tax laws. As such, the costs that are being excluded from non-GAAP guidance are difficult to predict and a reconciliation or a range of results could lead to disclosure that would be imprecise or potentially misleading. Material changes to any one of the exclusions could have a significant effect on our guidance and future GAAP results."", ""Akamai's definition of the non-GAAP measures used in this press release are outlined below:"", 'Non-GAAP operating margin – Non-GAAP income from operations stated as a percentage of revenue. Non-GAAP income from operations is GAAP income from operations adjusted for the following items: amortization of acquired intangible assets; stock-based compensation; amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation; amortization of capitalized interest expense; acquisition-related costs; restructuring charges; and other non-recurring or unusual items that may arise from time to time.', ""Non-GAAP net income per diluted share – Non-GAAP net income divided by weighted average diluted common shares outstanding. Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding are adjusted in non-GAAP per share calculations for the shares that would be delivered to Akamai pursuant to the note hedge transactions entered into in connection with the issuances of $1,265 million of convertible senior notes due 2029 and the issuances of $1,150 million of convertible senior notes due 2027 and 2025, respectively. Under GAAP, shares delivered under hedge transactions are not considered offsetting shares in the fully-diluted share calculation until they are delivered. However, Akamai would receive a benefit from the note hedge transactions and would not allow the dilution to occur, so management believes that adjusting for this benefit provides a meaningful view of operating performance. With respect to the convertible senior notes due in each of 2029, 2027 and 2025, unless Akamai's weighted average stock price is greater than $126.31, $116.18 and $95.10, respectively, the initial conversion prices, there will be no difference between GAAP and non-GAAP diluted weighted average common shares outstanding."", 'Non-GAAP net income – GAAP net income adjusted for the following tax-affected items: amortization of acquired intangible assets; stock-based compensation; amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation; acquisition-related costs; restructuring charges; amortization of debt issuance costs; amortization of capitalized interest expense; certain gains and losses on investments; gains and losses from equity method investment; and other non-recurring or unusual items that may arise from time to time.', ""The non-GAAP adjustments, and Akamai's basis for excluding them from non-GAAP financial measures, are outlined below:"", ""Amortization of acquired intangible assets – Akamai has incurred amortization of intangible assets, included in its GAAP financial statements, related to various acquisitions Akamai has made. The amount of an acquisition's purchase price allocated to intangible assets and term of its related amortization can vary significantly and is unique to each acquisition; therefore, Akamai excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets from its non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with a consistent basis for comparing pre- and post-acquisition operating results."", ""Stock-based compensation and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation – Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation paid to Akamai's employees, the grant date fair value varies based on the stock price at the time of grant, varying valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types. This makes the comparison of Akamai's current financial results to previous and future periods difficult to interpret; therefore, Akamai believes it is useful to exclude stock-based compensation and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation from its non-GAAP financial measures in order to highlight the performance of Akamai's core business and to be consistent with the way many investors evaluate its performance and compare its operating results to peer companies."", ""Acquisition-related costs – Acquisition-related costs include transaction fees, advisory fees, due diligence costs and other direct costs associated with strategic activities, as well as certain additional compensation costs payable to employees acquired from the Linode acquisition if employed for a certain period of time. The additional compensation cost was initiated by and determined by the seller, and is in addition to normal levels of compensation, including retention programs, offered by Akamai. Acquisition-related costs are impacted by the timing and size of the acquisitions, and Akamai excludes acquisition-related costs from its non-GAAP financial measures to provide a useful comparison of operating results to prior periods and to peer companies because such amounts vary significantly based on the magnitude of the acquisition transactions and do not reflect Akamai's core operations."", 'Restructuring charge – Akamai has incurred restructuring charges from programs that have significantly changed either the scope of the business undertaken by the Company or the manner in which that business is conducted. These charges include severance and related expenses for workforce reductions, impairments of long-lived assets that will no longer be used in operations (including right-of-use assets, other facility-related property and equipment and internal-use software) and termination fees for any contracts canceled as part of these programs. Akamai excludes these items from its non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating its continuing business performance as such items vary significantly based on the magnitude of the restructuring action and do not reflect expected future operating expenses. In addition, these charges do not necessarily provide meaningful insight into the fundamentals of current or past operations of its business.', ""Amortization of debt issuance costs and capitalized interest expense – Akamai has convertible senior notes outstanding that mature in 2029, 2027 and 2025. The issuance costs of the convertible senior notes are amortized to interest expense and are excluded from Akamai's non-GAAP results because management believes the non-cash amortization expense is not representative of ongoing operating performance."", ""Gains and losses on investments – Akamai has recorded gains and losses from the disposition, changes to fair value and impairment of certain investments. Akamai believes excluding these amounts from its non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as the types of events giving rise to these gains and losses are not representative of Akamai's core business operations and ongoing operating performance."", 'Gains and losses from equity method investment – Akamai records income or losses on its share of earnings and losses from its equity method investment, and any gains from returns of investments or impairments. Akamai excludes such income and losses because it does not have direct control over the operations of the investment and the related income and losses are not representative of its core business operations.', 'Income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments and certain discrete tax items – The non-GAAP adjustments described above are reported on a pre-tax basis. The income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments is the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP income tax expense. Non-GAAP income tax expense is computed on non-GAAP pre-tax income (GAAP pre-tax income adjusted for non-GAAP adjustments) and excludes certain discrete tax items (such as the impact of intercompany sales of intellectual property related to acquisitions), if any. Akamai believes that applying the non-GAAP adjustments and their related income tax effect allows Akamai to highlight income attributable to its core operations.', 'Contacts:', 'Gina SoriceMedia Relations646-320-4107gsorice@akamai.com', 'Mark StoutenbergInvestor Relations857-227-4491mstouten@akamai.com', 'View original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/akamai-announces-intent-to-acquire-api-security-company-noname-302138028.html', 'SOURCE Akamai Technologies, Inc.']"

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments."", ""While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns."", 'Colgate-Palmolive in Focus', ""Colgate-Palmolive (CL) is headquartered in New York, and is in the Consumer Staples sector. The stock has seen a price change of 16.52% since the start of the year. The consumer products maker is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.5 per share, with a dividend yield of 2.15%.

Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Colgate-Palmolive's payout ratio is 57%, which means it paid out 57% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend."", 'Earnings growth looks solid for CL for this fiscal year.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their past performance during recessionary periods, and go directly to read 5 Best Recession Dividend Stocks To Buy.\xa0', 'Several financial analysts, previously forecasting a recession in the US at the end of 2022, have now turned optimistic about the market’s outlook. The US economy experienced growth at an annualized rate of 4% in the second half of the year, leading experts to maintain a positive outlook on the country’s economic prospects. In fact, data from the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) indicates that recessions have become increasingly less frequent in the US. From 1990 to 2023, the US economy endured 36 months of recession, with the most recent recession occurring in 2020 and lasting for only two months. Their analysis further suggested that recessions were more common as we go further back in time.', 'While the likelihood of a recession is uncertain at the moment, investors have consistently maintained their focus on dividend stocks whenever concerns about a recession arise. In addition to dividends, analysts also recommend investing in industries that are known for their resilience and stability to ensure prudent investment choices. For example, industries such as healthcare, utilities, consumer staples, and telecommunications are considered less vulnerable to economic shifts, making them reliable for navigating through a recession. According to a report by Business Insider, the consumer staples sector outperformed the market by 49% over a 25-year period ending in 2015. The report further mentioned that a significant portion of this outperformance was observed during recessionary periods.', 'Investors favor these industries because they not only offer dividends to shareholders but have also raised their payouts over the years. According to data collected from Janus Henderson, global healthcare dividends grew from $94.5 billion in 2017 to nearly $135 billion in 2023. Similarly, dividends from the energy sector also jumped from $104.6 billion in 2017 to $173.7 billion last year. Dividend stocks have shown strong performance during recessionary periods.', 'Following the major recession of 2008, investors became more mindful of their investment strategies and recognized that dividend stocks are a reliable approach for sailing through economic downturns. Nova Southeastern University conducted research and found that during both the recovery and recessionary phases of 2001 and 2008 recessions, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of some of the best dividend stocks that have grown their payouts for at least 25 years, showed significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500. In particular, during the recovery phase of the 2008 recession, the index outpaced the broader market by 0.01% daily or an annualized rate of 4.59%. Moreover, during the recessionary phase of 2008, the dividend aristocrats outperformed the S&P 500 by 0.06% daily or an annualized rate of 23.7%.', 'Some of the best dividend stocks to consider for a recession include The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP). These companies have decades-long dividend growth streaks and maintain strong balance sheets that help them remain resilient during recessionary periods. In this article, we will further discuss the best dividend stocks to buy for a recession.', 'Our Methodology:', ""For this article, we used Insider Monkey's database of 933 hedge funds as of Q4 2023 and identified dividend stocks from industries that are known to be recession-proof, such as healthcare, consumer staples, telecommunications, and utilities.

That means you have to go in with your eyes open to the risks, even when energy prices are strong. But income investors don't have to fret since there are multiple ways to collect dividends in the energy space and one will probably suit you regardless of your risk appetite."", ""Here's why you'll want to take a close look at Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD), Chevron (NYSE: CVX), and Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN) as May gets under way."", 'The energy sector is broadly broken down into three segments: the upstream, which deals with oil and gas production; the downstream, which involves refining and chemicals; and the midstream, which connects the upstream to the downstream.', ""Midstream businesses, like the one operated by Enterprise Products Partners, generally charge fees for the use of the vital pipeline, transportation, storage, and processing assets they own. The price of the commodities flowing through its system isn't nearly as important as energy demand, which tends to remain robust even when oil prices are low."", ""The fees that Enterprise charges provide it with a reliable stream of cash to pay distributions. The master limited partnership (MLP) has increased its distribution annually for 25 consecutive years. Meanwhile, the distribution was covered 1.7 times over by distributable cash flow in the first quarter of 2024, meaning there's little risk of a distribution cut."", ""The huge 7.4% distribution yield is likely to make up the majority of an investor's return over time, but if you're looking for a big yield in the energy patch, Enterprise Products Partners is a good way to get it."", 'While Enterprise tries to sidestep the riskiest aspect of the energy patch, Chevron attempts to reduce risk in a different manner. For starters, it has diversified its business across all three segments of the industry. The upstream, midstream, and downstream all tend to have different business dynamics, which helps to soften the impact of the ups and downs inherent to energy markets over time.', ""Oil prices will still be the main determination of Chevron's results, but the swings aren't going to be as great as they would be for a pure-play upstream or downstream company."", 'In addition, Chevron has one of the strongest balance sheets among its integrated energy peers, ending 2023 with a debt-to-equity ratio of just 0.12. If oil prices crash, it will have ample room to take on debt to keep funding its business and shareholder dividends.', ""That's where Chevron's impressive streak of 37 annual dividend increases comes in. The energy industry has gone through some very big swings over the past three decades, including during the coronavirus pandemic, when U.S. oil prices actually fell below zero at one point. Through it all, Chevron continued to support its dividend, rewarding investors for sticking around. If dividend consistency is important to you, this is a stock you'll want to get to know very well. The dividend yield today is an attractive 4% or so."", ""Even if you aren't exactly interested in playing it safe, there's still a dividend option for you. Devon Energy is a U.S.-based upstream energy producer. Its top and bottom lines are tied to the price of oil and natural gas. When oil prices are heading higher, the company's performance will benefit. When oil prices are falling, its financial results will suffer."", ""This is vitally important to understand, because Devon Energy has a variable dividend policy tied to its financial performance. The dividend yield is currently 4.7%, but given the way the company approaches the dividend, you shouldn't put too much weight on that figure. The dividend payout will change."", ""With energy prices so important to Devon's financial results and dividend, the stock tends to be leveraged to the ups and downs of commodity prices. That's a big risk that more conservative investors probably won't want to take on. But if you step back, right when your real-world energy costs are heading higher, for things like heating and gasoline, Devon should be increasing its dividend."", ""In other words, it'll give you a bit more cash right when you need it most. Of course, the dividend will be cut when oil prices drop, but at that point your real-world energy costs should be falling, too. Devon is a complicated story for a dividend investor, but if you think a bit more strategically with your investments, you might find it's the perfect option for you."", ""If you're a safety-first investor, Enterprise will probably be attractive to you. If you're looking for a little energy exposure but don't want to bet the house, diversified and reliable Chevron could be the best call. If you can handle more risk, Devon's variable dividend could be right for you. All three have a lot to offer dividend investors, including attractive yields, as we enter May."", 'Before you buy stock in Enterprise Products Partners, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Enterprise Products Partners wasn’t one of them.

A number of new client sales deals failed to develop and close in the quarter, resulting in some deals slipping into future periods. In fact, several of the deals have already closed in the second quarter. Significant wins in the first quarter include sales from Rimini Street’s entire portfolio of solutions to leading global and regional brands across a variety of industries and geographies.', 'To address the challenges, we continue to focus on hiring, training and building out new solution sales capabilities globally. This includes sellers, sales management, sales support, regional marketing and senior revenue executives. In January, we held a comprehensive sales kickoff to further develop the skills of more than 400 global revenue team members. The event was a week of rigorous training on the full Rimini Street portfolio solutions and how to successfully sell Rimini Street solutions to diverse industries and help clients achieve their strategic, financial and operational goals. During the quarter, we continued the launch and rollout of our full portfolio of solutions globally, including our end-to-end ERP outsourcing solution, Rimini ONE, for Oracle and SAP products and our managed service solutions for Salesforce.', 'Subsequent to the quarter, we announced the hiring of a new general manager for the EMEA Theatre, Martyn Hoogakker, who joined us from Adobe with a successful career in sales and regional management and the hiring of our new Chief Revenue Officer, Steven Hershkowitz, who joined us following extensive and successful sales strategy and leadership experience with HP, Cisco and other companies.

Oracle litigation update, Rimini Street in Oracle have been in litigation for more than 14 years, including cases known as Rimini ONE and Rimini II. In 2010, Oracle filed the Rimini ONE case against Rimini Street in U.S. District Court. As a result of the Rimini ONE case, the trial completed in 2015 and subsequent appeals, the U.S. courts have affirmed the third-party software support is legal. The U.S. court issued a permanent injunction known as the Rimini ONE injunction enjoining certain activities related to the manner in which Rimini provides support on certain Oracle product lines.', 'The Rimini ONE injunction does not prohibit Rimini from providing support to any Oracle product line. There are no current litigation activities related to Rimini ONE. Subsequent to the Rimini ONE trial, Oracle filed and prevailed on certain claims that a contempt proceeding related to the Rimini ONE injunction. Rimini paid certain fines and settled with Oracle on reimbursement of a portion of its legal fees. In 2014, Rimini filed the Rimini II case against Oracle in the U.S. District Court. Trial occurred in 2022. While Oracle prevailed on liability for its DMCA and Lanham Act, Oracle abandoned its $1.4 billion of damages claim and all non-equitable claims of prejudice on the eve of a jury trial and lost its copyright claims for a majority of product lines that issued the case, EBS, JDE and Siebel On the remaining product lines, PeopleSoft database, Oracle prevailed on certain claims but Rimini prevailed on central crosscutting legal theories that record to Oracle’s broad infringement claims spanning all Oracle product lines.', 'In July 2023, concurrent with the District Court’s trial rulings for Rimini II, the District Court issued a permanent injunction known as the Rimini II injunction, which amongst other things, further enjoying certain Rimini activities related solely to the manner in which Rimini provides support on certain Oracle product lines. Rimini is appealing the injunction to the Court of Appeals. As of this date, an administrative stay of the Rimini II injunction remains effective, and the Court of Appeals has not yet issued a decision on Rimini’s motion to stay the Rimini II injunction pending the resolution of Rimini’s appeal. On November 6, 2023, Oracle filed the motion for attorney’s fees a taxable cost with the U.S. District Court, requested to recover attorney’s fees and taxable costs totaling approximately $70.6 million related to the Rimini II litigation.', 'Rimini filed its opposition to Oracle’s motion and argues that the District Court should deny Oracle’s motion in its entirety. Rimini further argues that, should the District Court award recovery of any attorney’s fees to Oracle, such fees should not exceed $14.47 million. The matter is now under consideration for determination by the District Court. Rimini reserves all rights, including appellate rights with respect to the Rimini II litigation, including any award of attorney fees and taxable cost to Oracle. So in summary, today, there are currently three Rimini II post-trial litigation matters still before court. One, a deal of the Rimini II findings known as the merits appeal and the Rimini II injunction before the Court of Appeals.', 'Two, a motion to further stay the Rimini II injunction pending a decision under Rimini’s appeal of the injunction, which is also before the Court of Appeals. And three, litigation before the District Court over Oracle’s requested recovery of certain of their attorneys’ fees and costs related to the Rimini II case that is on appeal. With respect to the Rimini II merits appeal and appeal of the Rimini II injunction, all briefs have been filed and the Court of Appeals has currently set the date of June 5, 2024 to hear oral arguments.

Summary, we remain confident that we are continuing to take the right actions and making the right investments to accelerate growth, increase profitability, enhance shareholder value and bring our litigation with Oracle to a successful conclusion. However, if Rimini Street does not ultimately prevail in the litigation matters described above and in our SEC filings, it could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results.', 'Now over to you, Michael.', 'Michael Perica: Thank you, Seth, and thank you for joining us, everyone.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Biggest Real Estate Companies in the US in 2024.', 'The US real estate market has long been subject to high mortgage rates and soaring home prices. As reported by CNBC on April 30, home prices in February increased 6.4% year over year. With all-time high prices in major cities including San Diego, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and New York, affordability concerns continue to arise. Regarding housing affordability, we have also discussed the least affordable metros for homebuyers in the US.', 'Monthly price appreciation has been reported in expensive West Coast metros where the inventory remains restricted and has not yet recovered since the pandemic. The highest monthly home value growth from February to March was recorded at 3.3% for San Jose, 2.7% for San Francisco, 2.4% for Seattle, 2.1% for San Diego, and 2% for Los Angeles. These are the five US metros where homeowners are most subject to a mortgage rate lock-in effect, which is when existing homeowners feel reluctant to sell their homes since they will have to purchase at higher rates. Buyers tend to compete for fewer choices in such markets with limited supply. On the other hand, existing inventory has improved in the Southern metros thereby easing the rapid price appreciation. New construction has also added to the choices in these housing markets. Some of the affordable, promising cities to buy real estate in 2024 have been previously covered.', 'As of March, total inventory has increased by 12.2% year over year. However, the inventory levels are still 36.4% lower as compared to the pre-pandemic period. New listings have also gone up by 3.7% since 2023, still falling behind the pre-pandemic levels by 25.4%. Therefore, strong demand and tight supply continue to drive home values up in the US.', 'Some of the dominant real estate companies in the US include Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX), Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD), and Keller Williams Realty. Let’s take a look at what these companies have been up to.', 'Equinix, Inc.

Here are some comments from Prologis, Inc.’s (NYSE:PLD) Q1 2024 earnings call:', '“We’ve had a good start to the year in terms of our operating and financial results in the first quarter. We delivered strong rent change, drove occupancy slightly ahead of our forecast, raised nearly $5 billion in capital, including $750 million in strategic capital, and made important headway in our Energy business.', 'We also had a successful equity raise in FIBRA Prologis, raising over $500 million for deployment into both assets to be contributed from our balance sheet, as well as pursuits of third-party acquisitions. Transaction volumes and activity have ticked up in recent weeks and pricing has certainly improved. As always, we are actively looking at acquisition opportunities across all of our markets, but our focus remains on the development of our land bank, which provides an opportunity for over $38 billion of build out with a return on incremental capital of approximately 8.5%. In terms of guidance, in light of our views on demand and leasing pace in the coming quarters, we are reducing our average occupancy guidance to range between 95.75% and 96.75% of the 75 basis point adjustment from the midpoint.”', 'Keller Williams Realty operates as the world’s largest real estate franchise by agent count. On March 27, the company reported its expansion to the Bahamas. Keller Williams Bahamas is expected to open its first market center in the second quarter of 2024.

The stock also remained steady in subsequent trading sessions."", 'This likely reflects some confidence in McDonald\'s stock. Although both revenue and earnings increased, CEO Chris Kempczinski noted the effects of inflation, saying customers are ""more discriminating"" with every dollar.', ""However, inflation does not matter to nearly the degree that casual observers might assume. Thus, investors are likely correct not to react to such news and stay the course with McDonald's. Here's why."", ""The shocking truth about McDonald's is that from a certain point of view, McDonald's is not a restaurant stock."", 'Yes, you read that correctly.', 'The reason why is its business model. When one looks at a competitor like Chipotle, nearly all of its revenue comes from restaurant sales.', ""That is not the case with McDonald's. In Q1 2024, around 38% of its revenue came from sales at company-owned restaurants. However, those sales come from about 5% of McDonald's restaurants owned by the company."", ""The remaining 95% of restaurants are franchises. McDonald's collects franchise fees from these restaurants, including a royalty of 4% to 5% of all revenue collected from a given location. Moreover, since it owns the building of every franchise, it derives revenue from rent. Since only a small portion of franchise fees depends on a restaurant's sales, its business model is highly resistant to phenomena such as recessions and inflation."", 'Furthermore, company-owned restaurants have high-operating costs. Just over 59% of its operating expenses in Q1 came from that part of the business. Thus, the majority of its operating income comes from its franchises.', ""In Q1, overall revenue was $6.2 billion, a 5% increase from last year. Additionally, McDonald's limited operating-expense growth to 2%. Hence, its net income of $1.9 billion grew by 7% yearly."", 'Investors should also note analyst estimates as its financials appear set to improve slightly. For 2024, analysts forecast a 10% profit increase this year and 9% in 2025.', ""Such numbers may not impress growth investors, but McDonald's will probably remain attractive to those investors looking for safety and dividends. While the stock fell 8% during the year, the company raised the dividend by 10% last year to $6.68 per share. The payout has also increased every year since 1976 under a variety of economic conditions, a factor that reinforces its stability."", ""Amid its struggles, McDonald's stock has underperformed the S&P 500 over the last year and slightly lagged the index over five years even when including dividends. This means that investors must go back 10 years to identify a timeline when it outperformed the averages."", 'Still, those struggles may set the stock up for a significant gain. The discounted stock price means its dividend yield now stands at 2.4%, significantly above the S&P 500 average of 1.4%. Also, its 23 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is below the five-year average of 28, near three-year lows. Such metrics could indicate the stock is ready to move higher again.', ""Ultimately, owning McDonald's stock is an excellent source of inflation-resistant income."", ""Admittedly, McDonald's is probably not earning the returns that will impress growth investors. However, most of its higher-margin revenue depends on franchise-related fees that are fixed amounts. Also, the company's stock dividend has risen yearly for nearly half a century under a variety of conditions."", 'For those who have waited until now to buy the stock, those cash returns far exceed S&P 500 averages, meaning income investors may want to consider adding shares.', ""Before you buy stock in McDonald's, consider this:"", ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and McDonald's wasn’t one of them.

McDonald's is trailing the S&P 500, meanwhile, having shed 8% in 2024 to date."", ""The biggest factor driving that performance gap is Chipotle's quality of growth when compared to its larger rival. Sure, both companies are boosting comparable-store sales right now. Yet McDonald's is achieving that growth through higher prices while Chipotle is earning its revenue gains the hard way."", ""Let's look at the difference in this key are, along with whether that makes the burrito chain an obvious buy over McDonald's right now."", ""Chipotle this past quarter reported a blazing 14% sales increase as Q1 revenue jumped to $2.7 billion. Part of that increase came from an expanding store base, sure. But sales at existing locations were up 7%, trouncing the 2% growth at McDonald's."", 'Chipotle isn\'t relying on price increases to drive sales higher, either. Higher traffic is doing all the heavy lifting instead. The chain handled 5% more diners this quarter compared to a year ago, keeping many stores operating near capacity for the core lunch hours. ""We had another outstanding quarter driven by our improvement in throughput and successful marketing initiatives,"" CEO Brian Niccol said in a late April press statement.', 'McDonald\'s said in February that customer traffic dipped into negative territory late in Q4, and that trend apparently worsened into the start of the fiscal year. The chain\'s comps decelerated to 2.5% in the core U.S. market from 4.3% in the prior quarter. ""Consumers are more discriminating with every dollar that they spend,"" CEO Chris Kempczinski said in a late April announcement .', ""McDonald's still has Chipotle beat in key financial metrics like cash flow and profitability. Operating profit improved to 44.3% of sales from 42.9% of sales this past quarter, making the fast-food giant among the most profitable companies in any industry. Chipotle, for comparison, converts about 17% of sales into operating earnings."", ""That profit gap is mainly due to McDonald's franchised selling approach that results in a steady flow of franchise, royalty, and rent fees. These income streams are far more profitable than food sales."", ""You'll also get more cash returns from owning McDonald's stock over its smaller rival. The chain has been paying a dividend for more than 25 consecutive years and its most recent annual raise was a healthy 10%. Chipotle is more focused on making growth investments and so it pays no dividend."", ""The stocks' valuation gap reflects Wall Street's different expectations for their businesses in 2024 and beyond. Chipotle is priced at 9 times sales, which is the highest premium investors have had to pay for this fast-food stock in 3 years. McDonald's, in contrast, is valued at below 8 times sales. That's near the lowest premium available for this fast-food titan in the past 3 years."", ""If you're a fan of growth, you still might want to pay up for Chipotle over McDonald's today. The chain has excellent market share momentum, and it can build on that healthy traffic metric to continue accelerating its sales trends. A McDonald's investment won't be as volatile, especially with its steady dividend income. But the fast-food giant's stock could remain under pressure until the company can prove it can boost traffic in this competitive selling environment."", 'Before you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn’t one of them.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Biggest Real Estate Companies in the US in 2024.', 'The US real estate market has long been subject to high mortgage rates and soaring home prices. As reported by CNBC on April 30, home prices in February increased 6.4% year over year. With all-time high prices in major cities including San Diego, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and New York, affordability concerns continue to arise. Regarding housing affordability, we have also discussed the least affordable metros for homebuyers in the US.', 'Monthly price appreciation has been reported in expensive West Coast metros where the inventory remains restricted and has not yet recovered since the pandemic. The highest monthly home value growth from February to March was recorded at 3.3% for San Jose, 2.7% for San Francisco, 2.4% for Seattle, 2.1% for San Diego, and 2% for Los Angeles. These are the five US metros where homeowners are most subject to a mortgage rate lock-in effect, which is when existing homeowners feel reluctant to sell their homes since they will have to purchase at higher rates. Buyers tend to compete for fewer choices in such markets with limited supply. On the other hand, existing inventory has improved in the Southern metros thereby easing the rapid price appreciation. New construction has also added to the choices in these housing markets. Some of the affordable, promising cities to buy real estate in 2024 have been previously covered.', 'As of March, total inventory has increased by 12.2% year over year. However, the inventory levels are still 36.4% lower as compared to the pre-pandemic period. New listings have also gone up by 3.7% since 2023, still falling behind the pre-pandemic levels by 25.4%. Therefore, strong demand and tight supply continue to drive home values up in the US.', 'Some of the dominant real estate companies in the US include Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX), Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD), and Keller Williams Realty. Let’s take a look at what these companies have been up to.', 'Equinix, Inc.

The two-story facility in the Silicon Valley region of California will be made in two phases. The first phase is scheduled to be completed in the second quarter of 2024.

The company’s revenue for the quarter amounted to $1.83 billion, up 11.87% year-over-year. Here are some comments from Prologis, Inc.’s (NYSE:PLD) Q1 2024 earnings call:', '“We’ve had a good start to the year in terms of our operating and financial results in the first quarter. We delivered strong rent change, drove occupancy slightly ahead of our forecast, raised nearly $5 billion in capital, including $750 million in strategic capital, and made important headway in our Energy business.', 'We also had a successful equity raise in FIBRA Prologis, raising over $500 million for deployment into both assets to be contributed from our balance sheet, as well as pursuits of third-party acquisitions. Transaction volumes and activity have ticked up in recent weeks and pricing has certainly improved. As always, we are actively looking at acquisition opportunities across all of our markets, but our focus remains on the development of our land bank, which provides an opportunity for over $38 billion of build out with a return on incremental capital of approximately 8.5%. In terms of guidance, in light of our views on demand and leasing pace in the coming quarters, we are reducing our average occupancy guidance to range between 95.75% and 96.75% of the 75 basis point adjustment from the midpoint.”', 'Keller Williams Realty operates as the world’s largest real estate franchise by agent count. On March 27, the company reported its expansion to the Bahamas. Keller Williams Bahamas is expected to open its first market center in the second quarter of 2024. The company also has a presence in other Caribbean regions such as Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Bermuda, Turks and Caicos, the Dominican Republic, Aruba, Sint Maarten, Bonaire, and Curaçao. Keller Williams Worldwide (KWW), the international division of Keller Williams, has more than 19,000 agents operating outside the United States and Canada, as of February.

The IDC White Paper, sponsored by NetApp, ""Scaling AI Initiatives Responsibly: The Critical Role of an Intelligent Data Infrastructure*,"" reveals the various challenges and business benefits at different levels of AI maturity and provides insights into the successful strategies adopted by leading organizations in their efforts to responsibly scale AI and GenAI workloads. By spotlighting actionable approaches, the report aims to help organizations avoid common pitfalls, ensuring that their AI initiatives are not one of the 20% that are likely to fail. The report also introduces a detailed AI maturity model developed to assess organizational progress based on their approach to AI, from AI Emergents and AI Pioneers, to AI Leaders and AI Masters', 'Intelligent Data Infrastructure is the Foundation of AI Success', 'The IDC White Paper found that:', 'AI Masters optimize their data infrastructure for transformational AI initiatives by facilitating easy access to corporate datasets with minimal preparation and designing a unified, hybrid, multicloud environment that supports various data types and access methods.', 'AI Masters have more ambitious AI goals and yet experience data-related failures including infrastructure-based data access limitations (21%), compliance limitations (16%), and insufficient data (17%).', 'AI Emergents note similar challenges but also experience budget constraints (20% Emergents vs 9% AI Masters), insufficient data for model training (26% vs 17%) and business restrictions on data access (28% vs 20%).', 'According to the findings, organizations need an intelligent data infrastructure in order to scale AI initiatives responsibly. Where a company falls on the AI maturity scale is determined by the level of infrastructure they have in place that will not only drive the long-term success of AI projects, but also of their associated business outcomes. Those organizations that are just beginning or have recently begun their AI journey typically have disparate data architectures or plans for a more unified architecture, while AI Leaders and AI Masters are likely already executing on a unified vision. As a result, organizations with the most AI experience are failing less.', '""This IDC White Paper further solidifies that companies need intelligent data infrastructure to scale AI responsibly and boost the rate of AI initiative success,"" said Jonsi Stefansson, Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer at NetApp. ""With intelligent data infrastructure in place, companies have the flexibility to access any data, anywhere with integrated data management to ensure data security, protection, and governance and adaptive operations that can optimize performance, cost and sustainability.""', 'Data Infrastructure Flexibility is Crucial for Data Access and AI Initiative Success', 'The IDC White Paper found that:', '48% of AI Masters report they have instant availability of their structured data and 43% of their unstructured data, while AI Emergents have only 26% and 20% respectively.', 'AI Masters (65%) and AI Emergents (35%) reported their current data architectures can seamlessly integrate their organization’s private data with AI Cloud services.', 'According to the research, AI Masters know that their data architecture and infrastructure for transformational AI initiatives must offer ease of access to corporate data sets without any—or with only minor—preparation or preprocessing.', '""Infrastructure decisions made during the design and planning process of AI Initiatives must factor in architecture flexibility,"" said Ritu Jyoti Group Vice President, Worldwide Artificial Intelligence and Automation Research Practice, Global AI Research Lead, at IDC. ""The dynamic nature of data inputs to AI and GenAI workstreams means easy access to distributed and diverse data—both structured and unstructured data sets with varying characteristics—is critical. This requires a flexible, unified approach to storage, a common control plane, and management tools that make it seamless for data scientists and developers to consume data with MLOps integrations.""', 'Effective Data Governance and Security Processes Drive AI Success', 'The IDC White Paper found that:', 'The inability for AI Emergents to progress is often due to a lack of standardized governance policies and procedures; only 8% of AI Emergents have completed and standardized these across all AI projects, compared to 38% of AI Masters.', 'While 51% of AI Masters reported they have standardized policies in place that are rigorously enforced by an independent group in their organization, only 3% of AI Emergents claim this.', 'The study found that effective data governance and security are crucial indicators of organizational maturity in AI initiatives. Managing data responsibly and securely remains a key issue for enterprises, because AI stakeholders often try to shortcut security processes to accelerate development. Feedback from organizations that have become more successful at delivering positive outcomes from their AI initiatives demonstrates that governance and security are not merely cost centers but vital enablers of innovation. By prioritizing security, data sovereignty, and regulatory compliance, organizations can mitigate risk in their AI and GenAI initiatives and ensure that their data engineers and scientists can focus on maximizing efficiency and productivity.', 'Efficient Use of Resources Important for Scaling AI Responsibly', 'The IDC White Paper found that:', '43% of AI Masters have clearly defined metrics for assessing resource efficiency when developing AI models that were completed and standardized across all AI projects compared to 9% of AI Emergents.', '63% of all respondents reported the need for major improvements or a complete overhaul to ensure their storage is optimized for AI and only 14% indicated they needed no improvements.', 'As AI workflows become increasingly integral to almost every industry, it’s critical to acknowledge the impact on compute and storage infrastructure, data and energy resources, and their associated costs. A key measure of AI maturity is the definition and implementation of metrics to assess the efficiency of resource use in the creation of AI models.', 'Methodology', 'In December of 2023 and January of 2024, IDC conducted 24 in-depth interviews and 1,220 quantitative interviews by web survey with global decision makers involved in IT operations, data science, data engineering and software development related to AI initiatives. These interviews revealed in-depth information about the state of AI initiatives today including the array of challenges, numerous business benefits, and best practices that leading organizations have taken to achieve success.', 'In conducting this analysis IDC has developed an AI maturity model where organizations fall into one of four maturity levels based on their current approach to AI in terms of data and storage infrastructure, data policy and governance, resource efficiency focus, and stakeholder enablement and collaboration. These maturity levels are AI Emergents, AI Pioneers, AI Leaders, and AI Masters.', '*Source: IDC White Paper sponsored by NetApp, ""Scaling AI Initiatives Responsibly: The Critical Role of an Intelligent Data Infrastructure,"" Doc #US52048524, April 2024', 'Learn more at: https://www.netapp.com/pdf.html?item=/media/107000-wp-scaling-ai-initiatives.pdf', 'Join NetApp and a guest speaker from IDC on Wednesday, May 22 at 11am ET for the ""Scaling AI Initiatives Responsibly: The Critical Role of an Intelligent Data Infrastructure"" Webcast: https://www.netapp.com/forms/ai-thought-leadership-webinar/', 'About NetApp', 'NetApp is the intelligent data infrastructure company, combining unified data storage, integrated data services, and CloudOps solutions to turn a world of disruption into opportunity for every customer.

That is much better than the loss reported in the same period the previous year.', 'Further, Appian highlighted the fastest net retention rate growth which stood at an impressive 119%. This means the current customers increased their spending with Appian in the quarter. Set to report Q1 results on May 2, it is looking at a revenue of $149.8 million, higher than the consensus.

Based on 15 Wall Street analysts covering NetApp stock, three have a buy rating while 10 have a hold rating with an average price target of $103.', 'The stock has been on a rally since March, and strong quarterly results could\xa0give it a boost.

Given the widespread global presence of this maker of Oreo cookies, Cadbury chocolate and Trident gum, scrutinizing the trends in international revenues becomes imperative to assess its financial strength and future growth possibilities.', ""In the current global economy, which is more interconnected than ever, a company's success in penetrating international markets is crucial for its financial health and growth journey. Investors must understand a company's dependence on overseas markets, as this offers a window into the company's earnings stability, its ability to benefit from varied economic cycles and its potential for long-term growth."", 'International market involvement serves as insurance against economic downturns at home and enables engagement with economies that are growing more quickly. Still, this move toward diversification is not without its challenges, as it involves navigating through the fluctuations of currencies, geopolitical threats, and the distinctive nature of various markets.', ""While delving into MDLZ's performance for the past quarter, we observed some fascinating trends in the revenue from its foreign segments that are commonly modeled and observed by analysts on Wall Street."", ""For the quarter, the company's total revenue amounted to $9.29 billion, experiencing an increase of 1.4% year over year. Next, we'll explore the breakdown of MDLZ's international revenue to understand the importance of its overseas business operations."", ""A Closer Look at MDLZ's Revenue Streams Abroad"", 'AMEA generated $1.95 billion in revenues for the company in the last quarter, constituting 21.0% of the total. This represented a surprise of +1.62% compared to the $1.92 billion projected by Wall Street analysts. Comparatively, in the previous quarter, AMEA accounted for $1.74 billion (18.6%), and in the year-ago quarter, it contributed $1.94 billion (21.2%) to the total revenue.', 'Of the total revenue, $1.32 billion came from Latin America during the last fiscal quarter, accounting for 14.2%. This represented a surprise of +0.59% as analysts had expected the region to contribute $1.31 billion to the total revenue. In comparison, the region contributed $1.26 billion, or 13.6%, and $1.21 billion, or 13.2%, to total revenue in the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively.', ""Europe accounted for 36.3% of the company's total revenue during the quarter, translating to $3.37 billion. Revenues from this region represented a surprise of +3.1%, with Wall Street analysts collectively expecting $3.27 billion. When compared to the preceding quarter and the same quarter in the previous year, Europe contributed $3.54 billion (38%) and $3.31 billion (36.1%) to the total revenue, respectively."", 'Projected Revenues in Foreign Markets', 'Wall Street analysts expect Mondelez to report $8.53 billion in total revenue for the current fiscal quarter, indicating an increase of 0.3% from the year-ago quarter. AMEA, Latin America and Europe are expected to contribute 18.7% ($1.59 billion), 14.4% ($1.23 billion) and 35.3% ($3.01 billion) to the total revenue, respectively.', 'For the full year, a total revenue of $36.79 billion is expected for the company, reflecting an increase of 2.2% from the year before. The revenues from AMEA, Latin America and Europe are expected to make up 19.5%, 14% and 36.5% of this total, corresponding to $7.18 billion, $5.16 billion and $13.41 billion respectively.', 'Key Takeaways', ""Mondelez's leaning on foreign markets for its revenue stream presents a mix of chances and challenges. Therefore, a vigilant watch on its international revenue movements can greatly aid in projecting the company's future direction."", ""In an era of growing international interdependencies and escalating geopolitical disputes, Wall Street analysts are vigilant in tracking these trends for businesses with a global reach, in order to refine their predictions of earnings. It should be noted, however, that a multitude of other elements, such as a company's domestic position, also play a significant role in shaping the earnings forecasts."", ""Emphasizing a company's shifting earnings prospects is a key aspect of our approach at Zacks, especially since research has proven its substantial influence on a stock's price in the short run. This correlation is positively aligned, meaning that improved earnings projections tend to boost the stock's price."", ""Boasting a remarkable track record that's been externally verified, the Zacks Rank, our unique stock rating system, leverages changes in earnings projections to function as a reliable gauge for predicting short-term stock price movements."", ""At present, Mondelez holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

And management has no one to blame but itself.', 'Ulta Beauty already had investors down in the dumps in March. On March 14, the company reported completed financial results for its fiscal 2023. The stock slid as its guidance for 2024 came in behind expectations.', ""However, on April 3 at an investor conference, Ulta Beauty's management said that spend for cosmetic products was off to a slower start this year than expected. Therefore, the company's upcoming first-quarter results could be at the low end of its guidance, and investors were disappointed with guidance to begin with."", 'Ulta Beauty stock sold off hard after these comments and continued drifting lower for the rest of the month.', ""Investors disliked the commentary from Ulta Beauty's management so much that even shares of rival cosmetics companies including e.l.f. Beauty sold off. But management didn't predict the end of cosmetic spend altogether. It merely expressed that the year was off to a slower-than-expected start."", ""For fiscal 2024, Ulta Beauty had shared its belief that same-store sales would increase by just 4% to 5%. However, it sounds like it will be closer to 4% based on management's most recent comments. In my view, this is hardly an insurmountable headwind for the company, considering sales are still growing."", ""Additionally, Ulta Beauty's management had expected its operating-profit margin to go down from its 16% margin in fiscal 2023. However, it's still expecting an operating margin of about 14% in fiscal 2024, which remains strong compared to other retail businesses."", ""Therefore, I'd say that things aren't too bad for Ulta Beauty. But between the negative reaction to its earnings report and the conference commentary, Ulta Beauty stock is down 20% year to date and down 31% from its 2024 high."", ""From an earnings perspective, Ulta Beauty stock has only been cheaper one time in the past decade -- a brief moment during the worst of the stock market crash at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. That one-time anomaly aside, Ulta Beauty's price-to-earnings ratio of 15 is the cheapest valuation many investors have seen with this stock."", ""Ulta Beauty has a lot for investors to like, including a large retail footprint, a loyal customer base, and a history of profitable growth. The company should make it through this slower season just fine and continue many of the things that have driven its strong, past-stock performance. Therefore, I don't think this is something that investors need to overthink: Ulta Beauty is a good business, and the stock trades at a cheap price, which makes it a stock worth buying today after the market's overreaction in April."", 'Before you buy stock in Ulta Beauty, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Ulta Beauty wasn’t one of them.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their past performance during recessionary periods, and go directly to read 5 Best Recession Dividend Stocks To Buy.\xa0', 'Several financial analysts, previously forecasting a recession in the US at the end of 2022, have now turned optimistic about the market’s outlook. The US economy experienced growth at an annualized rate of 4% in the second half of the year, leading experts to maintain a positive outlook on the country’s economic prospects. In fact, data from the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) indicates that recessions have become increasingly less frequent in the US. From 1990 to 2023, the US economy endured 36 months of recession, with the most recent recession occurring in 2020 and lasting for only two months. Their analysis further suggested that recessions were more common as we go further back in time.', 'While the likelihood of a recession is uncertain at the moment, investors have consistently maintained their focus on dividend stocks whenever concerns about a recession arise. In addition to dividends, analysts also recommend investing in industries that are known for their resilience and stability to ensure prudent investment choices. For example, industries such as healthcare, utilities, consumer staples, and telecommunications are considered less vulnerable to economic shifts, making them reliable for navigating through a recession. According to a report by Business Insider, the consumer staples sector outperformed the market by 49% over a 25-year period ending in 2015. The report further mentioned that a significant portion of this outperformance was observed during recessionary periods.', 'Investors favor these industries because they not only offer dividends to shareholders but have also raised their payouts over the years. According to data collected from Janus Henderson, global healthcare dividends grew from $94.5 billion in 2017 to nearly $135 billion in 2023. Similarly, dividends from the energy sector also jumped from $104.6 billion in 2017 to $173.7 billion last year. Dividend stocks have shown strong performance during recessionary periods.', 'Following the major recession of 2008, investors became more mindful of their investment strategies and recognized that dividend stocks are a reliable approach for sailing through economic downturns. Nova Southeastern University conducted research and found that during both the recovery and recessionary phases of 2001 and 2008 recessions, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of some of the best dividend stocks that have grown their payouts for at least 25 years, showed significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500. In particular, during the recovery phase of the 2008 recession, the index outpaced the broader market by 0.01% daily or an annualized rate of 4.59%. Moreover, during the recessionary phase of 2008, the dividend aristocrats outperformed the S&P 500 by 0.06% daily or an annualized rate of 23.7%.', 'Some of the best dividend stocks to consider for a recession include The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

In this article, we will further discuss the best dividend stocks to buy for a recession.', 'Our Methodology:', ""For this article, we used Insider Monkey's database of 933 hedge funds as of Q4 2023 and identified dividend stocks from industries that are known to be recession-proof, such as healthcare, consumer staples, telecommunications, and utilities.

As reported by CNBC on April 30, home prices in February increased 6.4% year over year.

Regarding housing affordability, we have also discussed the least affordable metros for homebuyers in the US.', 'Monthly price appreciation has been reported in expensive West Coast metros where the inventory remains restricted and has not yet recovered since the pandemic.

These are the five US metros where homeowners are most subject to a mortgage rate lock-in effect, which is when existing homeowners feel reluctant to sell their homes since they will have to purchase at higher rates. Buyers tend to compete for fewer choices in such markets with limited supply. On the other hand, existing inventory has improved in the Southern metros thereby easing the rapid price appreciation. New construction has also added to the choices in these housing markets.

This $122 million increase was driven by higher revenues primarily due to updated interim rates to reflect increases in invested capital, increases in transmission billing units, higher customer consumption partially attributable to weather, new base rates implemented May 1, 2023 and customer growth, and the write-off of rate base disallowances recorded in the first quarter of 2023, partially offset by higher costs associated with increases in invested capital (primarily borrowing costs and depreciation) and higher operation and maintenance expense (primarily regulatory asset amortization and self-insurance reserve accrual recovery amounts in new base rates). Financial and operational results are provided in Tables A, B, C and D below.', '""We are proud to announce Oncor\'s solid financial performance in the first quarter of 2024. Our continued focus on operational excellence is evident in our strong safety and reliability metrics during the quarter,"" said Oncor CEO Allen Nye. ""Our team worked hard to prepare our System Resiliency Plan filing. This strategic initiative, with almost $3 billion in capital expenditures and over $500 million in operation and maintenance expense earmarked for critical investments in system hardening and modernization, cybersecurity, wildfire mitigation, and other investments designed to make the grid more secure, reliable, and resilient, reflects our commitment to fortifying our infrastructure for the future. Pending approval from the Public Utility Commission of Texas, we anticipate launching these investments in 2025, to be rolled out over three years. This plan is not just an investment in infrastructure; it\'s an investment in creating a more secure and more intelligent grid that is better able to withstand and more quickly recover from the wide range of threats impacting our customers.""', 'System Resiliency Plan (""SRP"") FiledYesterday, Oncor filed its first SRP for Public Utility Commission of Texas (""PUCT"") approval. Oncor\'s SRP (PUCT Docket No. 56545) requests approval of approximately $2.9 billion in capital investment and $520 million in operation and maintenance (""O&M"") expenses over a three-year period to enhance the resiliency of its transmission and distribution system. The three-year period will commence upon PUCT approval of the plan, but is anticipated to be for the years 2025 through 2027. The proposed SRP requests capital investment and O&M spend for the following key resiliency measures:', 'Overhead and Underground Resiliency and Modernization – Approximately $1.830 billion in proposed spend to modernize and harden legacy overhead system (poles, crossarms, lightning protection and capacity) and underground system with injection/replacement and switchgear automation;', 'Continued Optimization of Distribution Automation – Approximately $510 million in proposed spend to enable, expand and optimize distribution automation through new ties, capacity and intelligent switches;', 'Expanded Vegetation Management (""VM"") – Approximately $285 million in proposed spend to expand VM along laterals and leverage remote-sensing capabilities such as satellite and laser imaging, detection and ranging, commonly known as LiDAR;', ""Enhanced Cybersecurity Risk Mitigation – Approximately $525 million in proposed spend to enhance cybersecurity risk mitigation, enhance and secure Oncor's digital backbone infrastructure and other measures;"", 'Improved Physical Security – Approximately $80 million in proposed spend to improve physical security, including video and event correlation systems and asset protection; and', 'Enhanced Wildfire Mitigation – Oncor estimates that approximately $900 million of the total proposed spend under the SRP will enhance its wildfire mitigation efforts, consisting of $182 million in specific wildfire mitigation measures as well as the implementation of the overhead and underground resiliency and modernization and expanded distribution automation measures described above in areas at the highest risk for wildfires. The SRP offers Oncor an opportunity to advance and accelerate its wildfire mitigation strategies through additional investments in fire safe device deployment, advanced wildfire risk modeling, and strengthening, modernization and protection of assets in wildfire mitigation zones.', ""Oncor further believes these measures will provide a substantial reduction in outage minutes for customers, while also expanding and accelerating Oncor's efforts around wildfire risk mitigation, the security of the grid, vegetation management and the expanded deployment of smart grid technologies. These investments, if approved, are expected to enable Oncor's transmission and distribution system to better withstand and more quickly recover from the wide range of extreme weather conditions and other risks Oncor experiences across its diverse service area."", ""The statute provides that the PUCT will review and approve, modify or deny a filed plan within 180 days. Oncor cannot predict the outcome of the proceeding. To the extent Oncor's SRP is approved by the PUCT, Oncor intends to recover distribution-related costs through its interim distribution cost recovery factor adjustments, with the unrecovered distribution-related O&M expenses, depreciation expenses and return on the capital to be recognized as a regulatory asset."", ""The amount of capital expenditures ultimately approved as part of Oncor's SRP program, would be incremental to Oncor's $24.2 billion of planned capex for the five-year period 2024-2028 announced earlier this year."", ""Operational Highlights and GrowthThroughout its operations, reliability and safety remain a primary focus at Oncor. For the industry's primary benchmark for reliability, System Average Interruption Duration Index (non-storm), Oncor's customers continued to see a decrease in the average minutes of outage in the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the twelve months ended March 31, 2023. On the safety front, Oncor's Days Away, Restricted and Transferred Rate and Preventable Vehicle Accident Rate decreased 26% and 61%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to the first quarter of 2023."", ""Ongoing growth within Texas as a whole, and within Oncor's service territory, continues to be a driver of operational activity. Oncor increased its premise count by 18,000 in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to 17,000 in the first quarter of 2023, and at the end of April reached a milestone in exceeding four million premises. Additionally, Oncor placed approximately $161 million of transmission projects into service in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to placing approximately $94 million of transmission projects into service in the first quarter of 2023. The continued growth across Oncor's service territory resulted in the construction or upgrading of approximately 24 circuit miles of transmission lines and included 9 major substation projects and 3 major switching station projects, all being placed into service in the first quarter of 2024."", 'At March 31, 2024, Oncor had 781 active generation and large commercial and industrial (""LC&I"" and also known as retail) transmission point of interconnection (""POI"") requests in queue, representing a 20% increase as compared to March 31, 2023. Of the 482 active generation POI requests in queue at March 31, 2024, 46% are solar, 42% are storage, 9% are wind and 3% are gas. LC&I requests come from customers across a diverse group of industries, including many with electricity loads that represent the potential for hundreds of megawatts of new electric load, such as data centers. Of the 299 active LC&I transmission POI requests in Oncor\'s queue, more than 25% of the projects represent large load customers that in the aggregate represent over 40 gigawatts of potential load.', 'In order to address the increased growth in Texas, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. (""ERCOT"") recently announced new load forecasting and planning processes. Relying on House Bill 5066 passed in the 2023 Texas legislative session, ERCOT now includes prospective load identified by transmission service providers like Oncor. As part of the new planning processes, ERCOT announced last month that it is studying load growth that could result in a peak demand of approximately 152 gigawatts in 2030. Previously, ERCOT had projected a peak demand of approximately 111 gigawatts by 2029.', ""Oncor anticipates that approximately 40% of the 2030 load being studied by ERCOT is in Oncor's service territory. Oncor's current five-year capital plan of $24.2 billion (not including amounts approved in its SRP filings) was developed with the anticipation of some but not all of the capital investment that would be needed to support this growth. The number of generation and LC&I customers seeking interconnection has grown since the capital plan was developed."", 'As part of its annual renewal process, Oncor recently secured excess liability policies that maintain $300 million of coverage for wildfire for the period May 1, 2024 through May 1, 2025.', 'LiquidityAs of May 6, 2024, Oncor\'s available liquidity, consisting of cash on hand and available borrowing capacity under its existing credit facilities, commercial paper program and accounts receivable facility (""AR Facility""), totaled $2.1 billion. Oncor expects cash flows from operations combined with long-term debt issuances and borrowings under credit agreements as well as availability under its existing credit facilities, commercial paper program and AR Facility to be sufficient to fund current obligations, projected working capital requirements, maturities of long-term debt and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months.', ""Sempra Internet Broadcast TodaySempra (NYSE: SRE) (BMV: SRE) will broadcast a live discussion of its earnings results over the Internet today at 12 p.m. ET, which will include discussion of first quarter 2024 results and other information relating to Oncor.

That's a fine question, and the answer, according to theonlineinvestor.com is: $13,947 for the period from May 1, 2014, to May 1, 2024. If that's sounding pretty good to you, know that it really isn't. It reflects an average annual gain of about 3.4%, over a period when the S&P 500 index of 500 of America's biggest and best companies averaged roughly 11.4%. (The S&P 500 would have turned your $10,000 into $29,407!)"", 'If you had happened to reinvest your dividends from General Electric into more shares of General Electric, the picture gets better — a little: Your average annual gain would have been 4%, bringing your stake to a value of $14,793 after 10 years. (Of course, reinvesting dividends from an S&P 500 index fund would have got you an average annual gain of roughly 12.25%, totaling $31,817 after 10 years.)', ""You could have done wildly better in many other stocks, too. Recent superstar Nvidia, for example, averaged 69% annually over the period and would have turned your $10,000 into $1.9 million with dividends reinvested. Even a less mind-blowing stock, such as Lowe's, averaged 19% (without reinvesting dividends), turning $10,000 into $54,123."", ""A key takeaway here is that if you're ever not confident in whatever stock(s) you're holding or thinking of holding, consider just opting for a simple, low-fee index fund, as it can help you build wealth powerfully over the long run without having to pick individual stocks, some of which will inevitably be losers. And don't expect to run across performances such as Nvidia's recent past very often, either."", ""General Electric used to be a well-respected blue chip stock — it was actually one of the 12 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average when the index launched in 1896. It's telling that GE was dropped from the Dow Jones in 2018, as it had been struggling and shedding many of its divisions, such as finance, healthcare, and even light bulbs — retaining the aerospace operations.

This strategic move enhances cross-selling opportunities and customer retention, further solidifying its market position."", ""Dependence on Auto Insurance: Despite efforts to diversify, Progressive's core business remains heavily reliant on auto insurance, which exposes the company to industry-specific risks such as regulatory changes and market volatility. This concentration could impact financial stability if the auto insurance sector faces downturns."", ""Investment Income Volatility: The company's investment income, while substantial, is subject to market fluctuations. The net realized gains on securities show volatility, with gains of $155.6 million in Q1 2024 compared to $71.8 million in the prior year. This unpredictability could affect Progressive's overall earnings stability."", 'Competitive Pressure: The insurance industry is highly competitive, with numerous players vying for market share. Progressive must continuously innovate and offer competitive pricing to maintain its leadership, which could pressure profit margins.', 'Technological Advancements: Progressive has the opportunity to leverage technology to enhance customer experience and streamline operations. Investments in telematics, artificial intelligence, and data analytics can lead to more personalized services and efficient claims processing, driving customer satisfaction and operational excellence.', 'Market Expansion: The company can capitalize on emerging markets and demographic shifts by tailoring products to meet the needs of a diverse customer base. Expanding into international markets could also provide new growth avenues.', ""Partnerships and Acquisitions: Strategic partnerships and acquisitions offer pathways to accelerate growth, expand Progressive's footprint, and access new technologies. The company's strong financial position enables it to pursue such opportunities effectively."", ""Regulatory Changes: The insurance industry is subject to stringent regulations that can change unpredictably. New legislation or changes in existing laws could impose additional compliance costs or limit Progressive's business practices, impacting profitability."", ""Economic Downturns: Economic instability can lead to decreased demand for insurance products as consumers look to cut costs. Additionally, investment portfolio returns may suffer during economic downturns, affecting Progressive's financial performance."", 'Technological Disruptions: The rise of insurtech startups and technological innovations could disrupt traditional insurance models. Progressive must stay ahead of these trends to avoid losing market share to more agile competitors.', ""In conclusion, Progressive Corp (NYSE:PGR) exhibits a strong financial foundation and market presence, with significant growth in net premiums earned and net income. The company's strategic diversification and technological initiatives position it well to capitalize on future opportunities. However, it must navigate the challenges of market concentration, investment income volatility, and competitive pressures.

Up to 40% of people with IDD have co-occurring mental health conditions, and this critical funding will help address their unmet mental health needs.', 'Currently, only 1 in 10 children and adolescents with IDD and mental health disorders receive specialized services. Additionally, people with disabilities report 3 times more suicidal ideation compared to those without disabilities, and adults with disabilities are 3.5 times more likely to experience frequent mental distress. These statistics highlight the need for training and awareness to ensure providers and caregivers are equipped to support the mental health needs of people with disabilities.', '""People with intellectual and developmental disabilities face barriers from the moment they are born, which can have a direct impact on their mental health,"" said Katy Neas, CEO of The Arc of the United States. ""But too often, their mental health needs are going unmet due to stigma, lack of training, and biases. This generous investment by the United Health Foundation gives us a path to tackle this mental health crisis head-on by providing critical training to all who interact with our community — medical professionals, caregivers, first responders, educators, families, and more. Let’s work together to improve coordination of care, raise awareness, and ensure everyone’s mental health needs are supported.""', 'The partnership will deploy $100,000 in direct grants to 10 chapters of The Arc nationwide to build comprehensive local solutions tailored to people with IDD. This includes expanding access to quality mental health care services, improving coordination between disability and health systems, training over 2,000 providers and caregivers to recognize mental health needs in people with IDD, and launching public awareness campaigns to counteract stigma and misconceptions.', 'The 10 chapters receiving grants are: The Arc of Arizona, The Arc of Loudoun (VA), The Arc of Macomb County (MI), The Arc of Mississippi, The Arc of Oklahoma, The Arc of Oregon, The Arc Prince George’s County (MD), The Arc Rhode Island, St. Louis Arc (MO) and Sertoma Star Services (IL).', '""When we root ourselves in empathy and build alongside those with lived experiences, pretty powerful things begin to take shape,"" said Dan Schumacher, executive vice president, UnitedHealth Group, who also serves on the Board of Directors of the United Health Foundation and as the executive sponsor of UnitedHealth Group’s disability inclusion employee resource group. ""The United Health Foundation is committed to building strong partnerships and providing resources to address the needs of our communities. Together with The Arc, we’re excited to see the impact this work has on providers, caregivers and the people they serve.""', 'A key component of the grant is partnering with the National Council for Mental Wellbeing to adapt its evidence-based Mental Health First Aid program with information on IDD. The training teaches how to identify and respond to signs of mental illness and substance disorders. As the Council notes, ""Most of us would know how to help someone having a heart attack, but too few know how to respond if someone was having a panic attack or showing signs of substance abuse. Mental Health First Aid takes the fear out of starting these conversations.""', ""Over three years, the United Health Foundation grant will help train caregivers, health care professionals, first responders, educators and family members to recognize the mental health needs of people with IDD and decrease the number of mental health crisis incidents experienced by this population. The partnership will also provide mental health resources directly to people with IDD through the participating chapters to help them recognize and communicate their own needs. This is vital for individuals, and also families as research shows the mental well-being of parents of children with IDD is strongly influenced by the severity of their child's co-occurring mental health conditions."", 'About The Arc of the United States: The Arc advocates for and serves people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), including Down syndrome, autism, Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders, cerebral palsy, and other diagnoses. Founded in 1950 by parents who believed their children with IDD deserved more, The Arc is now a network of nearly 600 chapters across the country promoting and protecting the human rights of people with IDD and actively supporting their full inclusion and participation in the community throughout their lifetimes.

Trusts (“NAREIT”). NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains from sales of certain real estate assets, impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity, depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets and other specified items, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries. FFO and FFO per diluted share are non-GAAP financial measures used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a performance measure or cash flow as a liquidity measure. FFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition to FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions, we also disclose FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions, as adjusted.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Fastest Growing Cities in New York State.', 'As reported by the US Census Bureau, 42 US states and the District of Columbia experienced a rise in their populations in 2023 as compared to 31 states and the District of Columbia in 2022. While net international migration going back to pre-pandemic levels contributed to this trend, a decrease in net domestic outmigration for some states was another contributing factor. Based on numeric population growth, Texas, Florida, and North Carolina ranked as the top states. These numeric growths were recorded at 473,453 for Texas, 365,205 for Florida, and 139,526 for North Carolina in 2023.', 'An analysis of the metropolitan and the micropolitan statistical areas in the country indicated that population growth was witnessed in 73% of the 387 metro areas between 2022 and 2023. During the same period, the population increased in 58% of the U.S. micro areas. In terms of annual numeric growth, Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington and Houston-Pasadena-The Woodlands ranked at the top with their respective growths of 152,598 and 139,789. Some of the most prominent percentage gains in population were recorded in Florida metros, in Wildwood-The Villages by 4.7%, in Lakeland-Winter Haven by 3.8%, in Ocala by 3.4%, and in Port St. Lucie by 3.1%. Myrtle Beach-Conway-North Myrtle Beach also recorded a growth of 3.7% and ranked third among the fastest-growing US metro areas.', 'As reported by the NYC Department of City Planning, the population of New York City was estimated to be 8.26 million in July 2023. This represents a decrease of 546,000 since the April 1, 2020 Census and a decline of 78,000 since July 1, 2022. Therefore, population losses have been recorded in the state from 2020 to 2023.', 'On March 14, The New York Times reported that the aforementioned NYC population losses of 78,000 residents in 2023 and more than 126,000 residents in 2022 do not take into account the migrants and those living in shelters and dorms. Since the spring of 2022, the city welcomed 180,000 migrants. It has been projected that population growth in the city will resume in the years to come and has stabilized since the pandemic.', 'Net domestic migration tends to significantly impact population change. Net domestic migration in NYC has been negative which implies that more people tend to leave the city than move into the city. Large net domestic outflows following 2020 have also led to population losses in NYC. On November 21, 2023, The US Census Bureau reported that people who moved between the states increased from almost 7.9 million people in 2021 to nearly 8.2 million people in 2022. Movers left highly populated states for their neighboring states for example people moving from New York to New Jersey. New York and California were the two top states that had the highest share of people who moved out of them out of the total number of movers. Many New Yorkers migrated to cheaper states such as New Jersey where they could easily commute to work. Some of them resorted to a warmer state such as Florida.', 'Demographic data demonstrates that those struggling have been leaving the most. In 2023, 4 out of the 5 boroughs saw a decline in their populations. Affordability and housing issues tend to force lower- and middle-income residents to move out. This is evident from the fact that families earning between $32,000 and $65,000 left the city at the fastest rate in 2022. You can also take a look at the 16 best places to live in Upstate New York for families. The poorest borough, The Bronx, lost more than 25,000 residents while Brooklyn saw a loss of more than 28,000 residents. More than 26,000 left Queens as well. Commuter areas around New York City also recorded a loss in residents. On the other hand, the population grew in Manhattan, the richest borough, by nearly 3,000 residents in 2023.', 'A recent survey from The Citizens Budget Commission reveals that New Yorkers have rated the quality of life and quality of city services as low. Only 30% of New Yorkers rate the quality of life as excellent or good while one-third rate the quality of life as poor. The residents have also rated the city’s neighborhoods better. Simultaneously, just 24% rated the quality of government services as good or excellent as compared to 44% in 2017. Wealthier households with incomes over $200,000 were also found to be more satisfied with the quality of life in their neighborhoods.', 'Despite the population dynamics showing underprivileged people moving out of New York, the state has long been regarded as a dominant business and economic hub. The state is home to leading multinationals including PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ).', 'The multinational PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP) is headquartered in Harrison, New York. The company’s products are consumed more than one billion times daily in more than 200 countries and territories. PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP) was capable of generating more than $91 billion in net revenue in 2023. Simultaneously, PepsiCo Beverages North America (PBNA) made more than $27 billion in net revenue during the year. It offers more than 300 beverage choices and renowned brands such as Pepsi, Gatorade, bubbly, and Mountain Dew.', 'JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) is an American multinational finance company. The company operates as one of the largest employers in New York. While the firm contributes $29.8 billion annually to New York City’s economy, it plans to further commit to the city. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) reported the construction of its new state-of-the-art global headquarters in Midtown Manhattan. During the project building, more than 8,000 construction jobs will be created thereby driving additional economic activity of $3.6 billion for New York State. The project will serve as New York City’s largest all-electric tower and is set to be completed by the end of 2025.', 'Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) is a leading American telecommunications conglomerate with its official headquarters in New York City. The company has nearly 1,500 retail locations and serves in more than 150 countries. The firm offers 5G, 4G LTE, Fiber Optic, and Multi Edge Compute (MEC) services, with 99% of the US population covered by 4G LTE. The Consumer segment of Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) offers consumer-focused wireless and wireline communications services and products while the Business segment engages in the provision of wireless and wireline communications services and products for Enterprise and Public Sector as well as Business Markets.', 'Now that we have taken a look at the population trends and the respective businesses in New York, let’s move to the fastest-growing cities in the state.
