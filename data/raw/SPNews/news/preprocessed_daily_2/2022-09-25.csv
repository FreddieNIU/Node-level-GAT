Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Charles Schwab Charles Schwab Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Founder &amp; Co-Chairman, Charles Schwab, for US$19m worth of shares, at about US$69.43 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$70.89. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. We note that the biggest single sale was only 0.2% of Charles Schwab's holding.All up, insiders sold more shares in Charles Schwab than they bought, over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At Charles Schwab Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Charles Schwab. Specifically, Founder &amp; Co-Chairman Charles Schwab ditched US$34m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesDoes Charles Schwab Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Charles Schwab insiders own 6.2% of the company, currently worth about US$8.3b based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Charles Schwab Insiders?An insider sold Charles Schwab shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. But since Charles Schwab is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with Charles Schwab and understanding it should be part of your investment process.But note: Charles Schwab may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 68% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).And institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's share price fell by 8.2% last week. This set of investors may especially be concerned about the current loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 27% for shareholders. Often called “market makers”, institutions wield significant power in influencing the price dynamics of any stock. As a result, if the decline continues, institutional investors may be pressured to sell U.S. Bancorp which might hurt individual investors.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of U.S. Bancorp. Check out our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About U.S. Bancorp?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in U.S. Bancorp. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at U.S. Bancorp's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in U.S. Bancorp. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Berkshire Hathaway Inc. with 8.1% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.7% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 6.7% of the company stock.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of U.S. BancorpThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of U.S. Bancorp. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$115m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 24% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Public Company OwnershipPublic companies currently own 8.1% of U.S. Bancorp stock. It's hard to say for sure but this suggests they have entwined business interests. This might be a strategic stake, so it's worth watching this space for changes in ownership.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.Many find it useful to take an in depth look at how a company has performed in the past. You can access this detailed graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow.Ultimately the future is most important. You can access this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Unless they raised their allocation in cash, their losses in the portfolio are mounting.The war in Ukraine earlier this year increased energy costs in Europe. This raised the pace of inflation. Globally, most countries faced unprecedented inflation rates. In turn, central banks collectively raised interest rates. This dynamic is pressuring investors to seek safe havens.Central banks are fearful that their few tools to combat inflation will become ineffectual. The longer prices keep rising, the harder it is for banks to achieve price stability.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAs interest rates rise, investors are re-modeling the stock market’s fair value. Investments compete with risk-free cash. The higher this asset pays interest, the more stocks must compete for investor money.There are seven safe havens for investors looking to protect their gains.CFCF Industries Holdings$101.70CNQCanadian Natural Resources$51.69CVECenovus Energy$17.64JNJJohnson &amp; Johnson$163.28MMIMarcus &amp; Millichap$35.69NVSNovartis$77.54SQMSociedad Quimica Y Minera$103.61CF Industries Holdings (CF)Tractor spraying pesticides on soybean field with sprayerSource: ShutterstockCF Industries Holdings (NYSE:CF) traded as high as $119.59 before pulling back on August 25, 2022. Traders took profits instead of holding this agricultural fertilizer distributor.In the first half of 2022, CF reported net earnings of $2.05 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $3.60 billion. It bought back $590 million worth of shares or 6.6 million shares. Many European producers shut down nitrogen production in response to surging gas costs. Conversely, CF’s competitors face $2,000 in ammonia costs. Winter is fast approaching. This will tighten the world availability of its product.Europe’s unfavorably high production cost will help CF stock. The American firm will benefit as prices for its product rises substantially. For now, CF is not increasing Urea Ammonium Nitrate (“UAN”) to export more. Although it has record exports, it wants to focus on ammonia export.Story continuesCF Industries will monitor the demand and margin opportunities for UAN. By next year, a shortage in the product should boost the company’s profit margins, making it one of the safe havens for investors to buy into now.Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ)A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ).Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comCanadian Natural Resources (NYSE:CNQ) reported strong second-quarter results that enabled the firm to declare a CAD 1.50 special dividend. It executed well on operations in the year-to-date period. This increased CNR’s free cash flow generation.The company has top tier long life low decline assets. In addition, it has low maintenance capital requirements. It also has a low-cost structure. After management rewarded shareholders, new investors should consider this safe haven stock. Oil and natural gas demand will increase. Supply dynamics are favorable.President and Chief Executive Officer Timothy McKay said that the company benefited from a good premium to WTI crude oil. Oil supply cuts led to higher prices.Looking ahead, CNR expects its trans mountain unit in service. In addition, it has several projects on the thermal side. This will take one or two years to add to revenue meaningfully. Long-term investors should expect output to ramp up in the next few years. Still, it is one of the safe havens for investors with a long-range plan.Cenovus Energy (CVE)The website for Cenovus Energy (CVE) seen through a magnifying glass.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comCenovus Energy (NYSE:CVE) last posted second-quarter results in July 2022. It reported a GAAP EPS of CAD 1.19.Revenue was CAD 19.2 billion. The energy firm is a classic safe haven that generated strong cash from operating activities of nearly $3.0. It also posted free funds flow of $2.3 billion.Cenovus took advantage of the strong cash flow to cut its debt. It allocated around half of its excess free funds flow to pay down its debt and reward shareholders. In Q2, it increased shareholder returns by buying back more than $1 billion worth of shares.Cenovus locked in $500 million to $700 million over the next three years to invest in its upstream business. It already bought the hardware. As a result, it is not exposed to any inflation for that acquired equipment.Expect margins above its historical average. In the near term, CVE stock will move whenever WTI prices change.

First, it will split its consumer business to create a global consumer champion. This allows the company to focus on pharmaceuticals and medical technology. Not only will it spin off value to investors, but it will also reinvigorate the company’s focus on the core business.J&amp;J’s second priority is improving MedTech’s performance. The unit is the second largest company. The unit grew at 1.5% in 2017. By the first half of 2022, it grew at a 6% rate.The pharmaceutical business is the company’s third priority.

It balances capital returns to its business growth expansion through a capital allocation initiative. It plans to buy back up to $70 million in shares. This represents only around 5% of its market capitalization and around 12% of its available cash.Marcus &amp; Millichap runs a cash-generating business. It is prioritizing the return to shareholders before pursuing aggressive acquisitions. The company’s financing arm has become more competitive. It is executing on its private client business. Its strong positioning led to bigger deals. Investors should expect its partnerships to bear fruit in the coming quarters.The broker count continued to fall from its peak in early 2021.

The lawsuit accused the firm of paying kickbacks to doctors through bogus speaker programs. The plaintiff filed the lawsuit alleging an illegal promotion of its multiple sclerosis therapy Gilenya in 2013.Earlier this month, Novartis said it would invest $300 million in next-generation biotherapeutics. This would create a fully integrated environment for developing biologics. Biologics are more complex than other medications. Although they will likely take longer to develop and cost more, Novartis will realize higher profit margins from biologics.In the second quarter, the company posted revenue of $12.78 billion, down by 1.4% from the previous year. For 2022, it expects sales to grow in the mid-single digits. Its core operating income will grow in the mid-single digits, too.Sociedad Quimica Y Minera (SQM)Sociedad Quimica y Minera logo displayed on a mobile phone with the company's web page on it.

Investors expected more, which is unreasonable given the strong growth it demonstrated. The company will modify its contracts with customers in the coming weeks. The Head of Business Intelligence, Felipe Smith, said that the company will negotiate prices that align more closely to the market index price.The company will increase its capacity as it hikes production levels. Export-related costs will rise, as will the cost of inventory. Still, as prices rise dramatically, investors should expect improving profitability in the next few quarters. In addition, demand is 30% higher than last year. By 2025, Sociedad expects a demand of above one million metric tons.

However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Walmart has been doing relatively well. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. Check out our latest analysis for Walmart peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Walmart.How Is Walmart's Growth Trending?Walmart's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.Taking a look back first, we see that the company grew earnings per share by an impressive 41% last year. EPS has also lifted 15% in aggregate from three years ago, mostly thanks to the last 12 months of growth. So we can start by confirming that the company has actually done a good job of growing earnings over that time.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 14% per annum during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 9.6% per year growth forecast for the broader market.With this information, we can see why Walmart is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.The Bottom Line On Walmart's P/ETypically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.Story continuesAs we suspected, our examination of Walmart's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.Don't forget that there may be other risks.

Insiders buy with the expectation to see their investments rise in value over a period of time. However, recent losses have rendered their above investment worth US$757k which is not ideal.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Marsh &amp; McLennan CompaniesOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by insider Marc Oken for US$837k worth of shares, at about US$167 per share. That means that even when the share price was higher than US$151 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares. Generally speaking, it catches our eye when an insider has purchased shares at above current prices, as it suggests they believed the shares were worth buying, even at a higher price. Marc Oken was the only individual insider to buy during the last year.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider OwnershipMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies insiders own about US$183m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Insiders?The fact that there have been no Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. But insiders have shown more of an appetite for the stock, over the last year. It would be great to see more insider buying, but overall it seems like Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies insiders are reasonably well aligned (owning significant chunk of the company's shares) and optimistic for the future. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

All organisms, including humans, need water to stay alive. It is reported that water makes up about 70% of human body weight.Water and power are also critical in keeping the world’s economies growing and producing. But water is becoming increasingly scarce, and expensive. And power, especially in the form of coal- and petroleum-derived power, has escalated in price, and the supplies of oil, coal and gas have become increasingly uncertain.We are seeing historic droughts in California. And Nevada last year passed a law to conserve water because of the drought that was drying up the Colorado River.  So, the problem is both finding more water sources and being more ecologically friendly and sustainable with their available sources.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAnd this creates an opportunity for water stocks, especially, to perform well.Also, last year the Infrastructure Investment &amp; Jobs Act was passed, providing about $1.2 trillion for the nation’s infrastructure. In this bill, about $51 billion is earmarked for water-based uses, creating substantial financing for water stocks to grow their activities.Following is a list of some of the most promising water stocks and ecologically-friendly stocks that could do well and should be looked at as buy candidates.Water Stocks to Buy: Mueller Industries (MLI)Stacks of copper tubingSource: ShutterstockMueller Industries (NASDAQ:MLI) released its second-quarter 2022 earnings in July, reporting $3.65 per share, almost double its $1.92 in earnings in the same period last year.According to Marketbeat, MLI made $11.65 per share over the last year and is selling at a price/earnings ratio of 5.3 times. That’s low for a company that has good earnings increases, and it makes MLI one of the best water stocks to consider buying.Mueller makes products out of base metals such as copper and brass and has a climate business division. Most of the company’s business is in piping systems, making valves and fittings and other products. Its climate division works in water distribution, refrigeration, temperature control products and more.Story continuesThe company, through its piping systems, helps residential and commercial water flow systems, including drinking water in homes and oxygen lines in doctors’ offices.Pentair (PNR)A photo of small bubbles in a container of water.Source: khak/ShutterStock.comPentair (NYSE:PNR) announced its new Pentair Rocean Reservoir in April — a water filtration system that can sit on your kitchen counter.

Railyard Utility supplies water utility service in the Austin, Texas, metropolitan area. This acquisition adds about 345 customers to CWT and will add about 150 more when the surrounding community is completed.CWT supplies more than 2 million people with water and wastewater services. It operates in California, Hawaii, New Mexico, Texas, and Washington. CWT is the third largest water utility in the U.S. and the largest west of the Mississippi River.Three analysts at CNN Business have a 12-month mean target of CWT of $61, forecasting an increase of about 6% from its recent price. CWT could be bought now for exposure to water stocks, but short-term there doesn’t seem to be a compelling reason to buy. Investors should instead wait for a further pullback for an entry point.Water Stocks to Buy: Artesian Resources Corporation (ARTNA)A photo of a woman holding a glass of water.Source: Alina Kruk/Shutterstock.comAccording to analysts who are reporting to Yahoo Finance, Artesian Resources Corporation (NASDAQ:ARTNA) has good earnings growth in store. Last year ARTNA made $1.79 per share; this year the analysts are estimating the company will make $1.93 per share; next year the estimates are for the company to make $2.17 per share.That makes Artesian one of the top water stocks to buy for further growth.Artesian services customers in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Delaware, supplying water, wastewater removal and other services.In addition to residential customers, ARTNA sells water to commercial, industrial, government and other utility customers.

Zacks estimates that Global will grow 15% a year for the next three to five years; Zacks also estimates the company growing 25% in the current year. This would be an impressive performance, the company growing at this rate.Zacks also has a forward P/E ratio on the stock of about 64 times earnings, which is a high P/E, not leaving much room for earnings disappointments.The industry, as discussed, does have a bright future. Demand for services such as water, electricity and gas do serve a basic need, and sales and earnings are not usually as volatile as in other sectors.GWRS is down about 37% from its 52-week high and should appreciate over time. But investors must keep in mind that there is risk in this high-multiple stock, and make sure they can accept the risk before buying.Water Stocks to Buy: Xylem (XYL)xylem appSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comXylem (NYSE:XYL) claims that the water situation is worsening around the world, and writes that “by 2025, 1.8 billion people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity.” XYL is a water technology company working globally and claiming that its mission is to solve water problems through its expertise and technology applications.Xylem’s numbers are good: according to analysts reporting to Yahoo Finance, XYL made $2.49 a share last year and is estimated to make $2.61 a share this year and $3.15 a share next year.Yahoo Finance has its trailing price/earnings multiple at about 30x, which is high, giving the stock some downside risk, and showing that some of the upside earnings estimates have already been discounted in the market price. Still, for long-term holders, XYL gives good exposure to this sector and is one of the water stocks to consider buying.On the date of publication, Max Isaacman did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Editor’s note: This article is regularly updated with the latest information.Max Isaacman is an Investment Advisor Representative in San Francisco.

""Opening Nord Stream 2 = Prevention"", read another. Organizers expected some 5,000 protestors in the city of Lubmin, where the pipeline lands in Germany.In addition to supplying RWE, ADNOC has also agreed to sell ammonia to German companies, including Steag and Aurubis . It will also provide 250,000 tonnes of diesel a month to German firm Hoyer.Earlier on Sunday, the president of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, signed an agreement with Scholz that covers accelerating energy security and industrial growth.Separately, the UAE renewable energy company Masdar will explore wind energy development off the German coast.Scholz travelled to Qatar after his meetings in Abu Dhabi.

But I do believe that the bias is toward higher prices for energy as opposed to lower.”Furthermore, the current demand for certain U.S refined products has been high and a harsh winter could impact supplies.“Diesel and heating oil and jet fuel — those are the products to watch,” Kloza said.The sun sets behind an idle pump jack near Karnes City, USA, April 8, 2020.

The FTSE 100 company’s relationship with Russia had survived the annexation of Crimea in 2014 as well as the poisoning of the Skripals on British soil in 2018.But with Russia launching the largest armed conflict in Europe since the Second World War, then business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng left Looney in “no doubt” about the concern it was now causing in Whitehall.Looney knew he had to act. That Sunday, February 25, BP said it would exit the 19.75pc stake it had held in state oil giant Rosneft since 2013. It was the first among several major Western oil and gas companies to announce they would quit Russia in outrage over its violence, reversing a rush towards its vast fossil fuel reserves that had been seen after the fall of the Iron Curtain.Bernard Looney - Hollie Adams/BloombergYet seven months later, the exit is turning into a long goodbye. With Russia curbing asset sales, sanctions deterring bankers, and a diminishing pool of buyers willing to work with Russia, a clean break is hard to make.BP is yet to get rid of its stake in Rosneft and Norway’s state-owned Equinor is the only Western major producer to have fully quit the country so far. Oil executives are finding, not for the first time, that Vladimir Putin is adept at throwing obstacles in their path. Assets exited so far have often gone back to the Russian state.“Oil majors announced their departures to great fanfare, yet seven months later, little has changed,” says Louis Wilson, senior adviser at campaign group Global Witness, which has been working with Ukrainian officials. Companies will struggle to get rid of “toxic assets” which are “fuelling war crimes”, he adds.It wasn’t so long ago that oil and gas companies were scrambling to get into Russia, rather than out. The country is home to the world’s largest gas reserves and, as of the start of this year, was the third largest oil producer after Saudi Arabia and the US.Story continuesJohn Browne, BP’s chief executive between 1995 and 2007, kicked off BP’s entanglement in 1990, meeting a Russian deputy minister in Moscow months after McDonald’s opened its first restaurant there.“It was very clear after the fall of the Berlin Wall that something was happening and we needed to be part of it,” Browne, who was a senior executive at BP at the time of the meeting, told the Financial Times this year.His successor, Bob Dudley, was undeterred even after having to flee Russia in 2008 after falling out with oligarchs. He returned to clinch the deal in 2013 that secured BP’s 20pc stake in Rosneft, providing about a third of its oil and gas output.Russia Shell energy - AFPShell has had ties to Russia since 1912 after buying the Rothschild family’s interests there. More recently, its partnership with Russia’s state gas giant Gazprom has helped it access vast gas reserves in Russia’s far east.It, too, hung on even after having to cede control of the $22bn [£19bn] Sakhalin-2 gas facility to Russia in 2006 following months of Kremlin pressure.Shell’s boss, Ben van Beurden, met Putin in April 2014, shortly after Russia’s annexation of Crimea, to tell him they wanted to expand the project. Equinor, meanwhile, entered Russia in the 1990s and ten years ago struck a major exploration deal with Rosneft as the two Arctic powers forged closer ties.By the start of the war, foreign companies covered about 11pc of Russia’s oil and gas production, according to James Henderson, at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. BP, TotalEnergies, Wintershall Dea, Shell and India’s Oil and Natural Gas Corporation were the largest.Many hoped that the energy ties with Russia would help prevent tensions with the West due to mutual interest. That has proven a miscalculation.Severing those ties is not proving easy. Russia put a temporary ban on foreign investors selling assets at the start of the war and last month banned investors from countries which have supported sanctions from selling assets, including oil and gas production projects, until the end of the year.The decree came days after US oil giant Exxon Mobil said it was selling its stake in the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project in the far east to an unnamed buyer. Exxon has since taken steps towards suing Russia unless it allows the exit. The rules add to the problems finding buyers and advisers as Russia’s pariah status grows.“I think the climate couldn't be worse for getting out,” says one senior industry source. “It’s in the hands of geopolitics now.”Another says, “I suspect passing back to the Russian state is the only exit. I don’t see anyone buying Russian assets right now.”That is the route taken by Equinor, which in May transferred its main assets back to Russian state partner Rosneft. According to Reuters, Rosneft paid only one euro, although it waived Norway’s investment commitments valued at around $1bn.Equinor completed its exit in September by quitting the Kharyaga field, which it held with other partners. The company decided its involvement in Russia was “untenable” three days after the invasion, a spokesman says.“We immediately set up a project team to execute the exit,” he adds. “It was important to move very quickly. It was also valuable to have good relations over time with relevant authorities, to continuously ensure that we were transparent and  complied with all sanctions.”Halliburton, the US oilfield services giant, also got out, splitting off its Russian operations to a team of former Halliburton employees.Shell’s entanglement is more complex, though it has made big strides to break free. Van Beurden announced plans to exit in February, deploring the “senseless act of military aggression”.Talks with Indian and Chinese buyers for its stake in the Sakhalin-2 gas facility in the far east are believed to have taken place earlier this year. But Russia then seized full control of the project, forcing partners to request permission if they wanted to stay. Shell has declined, walking away.Moscow-listed Novatek has been touted as a possible replacement. Shell sold its 411 retail fuel stations in Russia to private Russian oil giant Lukoil, in May, with no value disclosed. It has quit the board of Salym, a joint oil development venture with Gazprom Neft, but is still working on options for its stake, with its shareholder rights curtailed by Russia. It has transferred another joint venture back to Gazprom Neft.Some have taken a more nuanced stance. TotalEnergies’ boss Patrick Pouyanne in March argued getting out would mean handing assets over to Russia. “For me it’s a question of accountability and the responsibility of the offshore stakeholders,” he said.Under pressure from critics, in March the company said it would ""gradually suspend its activities in Russia.""It has since sold its interest in the Kharyaga oil project to Russian state partner Zarubezhneft, and its 49pc interest in Siberian gas field operator Terneftegaz to Novatek on “economic terms” and with Russian state approval. As of August, it still has minority stakes in a number of non-state-owned Russian companies: Novatek, Yamal LNG, and Arctic LNG 2.BP’s efforts are less advanced than rival Shell. It has written down its Russian assets, taking a $25bn hit, and no longer recognises the Rosneft stake in its accounts.Its failure to divest so far, however, has been seized on by Russia, with Rosneft boss Igor Sechin highlighting BP’s entitlement to dividends and, in June, claiming its actions showed “a desire to remain an active participant”.The company says it “continue[s] to pursue” its exit from Russia. Looney has a long road ahead.]"

(NYSE:CRM) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Salesforce The MethodWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.33bUS$7.57bUS$9.31bUS$10.8bUS$11.9bUS$12.7bUS$13.3bUS$13.9bUS$14.4bUS$14.8bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x26Analyst x27Analyst x11Analyst x6Analyst x4Est @ 6.51%Est @ 5.14%Est @ 4.18%Est @ 3.51%Est @ 3.04% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.4% US$6.0kUS$6.7kUS$7.7kUS$8.5kUS$8.7kUS$8.7kUS$8.6kUS$8.5kUS$8.2kUS$8.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$80bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (1.9%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$15b× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (6.4%– 1.9%) = US$340bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$340b÷ ( 1 + 6.4%)10= US$183bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$263b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$147, the company appears quite good value at a 44% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Salesforce as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.047. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For Salesforce, we've put together three important elements you should further examine:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 4 warning signs  with Salesforce , and understanding these should be part of your investment process.Future Earnings: How does CRM's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

20,82198f66-5bf5-3aa7-80b7-75e8f2e3ed71,MRO,2022-09-25,7 Energy Stocks Primed for a Q3 Earnings Gusher,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-energy-stocks-primed-q3-101550786.html,1663841750,STORY,"['OXY', 'CVX', 'KMI', 'DVN', 'PXD', '^GSPC', 'XOM', 'MRO']","[It’s been a banner year for energy stocks. With oil prices cresting above $120 a barrel and continuing to trade in a range between $85 and $105, energy companies are reaping record profits and issuing incredible earnings.Many energy companies have announced net income that is up more than 3,000% from year-earlier levels. It all amounts to a windfall for an industry that was decimated during the pandemic when oil prices finished 2020 below $50 per barrel.The strong earnings have led to outperformance among energy stocks this year, with many share prices up 25%, 50%, even 100%. Oil stocks have been the lone bright spot in an otherwise dismal year for equities.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWhile some analysts continue to debate whether oil prices have peaked, the consensus view is that the earnings of oil companies will remain strong through the remainder of this year. With that in mind, here are seven energy stocks primed for a Q3 earnings gusher.XOMExxonMobil$90.95OXYOccidental Petroleum$62.68CVXChevron$155.01DVNDevon Energy$64.48PXDPioneer Natural Resources $228.00KMIKinder Morgan$17.52MROMarathon Oil$25.18ExxonMobil (XOM)A view of a well-lit Exxon Mobil gas station in Pasadena, CA during nighttime. representing exxon mobil stockSource: Michael Gordon / Shutterstock.comFor this year’s second quarter, ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) reported that its revenues rose 69% year-over-year to $111.99 billion.Net income earned in the April through June period amounted to a record $17.85 billion, a 281% increase from a year ago.Its Q2 earnings per share came in at $4.21, a 283% annualized growth rate. Given that oil prices remain around $85 a barrel, chances are good ExxonMobil can do it again when it reports earnings for the third quarter on Nov. 4.Owing to its strong financial performance and bullish outlook, XOM stock has been ripping higher this year, having gained 46% to reach $92.72 per share. ExxonMobil also pays a hefty quarterly dividend that yields 3.79%, for a payout of $0.88 a share.Story continuesThe company has also impressed investors with its plan to buy back $30 billion of its own stock this year and next. If all this weren’t enough, ExxonMobil is also cutting costs, planning to save $9 billion in annual expenses by 2023.As a result, the company has lowered its break-even oil price to $41 a barrel. So if oil prices remain above $80 per barrel for an extended time, it should lead to a continued windfall at ExxonMobil.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Occidental Petroleum website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comWarren Buffett has been buying Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) stock aggressively, spending $16 billion to acquire 26.8% of it.There continues to be speculation in the media that Buffett’s holding company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B), may eventually buy 100% of Occidental Petroleum. Buffett has secured regulatory approval to purchase up to 50% of OXY stock should he choose to do so.With oil prices elevated, OXY stock has been one of the energy stocks that is on fire this year, rising more than 100% since January. The stock has been one of the top performers in the S&amp;P 500 index year to date. OXY has also gotten a lift from strong earnings prints.For this year’s second quarter, Occidental Petroleum reported $10.68 billion in revenue, a 79% increase from a year earlier. The company’s net income came in at $3.76 billion, an incredible year-over-year increase of 3,546%.  Earnings per share of $3.47 were up an annualized 3,570%.No wonder the Oracle of Omaha loves this stock.Chevron (CVX)Chevron logo on blue sign in front of skyscraper buildingSource: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comChevron (NYSE:CVX) has also seen its earnings take off this year as oil prices hovered around $100 per barrel.The company reported that its second-quarter profit more than tripled from the same period in 2021, reaching $11.6 billion as its revenue grew to $65 billion, compared with $36 billion a year earlier.The Q2 results translated into earnings per share of $5.95, a 272% increase from a year ago. The stellar earnings enabled Chevron to hike its share repurchase program, announcing that it will buy back up to$15 billion of its own stock.Chevron’s strong earnings were driven by April through June sales numbers. For that period, a barrel of crude oil and natural gas liquids averaged $89, up 65% from a year ago.While CVX stock hasn’t enjoyed as big a run this year as OXY stock, it has managed to gain around 30%  since January.The stock’s price-to-earnings ratio of 10.38 makes it undervalued relative to its peers. Its 3.66% quarterly dividend yield also is enticing. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Chevron is the only other of the energy stocks that Warren Buffett has been buying this year.Devon Energy (DVN)The logo for Devon Energy (DVN) is displayed on a sign outside an office.Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comDevon Energy (NYSE:DVN) is another of the energy stocks that can be expected to gush cash at its next earnings release.In the second quarter, the company reported $5.58 billion in revenue, which was up 79% from a year ago. Its net income of $1.93 billion and earnings per share of $2.93 were each up more than 650% year over year, while its operating income of $2.56 billion rose an annualized 702%.The exceptionally strong print has helped DVN stock gain around 40% so far this year. With oil prices continuing to float above $85 a barrel, Devon Energy can be expected to again announce strong earnings for this year’s third quarter.In addition to the strong balance sheet, investors also like that Devon Energy pays one of the best quarterly dividends around, currently yielding 7.22%.However, Devon Energy’s stock actually has an annualized yield of more than 10% because it is a fixed-plus-variable dividend. This means that the base dividend is supplemented by a variable dividend payment of up to 50% of the company’s free cash flow.Currently, Devon Energy has one of the most lucrative dividends among companies listed on the S&amp;P 500 index. The company’s price-to-earnings ratio is a low 8.19.Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD)Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD) logo seen on a smartphone with a green and yellow backgroundSource: rafapress / ShutterstockPioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD) stock has gained 23% this year and currently trades at $230 a share. However, PXD stock is presently 20% below its 52-week high, presenting a “buy the dip” opportunity to savvy investors. It would certainly be smart to buy shares before the company’s Q3 earnings are announced. In the second quarter, Pioneer reported that its revenue rose 64% year-over-year to $7.01 billion. Net income of $2.37 billion was up 524% from the second quarter of 2021, and earnings per share of $9.31 were up an annualized 505%. Other reasons to be bullish on PXD stock heading into earnings include a P/E ratio of 9.54 and a hybrid dividend that yields 11.03%.The company is also the largest land owner in Texas’ oil-rich Permian Basin and has announced plans to buyback $1 billion of its own stock. Not too shabby.Over the past 12 months, Pioneer Resources’ stock has increased 55%, buoyed by strong oil and natural gas prices and equally strong financial results.Kinder Morgan (KMI)Kinder Morgan logo on a sign outside the company headquarters in Houston.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comKinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) is a bit different than the other names on this list in that it focuses on oil and gas pipelines.Today, 40% of U.S. natural gas volumes and 50% of all U.S. gas that is exported to foreign jurisdictions travels through Kinder Morgan’s network of 83,000 miles of pipelines and terminals.Business for Kinder Morgan has been gangbusters this year as would be expected. Consequently, KMI stock is up more than 8% over the past 12 months.For the second quarter that runs from April through June, Kinder Morgan reported revenues of $5.15 billion, an increase of 64% from the same time frame in 2021.The company’s net income totaled $635 million in Q2, a 184% year-over-year gain. Investors have responded positively to the numbers and its 6.22% quarterly dividend. In addition to the pipelines it operates, Kinder Morgan has announced plans to diversify and expand into renewable natural gas going forward.Marathon Oil (MRO)San Felipe Street 5555 outside address stand with Marathon Oil Tower tenants on February 2016 in Houston, United States.Source: Valentin Martynov/Shutterstock.comSo far this year, Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) stock is up nearly 50%. It pays only a 1.25% dividend, but its earnings have been expanding at a fast clip this year.In this year’s second quarter, Marathon Oil reported revenue of $2.18 billion, up 73% from a year earlier. However, the company’s net income posted a mind-boggling annualized growth of 5,938%. Equally impressive was Marathon’s earnings per share of $1.37, which was up 6,750% from Q2 2021. The company’s profit margin was 44%, which is up 3,390% year over year.While it might seem hard to imagine that Marathon Oil can replicate its earnings success in Q3, indications are that the company will again outperform expectations.Analysts at Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR) lifted their price target on MRO stock to $41.00 and issued an “overweight” rating on the shares. If Piper Sandler’s forecast proves to be accurate, it would represent a 64% increase in Marathon Oil’s share price in the coming 12 months.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

21,3742bfdc-07ea-3fcc-8dd5-a003b17964ce,MSI,2022-09-25,Motorola Solutions (NYSE:MSI) Is Reinvesting To Multiply In Value,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/motorola-solutions-nyse-msi-reinvesting-134425384.html,1664027065,STORY,['MSI'],"[Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics. Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Ergo, when we looked at the ROCE trends at Motorola Solutions (NYSE:MSI), we liked what we saw.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Motorola Solutions is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.23 = US$1.8b ÷ (US$12b - US$3.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2022).So, Motorola Solutions has an ROCE of 23%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Communications industry average of 8.7%. View our latest analysis for Motorola Solutions roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Motorola Solutions compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.The Trend Of ROCEIn terms of Motorola Solutions' history of ROCE, it's quite impressive. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 23% and the business has deployed 34% more capital into its operations. Returns like this are the envy of most businesses and given it has repeatedly reinvested at these rates, that's even better. You'll see this when looking at well operated businesses or favorable business models.What We Can Learn From Motorola Solutions' ROCEIn summary, we're delighted to see that Motorola Solutions has been compounding returns by reinvesting at consistently high rates of return, as these are common traits of a multi-bagger. And the stock has done incredibly well with a 192% return over the last five years, so long term investors are no doubt ecstatic with that result. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we still believe the stock deserves further research.Story continuesOn a final note, we've found   3 warning signs for Motorola Solutions  that we think you should be aware of.Motorola Solutions is not the only stock earning high returns.

The consensus estimated revenue numbers rose, with their view now clearly much more bullish on the company's business prospects.Following the upgrade, the latest consensus from Parker-Hannifin's five analysts is for revenues of US$18b in 2023, which would reflect a notable 12% improvement in sales compared to the last 12 months. Prior to the latest estimates, the analysts were forecasting revenues of US$16b in 2023. The consensus has definitely become more optimistic, showing a nice increase in revenue forecasts. Check out our latest analysis for Parker-Hannifin earnings-and-revenue-growthLooking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. The analysts are definitely expecting Parker-Hannifin's growth to accelerate, with the forecast 12% annualised growth to the end of 2023 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 2.8% per annum over the past five years. Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to grow their revenue 5.9% annually. It seems obvious that, while the growth outlook is brighter than the recent past, the analysts also expect Parker-Hannifin to grow faster than the wider industry.The Bottom LineThe highlight for us was that analysts increased their revenue forecasts for Parker-Hannifin this year. Analysts also expect revenues to grow faster than the wider market. Given that analysts appear to be expecting substantial improvement in the sales pipeline, now could be the right time to take another look at Parker-Hannifin.Looking to learn more?

However, investors might be overlooking a clear opportunity or potential setback if there is no rational basis for the P/E.Philip Morris International could be doing better as it's been growing earnings less than most other companies lately. One possibility is that the P/E is moderate because investors think this lacklustre earnings performance will turn around. If not, then existing shareholders may be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. Check out our latest analysis for Philip Morris International peKeen to find out how analysts think Philip Morris International's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Is There Some Growth For Philip Morris International?In order to justify its P/E ratio, Philip Morris International would need to produce growth that's similar to the market.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a decent 2.6% gain to the company's bottom line. The latest three year period has also seen a 16% overall rise in EPS, aided somewhat by its short-term performance. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been respectable for the company.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 3.5% per annum as estimated by the analysts watching the company. That's shaping up to be materially lower than the 9.6% each year growth forecast for the broader market.With this information, we find it interesting that Philip Morris International is trading at a fairly similar P/E to the market. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly limited growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. These shareholders may be setting themselves up for future disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.Story continuesThe Final WordTypically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.Our examination of Philip Morris International's analyst forecasts revealed that its inferior earnings outlook isn't impacting its P/E as much as we would have predicted. When we see a weak earnings outlook with slower than market growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the moderate P/E lower. This places shareholders' investments at risk and potential investors in danger of paying an unnecessary premium.Having said that, be aware  Philip Morris International is showing 1 warning sign in our investment analysis, you should know about.You might be able to find a better investment than Philip Morris International.

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Leggett &amp; Platt's current trading price of US$34.08 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Leggett &amp; Platt’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Leggett &amp; Platt Is Leggett &amp; Platt Still Cheap?Leggett &amp; Platt appears to be expensive according to my price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 11.64x is currently well-above the industry average of 6.34x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Given that Leggett &amp; Platt’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from Leggett &amp; Platt?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with a relatively muted profit growth of 8.7% expected over the next couple of years, growth doesn’t seem like a key driver for a buy decision for Leggett &amp; Platt, at least in the short term.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in LEG’s outlook, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe LEG should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on LEG for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive growth outlook may mean it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you'd like to know more about Leggett &amp; Platt as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

Shares were down more than 72% on the year as of May 11, but multiple analyst upgrades following the announcement of an ad-supported tier have renewed some optimism about the streaming giant's growth.""[Netflix] is the leading streaming service globally, but they've painted themselves into this premium price, premium product corner,"" Mark Mahaney, Evercore ISI managing director, told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""Offering a lower-priced ad-supported solution gets them out of that corner. That's the set-up on Netflix — a stock that's been hated but starting to turn — and I think this turn can go on for quite some time.""Mahaney, who recently upgraded the stock to Outperform and upped his price target to $300 a share, added that low expectations on the part of investors will help create further upside potential.The analyst surmised that 20% of churn users, or users who left the service, are likely to return to Netflix with the rollout of the cheaper, ad-supported option. That could translate to 10 million incremental subscriber additions and $1 billion to $2 billion in incremental revenue by 2024, Evercore ISI estimated.""We have seen, since the beginning of 2018, rising price sensitivity amongst Netflix customers, and we've seen declining satisfaction, at least in their most mature markets like the U.S.,"" Mahaney said, referencing recent company surveys.In addition to catering to more price-sensitive customers, competitors have been able to generate $5 to $10 in ad revenue per user, according to Mahaney, making the ad-supported tier a win-win scenario for a platform like Netflix.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Netflix is looking to charge advertisers roughly $65 for reaching 1,000 viewers (a measure known as CPM or ""cost per thousand""), WSJ previously reported. That charge is significantly higher than most other streaming competitors.Story continues""We got something that addresses the price sensitivity and is also positive for unit economics,"" Mahaney said, adding that the full upside potential is not thoroughly captured in the company's current valuation or Wall Street's estimates.Nevertheless, that doesn't mean the platform will return to growth.""This is not the go-go days for Netflix,"" Mahaney cautioned, adding the company ""won't be able to generate the kind of growth that they did so consistently over the years. But this stock can still nicely outperform from here.""Netflix ad-supported tier 'still in the early days'Netflix estimated that its ad-supported tier will reach 40 million viewers by the end of next year, according to a recent report from The Wall Street Journal, which added that executives at Netflix and advertising partner Microsoft (MSFT) met with ad buyers in recent weeks.""We are still in the early days of deciding how to launch a lower-priced, ad-supported tier and no decisions have been made,"" a Netflix spokesperson told Yahoo Finance at the time. ""So this is all just speculation at this point.""As competition intensifies in the streaming space and Wall Street looks beyond subscriber counts, platforms have grown more open to exploring various distribution and pricing models in order to diversify audiences and offset shrinking growth.A scene from Netflix's 'Bridgerton.' (Courtesy: Netflix)Netflix and Disney (DIS) are the latest platforms to hop on the ad-tier bandwagon. Disney aims to officially launch its ad option on Dec. 8.Netflix planned to roll out an ad-supported tier next year — and recently announced two senior hires as part of the effort — although new reports now say the company is moving up the launch to Nov. 1 in order to get ahead of Disney's December timeline.The ad-supported option will cost between $7 and $9 a month, according to Bloomberg, and the company plans to play four minutes of ads for every hour of content.Alexandra is a Senior Entertainment and Food Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

After the stock price dropped 5.2% last week, the company's market value declined by US$3.9b, but insiders were able to mitigate their losses.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.

We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$61.27.

A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. TJX Companies insiders own about US$122m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company).

(NYSE:M), might not be a large cap stock, but it received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$21.92 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$15.72. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Macy's' current trading price of US$15.72 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Macy's’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Macy's What Is Macy's Worth?Good news, investors! Macy's is still a bargain right now according to my price multiple model, which compares the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Macy's’s ratio of 2.76x is below its peer average of 11.62x, which indicates the stock is trading at a lower price compared to the Multiline Retail industry. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Macy's’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What does the future of Macy's look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Though in the case of Macy's, it is expected to deliver a highly negative earnings growth in the next few years, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. It appears that risk of future uncertainty is high, at least in the near term.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Although M is currently trading below the industry PE ratio, the adverse prospect of negative growth brings about some degree of risk. Consider whether you want to increase your portfolio exposure to M, or whether diversifying into another stock may be a better move for your total risk and return.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on M for a while, but hesitant on making the leap, I recommend you dig deeper into the stock. Given its current price multiple, now is a great time to make a decision. But keep in mind the risks that come with negative growth prospects in the future.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the elevated P/E.Recent times haven't been advantageous for General Dynamics as its earnings have been rising slower than most other companies. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this lacklustre earnings performance will improve markedly. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. View our latest analysis for General Dynamics peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on General Dynamics.Is There Enough Growth For General Dynamics?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as high as General Dynamics' is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market.Taking a look back first, we see that the company managed to grow earnings per share by a handy 3.4% last year. The solid recent performance means it was also able to grow EPS by 5.9% in total over the last three years. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been respectable for the company.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 11% per year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. With the market predicted to deliver 9.6% growth per year, the company is positioned for a comparable earnings result.With this information, we find it interesting that General Dynamics is trading at a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly average growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. Although, additional gains will be difficult to achieve as this level of earnings growth is likely to weigh down the share price eventually.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayTypically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.Our examination of General Dynamics' analyst forecasts revealed that its market-matching earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E as much as we would have predicted. When we see an average earnings outlook with market-like growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the high P/E lower. Unless these conditions improve, it's challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.It's always necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 2 warning signs with General Dynamics, and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates. So take a peek at this free list of companies with a strong growth track record, trading on a P/E below 20x. Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

But I do believe that the bias is toward higher prices for energy as opposed to lower.”Furthermore, the current demand for certain U.S refined products has been high and a harsh winter could impact supplies.“Diesel and heating oil and jet fuel — those are the products to watch,” Kloza said.The sun sets behind an idle pump jack near Karnes City, USA, April 8, 2020.

(NYSE:NEE) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 79% of the company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nextera-energy-inc-nyse-nee-130100021.html,1664024460,STORY,['NEE'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 79% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of NextEra Energy. Check out our latest analysis for NextEra Energy ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About NextEra Energy?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.NextEra Energy already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at NextEra Energy's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in NextEra Energy. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.4% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.4% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 5.7% of the company stock.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of NextEra EnergyThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of NextEra Energy, Inc.. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$274m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 21% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for NextEra Energy   you should know about.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

44,a7df6487-163e-3d35-8fdd-64462b599e81,MA,2022-09-25,Mastercard's (NYSE:MA) five-year total shareholder returns outpace the underlying earnings growth,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mastercards-nyse-ma-five-total-140216475.html,1664028136,STORY,['MA'],"[Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) shareholders have seen the share price descend 14% over the month. But in stark contrast, the returns over the last half decade have impressed. It's fair to say most would be happy with 108% the gain in that time. We think it's more important to dwell on the long term returns than the short term returns. The more important question is whether the stock is too cheap or too expensive today. While the long term returns are impressive, we do have some sympathy for those who bought more recently, given the 18% drop, in the last year.While this past week has detracted from the company's five-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment. Check out our latest analysis for Mastercard To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Mastercard managed to grow its earnings per share at 20% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 16% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Mastercard has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Mastercard, it has a TSR of 114% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's never nice to take a loss, Mastercard shareholders can take comfort that , including dividends,their trailing twelve month loss of 18% wasn't as bad as the market loss of around 22%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 16%, each year, over five years. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Mastercard that you should be aware of before investing here.If you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

Unless they raised their allocation in cash, their losses in the portfolio are mounting.The war in Ukraine earlier this year increased energy costs in Europe. This raised the pace of inflation. Globally, most countries faced unprecedented inflation rates. In turn, central banks collectively raised interest rates. This dynamic is pressuring investors to seek safe havens.Central banks are fearful that their few tools to combat inflation will become ineffectual. The longer prices keep rising, the harder it is for banks to achieve price stability.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAs interest rates rise, investors are re-modeling the stock market’s fair value. Investments compete with risk-free cash. The higher this asset pays interest, the more stocks must compete for investor money.There are seven safe havens for investors looking to protect their gains.CFCF Industries Holdings$101.70CNQCanadian Natural Resources$51.69CVECenovus Energy$17.64JNJJohnson &amp; Johnson$163.28MMIMarcus &amp; Millichap$35.69NVSNovartis$77.54SQMSociedad Quimica Y Minera$103.61CF Industries Holdings (CF)Tractor spraying pesticides on soybean field with sprayerSource: ShutterstockCF Industries Holdings (NYSE:CF) traded as high as $119.59 before pulling back on August 25, 2022. Traders took profits instead of holding this agricultural fertilizer distributor.In the first half of 2022, CF reported net earnings of $2.05 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $3.60 billion. It bought back $590 million worth of shares or 6.6 million shares. Many European producers shut down nitrogen production in response to surging gas costs. Conversely, CF’s competitors face $2,000 in ammonia costs. Winter is fast approaching. This will tighten the world availability of its product.Europe’s unfavorably high production cost will help CF stock. The American firm will benefit as prices for its product rises substantially. For now, CF is not increasing Urea Ammonium Nitrate (“UAN”) to export more. Although it has record exports, it wants to focus on ammonia export.Story continuesCF Industries will monitor the demand and margin opportunities for UAN. By next year, a shortage in the product should boost the company’s profit margins, making it one of the safe havens for investors to buy into now.Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ)A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ).Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comCanadian Natural Resources (NYSE:CNQ) reported strong second-quarter results that enabled the firm to declare a CAD 1.50 special dividend. It executed well on operations in the year-to-date period. This increased CNR’s free cash flow generation.The company has top tier long life low decline assets. In addition, it has low maintenance capital requirements. It also has a low-cost structure. After management rewarded shareholders, new investors should consider this safe haven stock. Oil and natural gas demand will increase. Supply dynamics are favorable.President and Chief Executive Officer Timothy McKay said that the company benefited from a good premium to WTI crude oil. Oil supply cuts led to higher prices.Looking ahead, CNR expects its trans mountain unit in service. In addition, it has several projects on the thermal side. This will take one or two years to add to revenue meaningfully. Long-term investors should expect output to ramp up in the next few years. Still, it is one of the safe havens for investors with a long-range plan.Cenovus Energy (CVE)The website for Cenovus Energy (CVE) seen through a magnifying glass.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comCenovus Energy (NYSE:CVE) last posted second-quarter results in July 2022. It reported a GAAP EPS of CAD 1.19.Revenue was CAD 19.2 billion. The energy firm is a classic safe haven that generated strong cash from operating activities of nearly $3.0. It also posted free funds flow of $2.3 billion.Cenovus took advantage of the strong cash flow to cut its debt. It allocated around half of its excess free funds flow to pay down its debt and reward shareholders. In Q2, it increased shareholder returns by buying back more than $1 billion worth of shares.Cenovus locked in $500 million to $700 million over the next three years to invest in its upstream business. It already bought the hardware. As a result, it is not exposed to any inflation for that acquired equipment.Expect margins above its historical average. In the near term, CVE stock will move whenever WTI prices change.

First, it will split its consumer business to create a global consumer champion. This allows the company to focus on pharmaceuticals and medical technology. Not only will it spin off value to investors, but it will also reinvigorate the company’s focus on the core business.J&amp;J’s second priority is improving MedTech’s performance. The unit is the second largest company. The unit grew at 1.5% in 2017. By the first half of 2022, it grew at a 6% rate.The pharmaceutical business is the company’s third priority.

The lawsuit accused the firm of paying kickbacks to doctors through bogus speaker programs. The plaintiff filed the lawsuit alleging an illegal promotion of its multiple sclerosis therapy Gilenya in 2013.Earlier this month, Novartis said it would invest $300 million in next-generation biotherapeutics. This would create a fully integrated environment for developing biologics. Biologics are more complex than other medications. Although they will likely take longer to develop and cost more, Novartis will realize higher profit margins from biologics.In the second quarter, the company posted revenue of $12.78 billion, down by 1.4% from the previous year. For 2022, it expects sales to grow in the mid-single digits. Its core operating income will grow in the mid-single digits, too.Sociedad Quimica Y Minera (SQM)Sociedad Quimica y Minera logo displayed on a mobile phone with the company's web page on it.

The Head of Business Intelligence, Felipe Smith, said that the company will negotiate prices that align more closely to the market index price.The company will increase its capacity as it hikes production levels. Export-related costs will rise, as will the cost of inventory. Still, as prices rise dramatically, investors should expect improving profitability in the next few quarters. In addition, demand is 30% higher than last year. By 2025, Sociedad expects a demand of above one million metric tons.

Facing what could be a brutal winter for much of the world, geopolitical tensions cynically facilitate upside catalysts for hydrocarbon-related companies.Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said it succinctly in a CNN interview. “This winter, the European Union will cease, for the most part, buying Russian oil, and in addition, they will ban the provision of services that enable Russia to ship oil by tanker,” Yellen stated. “It is possible that could cause a spike in oil prices.” If so, you need to watch oil stocks to buy now.Economically, oil prices feature a baseline of price inelasticity. True, prices do fluctuate based on underlying conditions like consumer sentiment. But base demand – the fuel needed to go to work for instance – remains largely inelastic.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSuch an overriding reality may drive increased demand later for the below oil stocks to buy.CVXChevron$154.98TTETotalEnergies$48.24BKRBaker Hughes$23.02WMBWilliams Companies$31.47OXYOccidental Petroleum$62.50CVECenovus Energy$17.87SUNSunoco$39Chevron (CVX)a Chevron gas stationSource: Trong Nguyen / Shutterstock.comLike any high-profile industry, picking which oil stocks to buy can be a confusing affair. While not as numerous as cryptocurrencies, several publicly traded hydrocarbon players exist. For those that want the broadest canvas available, investors may want to consider Chevron (NYSE:CVX).One of the big oil giants, Chevron features a vertically integrated structure. Put another way, the company owns business units that cover all areas of the oil and gas industry: upstream (exploration and production), midstream (storage and transportation) and downstream (refining and marketing).With geopolitical tensions running hot and no end in sight to conflict-related sanctions and countervailing penalties, CVX offers cynical upside. On a year-to-date basis through the Sept. 20 session, Chevron shares gained 31%.Story continuesFinancially, the company is absolutely killing it. In the second quarter of this year, Chevron generated $65.4 billion, up 81% from the year-ago period. Further, net income increased nearly four-fold to $11.6 billion. Fewer hydrocarbon outflows will likely push profitability higher, making CVX one of the oil stocks to buy.TotalEnergies (TTE)Logo on the sign of a TotalEnergies (TTE) gas station, new name of the French oil company TotalSource: HJBC / Shutterstock.comA French multinational energy firm, TotalEnergies (NYSE:TTE) may not get quite as much love as domestic oil stocks to buy. Nevertheless, if you’re serious about this sector, TotalEnergies presents a very attractive framework. Like Chevron above, TTE features an integrated business covering the entire energy ecosystem. This includes production and processing to distribution in various forms.But what really makes TTE stand out among other giant oil stocks to buy is that the company also serves electric vehicles. According to its website, TotalEnergies’ “goal is to operate more than 150,000 EV charge points across the [European] continent by 2025, thereby making mobility more sustainable and more widely accessible.”Therefore, whichever way the mobility industry goes – combustion or electric – TotalEnergies stands ready.Still, not many folks appreciate the potential upside opportunity in TTE. Shares are down nearly 3% YTD. This downtrodden performance seems to overlook the company’s Q2 2022 results, where it increased revenue by 69% and net income by 158%, both on a year-over-year basis.Baker Hughes (BKR)The Baker Hughes (BKR) sign and office building in Houston, Texas.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comAn industrial service company, Baker Hughes (NASDAQ:BKR) owns the distinction of running one of the world’s largest oilfield services firms. Baker Hughes provides the hydrocarbon industry with products and services for oil drilling, formation evaluation, completion, production and reservoir consulting.What investors of oil stocks to buy will likely gravitate to is the broad canvas. Rather than picking out an individual energy exploration and development firm – which carries higher failure risks – Baker Hughes represents an infrastructural play. Essentially, the company aligns with the Levi Strauss historical business model. Rather than mining for gold, Strauss sold jeans to miners, becoming incredibly successful in the process. It’s the same idea with Baker Hughes.To be fair, Gurufocus.com labels BKR as significantly overvalued. Against the oil and gas industry, Baker Hughes’ valuation metrics run rich. However, according to TipRanks, Baker Hughes enjoys significant bullish support from covering analysts. Among 14 experts, all but one rate it a buy.Williams Companies (WMB)The Williams Companies (WMB) logo displayed on a smartphone.Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.comWhen it comes to the topic of energy stocks to buy, Williams Companies (NYSE:WMB) presents somewhat of a cheating answer. Primarily, Williams specializes in the midstream component of the natural gas industry. According to its website, the company commands significant gas pipelines throughout the U.S. Given that our country could suffer from a brutally cold winter season as well, WMB certainly offers a relevant profile.However, WMB technically classifies as one of the oil stocks to buy because of its deepwater crude oil pipelines. As well, Williams owns production platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. Should energy prices rise higher (either due to geopolitical dynamics or weather-related phenomena), WMB stock should become a healthy beneficiary.According to Gurufocus.com, WMB represents a fairly valued investment. Generally, its price-per-profitability metrics ranks around the middle of the road compared to the target industry. However, TipRanks notes that Williams features very strong analyst support.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Occidental Petroleum website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comIf you believe in the market wisdom of Warren Buffett, you may want to consider adding Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) to your list of oil stocks to buy. In August, CNBC noted that the Oracle of Omaha – via conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, BRK-B) – received regulatory approval to purchase up to 50% of the oil firm.Frankly, people shouldn’t acquire OXY or any investment opportunity based on one person’s opinion. Yes, we’re talking about the Oracle, but even he is human. Still, Occidental presents an intriguing case from a financial perspective. In Q2 2022, the company generated revenue of $10.7 billion, up over 79% on a YOY basis. Further, Occidental posted net income of $3.75 billion in the most recently reported quarter, up more than 36-fold from Q2 2021’s result.Currently, Gurufocus.com rates OXY as modestly overvalued, presenting some risks for following Buffett in this investment. As well, analysts give OXY a moderate buy consensus rating, which is somewhat lukewarm. Still, the consensus target for OXY is $77.50, representing double-digit growth from here.Cenovus Energy (CVE)The website for Cenovus Energy (CVE) seen through a magnifying glass.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comOne of the more compelling names among oil stocks to buy, Cenovus Energy (NYSE:CVE) deserves serious consideration. With operations that cover the “full value chain to develop, transport, produce and market crude oil and natural gas in Canada and internationally,” Cenovus is the integrated energy giant you might not be so familiar with.Along with the advantages of a vertically integrated structure, CVE fundamentally benefits from geopolitical rumblings. With Russia flexing its muscle against the West and refusing to back down from its belligerence, a critical energy source is essentially offline indefinitely. However, this circumstance should help the U.S. and Canada become much more closely intertwined.Financially, Cenovus brings plenty to the table, generating revenue of $19.2 billion in Q2 2022. For net income, it posted $1.9 billion in the most recent quarter, up more than 10-fold against the year-ago level.Sunoco (SUN)Image of a Sunoco gas station in Orlando, FloridaSource: Alex Pesantes / ShutterstockFinally, those interested in oil stocks to buy tethered to the downstream component of the hydrocarbon industry should consider Sunoco (NYSE:SUN). Riskier than the other ideas mentioned on this list, SUN stock slipped 4% YTD. At the same time, Gurufocus.com labels Sunoco as significantly overvalued based on its proprietary valuation formula.Against traditional metrics, though, SUN isn’t that bad at all. For instance, the company’s price/earnings-to-growth ratio stands at 0.28 times, below the industry median of 1.03. Moreover, according to TipRanks, Sunoco enjoys a strong buy consensus rating among covering analysts. Among five Wall Street experts, every one of them pegs SUN as a buy. Notably, SUN features an average price target of $47, which represents a double-digit gain from the current price.Fundamentally, downstream businesses offer an attractive profile for investors. As mentioned near the top, the baseline demand for transportation-related fuel is inelastic. Should society continue to normalize from Covid-19 – such as a full return to the office – SUN can get very interesting.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

51,a6863a11-a307-35fa-9eb4-3ace09797785,CI,2022-09-25,Is Cigna Corporation's (NYSE:CI) Stock's Recent Performance A Reflection Of Its Financial Health?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cigna-corporations-nyse-ci-stocks-140027324.html,1664028027,STORY,['CI'],"[Cigna's (NYSE:CI) stock up by 4.8% over the past three months. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. In this article, we decided to focus on Cigna's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for Cigna How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Cigna is:12% = US$5.5b ÷ US$46b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.12 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Cigna's Earnings Growth And 12% ROETo begin with, Cigna seems to have a respectable ROE. Even so, when compared with the average industry ROE of 16%, we aren't very excited. However, we are pleased to see the impressive 24% net income growth reported by Cigna over the past five years. We reckon that there could be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently. However, not to forget, the company does have a decent ROE to begin with, just that it is lower than the industry average. So this certainly also provides some context to the high earnings growth seen by the company.Story continuesWe then compared Cigna's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 19% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Cigna is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Cigna Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Cigna's ' three-year median payout ratio is on the lower side at 0.3% implying that it is retaining a higher percentage (100%) of its profits. So it looks like Cigna is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth.Additionally, Cigna has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 16% over the next three years. However, Cigna's future ROE is expected to rise to 16% despite the expected increase in the company's payout ratio. We infer that there could be other factors that could be driving the anticipated growth in the company's ROE.SummaryIn total, we are pretty happy with Cigna's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business at a moderate rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Northrop Grumman Northrop Grumman Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe insider, David Perry, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.2m worth of shares at a price of US$394 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$479). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. It is worth noting that this sale was only 25% of David Perry's holding.Northrop Grumman insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Northrop Grumman insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$134m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Northrop Grumman Tell Us?The fact that there have been no Northrop Grumman insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Northrop Grumman insiders selling.

After the stock price dropped 8.0% last week, the company's market value declined by US$13b, but insiders were able to mitigate their losses.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Wells Fargo Wells Fargo Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, Kleber Santos, sold US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$44.44 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$40.41. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive). Kleber Santos was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Wells Fargo insiders own 0.07% of the company, currently worth about US$113m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Wells Fargo Tell Us?The fact that there have been no Wells Fargo insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us.

(NYSE:PFE) may be sending bullish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios greater than 14x and even P/E's higher than 27x are not unusual. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's limited.With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Pfizer has been doing relatively well. One possibility is that the P/E is low because investors think this strong earnings performance might be less impressive moving forward. If not, then existing shareholders have reason to be quite optimistic about the future direction of the share price. View our latest analysis for Pfizer peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Pfizer.Does Growth Match The Low P/E?In order to justify its P/E ratio, Pfizer would need to produce sluggish growth that's trailing the market.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 140%. Pleasingly, EPS has also lifted 138% in aggregate from three years ago, thanks to the last 12 months of growth. So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing earnings over that time.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should bring diminished returns, with earnings decreasing 14% each year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. With the market predicted to deliver 9.6% growth per annum, that's a disappointing outcome.In light of this, it's understandable that Pfizer's P/E would sit below the majority of other companies. Nonetheless, there's no guarantee the P/E has reached a floor yet with earnings going in reverse. Even just maintaining these prices could be difficult to achieve as the weak outlook is weighing down the shares.What We Can Learn From Pfizer's P/E?While the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.Story continuesWe've established that Pfizer maintains its low P/E on the weakness of its forecast for sliding earnings, as expected. Right now shareholders are accepting the low P/E as they concede future earnings probably won't provide any pleasant surprises. Unless these conditions improve, they will continue to form a barrier for the share price around these levels.You should always think about risks.

(NYSE:PNC) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 83% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).And institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's share price fell by 7.3% last week. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 20% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors. Also referred to as ""smart money"", institutions have a lot of sway over how a stock's price moves. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell PNC Financial Services Group, which might have negative implications on individual investors.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of PNC Financial Services Group, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for PNC Financial Services Group ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About PNC Financial Services Group?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that PNC Financial Services Group does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at PNC Financial Services Group's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in PNC Financial Services Group. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.1%. With 8.7% and 7.4% of the shares outstanding respectively, Capital Research and Management Company and BlackRock, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 15 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of PNC Financial Services GroupThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$214m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 16% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over PNC Financial Services Group. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for PNC Financial Services Group that you should be aware of before investing here.Ultimately the future is most important.

Historically, the market has an upward bias, but the market doesn’t announce when it hits a bottom.The Dow is seen as a barometer for the broader economy, and since every component of the index pays a dividend, owning one or more of the Dow stocks can help smooth out the current market volatility.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFurthermore, some of these Dow stocks to buy on the dip are beginning to reach more attractive valuations which means they will likely have significant upside when the market does reverse course.Apple (AAPL)Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shopSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comWhen many investors consider Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) it’s due to its iconic iPhone. Not only does the iPhone command a significant market share, but it also carries a loyal following.Apple continues to expand its ecosystem with devices like the Apple Watch. This fits the definition of stocks that investors should be considering. That is, companies that make products that will continue to be in high demand.A growing portion of its revenue, however, is coming from its Services business. In fact, this area of the business accounts for approximately $20 billion a quarter. In the trailing 12 months that means between 16% and 25% of the company’s revenue came from this division.The company recently announced it will be increasing the price for apps and in-app purchases on its App Store beginning in October for all of the eurozone plus several countries in South America and Asia.Microsoft (MSFT)The Microsoft (MSFT) logo on a corporate office building during the day time.Source: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the perennial Dow stocks to buy on the dip. And my overall thesis for Microsoft is similar to that of Apple. The pandemic showed that Microsoft has a role to play in many of the high growth areas of our economy – particular in the area of cloud computing. Anytime a company can say it’s a worthy competitor to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in any area it’s impressive. And as my colleague Bret Kenwell noted Azure has been a huge part of the company’s success.Story continuesThe company’s current P/E ratio of around 26x earnings puts the stock at a premium to the S&amp;P 500. However, as the saying goes, it’s not bragging if you can back it up. And the company is projected to show double digit growth in both revenue and earnings for the next five years.Plus, the company has a rather attractive dividend compared to others in its sector. A dividend mind you that it just increased for the 19th consecutive year.Chevron (CVX)Chevron logo on blue sign in front of skyscraper buildingSource: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comEnergy stocks have been one of the best-performing sectors in 2022, but Chevron (NYSE:CVX) is the only traditional energy company that makes the list of Dow stocks.The simple thesis for owning CVX stock is that oil prices aren’t likely to stay depressed forever. When the economy does turn around, demand for oil will lead the way. Yes, renewable energy is coming, but it’s not time to close the book on traditional fossil fuels…yet.Plus, like many traditional oil and gas companies, Chevron is making strategic investments in renewable energy although it’s fair to note that it is not investing directly in wind and solar at this time.In a recent Q&amp;A session with investors, Chevron CEO Mike Wirth expressed the sentiment that the dividend remains one of the company’s primary priorities. The company’s dividend is already one of the best in the entire market. It currently pays out $5.68 on an annual basis and has increased it for the last 35 consecutive years.Home Depot (HD)Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.comSimilar to Chevron, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is another stock to consider as a harbinger of better days.The housing market is slowing considerably and that is reflected in the HD stock price which is down 35% in 2022. However, lower demand doesn’t mean that demand is non-existent, and that is reflected in the company’s revenue and earnings which continue to grow on a year-over-year basis.That being said, the need for home improvement supplies doesn’t stop once individuals move into a new home. In fact, as hurricane season reaches its peak, it’s a good reminder that the company’s products will always be in demand.Plus, as Josh Enomoto reminds investors the heft of the company’s products has allowed it to hold off Amazon at least for now.HD stock currently trades at about 16x earnings which puts its valuation about right with the S&amp;P 500. And the company pays an attractive annual dividend of $7.60 per share which currently is about a 2.19% dividend yield.McDonald’s (MCD)Man holds out a McDonald's bag with the golden arches logo on it at a drive-thru window.Source: Gargantiopa / ShutterstockDuring the pandemic, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) showed why it’s important to pay attention to what consumers do more than what they say they’re going to do. Or in the case of McDonald’s what they say they won’t do. McDonald’s is frequently dismissed as a restaurant chain that consumers would never buy food from.Well as it turns out, the company known for its Golden Arches did brisk business during the pandemic.Although the company’s earnings growth is not expected to continue to remain at pandemic levels, it still is projecting high single-digit earnings growth in the next couple of years.JPMorgan Chase (JPM)Chase Bank logo and storefrontSource: Daryl L / Shutterstock.comBuying quality stocks is always important. However, in times like this, it’s especially important to make sure you’re buying best-in-class stocks. That’s a reason to buy JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). It’s easy to see why the banking giant makes the list of Dow stocks.The economy may be facing “storm clouds” if CEO Jamie Dimon is correct. But so far, it’s having little effect on the bank’s revenue and earnings which remain strong. In fact, Dimon remarked that the bank will be fine during a recession.JPM stock is down 26% for the year, but some analysts believe that much of the bad news has been priced into bank stocks. Investors will get their first glance at how well the bank is really doing when the company reports earnings in mid-October.Even if stock price growth remains sluggish, investors are currently getting an annualized dividend of $4.00 per share that has been increasing for 10 consecutive years.Visa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comVisa (NYSE:V) is the last of the Dow stocks to buy on this list. A troubling reality that many Americans are facing is using credit cards to manage their monthly budget.Visa makes a relatively small amount on those purchases, but that’s not to say it makes nothing. In fact, in the last four quarters, the company recorded $28 billion in revenue from the fees it charges. That was a gain of 24% over the trailing twelve months.That growth is likely coming from the consumer’s continued commitment to travel. There’s no telling how long that will last. Still if consumers are forced to rely on credit that would bode well for Visa. Plus, consumers continue to express a preference for paying with debit cards and credit cards instead of cash. That trend is unlikely to change which bodes well for V stock.On the date of publication, Chris Markoch had LONG positions in AAPL, CVX, and MCD.

MAR recently announced an agreement with Bain Capital Credit and Omnam Group to open its EDITION branded hotel in Lake Como, Italy. The company anticipates opening the property in 2025. Currently, the brand has 15 properties under operation.Located on the western shore of Lake Como, the luxury lifestyle hotel will likely comprise 145 luxurious guest rooms, including two penthouse suites. It will come with amenities like a lobby bar, a floating pool and multiple restaurants and bars.With reference to the opening, Josh Fluhr, senior vice president and managing director, EDITION Hotels, Marriott International, stated, ""We are excited to work with Bain Capital Credit and Omnam Group to introduce the EDITION Hotels brand to one of Italy's most beautiful destinations. Today's signing demonstrates guests continued demand for luxury accommodations and experiences.""More Focus on ExpansionMarriott is consistently trying to expand its presence worldwide and capitalize on the demand for hotels in international markets. The company plans to expand its global portfolio of luxury and lifestyle brands. At the end of second-quarter 2022, Marriott's development pipeline totaled nearly 2,942 hotels, with approximately 495,000 rooms. Nearly 203,300 rooms were under construction. During the quarter, the company added 97 new properties (16,917 rooms) to its worldwide lodging portfolio.In 2022, Marriott anticipates net room growth in the range of 3-3.5%. The hotel company is also trying to strengthen its presence outside the United States, especially in Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. The company’s European pipeline has grown consistently in the recent past and is expected to continue going forward.Price PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchComing to price performance, shares of Marriott have declined 1.1% in the past year compared with the industry’s 12.3% fall. The company benefited from robust leisure demand and business and cross-border travel improvements. During the second quarter of 2022, the company reported a strong RevPAR recovery in Europe. Also, group demand in the United States and Canada increased sharply during the quarter, leading to improved occupancies and strength in ADR. With global trends improving, the company expects the recovery momentum to continue in the future. Attributes such as pent-up demand for all types of travel, the shift of spending towards experiences versus goods, sustained high levels of employment, lifting of travel restrictions and opening borders (in most markets) are likely to aid the company in the upcoming periods. Meanwhile, earnings estimates for 2022 have increased in the past 30 days, depicting analysts’ optimism regarding the stock growth potential.Story continuesZacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderMarriott currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

69,bc849bcd-a6e0-3d0b-b7df-a34ccc967a62,MAR,2022-09-25,Low Volatility ETFs: Smooth Ride Amid Gyrating Markets?,ETF.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/low-volatility-etfs-smooth-ride-163000452.html,1663777800,STORY,"['IYK', 'SLY', 'XSLV', 'RHS', 'SPLV', 'RYU', 'XLU', 'SIXL']","[Volatility may be poised to rear its head with rising interest rates and disappointing economic data upsetting financial markets. The VIX—the Chicago Board of Exchange’s Volatility Index—is moving up after settling down in mid-August. Charles Schwab Corp. has said investors can expect volatility to persist, and a recent Barron’s column by Stephen Miran sees increased volatility as the new normal due to shifts in the global economy. How to ride this out? A wide range of low volatility exchange-traded funds may provide investors with answers, and smoother sailing. Some of them announce their low volatility in their names, such as the Invesco S&amp;P SmallCap Low Volatility ETF (XSLV), while others meet the low vol definition by virtue of the sector or industry they cover. Here we consider 10 U.S. equity funds with more than $50 million in assets under management that offer the highest exposures to the low volatility factor as determined by MSCI.Six of the ETFs are issued by Invesco and track indexes provided by S&amp;P Global. Invesco leaned into the smart beta trend years ago and launched a bevy of funds offering different low volatility angles on the U.S. market. There’s also a single actively managed ETF in the group. And two of the funds are equal-weighted sector ETFs. TickerFundInceptionAUMLow Vol FactorYTD PerformanceYTD FlowsXSLVInvesco S&amp;P SmallCap Low Volatility ETF2/15/2013$706.66M0.90-14.17%-$358.94MSIXLETC 6 Meridian Low Beta Equity Strategy ETF5/11/2020$142.52M0.89-10.01%$10.15MRHSInvesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Consumer Staples ETF11/1/2006$630.21M0.89-2.93%$187.75MSPLVInvesco S&amp;P 500 Low Volatility ETF5/5/2011$10.79B0.86-7.51%$2,692.35MRYUInvesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Utilities ETF11/1/2006$470.44M0.858.06%$224.30MLVHDLegg Mason Low Volatility High Dividend ETF12/29/2015$738.92M0.84-5.64%$12.24MXRLVInvesco S&amp;P 500 ex-Rate Sensitive Low Volatility ETF4/9/2015$53.26M0.84-8.53%$4.72MBIZDVanEck BDC Income ETF2/12/2013$542.10M0.84-5.71%$67.95MXMLVInvesco S&amp;P MidCap Low Volatility ETF2/15/2013$1.15B0.82-10.06%-$77.66MIYKiShares U.S. Consumer Staples ETF6/12/2000$1.55B0.82-3.05%$848.72MSource: ETF.com, data as of 9/16/2022Story continues The Low Vol LabelSix of the funds in the group have low volatility or low beta incorporated into their names. The fund with the highest exposure to the low vol factor is the $707 million XSLV, with a factor exposure of 0.90. The fund is down 14.17% year to –date, while its plain vanilla counterpart, the SPDR S&amp;P 600 Small Cap ETF (SLY), is down 17.54%. It should be noted that SLY has an exposure to the low volatility factor of -0.09. However, it should also be noted that XSLV has seen the most outflows of any of the funds in the group, losing nearly $360 million year to date.The ETC 6 Meridian Low Beta Equity Strategy ETF (SIXL) has the second highest exposure to the low vol factor, at 0.89, and is the only actively managed fund in the group. It focuses on companies offering the lowest beta (similar to volatility), while taking into account profitability, growth and ability to service debt. The fund is down 14.17% year to date, which is noticeably better than the 18.81% decline in the Vanguard Total Stock market ETF (VTI).The largest ETF in the group is the $10.8 billion Invesco S&amp;P 500 Low Volatility ETF (SPLV), which has a factor exposure of 0.86%. The fund is down just 7.51% year to date compared with the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) decline of 17.88%. SPLV includes the 100 lowest volatility stocks from the S&amp;P 500 Index. It has pulled in $2.7 billion so far this year, more than any other fund in the groupSector FundsThree sector funds offer the best performance among the 10 ETFs in the group. Two of them represent consumer staples, which is not surprising given the sector represents companies providing things consumers generally can’t do without, meaning demand is stable. The $630 million Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Consumer Staples ETF (RHS) ties with SIXL for the second highest factor exposure in the group, at 0.89. It also has a year-to-date return of -2.93%, making it the second best performer. The $1.6 billion iShares US Consumer Staples ETF (IYK) has a factor exposure of 0.82 and a year-to-date return of -3.05%. The fact that two of the funds in the top 10 for exposure to the low volatility factor are equally weighted suggests the weighting approach has a dampening effect on a fund’s volatility. The Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Utilities ETF (RYU) has a low vol factor exposure of 0.85. Meanwhile, its cap-weighted counterpart, the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU) has a factor exposure of 0.79.Like consumer staples, utilities is a fairly inflation- and recession-proof sector, as the companies therein offer services that consumers typically can’t do without. RYU has the best year-to-date performance among the group and is the only one in positive territory for the period, gaining 8.06%.Final ThoughtsWith so many economic and geopolitical uncertainties looming, low-volatility funds may see renewed attention. Although offering a smoother ride for investors generally means a little less upside when markets are on an upswing, investors these days may be more concerned about mitigating big downturns. The lowest volatility ETFs, however, may not be labeled as such. Investors may want to consider ways they can reduce volatility in their portfolio and be sure to look beyond the label. Contact Heather Bell at heather.bell@etf.comRecommended StoriesNot Much Love for Currency ETFsLooming Copper Crunch May Boost ETFs ETFs Add $23B in September Weekly ETF Inflows Total $15.8B Permalink | © Copyright 2022 ETF.com.

Robinson Worldwide (NASDAQ:CHRW) Will Multiply In Value,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shareholders-optimistic-c-h-robinson-133928018.html,1664026768,STORY,['CHRW'],"[Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics. In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. With that in mind, the ROCE of C.H. Robinson Worldwide (NASDAQ:CHRW) looks attractive right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on C.H. Robinson Worldwide is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.36 = US$1.4b ÷ (US$7.5b - US$3.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).Therefore, C.H. Robinson Worldwide has an ROCE of 36%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Logistics industry average of 14%. View our latest analysis for C.H. Robinson Worldwide roceIn the above chart we have measured C.H. Robinson Worldwide's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.So How Is C.H. Robinson Worldwide's ROCE Trending?In terms of C.H. Robinson Worldwide's history of ROCE, it's quite impressive. The company has consistently earned 36% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 83% in that time. With returns that high, it's great that the business can continually reinvest its money at such appealing rates of return. If C.H. Robinson Worldwide can keep this up, we'd be very optimistic about its future.Story continuesOn a side note, C.H. Robinson Worldwide's current liabilities are still rather high at 47% of total assets. This effectively means that suppliers (or short-term creditors) are funding a large portion of the business, so just be aware that this can introduce some elements of risk. Ideally we'd like to see this reduce as that would mean fewer obligations bearing risks.Our Take On C.H. Robinson Worldwide's ROCEIn summary, we're delighted to see that C.H. Robinson Worldwide has been compounding returns by reinvesting at consistently high rates of return, as these are common traits of a multi-bagger. And the stock has followed suit returning a meaningful 44% to shareholders over the last five years. So even though the stock might be more ""expensive"" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research.If you want to know some of the risks facing C.H. Robinson Worldwide we've found 5 warning signs (3 are significant!) that you should be aware of before investing here.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

Shares were down more than 72% on the year as of May 11, but multiple analyst upgrades following the announcement of an ad-supported tier have renewed some optimism about the streaming giant's growth.""[Netflix] is the leading streaming service globally, but they've painted themselves into this premium price, premium product corner,"" Mark Mahaney, Evercore ISI managing director, told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""Offering a lower-priced ad-supported solution gets them out of that corner. That's the set-up on Netflix — a stock that's been hated but starting to turn — and I think this turn can go on for quite some time.""Mahaney, who recently upgraded the stock to Outperform and upped his price target to $300 a share, added that low expectations on the part of investors will help create further upside potential.The analyst surmised that 20% of churn users, or users who left the service, are likely to return to Netflix with the rollout of the cheaper, ad-supported option. That could translate to 10 million incremental subscriber additions and $1 billion to $2 billion in incremental revenue by 2024, Evercore ISI estimated.""We have seen, since the beginning of 2018, rising price sensitivity amongst Netflix customers, and we've seen declining satisfaction, at least in their most mature markets like the U.S.,"" Mahaney said, referencing recent company surveys.In addition to catering to more price-sensitive customers, competitors have been able to generate $5 to $10 in ad revenue per user, according to Mahaney, making the ad-supported tier a win-win scenario for a platform like Netflix.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Netflix is looking to charge advertisers roughly $65 for reaching 1,000 viewers (a measure known as CPM or ""cost per thousand""), WSJ previously reported. That charge is significantly higher than most other streaming competitors.Story continues""We got something that addresses the price sensitivity and is also positive for unit economics,"" Mahaney said, adding that the full upside potential is not thoroughly captured in the company's current valuation or Wall Street's estimates.Nevertheless, that doesn't mean the platform will return to growth.""This is not the go-go days for Netflix,"" Mahaney cautioned, adding the company ""won't be able to generate the kind of growth that they did so consistently over the years. But this stock can still nicely outperform from here.""Netflix ad-supported tier 'still in the early days'Netflix estimated that its ad-supported tier will reach 40 million viewers by the end of next year, according to a recent report from The Wall Street Journal, which added that executives at Netflix and advertising partner Microsoft (MSFT) met with ad buyers in recent weeks.""We are still in the early days of deciding how to launch a lower-priced, ad-supported tier and no decisions have been made,"" a Netflix spokesperson told Yahoo Finance at the time. ""So this is all just speculation at this point.""As competition intensifies in the streaming space and Wall Street looks beyond subscriber counts, platforms have grown more open to exploring various distribution and pricing models in order to diversify audiences and offset shrinking growth.A scene from Netflix's 'Bridgerton.' (Courtesy: Netflix)Netflix and Disney (DIS) are the latest platforms to hop on the ad-tier bandwagon. Disney aims to officially launch its ad option on Dec. 8.Netflix planned to roll out an ad-supported tier next year — and recently announced two senior hires as part of the effort — although new reports now say the company is moving up the launch to Nov. 1 in order to get ahead of Disney's December timeline.The ad-supported option will cost between $7 and $9 a month, according to Bloomberg, and the company plans to play four minutes of ads for every hour of content.Alexandra is a Senior Entertainment and Food Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

78,da89352d-4116-3fa7-9b0a-2d902d3fc006,CL,2022-09-25,There Are Reasons To Feel Uneasy About Colgate-Palmolive's (NYSE:CL) Returns On Capital,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reasons-feel-uneasy-colgate-palmolives-120204162.html,1664107324,STORY,['CL'],"[To find a multi-bagger stock, what are the underlying trends we should look for in a business? Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So when we looked at Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL), they do have a high ROCE, but we weren't exactly elated from how returns are trending.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Colgate-Palmolive, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.32 = US$3.6b ÷ (US$16b - US$4.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).Therefore, Colgate-Palmolive has an ROCE of 32%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 14% earned by companies in a similar industry. Check out our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Colgate-Palmolive compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Colgate-Palmolive here  for free.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsWhen we looked at the ROCE trend at Colgate-Palmolive, we didn't gain much confidence. While it's comforting that the ROCE is high, five years ago it was 45%. However it looks like Colgate-Palmolive might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.Story continuesThe Bottom LineIn summary, Colgate-Palmolive is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. And investors may be recognizing these trends since the stock has only returned a total of 17% to shareholders over the last five years. As a result, if you're hunting for a multi-bagger, we think you'd have more luck elsewhere.On a separate note, we've found   2 warning signs for Colgate-Palmolive   you'll probably want to know about.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

80,82198f66-5bf5-3aa7-80b7-75e8f2e3ed71,DVN,2022-09-25,7 Energy Stocks Primed for a Q3 Earnings Gusher,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-energy-stocks-primed-q3-101550786.html,1663841750,STORY,"['OXY', 'CVX', 'KMI', 'DVN', 'PXD', '^GSPC', 'XOM', 'MRO']","[It’s been a banner year for energy stocks. With oil prices cresting above $120 a barrel and continuing to trade in a range between $85 and $105, energy companies are reaping record profits and issuing incredible earnings.Many energy companies have announced net income that is up more than 3,000% from year-earlier levels. It all amounts to a windfall for an industry that was decimated during the pandemic when oil prices finished 2020 below $50 per barrel.The strong earnings have led to outperformance among energy stocks this year, with many share prices up 25%, 50%, even 100%. Oil stocks have been the lone bright spot in an otherwise dismal year for equities.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWhile some analysts continue to debate whether oil prices have peaked, the consensus view is that the earnings of oil companies will remain strong through the remainder of this year. With that in mind, here are seven energy stocks primed for a Q3 earnings gusher.XOMExxonMobil$90.95OXYOccidental Petroleum$62.68CVXChevron$155.01DVNDevon Energy$64.48PXDPioneer Natural Resources $228.00KMIKinder Morgan$17.52MROMarathon Oil$25.18ExxonMobil (XOM)A view of a well-lit Exxon Mobil gas station in Pasadena, CA during nighttime. representing exxon mobil stockSource: Michael Gordon / Shutterstock.comFor this year’s second quarter, ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) reported that its revenues rose 69% year-over-year to $111.99 billion.Net income earned in the April through June period amounted to a record $17.85 billion, a 281% increase from a year ago.Its Q2 earnings per share came in at $4.21, a 283% annualized growth rate. Given that oil prices remain around $85 a barrel, chances are good ExxonMobil can do it again when it reports earnings for the third quarter on Nov. 4.Owing to its strong financial performance and bullish outlook, XOM stock has been ripping higher this year, having gained 46% to reach $92.72 per share. ExxonMobil also pays a hefty quarterly dividend that yields 3.79%, for a payout of $0.88 a share.Story continuesThe company has also impressed investors with its plan to buy back $30 billion of its own stock this year and next. If all this weren’t enough, ExxonMobil is also cutting costs, planning to save $9 billion in annual expenses by 2023.As a result, the company has lowered its break-even oil price to $41 a barrel. So if oil prices remain above $80 per barrel for an extended time, it should lead to a continued windfall at ExxonMobil.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Occidental Petroleum website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comWarren Buffett has been buying Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) stock aggressively, spending $16 billion to acquire 26.8% of it.There continues to be speculation in the media that Buffett’s holding company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B), may eventually buy 100% of Occidental Petroleum. Buffett has secured regulatory approval to purchase up to 50% of OXY stock should he choose to do so.With oil prices elevated, OXY stock has been one of the energy stocks that is on fire this year, rising more than 100% since January. The stock has been one of the top performers in the S&amp;P 500 index year to date. OXY has also gotten a lift from strong earnings prints.For this year’s second quarter, Occidental Petroleum reported $10.68 billion in revenue, a 79% increase from a year earlier. The company’s net income came in at $3.76 billion, an incredible year-over-year increase of 3,546%.  Earnings per share of $3.47 were up an annualized 3,570%.No wonder the Oracle of Omaha loves this stock.Chevron (CVX)Chevron logo on blue sign in front of skyscraper buildingSource: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comChevron (NYSE:CVX) has also seen its earnings take off this year as oil prices hovered around $100 per barrel.The company reported that its second-quarter profit more than tripled from the same period in 2021, reaching $11.6 billion as its revenue grew to $65 billion, compared with $36 billion a year earlier.The Q2 results translated into earnings per share of $5.95, a 272% increase from a year ago. The stellar earnings enabled Chevron to hike its share repurchase program, announcing that it will buy back up to$15 billion of its own stock.Chevron’s strong earnings were driven by April through June sales numbers. For that period, a barrel of crude oil and natural gas liquids averaged $89, up 65% from a year ago.While CVX stock hasn’t enjoyed as big a run this year as OXY stock, it has managed to gain around 30%  since January.The stock’s price-to-earnings ratio of 10.38 makes it undervalued relative to its peers. Its 3.66% quarterly dividend yield also is enticing. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Chevron is the only other of the energy stocks that Warren Buffett has been buying this year.Devon Energy (DVN)The logo for Devon Energy (DVN) is displayed on a sign outside an office.Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comDevon Energy (NYSE:DVN) is another of the energy stocks that can be expected to gush cash at its next earnings release.In the second quarter, the company reported $5.58 billion in revenue, which was up 79% from a year ago. Its net income of $1.93 billion and earnings per share of $2.93 were each up more than 650% year over year, while its operating income of $2.56 billion rose an annualized 702%.The exceptionally strong print has helped DVN stock gain around 40% so far this year. With oil prices continuing to float above $85 a barrel, Devon Energy can be expected to again announce strong earnings for this year’s third quarter.In addition to the strong balance sheet, investors also like that Devon Energy pays one of the best quarterly dividends around, currently yielding 7.22%.However, Devon Energy’s stock actually has an annualized yield of more than 10% because it is a fixed-plus-variable dividend. This means that the base dividend is supplemented by a variable dividend payment of up to 50% of the company’s free cash flow.Currently, Devon Energy has one of the most lucrative dividends among companies listed on the S&amp;P 500 index. The company’s price-to-earnings ratio is a low 8.19.Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD)Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD) logo seen on a smartphone with a green and yellow backgroundSource: rafapress / ShutterstockPioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD) stock has gained 23% this year and currently trades at $230 a share. However, PXD stock is presently 20% below its 52-week high, presenting a “buy the dip” opportunity to savvy investors. It would certainly be smart to buy shares before the company’s Q3 earnings are announced. In the second quarter, Pioneer reported that its revenue rose 64% year-over-year to $7.01 billion. Net income of $2.37 billion was up 524% from the second quarter of 2021, and earnings per share of $9.31 were up an annualized 505%. Other reasons to be bullish on PXD stock heading into earnings include a P/E ratio of 9.54 and a hybrid dividend that yields 11.03%.The company is also the largest land owner in Texas’ oil-rich Permian Basin and has announced plans to buyback $1 billion of its own stock. Not too shabby.Over the past 12 months, Pioneer Resources’ stock has increased 55%, buoyed by strong oil and natural gas prices and equally strong financial results.Kinder Morgan (KMI)Kinder Morgan logo on a sign outside the company headquarters in Houston.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comKinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) is a bit different than the other names on this list in that it focuses on oil and gas pipelines.Today, 40% of U.S. natural gas volumes and 50% of all U.S. gas that is exported to foreign jurisdictions travels through Kinder Morgan’s network of 83,000 miles of pipelines and terminals.Business for Kinder Morgan has been gangbusters this year as would be expected. Consequently, KMI stock is up more than 8% over the past 12 months.For the second quarter that runs from April through June, Kinder Morgan reported revenues of $5.15 billion, an increase of 64% from the same time frame in 2021.The company’s net income totaled $635 million in Q2, a 184% year-over-year gain. Investors have responded positively to the numbers and its 6.22% quarterly dividend. In addition to the pipelines it operates, Kinder Morgan has announced plans to diversify and expand into renewable natural gas going forward.Marathon Oil (MRO)San Felipe Street 5555 outside address stand with Marathon Oil Tower tenants on February 2016 in Houston, United States.Source: Valentin Martynov/Shutterstock.comSo far this year, Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) stock is up nearly 50%. It pays only a 1.25% dividend, but its earnings have been expanding at a fast clip this year.In this year’s second quarter, Marathon Oil reported revenue of $2.18 billion, up 73% from a year earlier. However, the company’s net income posted a mind-boggling annualized growth of 5,938%. Equally impressive was Marathon’s earnings per share of $1.37, which was up 6,750% from Q2 2021. The company’s profit margin was 44%, which is up 3,390% year over year.While it might seem hard to imagine that Marathon Oil can replicate its earnings success in Q3, indications are that the company will again outperform expectations.Analysts at Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR) lifted their price target on MRO stock to $41.00 and issued an “overweight” rating on the shares. If Piper Sandler’s forecast proves to be accurate, it would represent a 64% increase in Marathon Oil’s share price in the coming 12 months.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

82,3b230405-7359-33b0-8e10-e9ab2aa8e6d3,MCD,2022-09-25,7 Dow Stocks to Buy on the Dip or You’ll Be Kicking Yourself Later,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-dow-stocks-buy-dip-100018997.html,1663840818,STORY,"['CVX', 'AAPL', 'MCD', 'V', '^GSPC', 'MSFT', 'AMZN']","[This may be your best chance to find Dow stocks to buy on the dip, although that might not seem intuitive given the current market climate.Still, if you have a long time horizon and a reasonable risk outlook, this may be the time to not only stay in equities but to make opportunistic buys. Historically, the market has an upward bias, but the market doesn’t announce when it hits a bottom.The Dow is seen as a barometer for the broader economy, and since every component of the index pays a dividend, owning one or more of the Dow stocks can help smooth out the current market volatility.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFurthermore, some of these Dow stocks to buy on the dip are beginning to reach more attractive valuations which means they will likely have significant upside when the market does reverse course.Apple (AAPL)Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shopSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comWhen many investors consider Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) it’s due to its iconic iPhone. Not only does the iPhone command a significant market share, but it also carries a loyal following.Apple continues to expand its ecosystem with devices like the Apple Watch. This fits the definition of stocks that investors should be considering. That is, companies that make products that will continue to be in high demand.A growing portion of its revenue, however, is coming from its Services business. In fact, this area of the business accounts for approximately $20 billion a quarter. In the trailing 12 months that means between 16% and 25% of the company’s revenue came from this division.The company recently announced it will be increasing the price for apps and in-app purchases on its App Store beginning in October for all of the eurozone plus several countries in South America and Asia.Microsoft (MSFT)The Microsoft (MSFT) logo on a corporate office building during the day time.Source: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the perennial Dow stocks to buy on the dip. And my overall thesis for Microsoft is similar to that of Apple. The pandemic showed that Microsoft has a role to play in many of the high growth areas of our economy – particular in the area of cloud computing. Anytime a company can say it’s a worthy competitor to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in any area it’s impressive. And as my colleague Bret Kenwell noted Azure has been a huge part of the company’s success.Story continuesThe company’s current P/E ratio of around 26x earnings puts the stock at a premium to the S&amp;P 500. However, as the saying goes, it’s not bragging if you can back it up. And the company is projected to show double digit growth in both revenue and earnings for the next five years.Plus, the company has a rather attractive dividend compared to others in its sector. A dividend mind you that it just increased for the 19th consecutive year.Chevron (CVX)Chevron logo on blue sign in front of skyscraper buildingSource: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comEnergy stocks have been one of the best-performing sectors in 2022, but Chevron (NYSE:CVX) is the only traditional energy company that makes the list of Dow stocks.The simple thesis for owning CVX stock is that oil prices aren’t likely to stay depressed forever. When the economy does turn around, demand for oil will lead the way. Yes, renewable energy is coming, but it’s not time to close the book on traditional fossil fuels…yet.Plus, like many traditional oil and gas companies, Chevron is making strategic investments in renewable energy although it’s fair to note that it is not investing directly in wind and solar at this time.In a recent Q&amp;A session with investors, Chevron CEO Mike Wirth expressed the sentiment that the dividend remains one of the company’s primary priorities. The company’s dividend is already one of the best in the entire market. It currently pays out $5.68 on an annual basis and has increased it for the last 35 consecutive years.Home Depot (HD)Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.comSimilar to Chevron, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is another stock to consider as a harbinger of better days.The housing market is slowing considerably and that is reflected in the HD stock price which is down 35% in 2022. However, lower demand doesn’t mean that demand is non-existent, and that is reflected in the company’s revenue and earnings which continue to grow on a year-over-year basis.That being said, the need for home improvement supplies doesn’t stop once individuals move into a new home. In fact, as hurricane season reaches its peak, it’s a good reminder that the company’s products will always be in demand.Plus, as Josh Enomoto reminds investors the heft of the company’s products has allowed it to hold off Amazon at least for now.HD stock currently trades at about 16x earnings which puts its valuation about right with the S&amp;P 500. And the company pays an attractive annual dividend of $7.60 per share which currently is about a 2.19% dividend yield.McDonald’s (MCD)Man holds out a McDonald's bag with the golden arches logo on it at a drive-thru window.Source: Gargantiopa / ShutterstockDuring the pandemic, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) showed why it’s important to pay attention to what consumers do more than what they say they’re going to do. Or in the case of McDonald’s what they say they won’t do. McDonald’s is frequently dismissed as a restaurant chain that consumers would never buy food from.Well as it turns out, the company known for its Golden Arches did brisk business during the pandemic.Although the company’s earnings growth is not expected to continue to remain at pandemic levels, it still is projecting high single-digit earnings growth in the next couple of years.JPMorgan Chase (JPM)Chase Bank logo and storefrontSource: Daryl L / Shutterstock.comBuying quality stocks is always important. However, in times like this, it’s especially important to make sure you’re buying best-in-class stocks. That’s a reason to buy JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). It’s easy to see why the banking giant makes the list of Dow stocks.The economy may be facing “storm clouds” if CEO Jamie Dimon is correct. But so far, it’s having little effect on the bank’s revenue and earnings which remain strong. In fact, Dimon remarked that the bank will be fine during a recession.JPM stock is down 26% for the year, but some analysts believe that much of the bad news has been priced into bank stocks. Investors will get their first glance at how well the bank is really doing when the company reports earnings in mid-October.Even if stock price growth remains sluggish, investors are currently getting an annualized dividend of $4.00 per share that has been increasing for 10 consecutive years.Visa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comVisa (NYSE:V) is the last of the Dow stocks to buy on this list. A troubling reality that many Americans are facing is using credit cards to manage their monthly budget.Visa makes a relatively small amount on those purchases, but that’s not to say it makes nothing. In fact, in the last four quarters, the company recorded $28 billion in revenue from the fees it charges. That was a gain of 24% over the trailing twelve months.That growth is likely coming from the consumer’s continued commitment to travel. There’s no telling how long that will last. Still if consumers are forced to rely on credit that would bode well for Visa. Plus, consumers continue to express a preference for paying with debit cards and credit cards instead of cash. That trend is unlikely to change which bodes well for V stock.On the date of publication, Chris Markoch had LONG positions in AAPL, CVX, and MCD.

See our latest analysis for Prologis Prologis Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Co-Founder, Hamid Moghadam, sold US$46m worth of shares at a price of US$145 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$109. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.In total, Prologis insiders sold more than they bought over the last year.

While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Does Prologis Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Prologis insiders own about US$97m worth of shares. That equates to 0.1% of the company. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Prologis Insiders?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. Still, the insider transactions at Prologis in the last 12 months are not very heartening. But it's good to see that insiders own shares in the company. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Prologis. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 3 warning signs for Prologis (of which 2 make us uncomfortable!) you should know about.Story continuesOf course Prologis may not be the best stock to buy.

All organisms, including humans, need water to stay alive. It is reported that water makes up about 70% of human body weight.Water and power are also critical in keeping the world’s economies growing and producing. But water is becoming increasingly scarce, and expensive. And power, especially in the form of coal- and petroleum-derived power, has escalated in price, and the supplies of oil, coal and gas have become increasingly uncertain.We are seeing historic droughts in California. And Nevada last year passed a law to conserve water because of the drought that was drying up the Colorado River.  So, the problem is both finding more water sources and being more ecologically friendly and sustainable with their available sources.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAnd this creates an opportunity for water stocks, especially, to perform well.Also, last year the Infrastructure Investment &amp; Jobs Act was passed, providing about $1.2 trillion for the nation’s infrastructure. In this bill, about $51 billion is earmarked for water-based uses, creating substantial financing for water stocks to grow their activities.Following is a list of some of the most promising water stocks and ecologically-friendly stocks that could do well and should be looked at as buy candidates.Water Stocks to Buy: Mueller Industries (MLI)Stacks of copper tubingSource: ShutterstockMueller Industries (NASDAQ:MLI) released its second-quarter 2022 earnings in July, reporting $3.65 per share, almost double its $1.92 in earnings in the same period last year.According to Marketbeat, MLI made $11.65 per share over the last year and is selling at a price/earnings ratio of 5.3 times. That’s low for a company that has good earnings increases, and it makes MLI one of the best water stocks to consider buying.Mueller makes products out of base metals such as copper and brass and has a climate business division. Most of the company’s business is in piping systems, making valves and fittings and other products. Its climate division works in water distribution, refrigeration, temperature control products and more.Story continuesThe company, through its piping systems, helps residential and commercial water flow systems, including drinking water in homes and oxygen lines in doctors’ offices.Pentair (PNR)A photo of small bubbles in a container of water.Source: khak/ShutterStock.comPentair (NYSE:PNR) announced its new Pentair Rocean Reservoir in April — a water filtration system that can sit on your kitchen counter. The system is ” certified to reduce or remove 76 contaminants” without a lot of clutter. Pentair claims this will help address the problem of plastic water bottles while giving consumers cleaner water at home.Pentair claims that over the past 10 years “4 trillion plastic bottles have been consumed and disposed of, with over 1 billion plastic water bottles being sold of every day.”The company provides water products and services worldwide, including drinking water filters and systems, water softening products, commercial water management and filtration, and other products and services.PNR is expected to report its third-quarter 2022 earnings on Oct. 24 and the consensus of analysts reporting to TipRanks is for $0.94 in EPS, vs. last year’s 89 cents per share. PNR is one of the water stocks to keep a close eye on.Water Stocks to Buy: American States Water Company (AWR)A photo of water being poured into a glass that's sitting on a table.Source: HQuality/ShutterStock.comAmerican States Water Company (NYSE:AWR) is a broad-based water and electric service company, serving commercial and residential customers. AWR buys, distributes, and sells water throughout the U.S., including maintaining and constructing water facilities.American States Water serves over 1 million customers across nine states and has a water utility subsidiary that serves about 263,000 customers in 80 communities in parts of California. AWR also distributes water and offers wastewater collection on 11 military bases around the country.Stockanalysis reports that eight analysts have given AWR a consensus buy rating with an average 12-month forecast of $90.78, an increase of over 6%. The analysts also forecast earnings per share of $2.58 for this year, and an increase to $2.75 a share next year. AWR gives you exposure to one of the water stocks with further growth potential.California Service Water Group (CWT)a picture of Los Angeles, CaliforniaSource: ShutterstockCalifornia Service Water Group (NYSE:CWT) announced on June 22 that its subsidiary completed the acquisition of Railyard Utility’s wastewater system. Railyard Utility supplies water utility service in the Austin, Texas, metropolitan area. This acquisition adds about 345 customers to CWT and will add about 150 more when the surrounding community is completed.CWT supplies more than 2 million people with water and wastewater services. It operates in California, Hawaii, New Mexico, Texas, and Washington. CWT is the third largest water utility in the U.S. and the largest west of the Mississippi River.Three analysts at CNN Business have a 12-month mean target of CWT of $61, forecasting an increase of about 6% from its recent price. CWT could be bought now for exposure to water stocks, but short-term there doesn’t seem to be a compelling reason to buy. Investors should instead wait for a further pullback for an entry point.Water Stocks to Buy: Artesian Resources Corporation (ARTNA)A photo of a woman holding a glass of water.Source: Alina Kruk/Shutterstock.comAccording to analysts who are reporting to Yahoo Finance, Artesian Resources Corporation (NASDAQ:ARTNA) has good earnings growth in store. Last year ARTNA made $1.79 per share; this year the analysts are estimating the company will make $1.93 per share; next year the estimates are for the company to make $2.17 per share.That makes Artesian one of the top water stocks to buy for further growth.Artesian services customers in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Delaware, supplying water, wastewater removal and other services.In addition to residential customers, ARTNA sells water to commercial, industrial, government and other utility customers. It also offers design and construction services, and services water utilities.And when looking at companies with greener options, it is providing environmentally friendly wastewater solutions and alternative procedures that protect and conserve groundwater supplies.Global Water Resources (GWRS)a picture of waterSource: ShutterstockGlobal Water Resources (NASDAQ:GWRS) has a “strong buy” rating at Zacks Investment Research, showing their faith in the company. Zacks estimates that Global will grow 15% a year for the next three to five years; Zacks also estimates the company growing 25% in the current year. This would be an impressive performance, the company growing at this rate.Zacks also has a forward P/E ratio on the stock of about 64 times earnings, which is a high P/E, not leaving much room for earnings disappointments.The industry, as discussed, does have a bright future. Demand for services such as water, electricity and gas do serve a basic need, and sales and earnings are not usually as volatile as in other sectors.GWRS is down about 37% from its 52-week high and should appreciate over time. But investors must keep in mind that there is risk in this high-multiple stock, and make sure they can accept the risk before buying.Water Stocks to Buy: Xylem (XYL)xylem appSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comXylem (NYSE:XYL) claims that the water situation is worsening around the world, and writes that “by 2025, 1.8 billion people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity.” XYL is a water technology company working globally and claiming that its mission is to solve water problems through its expertise and technology applications.Xylem’s numbers are good: according to analysts reporting to Yahoo Finance, XYL made $2.49 a share last year and is estimated to make $2.61 a share this year and $3.15 a share next year.Yahoo Finance has its trailing price/earnings multiple at about 30x, which is high, giving the stock some downside risk, and showing that some of the upside earnings estimates have already been discounted in the market price. Still, for long-term holders, XYL gives good exposure to this sector and is one of the water stocks to consider buying.On the date of publication, Max Isaacman did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Editor’s note: This article is regularly updated with the latest information.Max Isaacman is an Investment Advisor Representative in San Francisco.

And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. To wit, the Vertex Pharmaceuticals share price has climbed 86% in five years, easily topping the market return of 40% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 54%.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. View our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Vertex Pharmaceuticals achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 64% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 13% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Vertex Pharmaceuticals has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Vertex Pharmaceuticals shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 54% over the last year. That's better than the annualised return of 13% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks, for example - Vertex Pharmaceuticals has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.Story continuesOf course Vertex Pharmaceuticals may not be the best stock to buy.

Insiders might have been better off holding onto their shares, given that the average selling price of US$144 is still below the current share price.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Sempra The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At SempraThe Senior VP, Peter Wall, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$370k worth of shares at a price of US$144 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$162). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. This single sale was just 27% of Peter Wall's stake. The only individual insider seller over the last year was Peter Wall.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year.

We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It appears that Sempra insiders own 0.02% of the company, worth about US$17m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Sempra Insiders?The fact that there have been no Sempra insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. We don't take much encouragement from the transactions by Sempra insiders. But it's good to see that insiders own shares in the company. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Progressive's  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for Progressive How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Progressive is:5.4% = US$852m ÷ US$16b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.05 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Progressive's Earnings Growth And 5.4% ROEWhen you first look at it, Progressive's ROE doesn't look that attractive. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 11% either. Although, we can see that Progressive saw a modest net income growth of 14% over the past five years. So, there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.As a next step, we compared Progressive's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 14% in the same period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is PGR worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether PGR is currently mispriced by the market.Is Progressive Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Progressive has a three-year median payout ratio of 49%, which implies that it retains the remaining 51% of its profits. This suggests that its dividend is well covered, and given the decent growth seen by the company, it looks like management is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.Additionally, Progressive has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 50%. Regardless, the future ROE for Progressive is predicted to rise to 22% despite there being not much change expected in its payout ratio.SummaryOverall, we feel that Progressive certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Even in spite of the low rate of return, the company has posted impressive earnings growth as a result of reinvesting heavily into its business. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. One great example is O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) which saw its share price drive 220% higher over five years.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. Check out our latest analysis for O'Reilly Automotive To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, O'Reilly Automotive managed to grow its earnings per share at 24% a year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 26% per year. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months.

(NASDAQ:PEP) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for PepsiCo PepsiCo Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Vice Chairman, Hugh Johnston, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$6.0m worth of shares at a price of US$161 each. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$169, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price.

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Union Pacific's current trading price of US$204 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Union Pacific’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for Union Pacific What's The Opportunity In Union Pacific?Good news, investors! Union Pacific is still a bargain right now. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $309.09, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. However, given that Union Pacific’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from Union Pacific?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 25% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Union Pacific. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since UNP is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on UNP for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy UNP. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed buy.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.
