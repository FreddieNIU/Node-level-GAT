If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Goldman Sachs Semiconductor Stocks: Top 5 Picks. As per Washington-based Semiconductor Industry Association, global semiconductor sales dropped 3% in September compared to last year, and Korean chipmakers produced 3.5% less than a year earlier in September. The Korean economy, which is highly dependent on the semiconductor industry, experienced low demand given weakening currencies, high trade deficits, and tightening interest rates around the world. Meanwhile, the Biden administration is trying to boost investments in US chipmaking, in order to compete with China and to manufacture components essential for national security. The US effort increased after the semiconductor industry faced massive shortages in late 2020 and 2021, which revealed how essential chips were in the digital economy, for the production of everything from cars to smartphones. The most recent effort to help establish the US semiconductor industry is the CHIPS Act, which lent $39 billion in government funding for the local semiconductor manufacturing plants, in addition to billions of dollars for research and development initiatives.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is planning to construct a second US plant next to a $12 billion complex it is already building, which will advance American efforts to support local chipmaking. To benefit from the ongoing semiconductor initiatives amid lower competition from Korean and Chinese manufacturers, some of the best semiconductor stocks to consider according to investment firm Goldman Sachs are Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM). Our Methodology We selected the top 10 semiconductor stocks from the Goldman Sachs portfolio as of the end of the second quarter of 2022 for this analysis. Insider Monkey’s database of 895 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2022 was used to assess the hedge fund sentiment around the securities. Story continuesGoldman Sachs Semiconductor Stocks: Top 10 PicksPhoto by Redd on UnsplashGoldman Sachs Semiconductor Stocks: Top Picks10. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65Goldman Sachs’ Stake Value: $535,779,000Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is a California-based multinational technology corporation that operates in the semiconductors, computer hardware, autonomous cars, automation, and artificial intelligence sectors. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is one of the elite Goldman Sachs semiconductor stocks to monitor, with the firm holding 14.3 million shares worth nearly $536 million, representing 0.12% of the total securities. On October 31, Citi analyst Christopher Danely maintained a Neutral rating on Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) but lowered the price target on the shares to $27 from $30. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) posted mixed results and guided well below consensus due to the PC downturn, the analyst told investors. The company also disclosed a cost control plan, ""which should help but doesn't help the core problems of manufacturing and wasting money on growth markets that will never pan out,"" added the analyst.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 65 hedge funds were long Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) at the end of June 2022, compared to 76 funds in the last quarter. David Blood and Al Gore’s Generation Investment Management held the largest stake in the company, comprising 14.7 million shares worth $552.5 million. Like Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is one of the favorite semiconductor picks of elite hedge funds. Here is what Baron Funds specifically said about Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Then, there is the case of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). A blue-chip tech champion with a market capitalization of over $500 billion in early 2000, the stock was trading at a P/E multiple of 42. It was a fast-growing company whose stock price and multiple declined more or less in line with its peers. However, unlike Google, Intel’s net income has grown from $7.3 billion in 1999 to $19.9 billion in 2021, a compounded annual growth rate of just 4.7%. Its growth from the dot com era has not proven to be durable, and Intel has yet to trade at the price it attained in 1999.”9. Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63Goldman Sachs’ Stake Value: $569,242,000Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) is a Delaware-based company that designs, develops, and sells analog, mixed-signal, digital signal processing, embedded, and standalone integrated circuits. In Q2 2022, Goldman Sachs owned more than 13 million shares of Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) worth $569.2 million, representing 0.12% of the total portfolio. On October 18, Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore maintained a Buy recommendation on Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) but lowered the price target on the shares to $55 from $65. Fears of fundamental deterioration are ""leading to very bearish investor positioning"" into the Q3 results for semiconductors, the analyst told investors in a research note. According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 63 hedge funds were long Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL), with combined stakes worth $1.6 billion, compared to 63 funds in the prior quarter worth $2.4 billion. Paul Marshall and Ian Wace’s Marshall Wace LLP is the biggest position holder in the company, with approximately 5 million shares worth $214 million. Here is what Carillon Tower Advisers specifically said about Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) provides infrastructure semiconductor solutions. Investors have recently become concerned about the semiconductor cycle and how demand for Marvell’s products will fare in a slowing economic environment. We remain confident that the company’s portfolio of products is extremely important in parts of the datacenter server market, which remains healthy and possesses long-term secular trends. The company also has secured strong contract wins in upcoming global 5G wireless infrastructure build-outs, which are generally insulated from macroeconomic pressures. With supply chain issues easing, we believe Marvell remains in a strong position to post continued robust growth.”8. QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71Goldman Sachs’ Stake Value: $663,132,000QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a California-based company focused on the development and commercialization of foundational technologies for the wireless industry worldwide. QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is one of the most prominent Goldman Sachs semiconductor stocks to invest in. The firm owned 5.19 million shares of QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) in Q2 2022, worth $663 million and representing 0.14% of the total portfolio. On October 14, QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.75 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is distributable on December 15, to shareholders of record on December 1.

The analyst noted that QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) reported in-line Q4 results and ""shockingly bad"" Q1 guidance. According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 71 hedge funds were bullish on QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), compared to 73 funds in the last quarter. Alkeon Capital Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 4.2 million shares worth $541.15 million. In its Q4 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Market strength continued in the fourth quarter, with only the communication services sector down in the Russell 1000 Value Index. Portfolio returns benefited from the strong performance of semiconductor maker QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), which has executed exceptionally well in pursuing the transition to 5G, growing both content and share due to its leadership position in cellular technology. The chipmaker recently outlined a number of peripheral growth opportunities outside of mobile markets, including automotive (where it hopes to leverage its strong presence in the automotive infotainment space into advanced driver assistance systems), Internet of Things (including opportunities in the PC market, VR/AR market, and factory automation) and radio frequency (where mmWave adoption globally, including China, would drive substantial upside).”7. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Goldman Sachs’ Stake Value: $791,115,000Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is headquartered in San Jose, California, and the company designs, develops, and supplies digital and analog semiconductor devices and related products worldwide. In the second quarter of 2022, Goldman Sachs owned 1.6 million shares of Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) worth $791 million, representing 0.17% of the total securities. On October 18, Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore reiterated a Buy rating on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) but slashed the firm's price target on the shares to $575 from $635. The analyst expects the Q3 earnings season to ""yield more pervasive signs of weakness"" and for the second consecutive quarter, he sees downside risk to 2023 estimates. As for the semiconductor stocks, the analyst is becoming ""incrementally more constructive,"" noting the decline in the sector and relative underperformance versus the S&amp;P 500 ""have clearly priced in significant rev/EPS estimate cuts"" and left the group valuation 20% below its 5-year average.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 66 hedge funds were bullish on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 71 funds in the last quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management owned the leading stake in the company, with 1.5 million shares worth $716.3 million.Here is what Carillon Tower Advisers specifically said about Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Tech stocks, including Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), were one of the hardest-hit sectors due to fears over a weakening macroeconomic environment. Broadcom, however, outperformed semiconductor peers as its end-market exposures provided relatively more defensive characteristics.”6. KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43Goldman Sachs’ Stake Value: $835,425,000KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) is a California-based company that designs, manufactures, and markets process control, process-enabling, and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and electronics industries worldwide.

The analyst said he finds the more conservative 2023 WFE view as constructive, though he argues that the full extent of Logic/Foundry weakness is not yet completely factored in.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 43 hedge funds were long KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 52 funds in the last quarter. Brian Ashford-Russell and Tim Woolley’s Polar Capital is a significant position holder in the company, with 498,135 shares worth about $159 million. In addition to Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), Goldman Sachs is backing KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) in the semiconductor space. Here is what Vltava Fund has to say about KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“We then used the money freed up to, among other things, open three new positions. The stock price declines during the Russian invasion brought a lot of good prices to the market. Out of all the possibilities we considered, we picked the stock of KLA Corporation (KLAC).KLA Corporation develops leading-edge equipment and services that enable innovation throughout the electronics industry. It specialises in process management and control in semiconductor manufacturing and the related nanoelectronics industries. During manufacturing processes, products must be inspected for defects and correct critical dimensions in order to identify and eliminate possible sources of problems. As customers continue to enforce Moore’s Law, smaller chips must meet more precise specifications, which in turn increases the need for advanced inspection and diagnostic tools. This is a key step within the entire manufacturing process and one in which the company has built a very strong, and in places dominant, global position. We have been watching and waiting for an opportunity to acquire this stock for some time already, and this year’s drop in its price finally prompted us to buy.” Click to continue reading and see Goldman Sachs Semiconductor Stocks: Top 5 Picks.  Suggested articles:14 Largest Lithium Producers in the World12 Best Financial Dividend Stocks To Buy10 Stocks That Are On Sale Now Disclosure: None.

With 87% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Institutional investors would appreciate the 3.2% increase in share prices last week, given their one-year returns have been disappointing at 9.4%.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Texas Instruments. See our latest analysis for Texas Instruments ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Texas Instruments?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Texas Instruments. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Texas Instruments, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Texas Instruments. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.6%. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.5% and 4.1% of the stock.Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 21 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Story continuesResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Texas InstrumentsThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Texas Instruments Incorporated in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$166m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 13% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Texas Instruments. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Texas Instruments .If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

(NYSE:DVA)Warren Buffett’s hedge fund has been holding a stake in healthcare company DaVita (NYSE:DVA) for over 10 years now. At the end of June, the fund had owned 36 million shares of the company, worth $2.9 billion. DaVita (NYSE:DVA) is trading at an attractive PE ratio of 11 as of October 20.

The investment firm also upped its price target for the company to $117 from $106. UBS analyst Andrew Mok said that he believes the company can deliver $200M-300M of OI growth in 2023.A total of 28 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in DaVita (NYSE:DVA) as of the end of the June quarter.12. The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK)Another strong financial services player in Buffett’s portfolio, Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) is currently trading in oversold territory, having lost 31% year to date. The bank has increased its dividend consistently for the last 11 years. It has a strong dividend yield of over 3%. Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) is already benefitting from rising interest rates. It crushed analysts’ estimates for the third quarter despite a decline in assets under custody and management. The bank’s CEO Robin Vince said the company’s performance “benefitted” from higher interest rates and continued strength in client volumes. Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK)'s adjusted EPS in the third quarter came in at $1.21, versus the consensus estimate of $1.08.In October, JPMorgan upgraded Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) to Buy from Neutral due to limited credit risk and strong return capacity.Here is what Ariel Investments has to say about The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“Rising interest rates, after a surprisingly long period of low absolute rates and negative “real” rates, will create a headwind. While there has been much debate about the cause of these low rates, we believe the most important factor has been the $120 billion in monthly federal reserve open market bond purchases and the accumulation of an $8 trillion balance sheet. The former will end, and the latter will shrink. It is not just the Fed that has aggressively purchased bonds, bidding up prices and lowering yields. Bond traders and hedge fund managers have added to positions, confident that being on the same side as the Fed was the wise place to be. Now as the Fed is about to become a seller of bonds rather than a buyer, Wall Street’s “smart money” is likely to follow suit. Against this backdrop, fixed income securities and bond substitutes such as high dividend paying utilities and absolute return hedge funds are substantially overpriced and are not likely to produce attractive returns going forward.This expectation of a reversion to the mean for interest rates helped 2021 performance, though not as much as we had hoped. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury did indeed increase from +0.92% at the beginning of the year to +1.52% at year-end. An underreported story was the poor performance of bonds last year. The Barclays Aggregate Index declined -1.67% for the year ending December compared to a return of +28.71% for equities as measured by the S&amp;P 500. Interest rates have continued to climb in 2022 with the 10-year Treasury at +1.79% as we go to print. This move higher in rates has contributed to our good, early start to 2022. Smaller positions in The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) also benefited from higher rates, principally with their ability to invest customer cash.”11. HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ)HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) is one of the best Warren Buffett stocks to buy because of its stability and strong growth prospects. Berkshire Hathaway owns 104.5 million shares of HP Inc. These shares were worth $3.4 billion at the end of June.  In September, UBS added HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) to its top tech picks list and said that the company is “well-positioned in the still-nascent 3D printing market."" Not only does HP have strong chances of share price growth, its dividend also makes it an attractive tech stock. Since 2016, its dividend has more than doubled. Currently it has a dividend yield of over 3%. Its PE ratio is just 4.67 which indicates that it’s overvalued and can rebound when the market begins to turn the corner.As of the end of the second quarter, 35 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ), which indicates no change in hedge fund sentiment when compared to the previous quarter.10. Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI)Warren Buffett’s hedge fund upped its stake in Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) by 7% in the second quarter. The fund ended the period with 68.4 million shares of the company, worth $5.33 billion. Investors are holding their breath as regulators in Europe and US continue to scrutinize Microsoft’s $68.7 billion takeover of Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI). Reports suggest that the FTC is expected to reach a decision in this regard in November, and authorities in the UK have set March as a deadline for a decision. Nevertheless, in October, Wells Fargo added Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) to its high-momentum portfolio. The firm said that long-term momentum “typically outperforms in stressful times by keeping investors away from adverse stock situations.”Despite the MSFT deal uncertainty, hedge fund sentiment around Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) remains strong. Of the 895 funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 84 reported having stakes in the company at the end of June, up from 80 funds in the quarter earlier.Here is what Cooper Investors specifically said about Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) – our investment preceded news that the company was under investigation for workplace bullying. When it became clear management had misled the market on the extent of the problem we sold, led by our principles of Responsible Investing. We did not benefit from the subsequent M&amp;A premium paid by Microsoft.”9. U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB)U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is another strong dividend-paying stock in Warren Buffett’s portfolio. The company has been increasing its dividend consistently for the last 10 years. It has a dividend yield of over 4%. US Bancorp recently posted strong third quarter results, driven by growth in interest income, loan and deposit growth. Like other major banks, US Bancorp numbers were buoyed by rising interest rates. Adjusted EPS in the third quarter totaled $1.18, compared to the Wall Street estimate of $1.16. Revenue in the quarter came in at $6.33 billion, surpassing estimates of $6.20 billion.A total of 43 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in the bank at the end of June, compared to 40 funds in the previous quarter.Here is what ClearBridge Investments Dividend Strategy has to say about U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“Over the last year, we have repositioned our portfolio to navigate the course we see ahead. We have increased our exposure to interest-rate sensitive banks by adding to existing positions in U.S. Bancorp.”8. Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO)Warren Buffett owns about 25 million shares of Moody's (NYSE:MCO), worth $6.7 billion, as of the end of the second quarter. Berkshire has been holding stakes in the ratings company for over a decade now. Warren Buffett has been enjoying healthy dividends from Moody's (NYSE:MCO) over these past years. The company has increased its payout for 13 consecutive years. Its payout ratio is just one-fifth of earnings. Famous investors like Chuck Akre, Chris Hohn and Nicolai Tangen have major stakes in the company as of the end of the second quarter.In August, Deutsche Bank analyst Faiza Alwy slashed  Moody's (NYSE:MCO) shares to Neutral from Buy, adding that the stock could have a limited upside when compared to its valuation.Here is what Smead Value Fund has to say about Occidental Petroleum Corporation in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Our top-performing stocks in the quarter includes Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). Oil and gas have been the best game in the stock market town this year and it was a pleasant surprise to see home builders pick up even with dour news on interest rates and the economy. For the first three quarters of the year, we should change the name of our fund to the Jed Clampett Fund. Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), was one of the standouts. Up through the bear market came a “bubblin’ crude!”7. Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY)Warren Buffett increased his hold in Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) by 17% in the second quarter of 2022. His hedge fund now owns 159 million shares of the energy company. These shares have a total worth of $9.3 billion. The fund now owns 21% of the energy company. In light of this, Truist said in a report that Buffett now has a “clear path” towards acquiring Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY).Truist analyst Neal Dingmann said in a note to investors that the “total” purchase of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) would make “logical sense” for Berkshire, given the oil company has a strong FCF forecast, declining debt and is showing strong progress on low carbon ventures.Despite the bloodbath in the stock market in 2022, Occidental has gained 129% year to date.6. The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC)The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) is an important defensive stock that is gaining investors’ attention in 2022 amid recession fears. But Berkshire has been a long-time shareholder of the stock. At the end of the second quarter, Buffett’s fund owned 325 million shares of The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC), worth $12.42 billion. Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to Buy from Neutral. Goldman’s analyst Jason English cited attractive valuation and favorable conditions for the upgrade. Analysts see The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) favorably in this high-inflation environment as it’s relatively easier for food companies to pass on the price increases to consumers. The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) is a high-dividend stock, with a yield of 4.5% as of October 21.Hedge fund sentiment for The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) is increasing.

(NYSE:WMT) sold US$11m worth of stock, possibly indicating weakness in the future",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-walmart-inc-nyse-wmt-110043056.html,1667991643,STORY,['WMT'],"[The fact that multiple Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Walmart Walmart Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the , M. Biggs, sold US$3.1m worth of shares at a price of US$140 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at below the current price (US$143). We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. We note that the biggest single sale was only 8.2% of M. Biggs's holding.Walmart insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Walmart Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Walmart shares. Specifically, President C. McMillon ditched US$1.4m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Walmart insiders own 0.9% of the company, currently worth about US$3.5b based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Walmart Tell Us?An insider hasn't bought Walmart stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. But since Walmart is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Walmart you should know about.Of course Walmart may not be the best stock to buy.

14,10a10c4b-5ff7-396b-97ad-6ce5add2216e,WMT,2022-11-09,Earnings Preview: Walmart (WMT) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-walmart-wmt-q3-150003996.html,1667919603,STORY,['WMT'],"[Walmart (WMT) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 15, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis world's largest retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.31 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -9.7%.Revenues are expected to be $147.34 billion, up 4.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.25% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Walmart?For Walmart, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.25%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Walmart will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Walmart would post earnings of $1.60 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.77, delivering a surprise of +10.63%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Walmart doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Race to Resilience is a global campaign catalyzing a step-change in global ambition for climate resilience.""Through this initiative, we are showcasing the world’s most innovative and impactful insurance-based climate adaptation projects and applying a simple and clear framework for industry engagement,"" said Dr. Mahmoud Mohieldin, UN Climate Change High-Level Champion for Egypt, COP27.

The company benefits from attractive insurance industry dynamics, durable underlying revenue drivers and a strong margin/free cash flow profile.It has demonstrated the ability to grow revenue in excess of GDP growth, particularly during periods of strong property and casualty commercial industry pricing like the current environment, while experiencing more modest revenue declines than overall GDP during past recessions. The insurance brokerage segment does not take underwriting risk but instead earns fees and commissions based on services provided, resulting in low capital intensity and strong free cash flow generation.In aggregate, we believe MMC’s business will be durable during recessionary periods. Risks include a valuation on the higher end of the stock’s historical range, limited exposure to changes in GDP growth and the likelihood that shares would lag balance sheet intensive financials in a rebound.”Story continues10 Best Financial Advisory Firms To Buy NowAdam Gregor/Shutterstock.comMarsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc.

You can skip our comprehensive analysis about the leisure industry and go directly to Top 5 Leisure Companies in the World. The onset of coronavirus had wreaked havoc on most businesses across the world, but none felt the jitters harder than the global leisure &amp; hospitality industry, with some of its biggest names failing to make it to the top 500 in Forbes’ 2021 ranking of world’s largest public companies.According to a US Joint Economic Committee report, the leisure &amp; hospitality industry had experienced steady growth from 12.9 million workers in 2010 to 16.9 million at the beginning of 2020. But Covid-19 pandemic disrupted this trend when in April 2020 employment had dropped sharply, reaching levels that had not been seen since the 1980s.The impact of Covid-19 on leisure &amp; hospitality businesses can be gauged from the fact that the industry made up 40pc of all job losses at the height of the pandemic (February 2020 to April 2020), according to the report.In 2021, however, the downtrend slowly started shifting mainly due to an overall drop in Covid fatalities which led to ease in travel restrictions across the world, resulting in leisure &amp; hospitality companies seeing considerable improvements in their financials. Although Delta and Omicron variants slowed the recovery in some regions earlier this year, recent leisure spending trends show that it won’t take long for leisure businesses, particularly those operating in the US and Europe, to regain their pre-pandemic market share.As per Deloitte’s Consumer Tracker, total net leisure spending jumped three percentage points in the first quarter of 2022 compared to -10pc in Q4 2021. This uptick was in part driven by school half-term breaks but also by the loosening, or even the entire removal, of Covid-19 entry requirements in many popular international destinations.Story continuesWith further ease in restrictions in the offing, analysts predict air travel to soar and demand for both hotels and private rentals to remain strong moving forward.Top 10 Leisure Companies in the World in 2022Credit: Park Hotels &amp; ResortsAccording to the US Travel Association’s June report, travel spending ($100 billion) was 3pc more in April 2022 as compared to 2019 pre-pandemic levels. However, overseas visitation was still 43pc below 2019 levels, albeit European markets vastly improved and were down just 34pc of 2019 levels.As businesses operating in western markets are cautiously making their way back to pre-pandemic levels, the same cannot be said about leisure businesses operating in Asian markets, which remain down largely due to restrictions in individual countries.An Asian Development Bank (ADP) report  published in March 2022 concluded that popular tourist hubs like Hong Kong and Macau – latter  being home to some of the biggest casinos owned by US companies, may continue with the downtrend amidst Covid restrictions in vogue in China.Despite recent travel trends showing improvements in leisure activities across the world, it is safe to say that the industry’s revival, at least in Asia, would still rely heavily on potential lockdowns and restrictions.With that said, let's take a peek at the world’s top 10 leisure companies in the world in 2022, see how they fared amidst post-pandemic relaxations, and evaluate their operational preparedness to cope with any potential challenges in the near future.Top 10 Leisure Companies in the World10. InterContinental Hotels Group PLC (NYSE:IHG)Market Cap: $9.95 Billion British hospitality giant InterContinental Hotels Group PLC (NYSE: IHG) operates mainstream, upscale and luxury hotels under various brands across the world.Like many on this list, IHG cashed in on the reopening of the U.S. and European markets this year, witnessing a steady growth in performance and posting a positive outlook for the future.The group in its first quarter 2022 results reported a 61pc year-on-year jump in revenue per available room (RevPAR), attaining 82pc of 2019 level.Among its segments, the group’s Q1 RevPAR for ‘The Americas’ was up 58pc vs 2021 (down 8pc vs 2019) with close to 60pc occupancy rate, while Q1 RevPAR for ‘EMEAA Region’ was up 122pc vs 2021 (down 33pc vs 2019) with occupancy approaching 50pc.Trading in Greater China, however, continued to be impacted by restrictions put in place to control rising Covid cases. The company’s Q1 RevPAR for ‘Greater China’ segment remained 7pc down as compared to 2021 (-42pc vs 2019) with occupancy at 36pc.Keith Barr, Chief Executive Officer at IHG Hotels &amp; Resorts, noted that higher occupancy levels (in the US &amp; Europe) was indicative of increased pricing power. In March, IHG hotels in the U.S. achieved leisure rates up by more than 10pc on 2019 levels while rate across the whole of the U.S. business was 4pc ahead.Citing growth in corporate bookings and a surge in leisure activities as reasons, the company sees further progress in both occupancy and rate in the coming quarters.Headquartered in Buckinghamshire, England, InterContinental Hotels Group PLC owns and operates a portfolio of hotel businesses across The Americas; Europe, Middle East Asia and Africa (EMEAA), and Greater China. Its hotel brands include Six Senses, Regent, InterContinental, Vignette, Kimpton, Hotel Indigo, EVEN Hotels, HUALUXE, Crowne Plaza, voco, Holiday Inn, Holiday Inn Express, Holiday Inn Club Vacations, avid, Staybridge Suites, Atwell Suites, and Candlewood Suites.

Cash from operations turned positive in April and was positive for the second quarter of 2022.As of June 24, 2022, 91pc of the company's capacity is in guest cruise operation as part of its ongoing return to service.Carnival Corporation owns and operates cruise ships offering cruises to all major vacation destinations including North America, United Kingdom, Germany, Southern Europe, South America, and Asia Pacific.

Huazhu Group Ltd (NASDAQ:HTHT) Market Cap: $12.58 Billion  Unlike some of its rivals in the West, China-based hotel operator and franchisor Huazhu Group Limited has been encountering tremendous challenges at the hands of corona-induced lockdowns across prominent Chinese markets including Shanghai.According to the company’s unaudited Q1 2022 financials, net loss attributable to Huazhu Group Limited clocked in at RMB630 million ($99 million), compared with RMB248 million for the first quarter of 2021 and RMB459 million in the previous quarter.The company’s EBITDA for the first quarter of 2022 was negative RMB301 million ($48 million), compared with RMB70 million for the first quarter of 2021 and RMB46 million in the previous quarter.During the first quarter of 2022, the company’s Legacy-Huazhu business opened 302 hotels, including three leased hotels and 299 manachised hotels and franchised hotels, and closed a total of 140 hotels, including 12 leased hotels and 128 manachised and franchise hotels.In the second quarter of 2022, Huazhu Group expects revenue to decline 2pc to 6pc compared to the second quarter of 2021 due to the impact of Covid restrictions in China.Huazhu Group’s business includes leased and owned, manachised and franchised models.

The cruise company expects it will fill its ships in 2023 even with higher pricing and uncertain macroeconomic conditions, executives said during an earnings call Tuesday.In the third quarter, occupancy rose to 82 percent, up from 65 percent the last quarter but down 30 percent from the same period in 2019. Occupancy grew despite pricing being higher than in 2019. “Pricing continues to be significantly higher when compared to 2019 even when taking into consideration the diluted effect of future cruise credit,” said Norwegian Cruise President and CEO Frank J. Del Rio.The cruise company wants to sequentially narrow the gap from its 2019 level to 20 percent and expects to reach “100 percent plus levels” by the second quarter of 2023, Del Rio said. “As we have said, previously, pricing naturally will level off as we fill out our book for 2023, but we continue to expect to achieve record pricing for full year 2023.”The raised pricing is part of the company’s strategy to achieve its recovery targets. “We’re protecting price. We want the consumer to pay more,” said Norwegian Cruise Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Mark Kempa. “Is there an offset in the very short term that we are sacrificing a small amount of load factor? Yes, we’ve said that, but that is part of our strategy. We expect to be back at normal load factors in the second quarter of next year. We are right on track.”Booking windows expanded to 245 days, up 30 percent from the second quarter and up nearly 10 percent in the same period in 2019.  Net booking volumes continue to be at the pace needed to reach historical occupancy levels in 2023, the company said. Norwegian Cruise is targeting to have 65 percent of bookings for 2023 be completed by the end of 2022 at record pricing.Bookings got a boost in the drop in Covid measures around the world, which allowed the company to reach a wider guest market and to cover more international ports to support high-yielding itineraries, said Del Rio. He cited the removal of Covid testing in the key markets of Canada, Greece, Bermuda and in all of South America. In September and October, Norwegian Cruise’s brands relaxed and dropped Covid protocols.Story continuesIn the third quarter, revenue was $1.6 billion, down from $1.9 billion for the same period in 2019. Total revenue per passenger cruise day exceeded expectations, up 14 percent for the same period in 2019. The company reported a GAAP net loss of $295.4 million and an adjusted net loss of $268.3 million.The loss of St. Petersburg due to the ongoing Ukraine War, however, continues to deal a “real blow” to Norwegian Cruise, said Del Rio. He estimated its loss costs the company millions of dollars in forgone onboard revenue and high-yield itineraries and contributed to higher prices.Norwegian cited its guest mix as an advantage if macroeconomic conditions worsen in 2023. The vast majority of Norwegian’s guest mix consist of individuals with over $250,000 in net worth, a group that has historically continued to book despite economic downturns. Furthermore, less than 10 percent of the company’s guests are sourced from Europe, where the macroeconomic environment is challenging, said Del Rio.In August, Norwegian Cruise Line christened its newest ship Norwegian Prima, which made history as the first major cruise ship christened in Reykjavík, Iceland. Norwegian Cruise expects to launch eight additional ships by 2027.Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

At 1617 GMT, the shares were down 8.1% at 229.70 pence.The pan-European STOXX 600, meanwhile, was off 0.3% and an index of European oil and gas stocks fell 1.9% .Ithaca's IPO, which priced at the bottom of the expected price range, gave the company an initial valuation of 2.45 billion pounds ($2.83 billion). At the top of the original price range it would have been valued at 3.1 billion pounds.""Ithaca has IPO'd into a difficult broader market backdrop and the near term weakness probably underlines that,"" Investec analyst Nathan Piper said.Amid a drought of stock market listings, Ithaca raised proceeds of 288 million pounds.Global IPO proceeds are down more than 70% compared with the same time last year, data from Dealogic shows.London's stock exchange has suffered the worst year on record for IPO volumes as the ongoing energy crisis and worsening economic forecasts made markets volatile.Very few IPOs are expected in Europe, the Middle East and Africa before year-end, a bookrunner working on the Ithaca deal said, other than deals already underway in the Middle East including a listing by Americana Restaurants which is due to price in late November.More than half of Ithaca's book went to UK investors, with a quarter going to Israeli investors and a fifth to U.S. names, the bookrunner said.With a free-float of 12%, Ithaca is the first major firm to take advantage of new London listing rules implemented at the end of 2021 that reduced the proportion of shares required to be in public hands from 25% to 10%.Story continuesProceeds from shares sales in Britain have dropped 95% so far this year and only two out of 38 listings have been in the utility and energy sector, Dealogic data shows.NORTH SEA HORIZONIthaca, owned by Tel Aviv-listed Delek Group, is being watched for investor interest in energy producers in the North Sea, an ageing basin where private equity firms have in recent years bought assets, but have held off IPOs.Britain recently launched its first oil and gas exploration licensing round since 2019 to boost domestic production, but also imposed a 25% windfall tax on oil and gas producers to help households struggling with energy bills.Producers can reduce the windfall tax significantly if they invest in new oil and gas production, which has meant some companies like Shell are virtually shielded from paying it.Ithaca Chairman Gilad Myerson told Reuters that if the government, which is mulling changes to the tax, removes this mechanism, field developments in the North Sea would become ""uneconomical"".Ithaca, which produces around 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, wants to use the IPO proceeds to pay down debt, which stood at a net $1.4 billion at the end of June, and aims to pay a 2023 dividend of $400 million.The last oil and gas producer to float on the main London stock exchange was eastern Mediterranean-focused Energean in 2018.Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are joint global coordinators on the deal, while HSBC, Jefferies and Bank of America are joint bookrunners, with ING acting as co-lead manager.($1 = 0.8649 pounds)(Reporting by Emma-Victoria Farr, Joice Alves, Shadia Nasralla and Lucy Raitano; Editing by Mark Potter, Alexander Smith and Bernadette Baum)]"

Data on Wednesday showed Chinese factory inflation slowed for the first time in a year in October, indicating that manufacturing activity is likely to remain subdued in the near-term.China’s consumer inflation also grew less than expected last month, as COVID-19 restrictions continued to stifle economic activity. These measures are the biggest reason behind China’s weakening crude demand this year.While the country did import more than expected oil in October, a bulk of it was due to increased import quotas and lower prices. Crude consumption remained largely subdued in China, with a recent hike in export quotas indicating more woes.London-traded Brent oil futures rose 0.2% to $95.30 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 0.2% to $88.78 a barrel by 21:32 ET (02:32 GMT).Crude markets were privy to some profit taking after a strong rally over the past two weeks.Also weighing on the mood, data from the American Petroleum Institute showed that U.S. crude inventories grew a more than expected 5.6 million barrels in the week to November 4. Government data due later in the day is expected to show a 1.36 million barrel build.Oil prices rallied sharply in recent weeks on positive cues from a softening dollar and expectations of a smaller interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve. Markets also cheered reassurances from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries that it will cut supply as needed to stabilize prices.But fears that a pronounced global economic slowdown will dent crude demand persisted, especially amid rising interest rates and elevated inflation. U.S. inflation data due on Thursday is expected to shine more light on this trend, given that it will likely factor into the Fed’s interest rate decision in December.Story continuesMarkets were also disappointed this week by comments from Chinese authorities that they have no plans to scale back the country's economically-damaging zero-COVID policy.Related ArticlesOil prices steady after 3% slump, China slowdown in focusGold rallies above $1,700 as dollar weakens amid election jittersOil prices slide $2 on China demand worries, U.S. midterm elections]"

MISSISSAUGA, ON, Nov. 9, 2022 /CNW/ - With online shopping continuing to be a significant part of many Canadians' holiday preparations, e-commerce has empowered consumers with the tools to navigate a busy shopping season without having to necessarily tighten their purse strings. In fact, new data from this year's annual FedEx Express Holiday Shopping Survey reveals that a whopping 78 per cent of Canadian holiday shoppers expect to spend the same or more this holiday season compared to last year.FedEx 2022 (CNW Group/Federal Express Canada Corporation)""Canadians are gearing up for a busy holiday season by being smarter online shoppers, leveraging digital solutions that empower them to take ownership of their shopping experience,"" said Lisa Lisson, president of FedEx Express Canada.

Most Canadians are not letting rising costs affect their spending plans, as 78 per cent of those who plan to do holiday shopping expect to spend about the same amount or more as last year this holiday season.Shopping with intention.

Sixty-nine per cent of online shoppers are at least somewhat worried about package theft, an 8-point increase from last year. To combat these fears, digital tools are becoming more important.

(NYSE:DHI), Bowlero Corp. (NYSE:BOWL) is one of the top stock picks from the George Soros stock portfolio. 9. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 116Soros Fund Management’s Stake Value: $103,564,000Salesforce, Inc.

(NYSE:CRM) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a leading customer relationship management (CRM) platform with a broad suite of products that help its customers with sales, service, marketing, and analytics. Salesforce has steadily gained market share within its addressable market, that itself is growing 13% per year. Salesforce has used both organic innovation and selective M&amp;A to expand its menu of products. This has improved penetration as customers increase the number of products, or clouds, they buy from Salesforce. As a customer moves from one Salesforce cloud to two clouds, annual recurring revenue (ARR) increases 3X on average. With 3 clouds, ARR is 9X higher vs. 1 cloud, and we believe this exponential growth dynamic will increase with each successive cloud. In addition to generating recurring revenue for Salesforce, each incremental cloud helps Salesforce increase its position within the daily operations of its customers, making its products stickier. Long term, we believe these secular trends will continue, and that Salesforce will continue to gain market share, expand margins, and innovate to address the needs of its customers.”8.

Since Monday morning, PG&amp;E has restored more than 60,000 customers who lost power, with 96 percent restored in six hours or fewer.This cold, low pressure weather system entered across the service area Sunday evening resulting in scattered showers, isolated thunderstorms, heavy mountain snow and breezy winds. Shower activity is expected to linger through Wednesday with additional snow accumulation along the Sierra before drier conditions return Wednesday evening.PG&amp;E Executing Its Response PlanIn anticipation of widespread winter storm conditions, PG&amp;E activated its Emergency Operations Center on Sunday, Nov. 6, and has positioned personnel and equipment to respond to potential weather-related outages safely and as quickly as possible.PG&amp;E has more than 250 power restoration ground crews, including hundreds of troublemen, the first responders for customers who lose power. The company has also stored a large number of power poles, power lines, transformers and other electric equipment at yards throughout its service territory to help crews restore power as quickly as possible.Keeping Customers InformedPG&amp;E knows how important it is for customers to have the latest outage and restoration information.

PG&amp;E will notify customers about the cause of an outage, when crews are on their way, the estimated restoration time and when power is restored.Story continuesStorm Safety TipsNever touch downed wires: If you see a downed power line, assume it is energized and extremely dangerous. Do not touch or try to move it—and keep children and animals away. Report downed power lines immediately by calling 911 and by calling PG&amp;E at 1-800-743-5002.Use flashlights, not candles: During a power outage, use battery-operated flashlights, and not candles, due to the risk of fire. If you must use candles, please keep them away from drapes, lampshades and small children. Do not leave candles unattended.Have a backup phone: If you have a telephone system that requires electricity to work, such as a cordless phone or answering machine, plan to have a standard telephone or cellular phone ready as a backup.Have fresh drinking water, ice: Freeze plastic containers filled with water to make blocks of ice that can be placed in your refrigerator/freezer during an outage to prevent foods from spoiling. Blue Ice from your picnic cooler also works well in the freezer.Use generators safely: Customers with standby electric generators should make sure they are properly installed by a licensed electrician in a well-ventilated area. Improperly installed generators pose a significant danger to customers, as well as crews working on power lines. If using portable generators, be sure they are in a well-ventilated area.Turn off appliances: If you experience an outage, unplug or turn off all electrical appliances to avoid overloading circuits and to prevent fire hazards when power is restored. Simply leave a single lamp on to alert you when power returns. Turn your appliances back on one at a time when conditions return to normal.Safely clean up: After the inclement weather has passed, be sure to safely clean up. Never touch downed wires and always call 811 or visit 811express.com at least two full business days before digging to have all underground utilities safely marked.Other tips can be found at: pge.com/beprepared, Storm safety, safety action centerAbout PG&amp;EPacific Gas and Electric Company, a subsidiary of PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), is one of the largest combined natural gas and electric energy companies in the United States.

On an adjusted basis, our revenues grew a healthy three percent, building on the robust results from last year.Profitability for the quarter was $350 million, down 15 percent, although that reflects the forex headwinds and a fundamental reset by Amazon of its book inventory levels and warehouse footprint. We view neither factor as reflective of core business conditions or of our long-term potential.Story continuesDow Jones posted its best first quarter results since its acquisition with revenues rising 16 percent and Segment EBITDA an even more impressive 19 percent, benefiting from the successful integration of OPIS and Chemical Market Analytics, strong digital advertising growth, record digital subscriptions and continued momentum at Risk &amp; Compliance.News Corp is building on a sturdy base. We have reported record profitability in each of the last two fiscal years and bolstered our fortunes through savvy investments and by streamlining the cost base.""FIRST QUARTER RESULTSThe Company reported fiscal 2023 first quarter total revenues of $2.48 billion, a 1% decrease compared to $2.50 billion in the prior year period. The decline was primarily due to a $153 million, or 6%, negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations and lower revenues at the Book Publishing segment due to lower physical book sales from Amazon, partially offset by higher Dow Jones segment revenues, which includes the acquisitions of OPIS and Chemical Market Analytics (""CMA""). Adjusted Revenues (which excludes the foreign currency impact, acquisitions and divestitures as defined in Note 2) increased 3%.Net income for the quarter was $66 million, a 75% decline compared to $267 million in the prior year, primarily due to lower Other, net and lower Total Segment EBITDA, as discussed below, partially offset by lower tax expense.The Company reported first quarter Total Segment EBITDA of $350 million, a 15% decline compared to $410 million in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in costs, partly due to inflationary pressures, lower revenues, as discussed above, and a $23 million, or 6%, negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Adjusted Total Segment EBITDA (as defined in Note 2) decreased 13%.Net income per share attributable to News Corporation stockholders was $0.07 as compared to $0.33 in the prior year.Adjusted EPS (as defined in Note 3) were $0.12 compared to $0.23 in the prior year.SEGMENT REVIEWFor the three months endedSeptember 30,20222021% Change(in millions)Better/(Worse)Revenues:Digital Real Estate Services$421$426(1) %Subscription Video Services502510(2) %Dow Jones51544416%Book Publishing487546(11) %News Media553576(4) %Other———%Total Revenues$2,478$2,502(1) %Segment EBITDA:Digital Real Estate Services$119$138(14) %Subscription Video Services111114(3) %Dow Jones1139519%Book Publishing3985(54) %News Media1834(47) %Other(50)(56)11%Total Segment EBITDA$350$410(15) %Digital Real Estate ServicesRevenues in the quarter decreased $5 million, or 1%, compared to the prior year, reflecting a $20 million, or 5%, negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Segment EBITDA in the quarter decreased $19 million, or 14%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $9 million, or 7%, negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations and higher employee and marketing costs related to strategic investments at both Move and REA Group, partially offset by lower broker commissions at REA Group. Adjusted Revenues and Adjusted Segment EBITDA (as defined in Note 2) increased 3% and declined 7%, respectively.In the quarter, revenues at REA Group increased $6 million, or 2%, to $252 million, driven by higher Australian residential revenues due to price increases, the contribution from Premiere Plus, increased depth penetration and growth in national listings. The growth was partially offset by a $20 million, or 9%, negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations and lower financial services revenues due to declines in settlement activity. Australian national residential buy listing volumes in the quarter increased 5% compared to the prior year, with listings in Melbourne up 12% and Sydney up 5%, partly due to a number of state lockdowns in the prior year.Move’s revenues in the quarter decreased $11 million, or 6%, to $169 million, primarily as a result of lower real estate revenues, partially offset by higher advertising revenues. Real estate revenues, which represented 84% of total Move revenues, decreased $14 million, or 9%, driven by the impact of the macroeconomic environment, including higher household interest rates, on the housing market which has led to lower lead and transaction volumes. Revenues from the traditional lead generation product and the referral model, which includes the ReadyConnect Concierge℠ product, decreased due to these factors, partially offset by continued improvements in yield at Connections℠ Plus and higher home prices. The decline was also partially offset by higher sell-through of the Market VIP℠ product, a hybrid offering. The referral model generated 30% of total Move revenues in the quarter compared to 32% in the prior year. Based on Move’s internal data, average monthly unique users of Realtor.com®’s web and mobile sites for the fiscal first quarter declined 11% year-over-year to 86 million. Lead volume declined 32%.Subscription Video ServicesRevenues of $502 million in the quarter decreased $8 million, or 2%, compared with the prior year, primarily due to a $40 million, or 8%, negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Adjusted Revenues of $542 million increased 6% compared to the prior year, improving from the prior quarter rate. Higher revenues from Kayo and BINGE, higher commercial revenues and an increase in advertising revenues were partially offset by the impact from fewer residential broadcast subscribers. Foxtel Group streaming subscription revenues represented approximately 25% of total circulation and subscription revenues in the quarter, as compared to 19% in the prior year.As of September 30, 2022, Foxtel’s total closing paid subscribers were nearly 4.5 million, a 16% increase compared to the prior year, primarily due to the growth in BINGE and Kayo subscribers, partially offset by lower residential broadcast subscribers. Broadcast subscriber churn in the quarter increased slightly to 14.2% from 14.0% in the prior year. Broadcast ARPU for the quarter increased 1% year-over-year to A$83 (US$57).As of September 30,20222021(in 000's)Broadcast SubscribersResidential1,4391,605Commercial219162Streaming Subscribers (Total (Paid))Kayo1,270 (1,259 paid)1,079 (1,058 paid)BINGE1,451 (1,342 paid)885 (802 paid)Foxtel Now197 (191 paid)239 (227 paid)Total Subscribers, including Flash (Total (Paid))4,605 (4,465 paid)3,970 (3,854 paid)Segment EBITDA in the quarter decreased $3 million, or 3%, compared with the prior year, reflecting a $9 million, or 8%, negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. The decline also reflects higher sports programming rights costs, driven by the timing of sports events, notably in motorsports, and contractual increases, as well as higher marketing costs at BINGE. Adjusted Segment EBITDA increased 5%.Dow JonesRevenues in the quarter increased $71 million, or 16%, compared to the prior year, which includes $34 million and $18 million contributions from the acquisitions of OPIS and CMA, respectively. Adjusted Revenues at the Dow Jones segment increased 6% compared to the prior year, primarily due to the growth in circulation and subscription revenues from continued digital subscription gains and growth in Risk &amp; Compliance products, as well as higher digital advertising revenues. Digital revenues at Dow Jones in the quarter represented 79% of total revenues compared to 75% in the prior year.Circulation and subscription revenues increased $65 million, or 19%, which includes the contributions from the acquisitions of OPIS and CMA. Circulation revenue grew 5%, reflecting the continued strong growth in digital-only subscriptions at The Wall Street Journal. Professional information business revenues grew 40%, primarily driven by the acquisitions of OPIS and CMA and growth in Risk &amp; Compliance products, partially offset by negative foreign currency fluctuations. Revenues from the Risk &amp; Compliance products grew 6%, which includes a 10% negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Digital circulation revenues accounted for 68% of circulation revenues for the quarter, compared to 66% in the prior year.During the first quarter, total average subscriptions to Dow Jones’ consumer products reached over 4.9 million, an 8% increase compared to the prior year. Digital-only subscriptions to Dow Jones’ consumer products grew 13%. Total subscriptions to The Wall Street Journal grew 8% compared to the prior year, to nearly 3.8 million average subscriptions in the quarter. Digital-only subscriptions to The Wall Street Journal grew 13% to over 3.1 million average subscriptions in the quarter, and represented 84% of total Wall Street Journal subscriptions.For the three months ended September 30,20222021% Change(in thousands, except %)Better/(Worse)The Wall Street JournalDigital-only subscriptions3,1572,80313%Total subscriptions3,7783,5098%Barron’s GroupDigital-only subscriptions86272319%Total subscriptions1,04093511%Total ConsumerDigital-only subscriptions4,0993,62613%Total subscriptions4,9224,5728%Advertising revenues increased $4 million, or 4%, primarily due to 11% growth in digital advertising revenues, driven by higher average yields, partially offset by a 6% decline in print advertising revenues. Digital advertising accounted for 65% of total advertising revenues in the quarter, compared to 61% in the prior year.Segment EBITDA for the quarter increased $18 million, or 19%, primarily due to a $19 million combined contribution from the acquisitions of OPIS and CMA. Higher revenues were partially offset by higher costs related to the acquisitions and higher employee costs. Adjusted Segment EBITDA decreased 1%.Book PublishingRevenues in the quarter decreased $59 million, or 11%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower physical book sales due to Amazon’s reset of its inventory levels and rightsizing of its warehouse footprint which resulted in lower order volume and higher returns, despite consumer sales data remaining consistent with prior quarters. The decline also reflects a $22 million, or 4%, negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Key titles in the quarter included Portrait of an Unknown Woman by Daniel Silva, Live Wire: Long-Winded Short Stories by Kelly Ripa and Breaking History by Jared Kushner. Adjusted Revenues decreased 7%. Digital sales increased 1% compared to the prior year due to higher sales of downloadable audiobooks, partially offset by lower e-book sales. Digital sales represented 23% of Consumer revenues for the quarter compared to 21% in the prior year. Backlist sales represented approximately 65% of total revenues in the quarter.Segment EBITDA for the quarter decreased $46 million, or 54%, compared to the prior year, driven by lower orders from Amazon, as discussed above, higher manufacturing and freight costs due to the impact from ongoing supply chain and inflationary pressures and a $3 million, or 3%, negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by lower costs due to lower sales volume and lower employee costs. The supply chain and inflationary pressures are expected to continue to impact the business in the near term but at a more moderate rate. Adjusted Segment EBITDA decreased 51%.News MediaRevenues in the quarter decreased $23 million, or 4%, as compared to the prior year, driven by a $62 million, or 11%, negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by higher circulation and subscription revenues and higher advertising revenues in constant currency. Within the segment, revenues at News Corp Australia and News UK increased 1% and decreased 9%, respectively, as both were impacted by negative foreign currency fluctuations. The New York Post also saw higher revenues in the quarter. Adjusted Revenues for the segment increased 6% compared to the prior year.Circulation and subscription revenues decreased $16 million, or 6%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $32 million, or 12%, negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations and lower print volume. The decline was partially offset by cover price increases, higher content licensing revenues and digital subscriber growth.Advertising revenues decreased $10 million, or 4%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $22 million, or 9%, negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations, lower print advertising at News UK and lower revenues at Wireless Group, partly due to the absence of the Euro 2020, which occurred in the prior year period. The decline was partially offset by growth in digital advertising, primarily at News UK (mainly at The Sun), and the recovery of print advertising at News Corp Australia.In the quarter, Segment EBITDA decreased $16 million, or 47%, compared to the prior year, reflecting lower revenues, as discussed above, and a $2 million, or 6%, negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. The decline was also due to over $20 million of higher costs related to TalkTV and other digital investments, higher newsprint, production and distribution costs across the businesses and higher employee costs, partially offset by cost saving initiatives. The positive contributions from News Corp Australia and the New York Post were more than offset by the negative contributions from News UK and Wireless Group and negative foreign currency fluctuations. Adjusted Segment EBITDA decreased 44%.Digital revenues represented 36% of News Media segment revenues in the quarter, compared to 33% in the prior year, and represented 33% of the combined revenues of the newspaper mastheads. Digital subscribers and users across key properties within the News Media segment are summarized below:Closing digital subscribers at News Corp Australia as of September 30, 2022 were 1,012,000 (929,000 for news mastheads), compared to 897,000 (850,000 for news mastheads) in the prior year (Source: Internal data)The Times and Sunday Times closing digital subscribers, including the Times Literary Supplement, as of September 30, 2022 were 468,000, compared to 380,000 in the prior year (Source: Internal data)New York Post’s digital network reached 151 million unique users in September 2022, compared to 151 million in the prior year (Source: Google Analytics)CASH FLOWThe following table presents a reconciliation of net cash (used in) provided by operating activities to free cash flow and free cash flow available to News Corporation:For the three months endedSeptember 30,20222021(in millions)Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities$(31)$68Less: Capital expenditures(104)(101)Free cash flow(135)(33)Less: REA Group free cash flow(37)(35)Plus: Cash dividends received from REA Group5043Free cash flow available to News Corporation$(122)$(25)Net cash used in operating activities of $31 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $99 million lower than net cash provided by operating activities of $68 million in the prior year, primarily due to lower Total Segment EBITDA, as noted above, higher working capital and higher interest payments, partially offset by lower restructuring payments.Free cash flow in the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $(135) million compared to $(33) million in the prior year. Free cash flow available to News Corporation in the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $(122) million compared to $(25) million in the prior year period. The decrease in both free cash flow and free cash flow available to News Corporation was primarily due to lower cash provided by operating activities, as mentioned above. Foxtel’s capital expenditures for the three months ended September 30, 2022 were $40 million compared to $48 million in the prior year.Free cash flow and free cash flow available to News Corporation are non-GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, and free cash flow available to News Corporation is defined as free cash flow, less REA Group free cash flow, plus cash dividends received from REA Group.The Company believes free cash flow provides useful information to management and investors about the Company’s liquidity and cash flow trends. The Company believes free cash flow available to News Corporation, which adjusts free cash flow to exclude REA Group’s free cash flow and include dividends received from REA Group, provides management and investors with a measure of the amount of cash flow that is readily available to the Company, as REA Group is a separately listed public company in Australia and must declare a dividend in order for the Company to have access to its share of REA Group’s cash balance. The Company believes free cash flow available to News Corporation provides a more conservative view of the Company’s free cash flow because this presentation includes only that amount of cash the Company actually receives from REA Group, which has generally been lower than the Company’s unadjusted free cash flow. A limitation of both free cash flow and free cash flow available to News Corporation is that they do not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period. Management compensates for the limitation of free cash flow and free cash flow available to News Corporation by also relying on the net change in cash and cash equivalents as presented in the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows prepared in accordance with GAAP which incorporates all cash movements during the period.OTHER ITEMSExploration of Potential Combination with Fox Corporation (""Fox"")In October 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors (the ""Board""), following the receipt of letters from K. Rupert Murdoch and the Murdoch Family Trust, has formed a special committee of independent and disinterested members of the Board (the ""Special Committee"") to begin exploring a potential combination with Fox (the ""Potential Transaction""). The letters indicated that Mr. Murdoch and the Murdoch Family Trust will not vote in favor of a transaction unless it is both recommended by the Special Committee and approved by a majority vote of the shares held by non-affiliated stockholders entitled to vote. The Special Committee, in consultation with its independent financial and legal advisors, will evaluate the Potential Transaction. The Special Committee has not made any determination with respect to the Potential Transaction, and there can be no certainty that the Company will engage in the Potential Transaction. Neither the Company nor the Special Committee intends to disclose further developments regarding the Special Committee’s work until it deems such disclosure is appropriate or required.COMPARISON OF NON-GAAP TO U.S. GAAP INFORMATIONAdjusted Revenues, Total Segment EBITDA, Adjusted Total Segment EBITDA, Adjusted Segment EBITDA, adjusted net income attributable to News Corporation stockholders, Adjusted EPS, free cash flow and free cash flow available to News Corporation are non-GAAP financial measures contained in this earnings release. The Company believes these measures are important tools for investors and analysts to use in assessing the Company’s underlying business performance and to provide for more meaningful comparisons of the Company’s operating performance between periods. These measures also allow investors and analysts to view the Company’s business from the same perspective as Company management. These non-GAAP measures may be different than similar measures used by other companies and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations for the differences between non-GAAP measures used in this earnings release and comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP are included in Notes 1, 2 and 3 and the reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow available to News Corporation is included above.Conference callNews Corporation’s earnings conference call can be heard live at 5:00 p.m. EST on November 8, 2022.

She’s going to bring 25-plus years of meaningful retail operations experience, global business as well.”He noted that Kohl’s digital business — at about $6 billion — is the size of Levi’s overall.“She comes in and she learns the brand, she learns the company, she learns the business and gets to suck every ounce of knowledge out of my brain as possible and my job is to set her up for success,” Bergh said.“My biggest hope is that she comes in with a fresh set of eyes and an open mind,” he said. “She doesn’t have to sit in the hot seat on Day One.”That will give both her and the Levi’s organization a chance to acclimate.“I’m very confident that we’re going to have real strong continuity of our strategic choices,” said Bergh, who has focused on building the brand, the direct-to-consumer business and, more recently, expanding with the acquisition of Beyond Yoga. Earlier this year, Bergh set a five-year strategic plan that has Levi’s targeting $10 billion in sales.The scene at the Levi’s x Sami Miro Vintage launch dinner.Gass, who declined to comment Tuesday, landed the top job at Levi’s after a pressure-filled, difficult tenure as CEO — and activist shareholders got the change-in-command at Kohl’s that they have been pushing for.Taking over as interim CEO of Kohl’s is Tom Kingsbury, a highly regarded veteran merchant who elevated Burlington from a sleepy off-pricer into a top performer in the discount sector that has become increasingly  competitive against TJ Maxx and Ross Stores.Fredrick D. DiSanto, chairman and CEO of activist investor Ancora, and James Chadwick, president of Ancora Alternatives LLC, said: “It is the right time for the company to pivot to a leadership team with enhanced operational expertise and strong turnaround experience. We are very pleased that Kohl’s will be appointing retail sector veteran Tom Kingsbury, who was nominated by our shareholder group in 2021, as its interim chief executive officer.“We are also pleased that Tom and our group’s other designee, Margaret Jenkins, will be part of the new committee tasked with identifying the right permanent leader for the business,” the two investors said. “Ancora has been a long-term shareholder of Kohl’s and believes that under the right leadership, the company can be a source of tremendous value for investors, customers, suppliers and employees.”Gass joined Kohl’s in 2013 as chief customer officer, was named chief merchandising and customer officer in 2015 and became CEO in May 2018. Prior to Kohl’s, Gass held a variety of roles at Starbucks Corp., working in marketing, global strategy and merchandising and serving as president, Starbucks Europe, Middle East and Africa.Her tenure at Kohl’s ended up being a challenging one — and not just because it coincided with the pandemic.“It’s been a difficult company to steer,” said Kirk Palmer, founder and CEO of executive search firm Kirk Palmer Associates. “It’s hard to take a mature business that’s already gone through stratospheric growth and figure out how to keep it growing and how to keep the Street interested. Michelle Gass has taken a fair amount of criticism and it’s been no fun with all of the activist pressure, which can be very distracting.“But I rate her performance way above average,” Palmer said. “She brought Sephora to Kohl’s, formed a partnership with Amazon, and look at what’s been accomplished in both private and market brands. She’s had a lot of good ideas.”Regarding Kingsbury, Palmer cited his success at Burlington. Kingsbury joined Burlington in 2008, took the company public in 2013, and the stock rose from its opening $25 share price to more than $200 a share during his tenure. He left the company in September 2019. The stock is trading around $130.Prior to Burlington, Kingsbury served as senior executive vice president, information services, e-commerce, marketing and business development at Kohl’s from 2006 to 2008. Before joining Kohl’s,  Kingsbury held management positions with the former May Department Stores Co.He’s considered a strong merchant and could be a candidate for permanent CEO at Kohl’s, though his age — he’s 70 — could be a factor.Kohl’s also isn’t the only major retailer or fashion company looking for a new leader. Gap Inc. is also on the hunt for a permanent replacement for Sonia Syngal. And in the resale space, The RealReal Inc. is looking to fill the vacancy left by founder Julie Wainwright.Oliver Chen, an analyst at Cowen, said: “Kohl’s needs to attract and retain younger customers, drive greater consistency in traffic and full-price selling, continue to innovate and update the women’s apparel business, and drive lasting performance at very good partnerships — Sephora and Amazon. New leadership will need to execute on speed, pricing, and personalization as well.”That’s a big job for a big company in a tough spot.Elaine Hughes, managing director of executive search firm E.A. Hughes, described Gass’ move as “very timely given the challenges being faced by Kohl’s.”“The résumé of a CEO in the world of fashion consumer products has evolved over the past 10 to 15 years,” Hughes said. “Not all recruitments out of CPG have worked but as of late they have. Patrice Louvet of Ralph Lauren is one outstanding example. Chip Bergh broke the historic CEO mold at Levi’s and the results have been outstanding. Michelle’s foundational experience at Starbucks mirrors Chip’s P&amp;G experience, plus she has the additional leadership experience of Kohl’s.”Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said Gass’ departure from Kohl’s was “unsurprising” given the retailer’s “chronic underperformance.”“This will be seen as a sacrificial offering to investors, who have long pushed for widespread change in the management suite,” Saunders said. “While it is true that Gass has presided over the decline of recent years, she has also been responsible for guiding Kohl’s through the challenging pandemic period and putting in place improvements in assortments, multichannel and store format development…it is fair to say that Gass has saved Kohl’s from more serious decline. As such, we believe her legacy should be viewed favorably.”Now her focus will turn to Levi’s.Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, noted that the long transition period before Gass steps up to CEO at Levi’s “seems like a probationary period and does not indicate a real vote of confidence. Usually, a transition period is a few months.”Another source noted that any transition period between the current CEO and CEO-designees involving the exchange of control can be awkward, and succession plans could change.That was certainly the case for Joshua Schulman, who was set to take the reins at Capri Holdings Ltd. from John Idol, but instead made a surprise exit last March with Idol remaining in control. Elsewhere, Stefan Larsson had a long ramp up at PVH Corp. and successfully took on the mantle of CEO from his predecessor Manny Chirico.But Bergh noted he has known Gass for a decade and gave her a ringing endorsement to take the job he clearly loves.Johnson said: “Michelle Gass did a lot things right at Kohl’s, most notably the Sephora deal, the early jump into athleisure, and the deal with Under Armour,” among other brands added to the mix. “But if you look at the fundamentals of the company, the sales transaction velocity has flatlined, and the average ticket has lagged.”As Kohl’s revealed Gass’ departure, it also reported preliminary unaudited results for the third quarter ended Oct. 29, indicating that comparable sales decreased 6.9 percent and net sales decreased 7.2 percent. Kohl’s reported an operating margin of 4.7 percent and diluted earnings per share of 82 cents compared to  $1.65 in the year-ago quarter. Kohl’s plans to release its full third-quarter financial results on Nov. 17.Kohl’s is rolling out Sephora to its 1,100 stores.Johnson also said that the new strategy at Kohl’s to open 100 scaled-down stores, at around 35,000 square feet or about half the size of most Kohl’s stores, should have been started sooner. With smaller stores, Kohl’s expects to raise productivity levels.The partnership with Amazon, enabling Amazon orders to be returned to Kohl’s stores, “added footfall though it didn’t add transaction velocity,” Johnson contended. “Launching the small format is designed to better match supply and demand and is a good idea but belatedly done.”Kohl’s has already begun opening some scaled-down units including one completely modernized “concept”  location in Tacoma, Washington, opened two weeks ago that rethinks and modernizes the retailer’s brick-and-mortar experience.Johnson said Kohl’s was late in addressing the post-COVID-19 trend of consumers shifting from cozy, comfort styles to dressier ones.In addition to searching for a permanent CEO, Kohl’s has a vacancy for a permanent chief merchant.Said another source: “It’s anything but uncommon to see executive transitions when things are not going well. Conversations start. In this case, it looks like Michelle Gass has made a clean break.”]"

If you want to see more of the best consumer discretionary stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Buy.Consumer discretionary companies are companies that sell non-essential products and services such as entertainment or premium priced products.Given consumers don't have to buy consumer discretionary products or services, many consumer discretionary companies do well when the economy is strong and they don't do as well when the economy is weak. During times when the economy is strong, consumers generally have more money to spend and many consumers spend more on premium items or services they don't necessarily need. When the economy isn't strong, many consumers will spend less on discretionary items.2022Given high inflation in 2022, the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates six times this year alone and many analysts expect the central bank to raise rates further.As a result of the rate increases, the odds of a recession in the United States have increased. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said in October, ""There's a reasonable chance of a recession in the U.S., but it's not certain."" Meanwhile ratings agency Fitch said, ""Fitch expects the U.S. economy to enter genuine recession territory — albeit relatively mild by historical standards — in 2Q23.""As a result of the uncertainty, many consumer discretionary stocks have declined this year as investors anticipate potentially softer demand if a recession occurs next year. With the decline, many leading consumer discretionary stocks trade for fairly attractive valuations if the economy recovers and inflation normalizes in the long term.In the near to medium term, however, there could be more downside if economic data doesn't meet expectations. Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Story continuesmexican, grill, exterior, corner, sign, building, outdoor, vegetarian, windows, street, brick, brand, name, restaurantSusan Law Cain / Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our 12 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Buy list, we chose 12 leading consumer discretionary stocks that had competitive advantages and strong businesses.Some companies are both consumer staple and consumer discretionary such as The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) given the company's huge product portfolio which spans multiple categories. For the purposes of this article, we included The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) and the other companies that might also fit into other sectors as consumer discretionary stocks.Using the collective wisdom of hedge funds, we ranked the 12 consumer discretionary stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that owned shares of the same stock at the end of Q2 2022.12 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Buy12. The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31Although The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX) makes consumer staples such as bleach and disinfectant wipes, many of the company's products are premium priced, and as a result, some consumers are not buying as much of the company's products as they once did. For FY23, for example, The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX) sees sales potentially falling 4% year over year to rising 2% year over year. Shares of the company are also down 17.7% year to date given the headwinds. In the long term, however, The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX) has quality earnings power given its strong brands.Alongside Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX) is a consumer discretionary stock that many hedge funds in our database owned at the end of the second quarter.11. Darden Restaurants, Inc. (NYSE:DRI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32Darden Restaurants, Inc. (NYSE:DRI) is a leading restaurant operator that operates chains such as the Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse. In October, Eric Gonzalez of KeyBance raised his price target on Darden Restaurants, Inc. (NYSE:DRI) to $150 from $136 and kept an 'Overweight' rating. Gonzalez thinks Darden Restaurants, Inc. (NYSE:DRI)'s scale, data insights, results orientated culture can help its stock perform well in the long term. Of the 895 hedge funds in our database, 32 were long Darden Restaurants, Inc. (NYSE:DRI) at the end of the second quarter.10. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) is a leading burrito chain whose shares are down 17.4% year to date. In October, Joshua Long of Stephens trimmed his price target on Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) to $1,760 from $1,900 but kept an 'Overweight' rating after the company's third quarter report.Pershing Square Holdings commented on Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) in a Q2 2022 investor letter,We believe Chipotle is one of the best-positioned consumer companies for the current inflationary world. Given significant inflation in food and labor costs, management has planned a menu price increase of approximately 4% for August following a similarly-sized price increase in March. The company has tremendous pricing power due to the superb quality of its food which is priced at a discount to many competitors with inferior offerings, marketing focused on food quality and freshness rather than cost, and a customer base that over-indexes to higher-income consumers, some of whom are trading down from pricier alternatives. Chipotle’s economic model remains firmly intact, with restaurant-level margins in excess of 25% in the second quarter, up 0.8% year-over-year, and a consistent level of profitability expected for the current quarter. The company is debt-free and generates nearly all its sales in the U.S., insulating its earnings from the foreign currency headwinds facing many other large consumer companies. …”9. Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) is a leading restaurant operator that either franchises or operates around 53,000 restaurants under various company brands such as KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and more. On 11/2, Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) reported Q3 adjusted EPS of $1.09 versus the consensus estimate of $1.14 given the strong U.S. dollar. Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) sales, however, were above expectations as consumers have not pulled back spending as much as expected.8. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is a leading restaurant operator and franchisor that could potentially benefit from high inflation if enough consumers choose to go to McDonald's rather than more expensive restaurants. Although a recession would still be a headwind for McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), shares of the stock have rallied 2.9% year to date as investors anticipate the company's business to remain relatively steady. On 10/28, Christpher Carril of RBC Capital raised his price target on McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) to $295 from $275 and kept an 'Outperform' rating on shares.7. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is a leading coffee chain whose shares have fallen 22.5% year to date given the broader market weakness and recession worries.

HRB, ParkerHannifin Corp. PH, Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. ADM, Insperity Inc. NSP and McKesson Corp. MCK.Top 5 Dividend Stocks to Cheer You Up This Holiday SeasonDividend investing remains a popular strategy for investors even in the face of rising yields. The Fed has raised interest rates by 75 bps for the fourth consecutive time. This is the sixth rate hike this year and has pushed the yields to elevated levels.Although dividend does not offer dramatic price appreciation, the strategy is a major source of consistent income for investors to create wealth when returns from the equity market are at risk. Currently, the stock market is struggling with low economic growth, slowing payroll growth and four-decade-high inflation.Stocks with a strong history of dividend growth year over year form a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those that have high yields. We have selected five dividend growth stocks — H&amp;R Block Inc., ParkerHannifin Corp., Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., Insperity Inc. and McKesson Corp. — that could be compelling picks for your portfolio ahead of the holiday season.Why Dividend Growth?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future.Story continuesMoreover, a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields. Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.Here are five of the 21 stocks that fit the bill:Missouri-based H&amp;R Block is a leading provider of tax preparation services.

82,f2b677e3-18d0-3348-957c-53d942195f79,HST,2022-11-09,Top 10 Leisure Companies in the World in 2022,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-10-leisure-companies-world-234321820.html,1667951001,STORY,"['CUK', 'IHG', 'MGM', 'HST']","[In this article, we discuss the top 10 leisure companies in the world in 2022. You can skip our comprehensive analysis about the leisure industry and go directly to Top 5 Leisure Companies in the World. The onset of coronavirus had wreaked havoc on most businesses across the world, but none felt the jitters harder than the global leisure &amp; hospitality industry, with some of its biggest names failing to make it to the top 500 in Forbes’ 2021 ranking of world’s largest public companies.According to a US Joint Economic Committee report, the leisure &amp; hospitality industry had experienced steady growth from 12.9 million workers in 2010 to 16.9 million at the beginning of 2020. But Covid-19 pandemic disrupted this trend when in April 2020 employment had dropped sharply, reaching levels that had not been seen since the 1980s.The impact of Covid-19 on leisure &amp; hospitality businesses can be gauged from the fact that the industry made up 40pc of all job losses at the height of the pandemic (February 2020 to April 2020), according to the report.In 2021, however, the downtrend slowly started shifting mainly due to an overall drop in Covid fatalities which led to ease in travel restrictions across the world, resulting in leisure &amp; hospitality companies seeing considerable improvements in their financials. Although Delta and Omicron variants slowed the recovery in some regions earlier this year, recent leisure spending trends show that it won’t take long for leisure businesses, particularly those operating in the US and Europe, to regain their pre-pandemic market share.As per Deloitte’s Consumer Tracker, total net leisure spending jumped three percentage points in the first quarter of 2022 compared to -10pc in Q4 2021. This uptick was in part driven by school half-term breaks but also by the loosening, or even the entire removal, of Covid-19 entry requirements in many popular international destinations.Story continuesWith further ease in restrictions in the offing, analysts predict air travel to soar and demand for both hotels and private rentals to remain strong moving forward.Top 10 Leisure Companies in the World in 2022Credit: Park Hotels &amp; ResortsAccording to the US Travel Association’s June report, travel spending ($100 billion) was 3pc more in April 2022 as compared to 2019 pre-pandemic levels. However, overseas visitation was still 43pc below 2019 levels, albeit European markets vastly improved and were down just 34pc of 2019 levels.As businesses operating in western markets are cautiously making their way back to pre-pandemic levels, the same cannot be said about leisure businesses operating in Asian markets, which remain down largely due to restrictions in individual countries.An Asian Development Bank (ADP) report  published in March 2022 concluded that popular tourist hubs like Hong Kong and Macau – latter  being home to some of the biggest casinos owned by US companies, may continue with the downtrend amidst Covid restrictions in vogue in China.Despite recent travel trends showing improvements in leisure activities across the world, it is safe to say that the industry’s revival, at least in Asia, would still rely heavily on potential lockdowns and restrictions.With that said, let's take a peek at the world’s top 10 leisure companies in the world in 2022, see how they fared amidst post-pandemic relaxations, and evaluate their operational preparedness to cope with any potential challenges in the near future.Top 10 Leisure Companies in the World10. InterContinental Hotels Group PLC (NYSE:IHG)Market Cap: $9.95 Billion British hospitality giant InterContinental Hotels Group PLC (NYSE: IHG) operates mainstream, upscale and luxury hotels under various brands across the world.Like many on this list, IHG cashed in on the reopening of the U.S. and European markets this year, witnessing a steady growth in performance and posting a positive outlook for the future.The group in its first quarter 2022 results reported a 61pc year-on-year jump in revenue per available room (RevPAR), attaining 82pc of 2019 level.Among its segments, the group’s Q1 RevPAR for ‘The Americas’ was up 58pc vs 2021 (down 8pc vs 2019) with close to 60pc occupancy rate, while Q1 RevPAR for ‘EMEAA Region’ was up 122pc vs 2021 (down 33pc vs 2019) with occupancy approaching 50pc.Trading in Greater China, however, continued to be impacted by restrictions put in place to control rising Covid cases. The company’s Q1 RevPAR for ‘Greater China’ segment remained 7pc down as compared to 2021 (-42pc vs 2019) with occupancy at 36pc.Keith Barr, Chief Executive Officer at IHG Hotels &amp; Resorts, noted that higher occupancy levels (in the US &amp; Europe) was indicative of increased pricing power. In March, IHG hotels in the U.S. achieved leisure rates up by more than 10pc on 2019 levels while rate across the whole of the U.S. business was 4pc ahead.Citing growth in corporate bookings and a surge in leisure activities as reasons, the company sees further progress in both occupancy and rate in the coming quarters.Headquartered in Buckinghamshire, England, InterContinental Hotels Group PLC owns and operates a portfolio of hotel businesses across The Americas; Europe, Middle East Asia and Africa (EMEAA), and Greater China.

Scheduled passenger numbers are forecasted to reach 3.8 billion and yields are expected to increase 5.6%. In 2022, industry revenues are expected to touch $782 billion, up 54.5% as compared to 2021 and 93.3% of the 2019 levels. The number of flights operated in 2022 will amount to 33.8 million as per IATA, which is 86.9% of 2019 levels, when total flights amounted to 38.9 million. Overall, expenses are expected to climb to $796 billion, which is a 44% increase as compared to 2021, reflecting the costs of expanding operations and the inflationary impact.IATA expects that the airline industry will be profitable in 2023 as pent-up travel demand leads to higher airline bookings even as the global economy weakens. Bloomberg cited IATA Director General Willie Walsh, who told a group of airline chiefs in June 2022: “Industry-wide profit should be on the horizon in 2023. We are rebounding. By next year, most markets should see traffic reach or exceed pre-pandemic levels.”While Walsh did not overlook the harsh economic and political climate, he noted that “the desire to travel and the necessity of moving goods are both solid.” The North American market is on its way to profitability, and airlines are forecasted to collectively report a net income of $8.8 billion this year.

Shares of low-cost airline Allegiant Travel were weak as higher fuel and labor costs pressured profitability and recession fears weighed on market sentiment.

(PM) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/philip-morris-international-inc-pm-140002461.html,1667916002,STORY,['PM'],"[Philip Morris (PM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this seller of Marlboro and other cigarette brands have returned +8.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Tobacco industry, which Philip Morris falls in, has gained 6.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Philip Morris is expected to post earnings of $1.33 per share, indicating a change of -1.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.1% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $5.80 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -4.6%. This estimate has changed +2.6% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.65 indicates a change of -2.7% from what Philip Morris is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.1%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Philip Morris is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Philip Morris, the consensus sales estimate of $7.43 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -8.3%. The $30.16 billion and $29.72 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -4% and -1.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPhilip Morris reported revenues of $8.03 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.1%. EPS of $1.53 for the same period compares with $1.58 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.23 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +11.16%. The EPS surprise was +10.87%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Philip Morris is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Philip Morris. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for AerSale Corporation: favorable.

Its fiscal third-quarter results are likely to be boosted by growth in air travel demand.Power &amp; Control Segment Poised to Boost RevenuesThe continued recovery in the commercial aerospace industry, particularly the increase in the utilization of narrowbody aircraft and air cargo demand and the resulting higher flight hours, must have boosted organic sales of TDG’s commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket businesses in the fiscal fourth quarter. This, in turn, is expected to have contributed to the company’s Power &amp; Control segment revenues in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.Also, solid bookings in the prior quarters are projected to have benefited defense revenues within this segment in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Power &amp; Control segment’s fiscal fourth-quarter revenues, pegged at $802 million, suggests an improvement of 17.9% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Transdigm Group Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseTransdigm Group Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseTransdigm Group Incorporated price-eps-surprise | Transdigm Group Incorporated QuoteAirframe Segment – Another Revenue ContributorSolid air travel demand in recent times, along with a higher volume of narrow-body aircraft deliveries by aircraft manufacturers to airlines, must have bolstered top-line growth of the company’s Aiframe segment in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Airframe segment’s fiscal fourth-quarter revenues, pegged at $654 million, suggests an improvement of 17.6% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Q4 EstimatesWith the majority of TransDigm Group’s segments anticipated to report an improvement in sales, it makes one optimistic about strong growth in the top line of the company in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Goldman Sachs Semiconductor Stocks: Top 5 Picks. As per Washington-based Semiconductor Industry Association, global semiconductor sales dropped 3% in September compared to last year, and Korean chipmakers produced 3.5% less than a year earlier in September. The Korean economy, which is highly dependent on the semiconductor industry, experienced low demand given weakening currencies, high trade deficits, and tightening interest rates around the world. Meanwhile, the Biden administration is trying to boost investments in US chipmaking, in order to compete with China and to manufacture components essential for national security. The US effort increased after the semiconductor industry faced massive shortages in late 2020 and 2021, which revealed how essential chips were in the digital economy, for the production of everything from cars to smartphones. The most recent effort to help establish the US semiconductor industry is the CHIPS Act, which lent $39 billion in government funding for the local semiconductor manufacturing plants, in addition to billions of dollars for research and development initiatives.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is planning to construct a second US plant next to a $12 billion complex it is already building, which will advance American efforts to support local chipmaking. To benefit from the ongoing semiconductor initiatives amid lower competition from Korean and Chinese manufacturers, some of the best semiconductor stocks to consider according to investment firm Goldman Sachs are Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM). Our Methodology We selected the top 10 semiconductor stocks from the Goldman Sachs portfolio as of the end of the second quarter of 2022 for this analysis. Insider Monkey’s database of 895 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2022 was used to assess the hedge fund sentiment around the securities. Story continuesGoldman Sachs Semiconductor Stocks: Top 10 PicksPhoto by Redd on UnsplashGoldman Sachs Semiconductor Stocks: Top Picks10. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65Goldman Sachs’ Stake Value: $535,779,000Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is a California-based multinational technology corporation that operates in the semiconductors, computer hardware, autonomous cars, automation, and artificial intelligence sectors. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is one of the elite Goldman Sachs semiconductor stocks to monitor, with the firm holding 14.3 million shares worth nearly $536 million, representing 0.12% of the total securities. On October 31, Citi analyst Christopher Danely maintained a Neutral rating on Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) but lowered the price target on the shares to $27 from $30. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) posted mixed results and guided well below consensus due to the PC downturn, the analyst told investors. The company also disclosed a cost control plan, ""which should help but doesn't help the core problems of manufacturing and wasting money on growth markets that will never pan out,"" added the analyst.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 65 hedge funds were long Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) at the end of June 2022, compared to 76 funds in the last quarter. David Blood and Al Gore’s Generation Investment Management held the largest stake in the company, comprising 14.7 million shares worth $552.5 million. Like Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is one of the favorite semiconductor picks of elite hedge funds. Here is what Baron Funds specifically said about Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Then, there is the case of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). A blue-chip tech champion with a market capitalization of over $500 billion in early 2000, the stock was trading at a P/E multiple of 42. It was a fast-growing company whose stock price and multiple declined more or less in line with its peers. However, unlike Google, Intel’s net income has grown from $7.3 billion in 1999 to $19.9 billion in 2021, a compounded annual growth rate of just 4.7%. Its growth from the dot com era has not proven to be durable, and Intel has yet to trade at the price it attained in 1999.”9. Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63Goldman Sachs’ Stake Value: $569,242,000Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) is a Delaware-based company that designs, develops, and sells analog, mixed-signal, digital signal processing, embedded, and standalone integrated circuits. In Q2 2022, Goldman Sachs owned more than 13 million shares of Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) worth $569.2 million, representing 0.12% of the total portfolio. On October 18, Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore maintained a Buy recommendation on Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) but lowered the price target on the shares to $55 from $65. Fears of fundamental deterioration are ""leading to very bearish investor positioning"" into the Q3 results for semiconductors, the analyst told investors in a research note. According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 63 hedge funds were long Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL), with combined stakes worth $1.6 billion, compared to 63 funds in the prior quarter worth $2.4 billion. Paul Marshall and Ian Wace’s Marshall Wace LLP is the biggest position holder in the company, with approximately 5 million shares worth $214 million. Here is what Carillon Tower Advisers specifically said about Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) provides infrastructure semiconductor solutions. Investors have recently become concerned about the semiconductor cycle and how demand for Marvell’s products will fare in a slowing economic environment. We remain confident that the company’s portfolio of products is extremely important in parts of the datacenter server market, which remains healthy and possesses long-term secular trends. The company also has secured strong contract wins in upcoming global 5G wireless infrastructure build-outs, which are generally insulated from macroeconomic pressures. With supply chain issues easing, we believe Marvell remains in a strong position to post continued robust growth.”8.

It specialises in process management and control in semiconductor manufacturing and the related nanoelectronics industries. During manufacturing processes, products must be inspected for defects and correct critical dimensions in order to identify and eliminate possible sources of problems. As customers continue to enforce Moore’s Law, smaller chips must meet more precise specifications, which in turn increases the need for advanced inspection and diagnostic tools. This is a key step within the entire manufacturing process and one in which the company has built a very strong, and in places dominant, global position.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Goldman Sachs Energy Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks. Jan Hatzius, Goldman Sachs’ chief economist, noted that there is a “very plausible” scenario where the US economy can steer clear of a recession, regardless of the Federal Reserve's hawkish interest rate tightening and geopolitical unrest. On November 7, Goldman Sachs reaffirmed a 35% probability that the US economy will experience a slowdown in the next year, which is decidedly below Wall Street estimates. Jan Hatzius said that the path to growth “has already occurred, and it looks durable.”Goldman Sachs believes that a soft landing is possible, which means that inflation will slow down and the economy will continue to grow, and the investment firm cited a slowdown in nominal wage growth as the key indicator for this scenario. Jan Hatzius also mentioned October payroll numbers, supplier deliveries, second-hand car auction prices, and rents on new leases as some other reasons to expect reduced inflation. However, Goldman Sachs’ opinion is not popular on Wall Street. A majority of the economists believe that the United States will slip into a recession for the Fed to finally control mounting prices. In this uncertain macro environment, it is a good idea to look for defensive sectors as a safe haven for investments, with energy being one of them. Keeping that in mind, we reviewed the Goldman Sachs equity portfolio for the second quarter of 2022 and some of the top Goldman Sachs energy stocks were Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH), and Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET). Our Methodology We selected the top 10 energy stock picks from the Goldman Sachs stock portfolio as of the end of the second quarter of 2022 for this analysis. Insider Monkey’s database of 895 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2022 was used to assess the hedge fund sentiment around the securities. Story continuesGoldman Sachs Energy Stocks: Top 10 Stock PicksPhoto by David Thielen on UnsplashGoldman Sachs Energy Stocks: Top Stock Picks10.

He believes the ""Option Value"" of energy is up again, supported by a limited capital cycle. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 65 hedge funds were bullish on Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE:LNG) at the end of the second quarter of 2022, compared to 62 funds in the prior quarter. Carl Icahn’s Icahn Capital LP is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 5.6 million shares worth $746.5 million. Like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH), and Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET), Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE:LNG) is one of the top energy stocks from the Goldman Sachs portfolio. Here is what ClearBridge Global Infrastructure Value Strategy has to say about Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE:LNG) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“Cheniere Energy is an energy infrastructure company that owns and operates U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facilities. Strong quarterly results and the disclosure of capital allocation policies were positively received by the markets. In addition, continued supply and demand tightness in the LNG market created a favorable commodity price environment.”9. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Goldman Sachs’ Stake Value: $413,720,000Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) is a London-based energy and petrochemical company that operates worldwide via Integrated Gas, Upstream, Marketing, Chemicals and Products, and Renewables and Energy Solutions segments. On October 27, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) declared a $0.50 per average diluted share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on December 19, to shareholders of record on November 11. The company also announced $4 billion in share buybacks and plans to raise the dividend by 15% in the fourth quarter of 2022. Securities filings for Q2 2022 reveal that Goldman Sachs owned 7.9 million shares of Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) worth $413.72 million, representing 0.09% of the total holdings. On November 6, Goldman Sachs analyst Michele Della Vigna downgraded Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $76, down from $79. The analyst cited valuation for the downgrade after the stock's outperformance. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL)’s continuous improvement in corporate returns and historically high cash flow has resulted in a ""relatively expensive valuation"" versus peers, the analyst wrote in a research note. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 39 hedge funds were bullish on Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) at the end of June 2022, compared to 37 funds in the preceding quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 20.25 million shares worth $1.06 billion. Here is what Harding Loevner International Equity Fund has to say about Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“While risks of unforeseen consequences arising from the Ukraine conflict are high, on this front we are cautiously optimistic that China will work hard to maintain its neutrality in a credible way, as it is a huge beneficiary of trade with the rest of the world, especially the rich developed nations. We think it likely that China, along with India, will continue to buy oil and gas from Russia (just as Europe, at least for now, plans to keep its gas pipelines open), and do not expect that fact to alter China’s trade relations with the West much. Nevertheless, we must contemplate that our optimism is misplaced on the importance of membership in the global network of exchange. If our central and optimistic case—admittedly an educated guess—is wrong, then we’d need to greatly modify our views of which companies in our opportunity set will face new barriers to profitable growth, and which might stand to benefit, relatively, from a further receding of globalization. (Global trade, after all, has never matched the peak share of GDP it reached in 2008, before the Global Financial Crisis.) We’d expect such a world to be less efficient, as the cold logic of comparative advantage is demoted as a determinant of which goods or services are produced and where. That would lead to a less prosperous world, since exploiting comparative advantage is a cornerstone of wealth creation. If regional blocs began to raise limits on the movement of capital as well as goods, we’d need to parse which of our multinational companies were at risk of declining sales from increasingly hostile, siloed countries. Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:SHEL) has found its Siberian oil and gas joint venture assets stranded by the combination of sanctions and the public opprobrium of Russia’s actions.”8. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71Goldman Sachs’ Stake Value: $628,774,000ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is a Texas-based company that produces, transports, distributes, and markets crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, liquefied natural gas, and natural gas liquids worldwide. In Q2 2022, Goldman Sachs owned more than 7 million ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) shares worth $628.8 million, representing 0.14% of the total portfolio. It is one of the premier Goldman Sachs energy stocks to monitor. On November 3, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) declared a $0.51 per share quarterly dividend, a 10.9% increase from its prior dividend of $0.46. The dividend is payable on December 1, to shareholders of record on November 15. The company also announced that the board of directors approved a $20 billion increase in the current share repurchase program to $45 billion. Truist analyst Neal Dingmann on November 7 raised the price target on ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) to $167 from $149 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares after its Q3 earnings beat. The company's financial and operational positions are ""enviable"" with almost no debt, record production, and quality inventory, the analyst told investors in a research note. Although there has been some investor pushback given ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) stock hit a recent all-time high, he believes that the valuation ""still looks very reasonable"".According to Insider Monkey’s data, 71 hedge funds were long ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) at the end of June 2022, compared to 67 funds in the prior quarter. Ric Dillon’s Diamond Hill Capital is one of the leading position holders in the company, with 6.58 million shares worth approximately $592 million. Diamond Hill Capital made the following comment about ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“On an individual holdings basis, top contributors to return included oil and gas producer ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and global technology company Nasdaq.The rising price of both oil and natural gas has allowed ConocoPhillips to continue reporting strong earnings and cash flow growth even as the economic outlook becomes more uncertain. We continue to believe the company is an outstanding operator with a strong balance sheet and assets concentrated in well understood jurisdictions. While supply chain tightness has driven input prices higher within the industry, ConocoPhillips has kept its production and capex guidance steady for the full year as its longer-term service contracts help it push costs out into the future as compared to smaller competitors.”7. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59Goldman Sachs’ Stake Value: $840,667,000Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is one of the top Goldman Sachs energy stocks to monitor.

According to Insider Monkey’s data, 59 hedge funds were bullish on Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) at the end of June 2022, compared to 53 funds in the last quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway held the biggest stake in the company, with 161.4 million shares worth $23.3 billion. Diamond Hill Capital mentioned Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) in its Q1 2022 investor letter.

The company benefited from increased energy demand as COVID-related economic restrictions eased in tandem with concerns regarding supply interruptions related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.”6. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59Goldman Sachs’ Stake Value: $867,952,000Another prominent Goldman Sachs energy pick is NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), a Florida-based company that generates, transmits, and distributes electric power to retail and wholesale customers in North America.

(NYSE:NEE) worth $868 million, representing 0.19% of the total securities. On October 24, Guggenheim analyst Shahriar Pourreza reiterated a Buy rating on NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) but lowered the price target on the shares to $99 from $108. The analyst updated select estimates ahead of Q3 earnings season from the Power and Utilities group to reflect ""known and measurable year-over-year items"", to adjust for seasonality, and to re-mark to the latest commodity curves. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 59 hedge funds were long NextEra Energy, Inc.

(NASDAQ:ENPH), and Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET), NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is one of the top energy stock picks of elite hedge funds. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and NextEra Energy, Inc.

Here is what the fund said:“We increased our exposure to the energy transition during the quarter with new positions in Iberdrola (OTCPK:IBDSF), a Spanish-based integrated utility that is also one of the leading renewable energy developers in the world, and NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), an integrated utility business with a regulated utility operating in Florida and the largest wind business in the U.S. The war has opened the eyes of the world that energy independence is critical. Renewables are for many countries the only way to get to the target. It is expected that existing renewable project pipelines will be executed faster, and more projects added to existing pipelines.The energy transition would be extremely helpful for climate change and Iberdrola ranks well on our ESG matrix. NextEra, meanwhile, recently raised future earnings forecasts, citing a very favorable macro environment for rapid renewable generation expansion driven by decarbonization of the U.S. economy and the relative attractiveness of renewable generation in the context of high natural gas and power prices.” Click to continue reading and see Goldman Sachs Energy Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks.  Suggested articles:12 Best Financial Dividend Stocks To Buy10 Best Auto Stocks To Buy10 Most Undervalued Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None.

If you want to see more of the best blue chip stocks with strong balance sheets, go directly to 5 Best Blue Chip Stocks With Strong Balance Sheets.Companies with strong balance sheets have more flexibility in challenging times.With more cash on their balance sheets and not as much debt relative to their earnings power, fiscally strong companies can buy back more stock at lower valuations.With M&amp;A, fiscally strong companies can expand by buying companies with weaker balance sheets. Many fiscally strong companies can also gain market share by spending more on R&amp;D or marketing during tough times.A company with a strong balance sheet generally has substantial net cash on its balance sheet. If it does have net debt, a fiscally strong company will have substantial earnings and cash flow to be able to cover its net debt.Fiscally strong companies sometimes have a net debt position because the cost of debt was very affordable when interest rates were low and those companies decided they could add more value if they returned more capital back to shareholders rather than keep it on their balance sheets.2022Given the high inflation, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times in 2022 alone. With the Federal Reserve expected to continue to raise interest rates and with a potential recession in 2023, it could get tougher before it gets better.In the challenging times, blue chip companies with strong balance sheets can offer potential long term value for shareholders given lower valuations and potential value adding expansion opportunities.In the near to medium terms, however, there could be more downside to the market and individual stocks if economic data fails to meet expectations.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Story continuesMethodologyFor our list of 10 Best Blue Chip Stocks With Strong Balance Sheets, we chose 10 leading stocks with strong balance sheets and strong competitive advantages.Using the collective wisdom of hedge funds, we ranked the 10 stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that held shares of the same stock at the end of Q2 2022.10 Best Blue Chip Stocks With Strong Balance Sheets10.

It has one of the more diversified and attractive pharmaceutical portfolios and an improving medical technology business, and it will soon be exiting the lower-growth consumer business. We believe new management has sharpened the strategy to improve execution in the medical device business and look for more meaningful capital allocation opportunities, which the balance sheet can easily support. Johnson &amp; Johnson’s products and services have a clear positive impact on human health. The company’s long-held credo sets the tone for ethical business practices and considering all stakeholders in guiding its decision making and prioritizing patients and caregivers. The company also contributes to 11 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGS) through its Health for Humanity 2025 goals.6. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

(NYSE:JPM) had a standardized CET1 capital ratio of 12.5% and an advanced CET1 capital ratio of 13%. The company also paid a common dividend of $3 billion given its excess cash generation.Vltava Fund commented on JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) in a Q3 2022 investor letter,We regard JPM to be the strongest and best- managed bank in the world. It is a leader in investment banking, commercial banking, credit cards, and asset management. Its size (the largest bank in the USA, with nearly USD 4,000 billion in assets) and diversification give it a strong competitive advantage that is compounded by its cost advantages and the high costs to clients associated with switching banks. JPM’s management prides itself on running the only large bank to avoid major instability over the long term. JP Morgan’s quality and strength first became fully evident in 2008 under the leadership of its CEO Jamie Dimon. Not only did JP Morgan help to stabilize the market by taking over the failing Bear Stearns in the spring of that year, but throughout the Great Financial Crisis it was the only big US bank that did not require government assistance and it was highly profitable even in the difficult year of 2008. A well-functioning and efficient bank can be a very good long-term investment, because the interest compounding effect works well here. JPM’s return on equity (ROE) is well into the double digits and this puts it in a good position to continue producing better long-term returns than does the market. JPM has been very profitable even during years when interest rates were close to zero. The current – and perhaps not temporary – return to somewhat more normal, higher interest rates should have a significantly positive impact on the bank’s interest income and overall profitability.”Like JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc.

However, earnings were up 24.4% year over year. Unfavorable currency movements and higher operating expenses hurt earnings in the quarter, which was offset by strategic pricing initiatives undertaken by management. Excluding the negative currency impact, earnings rose 44.4%.Net sales increased 5.5% year over year to $1.10 billion but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14 billion. Excluding the negative currency impact, earnings rose 12.3%. The upside was driven by sales from the newly-acquired HRA Pharma, strong demand for cough/cold products globally and higher demand for infant formula in the United States. These were partially offset by unfavorable currency movements and divested Latin American businesses. Organic net sales (excluding the effects of acquisitions and divestitures and the impact of currency) were up 7.7% year over year.Segment DiscussionPerrigo reports its results under the following segments — Consumer Self Care Americas (“CSCA”) and Consumer Self Care International (“CSCI”). Per management, the company gained market share in both business segments during the quarter, as compared to the year-ago period.CSCA: Net sales of the segment in the third quarter of 2022 came in at $722.3 million, up 4% year over year. Sales increased due to strategic price increases, strong demand for store-brand infant formula and new product launches.CSCI: The segment reported net sales of $377.9 million, up 8.4% from the year-ago period. At constant-currency (cc) rates, sales were up 28.6% year over year. Organically sales increased 8.3%. Segment revenues benefitted from the higher sales of HRA Pharma brands, strong demand for cough/cold products and Women’s Health products, partially offset by lower sales of products from the Healthy Lifestyle category. Sales were negatively impacted by unfavorable currency movement.Story continues2022 Guidance RevisedPerrigo lowered its earnings guidance for 2022. The company now expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $2.00-$2.10, down from the previous guidance of $2.25-$2.35, to account for the worse-than-previously-expected impact of currency translation.Shares of Perrigo were down 7% in pre-market trading on Nov 8, likely due to a slash in earnings guidance for the full year.

This compares to earnings of $0.45 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -15.15%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this drug company would post earnings of $0.44 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.43, delivering a surprise of -2.27%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.Perrigo , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Products industry, posted revenues of $1.1 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.28%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.04 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Perrigo shares have added about 1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -20.1%.What's Next for Perrigo?While Perrigo has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Perrigo: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.80 on $1.18 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.23 on $4.51 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Medical - Products is currently in the bottom 44% of the 250 plus Zacks industries.

How's that for a six pack? Anheuser-Busch joining the sports and business icons and buying a Major League pickleball team, the first Fortune 500 company to buy a team. Let's talk about it with Matt Davis, Anheuser-Busch, head of US sports marketing sponsorships.Matt, great to have you here, my man. Very exciting-- fastest growing sport in the country by far. What's the business play, though? Why buy a team and not just sponsor it?MATT DAVIS: Yeah, it's a great, great question. Appreciate you having me. I'm excited to be here and talk about it. The play for us has always been the same. We want to meet fans where they are and drive excitement with our brands.What we found with Major League pickleball is that we can bring more to the table than what a traditional sponsorship would afford. We can help them with scale, with connecting with consumers, with finding ways to expand the reach of pickleball to those fans maybe that haven't been approached to it previously and in doing so, really drive excitement inside of the world of pickleball, but the larger ecosystem of sports, that we've been dominant in for the past several decades. And so for us, it was an amazing opportunity to do something that was bigger and really become a new driver of innovation as we look to new and emerging sports, moving forward.- And that something near and dear to my heart, the World Cup. And we know that Budweiser is the official beer sponsor for it. But talk about how you're navigating, this trying to sell beer in a place where you can't advertise, that where there's sort of limited opportunities for fans to even drink during the matches.MATT DAVIS: Yeah, sure, we've been working very closely with those on the ground to make sure that we can do so in ways that are complimentary to the fan experience overall. But really for us, the big opportunity for the World Cup is all of the fan bases across the entire globe. How can we be as relevant as possible for all of those in Brazil or America or Belgium to really take and amplify the teams that they love and make them tangible for them in their home countries?Story continues- But in Qatar, and we're less than two weeks out, in Qatar, what are your expectations as far as consumption, versus recent World Cups? And can you talk about some of the complications that Rochelle was alluding to in terms of selling it, where you sell it, how you market it, and even how you ship it to Qatar?MATT DAVIS: Sure. There's definitely been some additional paths for us to work through. But every piece of the organization has been working with us to make sure we do so in ways that are respective-- respectful of their current processes, as well as where we need to achieve as a business. There's places inside the stadium that have been designated as areas that we have product, as well as certain hotels.And then also, one of our main products, Budweiser Zero, which has a non-alcoholic component for Budweiser flagship, is also more available than the other brands across stadiums and the market, as well as airlines. So it's a huge opportunity for us to also get a product that is massive for us globally and a big bet in front of more consumers.- And so England fans will be doing their part to guzzle as much beer as they can. But I also want to talk about your advertising on Netflix, obviously Netflix adding its ad supported tier. And you're going to be the first to have a beer spot with this new tier. Tell us about that and how this really plays into to your growth story.MATT DAVIS: Sure. I think it's a similar strategy as what you see with us doing with Major League pickleball. At the end of the day, we're an advertiser. But the average consumer and the average fans today don't want to be interrupted in how they engage their entertainment. And so for us, it's how can we be more involved in the places that they want to seek out and gain content and integrating ad-complementary benefits to the places they're already consuming entertainment?Netflix was an amazing example of doing that. They have a huge fan base of people that come to the platform on a regular basis. And for us to be able to integrate into that platform in a way that we hope to continuously evolve to be complementary to the entertainment, as opposed to just an interruption, is really the game plan for us holistically.- And there's also the Super Bowl. And for as long as I can remember, Anheuser-Busch has been the face of commercials for the Super Bowl. This is the first time that I can recall where you're not the exclusive beer advertisers, whether it's WhatsApp or Budweiser, which is a legend, and the Clydesdales. I mean, all the commercials are, essentially, yours that are iconic. How does that indicate the move forward for Anheuser-Busch in terms of your ad spend and marketing?MATT DAVIS: Yeah, it's a great question. It's one we've gotten a few times now. The Super Bowl will still be a massive opportunity for us and one that we're going to be dominating on. We're still going to be the biggest beer spender and one of the biggest spenders inside of the Super Bowl across the entire portfolio. So you'll still see our brands on game day.I think the big piece for us is the evolution of the strategy in terms of meeting the fans where they are. And so while the big sports and the big moments will still be a dominant place for us to show up, it's about finding those other opportunities over the summer which are key beer-selling opportunities for us, as well as finding the new and emerging platforms to make sure we're diversifying and meeting the fans where they are, engaging in the content in a way that meets the channels that they're most used to and kind of seek out on their own.- And how do you plan on innovating in that space? Will people, at some point, be able to sort of, while they're watching the game or while they're watching Netflix, be able to sort of click and order a beer from their couch? What are we looking at?MATT DAVIS: I sure hope so. I think that's really where we want to go. And if you look at our DTC partners, ordering beer has become easier than ever at home through different channels. And I think for us, it's a matter of, how can we keep connecting those channels back to the way that fans are engaging with content, to make that entire consumer journey as seamless as possible?I think over the past two years, fans have gotten much more accustomed to ordering things back to their house. And so as technology continues to improve and as the platforms continue to evolve, how we can integrate into those platforms and drive our sales, I think, will make everyone's lives a lot more seamless and a big opportunity for our company.- Cheers to you, sir. Matt Davis, Anheuser-Busch, head of US sports marketing and sponsorships, appreciate you being with us. Best of luck, moving forward. OK, Seana, I'm curious. Your thoughts? Matt convinced me. I actually think it's a terrible investment to bet on the future of--- OK, you're coming clean.- --pickleball except for Budweiser. I think that's the only one of that group that I mentioned that makes sense because they can, in his words, meet the customer where they are. I don't get it from Marc Lasry or Gary V or Tom Brady, or anybody else.- I think it makes a lot of sense, especially when you take a look at the popularity of pickleball, you can see he explained very, very well the opportunity that the company sees in this space. But I got to bring up your impersonation of the ""whassup.""- Whassup!- But you lost me after that. It's the only thing I can think of.]"

And sources tell the Wall Street Journal that Netflix is considering offering live sports on the platform. Now Netflix previously bid on streaming rights for the ATP tennis tour before pulling out. And also last year, Netflix was in talks to buy the World Surf League, but then they couldn't agree on a price.Now, so far, Netflix has used the documentary approach with shows like ""The Last Dance"" with Michael Jordan and ""Formula One, Drive to Survive"" to really have this foray into sports. Now, they lost out to the live US streaming rights of Formula One to Disney's ESPN. And of course, it's the sky high bidding wars for major sports leagues and events between the streaming giants that's reportedly giving CEO Reed Hastings pause.Now, smaller, lesser known sports could be an avenue for Netflix to enter and grow some of these niche franchises and create new tournaments. And of course, after the success that Amazon has had with Thursday Night Football, you have to think if the price is right, Seana, a Netflix clearly seems to be more open to the idea.SEANA SMITH: It was interesting. I was a little taken aback that Reed Hastings-- really, when you take a look at Netflix, maybe their strategy here is to go for some of those lower profile leagues because I think the massive issue that is facing Netflix is, obviously, market saturation. And they're doing-- they would be making this move in order to attract new users. And I think you do that by going by the top leagues. You're going to have to pay top dollar, but that's how you're going to get more and more users to your platform. So I would think it would make the most sense investment wise in the long run. But what do you think, Dave?DAVE BRIGGS: Oh, I've just been pleading for this for years and waiting for this to finally happen. And look, they can't play in the sandbox, the NFL, Major League Baseball, and HLNBA. Where they're talking is perfect because those are sticky viewers. That's what they need and they just don't have right now. They have fickle viewers that cancel and resubscribe. If they get those smaller leagues, they get sticky.SEANA SMITH: More of a positive spin. I don't know. We'll see how it all plays out.]"

If you want to skip the detailed analysis of the copper market and its recent trends, go directly to the 5 Best Copper Stocks to Buy Now.Copper is one of the main drivers in the global economy due to its vast applications in several industries. Data Bridge Market Research analysis shows that the global copper market was valued at $304.79 billion in 2021 and is expected to reach $453.756 billion by 2029 at a CAGR of 5.10%. According to the executive co-chair of Ivanhoe Mines Ltd., Robert Friedland, copper is one of the essential commodities to combat climate change. He said:""We're not going to have clean air or make a meaningful impact on the climate, nor are we going to be able to act on the so-called inflation reduction bill [in the U.S.], without a massive increase in demand for the copper metal.""According to MiningIntelligence data, in 2021, Chile’s Codelco produced the most significant amount of copper with 1,728 kt, followed by Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX) with 1,210 kt, and third place was secured by Glencore plc (OTC:GLNCY) with 1,196 kt of copper in 2021. You can check out the following article for a list of the biggest copper producing countries. Recent TrendsCopper hit a record peak in May 2021 at $10,747.50 per ton. However, it faced the most significant price drop since 2011 in July 2022. In mid-July, the three-month price of copper on the London Metal Exchange was at $7,341 per ton. ANZ Bank strategist Daniel Hynes said that the copper market’s performance depends on how the global sentiment changes as U.S. Federal Reserve hikes interest rates. However, the supply constraints are expected to keep the market tight. He further added that the outlook still “looks promising.” A problematic factor in the copper market is Chile’s recent move toward the tax reform bill, which would increase the mining royalties on any company that produces over 50,000 metric tons per annum. The government is looking toward raising taxes for high earners to fund its social reforms and programs. This tax reform bill could substantially affect copper prices as Chile is the largest copper producer in the world.Story continuesLooking ForwardAccording to S&amp;P Global, decarbonization will require massive amounts of copper, which will increase its demand in the future. However, companies have avoided exploring and developing new copper projects in the last decade as they take decades to achieve commercial production. S&amp;P Global predicts that there will be a shortage of 1.6 million tonnes by 2035. The more pessimistic prediction is that the deficit could reach 9.9 million tonnes. Daniel Yergin, vice chair of S&amp;P Global, said:""The challenge is that if current trends continue ... there's a huge gap. And even if you put on your roller skates and your jet burner [to realize optimistic supply growth], and everything goes right, there's still a gap, because it's enormous. And it's important to recognize that now, not in 2035.""Earlier in April, the CEO of Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO) spoke to a panel about the upcoming ""massive deficit"" of copper supplies in the next three years. Jeff Currie, global head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs, agreed with the statement and added that the expected deficit drives the firm's $15000 per ton price target. Currie further explained that the deficit has already been flagged by numerous people. However, the market has not priced it in yet because the commodities market doesn't price in expectations.During these bearish times for copper, some of the best copper stocks still remain stable due to their fundamentals.

We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for General Dynamics The ModelWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.98bUS$4.33bUS$4.48bUS$4.98bUS$5.26bUS$5.50bUS$5.71bUS$5.89bUS$6.06bUS$6.22bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x11Analyst x11Analyst x5Analyst x3Est @ 5.6%Est @ 4.51%Est @ 3.75%Est @ 3.22%Est @ 2.85%Est @ 2.59% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.6% US$3.7kUS$3.8kUS$3.7kUS$3.9kUS$3.8kUS$3.7kUS$3.6kUS$3.5kUS$3.4kUS$3.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$37bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.2b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.6%– 2.0%) = US$137bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$137b÷ ( 1 + 6.6%)10= US$72bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$109b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$253, the company appears quite good value at a 36% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at General Dynamics as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.902. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For General Dynamics, we've compiled three additional factors you should look at:Risks: We feel that you should assess the 1 warning sign for General Dynamics we've flagged before making an investment in the company.Future Earnings: How does GD's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

Walt Disney falls in premarket on fears of bigger startup losses for its streaming services and inflation impacts on its theme parks. Bitcoin falls to a two-year low as FTX's near-collapse rattles the crypto universe, and the U.S. produces reports on oil inventories and world grain supply and demand. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, 9th November.1. DeSantis cruises as GOP edges toward House win; Dems flip key Pennsylvania Senate seatFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis emerged as the big winner from the midterm elections, securing re-election in style as a number and putting him in poll position for the GOP’s presidential candidacy in 2024.By contrast, a number of Republican candidates with the high-profile backing of Donald Trump – including gubernatorial candidates Don Bolduc and Doug Mastriano - fared relatively weakly.Democrat John Fetterman’s victory in a key Pennsylvania race left GOP hopes of regaining control of the Senate hanging by a thread, but its gains elsewhere appeared likely to be big enough to regain control of the House of Representatives.2. Disney hurt by streaming lossesWalt Disney (NYSE:DIS) stock fell nearly 8% in premarket after the entertainment giant reported bigger-than-expected losses at its Disney+ streaming operation.Management said the loss, which more than doubled from a year earlier to $1.47 billion, will likely narrow from here on as the operation scales up, although subscriber growth slowed after it lost the rights to the Indian Premier League cricket competition.Weaker-than-expected performances by its theme parks and traditional TV operations meant that operating profit – at $1.6 billion – was 30% below consensus forecasts.3. Stocks set to open marginally lower; Meta confirms huge layoffsU.S. stocks are set to open lower later, with the Disney disappointment, along with the prospect of two years policy paralysis in Washington, weighing on sentiment.Story continuesBy contrast, there was support from Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), which confirmed it will lay off some 11,000 staff – 13% of its total – as it draws a line under a period of throwing money at longshot investments in the so-called Metaverse.By 6:30 ET, Dow Jones Futures were down 89 points or 0.3%, while S&amp;P 500 Futures were down 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 Futures were effectively unchanged. Meta stock was up 3.8%.The economic calendar includes weekly updates on mortgage applications and rates, while the Federal Reserve’s John Williams and Tom Barkin are both due to speak.Earnings season shifts down a gear, with DR Horton (NYSE:DHI) (early) and Wynn Resorts Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) (late) among the few highlights.4. Bitcoin hits two-year low as Binance deal fails to stop FTT routBitcoin slumped to its lowest in more than two years as the crypto space reeled from the latest crisis of confidence triggered by the near-collapse of FTX.Binance, the world’s largest crypto platform, had agreed to buy FTX’s non-U.S. operations on Tuesday after FTX had been forced by a massive depositor run to suspend client withdrawals.FTX, FTX’s native token, crumpled nonetheless.

In the previous quarter, the company reported an earnings surprise of 12.8%.How Are Estimates Placed?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third-quarter bottom line is pegged at a loss of $1.20 per share, indicating an improvement of 3.2% from a loss of $1.24 reported in the year-ago quarter.For revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at nearly $852 million. The metric suggests a deterioration of 14.3% from the year-ago quarter’s figure.Wynn Resorts, Limited Price and EPS Surprise Wynn Resorts, Limited Price and EPS SurpriseWynn Resorts, Limited price-eps-surprise | Wynn Resorts, Limited Quote Let's look at how things have shaped up in the quarter.Factors to NoteWynn Resorts’ third-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from its non-gaming business, remodeling initiatives, improved bookings (backed by strength in ADR’s) and sports betting expansion. Solid Las Vegas operations and broad-based strength across rooms, entertainment and retail are likely to have aided the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter revenues from Las Vegas operations is pegged at $518 million, suggesting an improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure of $476 million. The consensus estimate for room, entertainment, retail and other revenues is pegged at $198 million and $113 million, indicating growth of 13.8% and 5.6%, year over year, respectively.However, the seasonal slowdown in occupancy (particularly in August) and COVID-related travel challenges are likely to have affected the company’s operations in the third quarter. This and the shutdown of integrated resorts (due to COVID outbreaks) are likely to have affected the company’s Macau operations in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net revenues at Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau is pegged at $42.1 million and $40 million, suggesting a 76.7% and 69.5% decline, respectively, from the prior-year quarter’s figures.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Wynn Resorts this time around.

130,c51d9019-3f32-3678-b7f0-9e9109a7a616,NEE,2022-11-09,Goldman Sachs Energy Stocks: Top 10 Stock Picks,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-energy-stocks-top-220858993.html,1667945338,STORY,"['GS', 'ET', 'LNG', 'COP', 'GSBD', 'CVX', 'ENPH', 'NEE-PR', 'ET-PD', 'XOM']","[In this article, we discuss the top 10 energy stock picks of Goldman Sachs. If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Goldman Sachs Energy Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks. Jan Hatzius, Goldman Sachs’ chief economist, noted that there is a “very plausible” scenario where the US economy can steer clear of a recession, regardless of the Federal Reserve's hawkish interest rate tightening and geopolitical unrest. On November 7, Goldman Sachs reaffirmed a 35% probability that the US economy will experience a slowdown in the next year, which is decidedly below Wall Street estimates. Jan Hatzius said that the path to growth “has already occurred, and it looks durable.”Goldman Sachs believes that a soft landing is possible, which means that inflation will slow down and the economy will continue to grow, and the investment firm cited a slowdown in nominal wage growth as the key indicator for this scenario. Jan Hatzius also mentioned October payroll numbers, supplier deliveries, second-hand car auction prices, and rents on new leases as some other reasons to expect reduced inflation. However, Goldman Sachs’ opinion is not popular on Wall Street. A majority of the economists believe that the United States will slip into a recession for the Fed to finally control mounting prices. In this uncertain macro environment, it is a good idea to look for defensive sectors as a safe haven for investments, with energy being one of them. Keeping that in mind, we reviewed the Goldman Sachs equity portfolio for the second quarter of 2022 and some of the top Goldman Sachs energy stocks were Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH), and Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET). Our Methodology We selected the top 10 energy stock picks from the Goldman Sachs stock portfolio as of the end of the second quarter of 2022 for this analysis. Insider Monkey’s database of 895 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2022 was used to assess the hedge fund sentiment around the securities. Story continuesGoldman Sachs Energy Stocks: Top 10 Stock PicksPhoto by David Thielen on UnsplashGoldman Sachs Energy Stocks: Top Stock Picks10. Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE:LNG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65Goldman Sachs’ Stake Value: $391,589,000Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE:LNG) is a Texas-based energy infrastructure company engaged in liquefied natural gas businesses in the United States. Goldman Sachs owned 2.94 million shares of Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE:LNG) in Q2 2022, worth $391.6 million and representing 0.08% of the total holdings. On October 25, Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE:LNG) declared a $0.395 per share quarterly dividend, a 19.7% increase from its prior dividend of $0.330. The dividend is payable on November 16, to shareholders of record on November 8. Jefferies analyst Sam Burwell on October 19 initiated coverage of Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE:LNG) with a Buy rating and a $210 price target. He believes the ""Option Value"" of energy is up again, supported by a limited capital cycle. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 65 hedge funds were bullish on Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE:LNG) at the end of the second quarter of 2022, compared to 62 funds in the prior quarter. Carl Icahn’s Icahn Capital LP is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 5.6 million shares worth $746.5 million. Like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH), and Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET), Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE:LNG) is one of the top energy stocks from the Goldman Sachs portfolio. Here is what ClearBridge Global Infrastructure Value Strategy has to say about Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE:LNG) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“Cheniere Energy is an energy infrastructure company that owns and operates U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facilities. Strong quarterly results and the disclosure of capital allocation policies were positively received by the markets. In addition, continued supply and demand tightness in the LNG market created a favorable commodity price environment.”9. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Goldman Sachs’ Stake Value: $413,720,000Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) is a London-based energy and petrochemical company that operates worldwide via Integrated Gas, Upstream, Marketing, Chemicals and Products, and Renewables and Energy Solutions segments. On October 27, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) declared a $0.50 per average diluted share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on December 19, to shareholders of record on November 11. The company also announced $4 billion in share buybacks and plans to raise the dividend by 15% in the fourth quarter of 2022. Securities filings for Q2 2022 reveal that Goldman Sachs owned 7.9 million shares of Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) worth $413.72 million, representing 0.09% of the total holdings. On November 6, Goldman Sachs analyst Michele Della Vigna downgraded Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $76, down from $79. The analyst cited valuation for the downgrade after the stock's outperformance. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL)’s continuous improvement in corporate returns and historically high cash flow has resulted in a ""relatively expensive valuation"" versus peers, the analyst wrote in a research note. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 39 hedge funds were bullish on Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) at the end of June 2022, compared to 37 funds in the preceding quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 20.25 million shares worth $1.06 billion. Here is what Harding Loevner International Equity Fund has to say about Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“While risks of unforeseen consequences arising from the Ukraine conflict are high, on this front we are cautiously optimistic that China will work hard to maintain its neutrality in a credible way, as it is a huge beneficiary of trade with the rest of the world, especially the rich developed nations. We think it likely that China, along with India, will continue to buy oil and gas from Russia (just as Europe, at least for now, plans to keep its gas pipelines open), and do not expect that fact to alter China’s trade relations with the West much. Nevertheless, we must contemplate that our optimism is misplaced on the importance of membership in the global network of exchange. If our central and optimistic case—admittedly an educated guess—is wrong, then we’d need to greatly modify our views of which companies in our opportunity set will face new barriers to profitable growth, and which might stand to benefit, relatively, from a further receding of globalization. (Global trade, after all, has never matched the peak share of GDP it reached in 2008, before the Global Financial Crisis.) We’d expect such a world to be less efficient, as the cold logic of comparative advantage is demoted as a determinant of which goods or services are produced and where. That would lead to a less prosperous world, since exploiting comparative advantage is a cornerstone of wealth creation. If regional blocs began to raise limits on the movement of capital as well as goods, we’d need to parse which of our multinational companies were at risk of declining sales from increasingly hostile, siloed countries. Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:SHEL) has found its Siberian oil and gas joint venture assets stranded by the combination of sanctions and the public opprobrium of Russia’s actions.”8. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71Goldman Sachs’ Stake Value: $628,774,000ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is a Texas-based company that produces, transports, distributes, and markets crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, liquefied natural gas, and natural gas liquids worldwide. In Q2 2022, Goldman Sachs owned more than 7 million ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) shares worth $628.8 million, representing 0.14% of the total portfolio. It is one of the premier Goldman Sachs energy stocks to monitor. On November 3, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) declared a $0.51 per share quarterly dividend, a 10.9% increase from its prior dividend of $0.46. The dividend is payable on December 1, to shareholders of record on November 15. The company also announced that the board of directors approved a $20 billion increase in the current share repurchase program to $45 billion. Truist analyst Neal Dingmann on November 7 raised the price target on ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) to $167 from $149 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares after its Q3 earnings beat. The company's financial and operational positions are ""enviable"" with almost no debt, record production, and quality inventory, the analyst told investors in a research note. Although there has been some investor pushback given ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) stock hit a recent all-time high, he believes that the valuation ""still looks very reasonable"".According to Insider Monkey’s data, 71 hedge funds were long ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) at the end of June 2022, compared to 67 funds in the prior quarter. Ric Dillon’s Diamond Hill Capital is one of the leading position holders in the company, with 6.58 million shares worth approximately $592 million. Diamond Hill Capital made the following comment about ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“On an individual holdings basis, top contributors to return included oil and gas producer ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and global technology company Nasdaq.The rising price of both oil and natural gas has allowed ConocoPhillips to continue reporting strong earnings and cash flow growth even as the economic outlook becomes more uncertain. We continue to believe the company is an outstanding operator with a strong balance sheet and assets concentrated in well understood jurisdictions. While supply chain tightness has driven input prices higher within the industry, ConocoPhillips has kept its production and capex guidance steady for the full year as its longer-term service contracts help it push costs out into the future as compared to smaller competitors.”7. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59Goldman Sachs’ Stake Value: $840,667,000Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is one of the top Goldman Sachs energy stocks to monitor. The firm held 5.80 million shares of Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) in the second quarter of 2022, worth $840.6 million and representing 0.18% of the total securities. On October 26, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) declared a $1.42 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on December 12, to shareholders of record on November 18. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) also posted market-beating Q3 results and had a free cash flow of $12.3 billion during the period.Cowen analyst Charles Ryhee raised the price target on Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) on October 31 to $185 from $160 and maintained an Outperform rating on the shares. The analyst noted that 2023 capex was guided to the high end of the mid-term range while 2022 Permian growth was guided to the low end of the range. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 59 hedge funds were bullish on Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) at the end of June 2022, compared to 53 funds in the last quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway held the biggest stake in the company, with 161.4 million shares worth $23.3 billion. Diamond Hill Capital mentioned Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) in its Q1 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm had to say:“Other top contributors in Q1 included multinational energy company Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX). The company benefited from increased energy demand as COVID-related economic restrictions eased in tandem with concerns regarding supply interruptions related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.”6. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59Goldman Sachs’ Stake Value: $867,952,000Another prominent Goldman Sachs energy pick is NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), a Florida-based company that generates, transmits, and distributes electric power to retail and wholesale customers in North America. The company generates electricity through wind, solar, nuclear, coal, and natural gas facilities. In Q2 2022, Goldman Sachs held 11.20 million shares of NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) worth $868 million, representing 0.19% of the total securities. On October 24, Guggenheim analyst Shahriar Pourreza reiterated a Buy rating on NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) but lowered the price target on the shares to $99 from $108. The analyst updated select estimates ahead of Q3 earnings season from the Power and Utilities group to reflect ""known and measurable year-over-year items"", to adjust for seasonality, and to re-mark to the latest commodity curves. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 59 hedge funds were long NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 64 funds in the preceding quarter. Jos Shaver’s Electron Capital Partners is a significant position holder in the company, with 2.65 million shares worth $205 million. In addition to Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH), and Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET), NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is one of the top energy stock picks of elite hedge funds. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“We increased our exposure to the energy transition during the quarter with new positions in Iberdrola (OTCPK:IBDSF), a Spanish-based integrated utility that is also one of the leading renewable energy developers in the world, and NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), an integrated utility business with a regulated utility operating in Florida and the largest wind business in the U.S. The war has opened the eyes of the world that energy independence is critical. Renewables are for many countries the only way to get to the target. It is expected that existing renewable project pipelines will be executed faster, and more projects added to existing pipelines.The energy transition would be extremely helpful for climate change and Iberdrola ranks well on our ESG matrix. NextEra, meanwhile, recently raised future earnings forecasts, citing a very favorable macro environment for rapid renewable generation expansion driven by decarbonization of the U.S. economy and the relative attractiveness of renewable generation in the context of high natural gas and power prices.” Click to continue reading and see Goldman Sachs Energy Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks.  Suggested articles:12 Best Financial Dividend Stocks To Buy10 Best Auto Stocks To Buy10 Most Undervalued Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None.

The carbon intensity estimates for refined products will help refiners, investors, shareholders and downstream purchasers better understand the emissions attributes of these key transportation fuels.S&amp;P Global Inc. logoS&amp;P Global Commodity Insights' Platts carbon offset price premiums assessments will cover diesel, gas, and jet fuel in Northwest Europe (NWE), US Gulf Coast (USGC) and Singapore, and be tied to existing price benchmarks in these markets. The carbon intensity price premium currently reflects the cost of offsetting the emissions using removals-based carbon credits. This price premium is expected to evolve to become a differential to the basis price, based on the carbon intensity attribute of the product.Deb Ryan, Head of Low Carbon Commodities at S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, said: ""The carbon intensity of these regional gasoline, diesel and jet fuel products are the next step in the evolution of carbon intensity assessments and provide an estimate of carbon emissions for the production of these key fuels. We believe publishing our assessments with the associated transparent methodology is key, and we will continue to evolve our methodology as technology improves.""Increased scrutiny of the emissions associated with fossil fuels, and efforts to reduce carbon footprints and emissions has resulted in a growing demand for transparency in how carbon intensity is estimated and how it will impact the buying, selling and trading of commodities. Estimating the carbon intensity of different commodities has become one of the ways the market has started to incorporate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from specific types of production because high GHG emissions per unit of output often translates into high carbon intensity (CI). Higher CI products will carry a greater carbon intensity premium and require more voluntary carbon credits to offset emissions, compared to products with a lower CI.Story continuesPaula VanLaningham, Global Head of Carbon at S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, said: ""Growing interest in carbon intensity from market participants and recent trades to account for carbon emissions are important steps in the right direction for the energy transition. As low carbon commodity trading continues to gain traction, aligning our carbon intensity assessments and price premiums directly with the regional gasoline, diesel and jet fuel price benchmarks will allow the market to judge individual asset and cargo performance against the standard we have outlined.""From November 15, 2022, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights will begin publishing Platts monthly measures of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel carbon intensity in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent per produced volume of product. In the US this is gallons, in Europe this is metric tons, and in Asia it is barrels. The daily price premium assessments are published in $/gal, $/mt, $/bbl for the US, Europe and Asia respectively using the daily Platts Carbon Removal Credit (CRC) voluntary carbon credit assessment.S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights' refined product carbon intensity assesses regional emissions for the different products. S&amp;P Global uses proprietary information about quantity of crude grade feedstock in each region; the different types of refinery configurations; the number of these refiners and the regional refinery yields to estimate a regional weighted carbon intensity value for the individual products used on PRELIM, an open-source model. These price assessments are estimated by assessing the total costs of offset using the Platts CRC price.

If you want to explore more nuclear ETFs that you can add to your portfolio, you can also take a look at 5 Best Nuclear ETFs to Buy Now.Nuclear energy has been the center of bad press for a long time now. Whenever the word nuclear comes to mind, most people recall the Chernobyl and Fukushima Daiichi incidents. These two disasters have had a negative impact on the world and turned it more cautious toward generating energy from nuclear power. However, the benefits of nuclear power over fossil fuels cannot be overlooked. One of the biggest benefits of nuclear energy over matter-dense energy sources, such as fossil fuels, is its lack of carbon emissions. According to the Nuclear Energy Institute, energy generated from nuclear power in the U.S. reduces over 470 million metric tons of carbon emissions every year.The U.S. draws roughly 50% of its carbon-free energy from nuclear sources. In efforts to battle climate change, on April 19, the Biden administration poured $6 billion into the nuclear energy industry to extend the life of nuclear plants in the U.S. that were at risk of shutting down.The Energy Crisis in Europe: Nuclear Energy to the RescueThe Russian-Ukraine conflict has sent prices to all-time highs around the globe. No other region is experiencing the repercussions of the war more than Europe. On August 31, Russia completely cut off gas supplies to Europe, claiming that the Nord Stream 1 pipelines need to go through routine repairs. Russia previously shut down the Nord Stream 1 pipeline in July. Inflation in Europe attained a record high of 9.1% in August, with the energy index contributing the most. The energy index was the highest contributor and recorded a reading of 38.3% in August, down from 30.6% in July, but still alarmingly high.High energy prices and hurdles in getting gas from Russia have spiked interest in European governments to consider nuclear energy as a solution. On March 17, the Czech Republic announced an investment of EUR 6 billion to fund the building of a new nuclear reactor at the Dukovany nuclear plant. On September 1, Britain's outgoing Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that the UK will invest roughly $800 million to fund a new nuclear power plant to ensure the nation's national and energy security.Story continuesThe energy crisis in Europe has triggered hefty investments in nuclear energy infrastructure. As economies around the globe push further to achieve carbon neutrality, the nuclear energy industry is expected to experience significant growth. Some of the best nuclear energy stocks that investors and analysts have turned bullish on include Denison Mines Corp. (NYSE:DNN), NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), and Cameco Corporation (NYSE:CCJ).Best Nuclear ETFs to Buy Nowdan-meyers-F_DSvG5Fb0A-unsplashOur MethodologyFor risk-averse investors that are seeking exposure to the lucrative nuclear energy market, we have compiled a list of the best nuclear ETFs to buy now.

However, the market is not giving the company credit for the material improvements CEO Larry Culp has made in his tenure. The balance sheet today is stronger than it has been in a very long time, and each of the three primary business segments each have strong paths to increasing earnings, regardless of the economic environment. Healthcare has historically not been a cyclical business. While Aviation typically has some economic sensitivity, the business still has a strong COVID rebound tailwind that should continue even in an uncertain environment. Power is a less cyclical business, and GE maintains a steady business servicing approximately one-third of the world’s electricity. GE is another example of strong insider buying indicating management’s confidence in the business, while the company also began buying back discounted shares. GE is still on track to break the company into three separate businesses, and we believe this will help the market properly weigh the value of each core segment.”In addition to investing in ETFs, investors can look to nuclear stocks such as Denison Mines Corp.

139,0c617c4e-9436-3f27-b0f3-e9d6bec8565a,TSN,2022-11-09,Tyson Foods CFO’s arrest is a ‘critical moment’ for corporate governance at the company,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tyson-foods-cfo-arrest-critical-115105667.html,1667908265,STORY,['TSN'],"[Good morning,Being new on the job as a CFO means you’re in the spotlight, and it's time to make a good impression. But Tyson Foods Inc. CFO John R. Tyson, the son of the chairman of the company’s board of directors, is facing serious allegations a month into his appointment.Tyson, 32, was arrested this past weekend for public intoxication and criminal trespassing, according to reports. Detainee information released by the Washington County, Ark., sheriff’s department states he was arrested in the early morning of Nov. 6 and released later that day. A woman in Fayetteville, Ark. called the police when she found Tyson, whom she said she doesn't know, in a bed in her home, according to local reports by KNWA Fox24. Police said they tried to wake Tyson up at the scene, but he was incoherent, briefly waking up and going back to sleep.A company spokesperson told KNWA in a statement: “This is a personal matter, we have no additional comment.” I reached out to Tyson Foods but didn’t receive a response as of press time.Tyson was named EVP and CFO of the Arkansas-based meat company, effective Oct. 2. He is the son of board chairman John H. Tyson and the great-grandson of Tyson founder John W. Tyson. John R. Tyson previously served as the company's EVP of strategy and as chief sustainability officer. Before joining Tyson Foods in 2019, he held various roles in investment banking, private equity, and venture capital, including at J.P. Morgan. Tyson succeeded Stewart Glendinning, who transitioned from his role as EVP and CFO to take on the position of group president of prepared foods.The company is scheduled to release its latest 2022 quarterly financial results on Nov. 14. That's the first time Tyson would participate in an earnings call as CFO. ""We delivered solid operating income of nearly $1 billion because of our diversified portfolio; year to date, we are up 15% over prior year,"" Tyson Foods CEO Donnie King said in August on the earnings call for the period ending June 30. ""Overall, earnings per share came in at $1.94 for the third quarter and $7.10 year to date.""Story continuesTyson Foods may be a family-founded company, but it’s also a public company.“This will be a critical moment for Tyson Foods and corporate governance,” Shane Goodwin, associate dean for Executive Education and Graduate Programs at the Cox School of Business at Southern Methodist University, told me. Tyson Foods has a dual-class share structure, which means the family of the founders have tremendous influence over the company, says Goodwin who teaches an MBA corporate ethics course. The Tyson family owns 99.9% of its Class B shares, giving them the ability to outvote the Class A shareholders 10-1, and shareholders know the family has the power, he says.However, being a public company, Tyson Foods has “many stakeholders to consider not only shareholders, but customers, employees, and the community,” Goodwin says.As CFO, Tyson receives ""an increased base salary of $650,000 and an increase in his target annual incentive payment under the Company’s Annual Incentive Compensation Plan for senior executives from 90% to 110% of his annual base salary, with the actual annual incentive payment payable based on performance,"" according to the company's form 8-K filed on Sept. 27.Goodwin says companies should always emphasize ethics for executives, both on and off the clock. ""There is no exception to this,"" he says. ""I know many want their private life to be 'off limits.' And it is—unless one is violating laws, rules, ethical judgments, etc. Admittedly, situations are different. The alleged circumstances around this situation are very serious.”I asked Goodwin what approach Tyson’s CEO and the board should take when it comes to this alleged incident. “Everyone is innocent until proven guilty—that is a bedrock of our country,” he says. “So, I would ensure the process plays out properly. I would follow any policy that we already have in place. Do not change that policy.” For example, if the company allows employees to continue working until a legal matter is fully adjudicated, it should continue doing that, he says.“However, if they have a history of suspending or dismissing employees then they have to follow that precedent,” Goodwin says. “Personally, in my honest opinion, if I were [the chairman] in this situation, I would immediately suspend my son. This lapse of judgment cannot be tolerated for such a serious job.” But Goodwin added, “I also believe we live in a world of second chances and we need to support those going through challenging times.”One thing's for sure, the family’s support for Tyson will be watched publicly.See you tomorrow.Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.comSign up here to receive CFO Daily weekday mornings in your inbox.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: The American middle class is at the end of an eraElon Musk is facing trial again over his $56 billion Tesla paycheck that’s ‘the largest in human history’The winners of the $1.5 billion Powerball jackpot will probably take it in cash.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Goldman Sachs Semiconductor Stocks: Top 5 Picks. As per Washington-based Semiconductor Industry Association, global semiconductor sales dropped 3% in September compared to last year, and Korean chipmakers produced 3.5% less than a year earlier in September. The Korean economy, which is highly dependent on the semiconductor industry, experienced low demand given weakening currencies, high trade deficits, and tightening interest rates around the world. Meanwhile, the Biden administration is trying to boost investments in US chipmaking, in order to compete with China and to manufacture components essential for national security. The US effort increased after the semiconductor industry faced massive shortages in late 2020 and 2021, which revealed how essential chips were in the digital economy, for the production of everything from cars to smartphones. The most recent effort to help establish the US semiconductor industry is the CHIPS Act, which lent $39 billion in government funding for the local semiconductor manufacturing plants, in addition to billions of dollars for research and development initiatives.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is planning to construct a second US plant next to a $12 billion complex it is already building, which will advance American efforts to support local chipmaking. To benefit from the ongoing semiconductor initiatives amid lower competition from Korean and Chinese manufacturers, some of the best semiconductor stocks to consider according to investment firm Goldman Sachs are Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM). Our Methodology We selected the top 10 semiconductor stocks from the Goldman Sachs portfolio as of the end of the second quarter of 2022 for this analysis. Insider Monkey’s database of 895 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2022 was used to assess the hedge fund sentiment around the securities. Story continuesGoldman Sachs Semiconductor Stocks: Top 10 PicksPhoto by Redd on UnsplashGoldman Sachs Semiconductor Stocks: Top Picks10. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65Goldman Sachs’ Stake Value: $535,779,000Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is a California-based multinational technology corporation that operates in the semiconductors, computer hardware, autonomous cars, automation, and artificial intelligence sectors. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is one of the elite Goldman Sachs semiconductor stocks to monitor, with the firm holding 14.3 million shares worth nearly $536 million, representing 0.12% of the total securities. On October 31, Citi analyst Christopher Danely maintained a Neutral rating on Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) but lowered the price target on the shares to $27 from $30. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) posted mixed results and guided well below consensus due to the PC downturn, the analyst told investors. The company also disclosed a cost control plan, ""which should help but doesn't help the core problems of manufacturing and wasting money on growth markets that will never pan out,"" added the analyst.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 65 hedge funds were long Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) at the end of June 2022, compared to 76 funds in the last quarter. David Blood and Al Gore’s Generation Investment Management held the largest stake in the company, comprising 14.7 million shares worth $552.5 million. Like Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is one of the favorite semiconductor picks of elite hedge funds. Here is what Baron Funds specifically said about Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Then, there is the case of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). A blue-chip tech champion with a market capitalization of over $500 billion in early 2000, the stock was trading at a P/E multiple of 42. It was a fast-growing company whose stock price and multiple declined more or less in line with its peers. However, unlike Google, Intel’s net income has grown from $7.3 billion in 1999 to $19.9 billion in 2021, a compounded annual growth rate of just 4.7%. Its growth from the dot com era has not proven to be durable, and Intel has yet to trade at the price it attained in 1999.”9. Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63Goldman Sachs’ Stake Value: $569,242,000Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) is a Delaware-based company that designs, develops, and sells analog, mixed-signal, digital signal processing, embedded, and standalone integrated circuits. In Q2 2022, Goldman Sachs owned more than 13 million shares of Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) worth $569.2 million, representing 0.12% of the total portfolio. On October 18, Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore maintained a Buy recommendation on Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) but lowered the price target on the shares to $55 from $65. Fears of fundamental deterioration are ""leading to very bearish investor positioning"" into the Q3 results for semiconductors, the analyst told investors in a research note. According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 63 hedge funds were long Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL), with combined stakes worth $1.6 billion, compared to 63 funds in the prior quarter worth $2.4 billion. Paul Marshall and Ian Wace’s Marshall Wace LLP is the biggest position holder in the company, with approximately 5 million shares worth $214 million. Here is what Carillon Tower Advisers specifically said about Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) provides infrastructure semiconductor solutions. Investors have recently become concerned about the semiconductor cycle and how demand for Marvell’s products will fare in a slowing economic environment. We remain confident that the company’s portfolio of products is extremely important in parts of the datacenter server market, which remains healthy and possesses long-term secular trends. The company also has secured strong contract wins in upcoming global 5G wireless infrastructure build-outs, which are generally insulated from macroeconomic pressures. With supply chain issues easing, we believe Marvell remains in a strong position to post continued robust growth.”8.

It specialises in process management and control in semiconductor manufacturing and the related nanoelectronics industries. During manufacturing processes, products must be inspected for defects and correct critical dimensions in order to identify and eliminate possible sources of problems. As customers continue to enforce Moore’s Law, smaller chips must meet more precise specifications, which in turn increases the need for advanced inspection and diagnostic tools. This is a key step within the entire manufacturing process and one in which the company has built a very strong, and in places dominant, global position.

High-interest rates on loans have significantly contributed to the downfall of the IT industry since they swiftly devalue the growing revenues that analysts predict will continue to rise for years to come.

Prior to the pandemic, Trip.com was a profitable business with a large competitive advantage built around its position in both inbound and outbound international travel. That advantage was based on considerable investment in support centers, a large sales force outside of China focused on hotel supply agreements, partnerships with Chinese language tour providers, and other services to support the Chinese traveler. Trip.com was a healthy and growing business—the number of Chinese outbound tourists grew to 155 million (larger than the population of Japan) in 2019 from just 57 million in 2010. As it did with so many travel entities, the pandemic upended the business, and Chinese outbound tourists in 2021 fell to just under 26 million, devastating the company’s profits and the share price, which fell from the high 30s to the low 20s.Generally speaking, OTAs are great businesses. Effectively, these companies take a commission for booking travel for providers. In addition, an OTAs app attracts advertising revenue from airlines, hotels, and other tourist destinations. Trip.com’s appeal is enhanced by a management team thoughtful enough to operate with significant net cash on the balance sheet.”7. Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM)Cavalry Asset Management’s Stake Value: $50,968,000 Percentage of Cavalry Asset Management’s 13F Portfolio: 4.75% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44Zoom Video Communications, Inc.

With about 10.89 million shares valued at $801.49 million, ARK Investment Management is a notable shareholder of Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) in the third quarter of 2022. 44 hedge funds in our database held stakes in Zoom Video Communications, Inc.

(NASDAQ:ZM), amounting to $50.97 million, representing 4.75% of the fund’s 13F portfolio.

(NASDAQ:ZM) in its Q1 2022 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:“What about the other asset class that has attracted the most attention from the investment community in recent times? Here we can distinguish three major groups. First, those companies without earnings that had convinced investors of their great future growth prospects, pushing up their valuations to irrational levels. A clear example of this, which we mentioned almost two years ago (see here) is Zoom Video Communications (“Zoom”), whose market cap exceeded that of companies such as IBM or came close to that of Cisco Systems. Well, from the time we wrote about this odd situation until today, Zoom shares have collapsed nearly 80%.Therefore, if interest rates rise (or are expected to rise), company valuations are negatively impacted. This is especially true for those businesses that generate little cash today and the market expects them to generate a lot of cash in the future. Hence the severe losses in companies that promised a lot of cash generation in the future (such as Zoom).”6. Booking Holdings Inc.

The company has been a dominant on-line travel agency for more than a decade with a high margin business model (40% EBITDA margin for 2019 and 28% for 2021) that requires limited capital expenditures, typically less than 3% of revenue, producing $4.5 billion free cash flow for 2019 and $2.5 billion for 2021 (due to the vast COVID disruption). The company has used its free cash flow for episodic acquisitions as well as to return cash to shareholders. BKNG is well positioned in travel as the largest player in online lodging bookings and the second largest player in alternative accommodations. Like all travel companies, Booking was hit hard by the pandemic, but with its high international exposure, we expect the company’s recovery to be equally strong as travel returns.” Click to continue reading and see Top 5 Stock Picks of John Hurley’s Cavalry Asset Management.Suggested articles:11 Best Dividend Stocks To Buy Under $20Biggest IT Companies in the WorldBiggest Oil Producing Countries in 2022Disclosure: None. Top 10 Stock Picks of John Hurley’s Cavalry Asset Management is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Taking a look at the Dow Jones Industrial Average, that's to the upside by about 6/10 of a percent. 205 points in positive territory. Also holding onto some gains after dipping into negative territory just very briefly, you've got the NASDAQ composite tech heavy average up by about 3/10 of a percent.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this chipmaker have returned -3.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry, which Qualcomm falls in, has lost 3.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Qualcomm is expected to post earnings of $2.36 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -26.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -36.9%.The consensus earnings estimate of $10.47 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -16.4%. This estimate has changed -19.8% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.31 indicates a change of +17.6% from what Qualcomm is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -6%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Qualcomm.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for QCOM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Qualcomm, the consensus sales estimate of $9.62 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -10.1%. The $40.88 billion and $46.23 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -7.5% and +13.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryQualcomm reported revenues of $11.4 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.1%. EPS of $3.13 for the same period compares with $2.55 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.38 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.13%. The EPS surprise was +0.32%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Qualcomm is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Qualcomm. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:BAX), a global innovator in kidney care, advanced scientific exchange with 14 new data presentations about the role innovation plays in increasing access to and quality of home dialysis and expanded hemodialysis (HDx) care at Kidney Week 2022, Nov. 3-6, Orlando, Florida. Key data highlighted include:A study indicating a significant reduction in all-cause mortality and fluid balance, and cardiovascular and metabolic related adverse events, in home automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) patients with Sharesource remote patient management (RPM) versus APD patients without RPM, “Adverse Events and Hospitalizations with Remote Patient Monitoring of Patients on Automated Peritoneal Dialysis” [Abstract #FR-PO504].A simulated dialysis study indicating expanded hemodialysis (HDx) enabled by Theranova demonstrates the best balance when aiming to achieve higher clearance of larger molecular weight middle molecules while minimizing albumin loss, “On the Removal of Middle Molecules and Albumin Loss: An Ex Vivo Evaluation of Commercial Dialyzers” [Abstract #SA-PO405].“With a growing global deficit between the number of patients with kidney disease and those receiving care, we believe a combination of collaboration, education and innovation is necessary to help increase both access to and quality of care,” said Peter Rutherford, MB BS, PhD., vice president, Medical Affairs, Baxter Renal Care. “Scientific exchange is an important part of the collaboration and education initiatives, which we are very pleased to support at this year’s Kidney Week.”Story continuesSharesource Remote Patient ManagementBaxter’s Sharesource RPM digital health platform allows healthcare professionals to monitor their patients’ home dialysis treatments, and then remotely adjust therapy without the need for patients to make unplanned visits to the clinic. Sharesource is currently serving more than 50,000 patients, across more than 70 countries on Baxter’s APD cyclers. The RPM study [Abstract #FR-PO504] presented at Kidney Week 2022 was a cluster randomized, controlled trial, at 21 hospitals across Mexico, where care units were randomly assigned to treat their APD patients with or without RPM.HDx Enabled by TheranovaHDx enabled by Theranova removes a wider range of molecules from the blood than traditional HD filters, like high-flux membranes, by targeting the effective removal of large middle molecules (up to 45,000 Da),1,2,3 while selectively retaining essential proteins and maintaining stable albumin levels.4,5,6 These middle molecules have been linked to the development of inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and other co-morbidities in dialysis patients.7,8The new Theranova data [Abstract #SA-PO405] comes from a simulated study that evaluated the challenges associated with increased removal of larger middle molecules while avoiding clinically relevant albumin loss during a dialysis session. During the study, four commercial dialyzers with comparable surface areas were carefully evaluated for solute clearance and albumin loss during four-hour simulated hemodialysis treatments under standardized conditions.Theranova had significantly higher small and large middle molecule clearance (up to 2-3 times higher for YKL40) than two of the other dialyzers as well as lower albumin loss. One dialyzer cleared a higher volume of large middle molecules, but demonstrated albumin loss more than double that observed with Theranova. The study shows further assessment of the dialyzer’s performance in clinic studies is necessary to better understand the benefits of these findings.HDx enabled by Theranova is currently available in 54 countries across Europe, Latin America, Asia, Africa and in the United States and Canada. More than nine million dialysis treatments have been performed worldwide using Theranova in more than 850 clinics. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted Theranova a De Novo application in 2020, which established it as a new class of dialyzer technology with unique performance standards.          The Theranova Dialyzer is indicated for patients with chronic kidney failure who are prescribed intermittent hemodialysis. It provides an expanded solute removal profile with increased removal of various middle molecules (up to 45 kDa) that may play a pathologic role in the uremic clinical syndrome. The Theranova Dialyzer is not intended for hemofiltration or hemodiafiltration therapy. The total extracorporeal blood volume for the Theranova Dialyzer and the set should represent less than 10% of the patient's blood volume.Rx Only: For safe and proper use of the devices mentioned herein, refer to the Instructions for Use.About BaxterEvery day, millions of patients, caregivers and healthcare providers rely on Baxter’s leading portfolio of diagnostic, critical care, kidney care, nutrition, hospital and surgical products used across patient homes, hospitals, physician offices and other sites of care.

If you want to see more of the best blue chip stocks with strong balance sheets, go directly to 5 Best Blue Chip Stocks With Strong Balance Sheets.Companies with strong balance sheets have more flexibility in challenging times.With more cash on their balance sheets and not as much debt relative to their earnings power, fiscally strong companies can buy back more stock at lower valuations.With M&amp;A, fiscally strong companies can expand by buying companies with weaker balance sheets. Many fiscally strong companies can also gain market share by spending more on R&amp;D or marketing during tough times.A company with a strong balance sheet generally has substantial net cash on its balance sheet. If it does have net debt, a fiscally strong company will have substantial earnings and cash flow to be able to cover its net debt.Fiscally strong companies sometimes have a net debt position because the cost of debt was very affordable when interest rates were low and those companies decided they could add more value if they returned more capital back to shareholders rather than keep it on their balance sheets.2022Given the high inflation, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times in 2022 alone. With the Federal Reserve expected to continue to raise interest rates and with a potential recession in 2023, it could get tougher before it gets better.In the challenging times, blue chip companies with strong balance sheets can offer potential long term value for shareholders given lower valuations and potential value adding expansion opportunities.In the near to medium terms, however, there could be more downside to the market and individual stocks if economic data fails to meet expectations.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Story continuesMethodologyFor our list of 10 Best Blue Chip Stocks With Strong Balance Sheets, we chose 10 leading stocks with strong balance sheets and strong competitive advantages.Using the collective wisdom of hedge funds, we ranked the 10 stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that held shares of the same stock at the end of Q2 2022.10 Best Blue Chip Stocks With Strong Balance Sheets10.

Johnson &amp; Johnson’s products and services have a clear positive impact on human health. The company’s long-held credo sets the tone for ethical business practices and considering all stakeholders in guiding its decision making and prioritizing patients and caregivers. The company also contributes to 11 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGS) through its Health for Humanity 2025 goals.6. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 104Given its scale and leading businesses, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) has a strong balance sheet. For its Q3 2022, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) had a standardized CET1 capital ratio of 12.5% and an advanced CET1 capital ratio of 13%. The company also paid a common dividend of $3 billion given its excess cash generation.Vltava Fund commented on JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) in a Q3 2022 investor letter,We regard JPM to be the strongest and best- managed bank in the world. It is a leader in investment banking, commercial banking, credit cards, and asset management. Its size (the largest bank in the USA, with nearly USD 4,000 billion in assets) and diversification give it a strong competitive advantage that is compounded by its cost advantages and the high costs to clients associated with switching banks. JPM’s management prides itself on running the only large bank to avoid major instability over the long term. JP Morgan’s quality and strength first became fully evident in 2008 under the leadership of its CEO Jamie Dimon. Not only did JP Morgan help to stabilize the market by taking over the failing Bear Stearns in the spring of that year, but throughout the Great Financial Crisis it was the only big US bank that did not require government assistance and it was highly profitable even in the difficult year of 2008. A well-functioning and efficient bank can be a very good long-term investment, because the interest compounding effect works well here. JPM’s return on equity (ROE) is well into the double digits and this puts it in a good position to continue producing better long-term returns than does the market. JPM has been very profitable even during years when interest rates were close to zero. The current – and perhaps not temporary – return to somewhat more normal, higher interest rates should have a significantly positive impact on the bank’s interest income and overall profitability.”Like JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

TRC represented Theravance’s 85% economic interest in the sales-based royalty rights on the global net sales of GSK’s GSK once-daily single inhaler triple therapy for COPD and asthma, Trelegy Ellipta.Per the deal, Royalty Pharma will financially support Theravance in clinically developing the latter’s pipeline candidate, ampreloxetine, for treating symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH), in exchange for certain royalty rights.In April, Theravance failed to achieve statistical significance in its primary endpoint in the phase III study evaluating ampreloxetine in nOH. However, a sub-group analysis based on disease type showed that the drug achieved a 72% reduction in the odds of treatment failure compared to a placebo in patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA), a rare disease.

Theravance plans to start a new phase III clinical study in MSA patients with symptomatic nOH (CYPRESS) in the first quarter of 2023.

While the company lowered FY22 revenue guidance to be in a range of $16.2-16.7 billion, compared to previous guidance for revenue of $17-17.5 billion, this revision is solely attributable to the incremental impact of FX headwinds. The company reaffirmed FY22 guidance for Adjusted EBITDA of $5.8-6.2 billion (36.5% margin at midpoint) and FCF of $2.5-2.9 billion, or a forward FCF yield of 23.3%. The company generated approximately $84 million in new product revenues in 2Q22, bringing 1H22 revenues to $205 million, which were primarily driven by interchangeable Semglee in the US, and the company remains on track to achieve ~$600 million (3.7% of FY22 guided revenue at the midpoint) in FY22 new product revenues.” Click to continue reading and see Goldman Sachs' 5 Cheap Dividend Stocks.  Suggested articles:Best Biotech Stocks Under $10Best Lithium Stocks To Buy10 Best Small Cap Stocks To Buy Now Disclosure.

It is expected to launch in 2024.As milestones are met, Cloud DX will receive up to $560,000 CAD over the project span to support the integration of a new Medtronic continuous vital sign monitoring device and a connected medication dispenser to the Connected Health software platform.KITCHENER, ON / ACCESSWIRE / November 8, 2022 / Cloud DX (TSXV:CDX)(OTC:CDXFF), a leading digital health platform, today announced $5.2 million CAD of co-investment from the Digital Supercluster, through Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada to create the Continuous Connected Patient Care (CCPC) digital platform. Continuous remote monitoring of recently discharged patients is expected to improve patient outcomes and free up badly needed hospital resources.Cloud DX Inc., Tuesday, November 8, 2022, Press release pictureThis novel remote patient monitoring system project will be led by Medtronic and include expertise and technology from a consortium of partners, including Excelar Technologies, Providence Health Care's St. Paul's Hospital, Providence Health Care Ventures, Simon Fraser University, 3D Bridge Solutions Inc, and StarFish Medical (as a Medtronic sub-contractor).Each consortium member offers a unique and vital component to create the seamless end-to-end monitoring system for clinicians and patients at the hospital as a solution to the challenge of providing affordable, easy-to-use, hospital-grade care at home.""Hospital resources should be focused on patients with the most urgent and severe illnesses, but many people hospitalized for significant health issues remain there for basic supervision and monitoring while they heal,"" says Rick Sethi, CCPC Project Leader and Director of Open Innovation at Medtronic. ""CCPC is about improving patient outcomes by providing hospital-level monitoring at home for less acute patients -- sparing them from unnecessarily long hospital stays and subsequently, reducing wait times and freeing up resources for patients who need in-hospital care.""Story continuesMedtronic will provide a new multi-parameter untethered sensor device, based on proven clinical-grade medical sensor technologies.3D Bridge Solutions will further enhance its AlthaRX (Altha) medication dispensing, tracking, and adherence monitoring device and software. The Cloud DX and 3D Bridge solutions will be integrated into the overall CCPC platform via the Excelar Careflow Broker. Excelar will enhance its clinical data normalization module to include remote patient monitoring and medication adherence tracking data as well as significantly enhancing its patient timeline care flow data visualization module.Providence Health Care Ventures (PHCV) will provide patient and clinical needs assessment, workflow, and validation, co-design and co-development of the end-solution, as well as data governance and integration. The Consortium will work with St. Paul's Hospital clinicians on the requirements definition and process design.Simon Fraser University (SFU) will elicit users' needs to inform the development of the sensor, clinical workflows for an untethered blood pressure monitor or trend device, clinical decision support model, and user interfaces for clinicians, and patients and their families.Cloud DX will provide the patented, ISO certified ‘backbone' for the CCPC project including an enhanced patient-facing Connected Health kit and mobile application, data collection and secure cloud-based storage, smart clinician notification system, as well as patient engagement tools including surveys, text messaging and video telehealth capabilities. The Cloud DX Clinician Portal will be used by care teams to monitor up to thousands of patients safely, reducing workloads and improving efficiency.The Digital Supercluster is a co-investment partner, providing $5.2 million in funding to accelerate made-in-Canada healthcare innovation and improve outcomes from health services. The CCPC platform is expected to be completed and approved by regulators in 2024, at which time, Medtronic intends to market the platform to healthcare providers in over 125 countries.""Hospital care can cost up to $2,000 per patient per day, which creates a huge cost burden for our healthcare system. Using an advanced home monitoring solution, such as CCPC, can shift a large proportion of that cost to a more affordable ""hospital at home"" model,"" says Robert Kaul, CEO of Cloud DX. ""Hospitals can safely send less acutely ill patients home without compromising quality of care, freeing up urgently needed hospital resources including beds, equipment, and staff.""The Continuous Connected Patient Care digital project will initially focus on adults with congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with attention on internal medicine and geriatrics. Under the funding agreement, patients, families, clinicians, and industry partners will collaborate to build, test, evaluate and demonstrate the applicability of the CCPC platform, as well as gather critical data related to patient healthcare outcomes that will underpin broader commercial deployment in the future.Neither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.Cloud DX Inc., Tuesday, November 8, 2022, Press release pictureAbout Cloud DXAccelerating digital healthcare, Cloud DX is on a mission to make healthcare better for everyone.

This is expected to deplete channel inventories. While nutrient prices remain historically elevated in Brazil, they have retreated to levels that are supporting in-country shipments, which are projected to pull year-end inventories down to levels comparable to last year.

""They are not in heavy, dense usage over urban populations.""Jetliners are required, for example, to have redundancies on critical systems that would lead to a catastrophic failure if they could not function.While the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) already has such requirements for air taxis, it was not clear whether the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will have such requirements, consultants and executives said.Story continuesAdvanced air mobility vehicles are generally lumped into a category for smaller aircraft than jetliners, however projects can be subject to other criteria.""It's kind of case by case,"" said Charlton Evans, head of a U.S. aerospace consultancy.On Monday, the U.S. regulator issued the certification blueprint that Joby Aviation will need to meet for its air taxi aircraft.The FAA was not immediately available for comment.Redundancy was at the centre of a safety crisis over the 737 MAX that saw the model grounded for almost two years. Boeing has announced sweeping safety and engineering reforms since the fatal crashes of two jets that killed a total of 346 people.Allen said global regulators would ideally come up with common requirements for certifying these aircraft, but acknowledged that would take time. ""To us, the more important thing is consensus on commercial safety standards,"" he said. (Reporting by Allison Lampert in Montreal.

She became interested in how two populations of fish-one living in the ocean, the other in this 50-foot-deep saltwater pond-might differ genetically.Kate's taking a biotech capstone course at Menlo School in Atherton, California, and she'll use this question to drive her research project this semester. She plans to use PCR and DNA sequencing to search for genetic differences. Her teacher, Tanya Buxton, started the capstone course as an after-school biotech club in 1994 and has cultivated its growth ever since.One tool Buxton's students use is a virtual simulation, Illumina Genomic Discoveries (IGD) DNA Library Preparation and Sequencing Simulation Lab, developed in partnership with Biocom California Institute (BCI) as a free resource for educators to introduce students to the key genomics concepts of DNA, PCR, and whole-genome sequencing.""The IGD Simulation Lab is a hands-on experience in a virtual environment, exposing students to micropipetting, DNA library preparation and library clean-up protocols, PCR, and Illumina's state-of-the-art tagmentation and whole-genome sequencing technology,"" says Mikayla Ortega, BCI program manager. ""Students get to be Illumina scientists for the day and work in a virtual lab space where they explore the equipment and complete the simulated experiment.""""It has always been important to me to stay up-to-date with the latest industry technology and bring it to my students through programs and industry mentors,"" says Buxton. ""My experience with Illumina's virtual lab simulation was seamless because it includes a robust curriculum and resources. It also opened my students' eyes to a broader scope for their capstone projects to include DNA sequencing.""Buxton is one of 20 teachers who've been trained in the IGD curriculum. Many are based in Southern California, but IGD is growing in the Bay Area through partnerships between BCI and regional organizations and county offices of education. Buxton is also collaborating with the Bay Area Bioscience Education Community (BABEC) to introduce the simulated DNA sequencing experience to hundreds of students across the region.Story continues""At Illumina, we are committed to equitable access to STEM education,"" says Sharon Vidal, global head of Corporate Social Responsibility at Illumina. ""By partnering with our employees and nonprofit community partners like Biocom California Institute, we have created industry-aligned resources.

In collaboration with Labcorp, Illumina presented two important studies focusing on tumor-agnostic gene fusions in oncology patients. Labcorp is a leading global life sciences company with deep oncology expertise in precision medicine diagnostics, clinical trials, and drug development.Why study fusions?Genomic alterations known as gene fusions often drive cancer and can be important across different patient tumor types. Today, targeted therapies exist for a growing number of gene fusions. In order to accurately identify all potential gene fusions and genomic biomarkers, a comprehensive genomic profiling test should include both RNA and DNA sequencing.In the first study, the authors analyzed more than 6700 solid tumor samples. ""Using comprehensive genomic profiling, or CGP, with RNA sequencing, we were able to identify 17 NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3 fusions in 16 patient tumors, 10 of which were novel-a stunning number,"" says Dr. Shakti Ramkissoon, vice president and medical lead, Labcorp Oncology. Since NTRK fusions are tumor agnostic, the study authors sequenced samples from breast, colorectal, non-small-cell lung cancer, and more. NTRK fusions are rare and can be difficult to detect by DNA sequencing alone, since the gene breakpoints occur across large, intronic regions and have many partner genes. The authors used TSO 500 for RNA and DNA sequencing.To date, the response rate for tumors harboring NTRK fusions treated with NTRK inhibitors has proven to be very high. With larotrectinib, which is approved for all solid tumors including pediatric, objective responses are observed in 79% of patients.1 This means patients may enjoy longer survival and a better quality of life-if the fusion is identified in time to receive treatment.Story continuesThe second AMP abstract focuses on detection of NRG1 fusions, another rare but therapeutically relevant target in cancer that cannot be detected by DNA sequencing. The study authors analyzed 4397 patient samples across multiple tumor types using TSO 500 for RNA and DNA sequencing and identified 19 NRG1 fusions in 17 unique patients. Identifying NRG1 fusions is critical, since these patients typically lack other driver alterations and targeted treatment options. Patients with NRG1 fusions were eligible to participate in a clinical trial that's currently underway. The Food and Drug Administration recently granted fast-track approval for a HER3 inhibitor (serbantumab) to treat solid tumors with NRG1 fusions.""RNA-based sequencing has emerged as an effective method to detect novel fusions,"" says Dr. Pratheesh Sathyan, who is part of Illumina's Medical Affairs organization and its head of oncology in the Americas. ""Illumina, in collaboration with leading companies like Labcorp, is bringing this technology to community oncology practices for reliable detection of the novel fusions in cancer diagnostics.""Learn more about how Illumina is expanding access to genomics, click here.ReferencesHong DS, DuBois SG, Kummar S, et al.

184,a75369db-6ad3-3530-b13b-b0b0cc04bdde,SWKS,2022-11-09,"Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 78% of the company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/skyworks-solutions-inc-nasdaq-swks-140459781.html,1667916299,STORY,['SWKS'],"[If you want to know who really controls Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 78% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Skyworks Solutions, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Skyworks Solutions ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Skyworks Solutions?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Skyworks Solutions does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Skyworks Solutions' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Skyworks Solutions is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 11% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.6% and 4.5%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Skyworks SolutionsWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that Skyworks Solutions, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$51m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 21% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Skyworks Solutions. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks for example - Skyworks Solutions has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.Ultimately the future is most important.

[Source: U.S. Army]HUNTSVILLE, Ala., Nov. 08, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Northrop Grumman’s Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS) completed the final, demanding assessment, during its recent Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E). Completion of IOT&amp;E is the last major test event before the U.S. Army makes the decision to move the program from low rate initial production to full rate production, allowing IBCS to be fielded around the world.Beginning in January, at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), New Mexico, IBCS began a series of operational flight tests. Throughout the 10-month period, soldiers operated IBCS in complex test environments encompassing a broad spectrum of attack and defense scenarios under realistic operating conditions, stressing the system as never before, and under intense scrutiny by U.S. Army independent evaluators.“Throughout IOT&amp;E, we’ve shown how IBCS enables the warfighter to make more informed and faster decisions,” said Christine Harbison, vice president and general manager, combat systems and mission readiness, Northrop Grumman. “IBCS is ready for today’s threats and those of the future, making Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) a reality.”Across two IO&amp;TE flight tests at WSMR, IBCS detected, tracked, and intercept threats that included: a high speed, high performance tactical ballistic missile and two cruise missile surrogates during a stressing electronic attack.Once fielded, IBCS will extend the battlespace beyond what a single sensor tied to a single effector can provide, allowing the use of a sensor or effector’s full range and enabling the warfighter to quickly see and act on data across the entire battlefield.Northrop Grumman designed IBCS with a modular, open, and scalable system architecture that is foundational to integrating all available assets in the battlespace, regardless of source, service, or domain. Its architecture enables the efficient and affordable integration of current and future systems and extends the battlespace by disaggregating sensors and effectors. Through numerous successful tests and demonstrations, IBCS has validated the ability to connect and fuse multi-service sensor data to multi-service weapons, demonstrating JADC2 capabilities.Story continuesNorthrop Grumman is a technology company, focused on global security and human discovery.

If you want to see more of the best blue chip stocks with strong balance sheets, go directly to 5 Best Blue Chip Stocks With Strong Balance Sheets.Companies with strong balance sheets have more flexibility in challenging times.With more cash on their balance sheets and not as much debt relative to their earnings power, fiscally strong companies can buy back more stock at lower valuations.With M&amp;A, fiscally strong companies can expand by buying companies with weaker balance sheets. Many fiscally strong companies can also gain market share by spending more on R&amp;D or marketing during tough times.A company with a strong balance sheet generally has substantial net cash on its balance sheet. If it does have net debt, a fiscally strong company will have substantial earnings and cash flow to be able to cover its net debt.Fiscally strong companies sometimes have a net debt position because the cost of debt was very affordable when interest rates were low and those companies decided they could add more value if they returned more capital back to shareholders rather than keep it on their balance sheets.2022Given the high inflation, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times in 2022 alone. With the Federal Reserve expected to continue to raise interest rates and with a potential recession in 2023, it could get tougher before it gets better.In the challenging times, blue chip companies with strong balance sheets can offer potential long term value for shareholders given lower valuations and potential value adding expansion opportunities.In the near to medium terms, however, there could be more downside to the market and individual stocks if economic data fails to meet expectations.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Story continuesMethodologyFor our list of 10 Best Blue Chip Stocks With Strong Balance Sheets, we chose 10 leading stocks with strong balance sheets and strong competitive advantages.Using the collective wisdom of hedge funds, we ranked the 10 stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that held shares of the same stock at the end of Q2 2022.10 Best Blue Chip Stocks With Strong Balance Sheets10.

According to the ratings agency, ""Obligations rated Aaa are judged to be of the highest quality, subject to the lowest level of credit risk.""ClearBridge Investments commented on Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) in a Q2 2022 investor letter,We reinforced our defensive capabilities during the quarter with the addition of Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), a diversified health care company with a strong balance sheet, attractive profitability and return metrics and the ability to generate steady moderate growth. It has one of the more diversified and attractive pharmaceutical portfolios and an improving medical technology business, and it will soon be exiting the lower-growth consumer business.

Johnson &amp; Johnson’s products and services have a clear positive impact on human health. The company’s long-held credo sets the tone for ethical business practices and considering all stakeholders in guiding its decision making and prioritizing patients and caregivers. The company also contributes to 11 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGS) through its Health for Humanity 2025 goals.6. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 104Given its scale and leading businesses, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) has a strong balance sheet. For its Q3 2022, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) had a standardized CET1 capital ratio of 12.5% and an advanced CET1 capital ratio of 13%. The company also paid a common dividend of $3 billion given its excess cash generation.Vltava Fund commented on JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) in a Q3 2022 investor letter,We regard JPM to be the strongest and best- managed bank in the world. It is a leader in investment banking, commercial banking, credit cards, and asset management. Its size (the largest bank in the USA, with nearly USD 4,000 billion in assets) and diversification give it a strong competitive advantage that is compounded by its cost advantages and the high costs to clients associated with switching banks. JPM’s management prides itself on running the only large bank to avoid major instability over the long term. JP Morgan’s quality and strength first became fully evident in 2008 under the leadership of its CEO Jamie Dimon. Not only did JP Morgan help to stabilize the market by taking over the failing Bear Stearns in the spring of that year, but throughout the Great Financial Crisis it was the only big US bank that did not require government assistance and it was highly profitable even in the difficult year of 2008. A well-functioning and efficient bank can be a very good long-term investment, because the interest compounding effect works well here. JPM’s return on equity (ROE) is well into the double digits and this puts it in a good position to continue producing better long-term returns than does the market. JPM has been very profitable even during years when interest rates were close to zero. The current – and perhaps not temporary – return to somewhat more normal, higher interest rates should have a significantly positive impact on the bank’s interest income and overall profitability.”Like JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are blue chip stocks with strong balance sheets that many hedge funds in our database owned at the end of the second quarter.Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Blue Chip Stocks With Strong Balance Sheets.Suggested articles:22 Biggest Economies in the World in 202215 Largest IPOs of All Time Worldwide15 Biggest Global Tech Companies by Market CapDisclosure: None. 10 Best Blue Chip Stocks With Strong Balance Sheets is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

With that windfall, it plans to get richer, sinking the cash into developing and marketing potential blockbusters for conditions like migraines, ulcerative colitis, prostate cancer, sickle cell disease, and obesity.It just announced it will triple or even quadruple the price of its COVID vaccine once it goes on the commercial market next year. Meanwhile, the company is inundating doctors and pharmacists—and consumers—with advertising touting its COVID drug Paxlovid.“Pfizer is a remarkable marketing machine. They have an incredible ability to make the most of molecules and get them adopted,” said Timothy Calkins, a professor of marketing at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management.The federal government is helping Pfizer with its marketing, urging people to get boosters targeting the omicron variants, although early data has been mixed on whether the shots work better than the earlier version. But even with a 66% drop in COVID vaccine sales in the past quarter, the company made about $4.4 billion in those three months. Pfizer has a deep stream of cash to finance its future. COVID has been very good for business.The company appears most excited—judging from its messages to investors—about two experimental diabetes pills, “me too” drugs in the class known as GLP-1 agonists. As Pfizer competitors have already discovered, they double as weight-loss drugs. In one trial, more than half of obese patients on a high-dose Eli Lilly and Co. injectable lost a fifth of their body weight—results that have raised the drugs’ cachet as a diet aid in Hollywood, Silicon Valley, and other social niches where cost is no issue and being thin is always in.Wall Street analysts are predicting such massive demand for these drugs that Pfizer “can find a place there with marketing” if its version works, though it is at least two years from licensure, said Mohit Bansal, a Wells Fargo analyst. By 2035, the Lilly drug alone could earn $100 billion a year for its formulation, according to one Bank of America analysis.Story continuesPfizer still sees COVID as a “multibillion-dollar franchise” long term, Chief Financial Officer David Denton told a Nov. 1 earnings call, since COVID “is going to be somewhat like a flu, sustained flu, but actually more deadly than the flu.”The company announced Oct. 20 that it would charge $110 to $130 a shot once government contracts run out next year, more than double what investors were expecting. The U.S. government paid $30.50 per shot in its latest contract with Pfizer, according to Zaid Rizvi, a researcher for the advocacy group Public Citizen.Pfizer was a good citizen in keeping prices down during the worst of the pandemic, CEO Albert Bourla told investors. Now payers will pick up the added cost, while consumers ""wouldn't see the difference” because there's generally no copay for vaccines.Still, unless new mutations are dangerous enough to scare enough people, Wall Street analysts expect sales to lag, as the public loses interest, Republican politicians discourage booster shots, and concerns continue about rare heart damage in young people getting the shots. Pfizer said in July it had taken “a $450 million write-off of inventory related to COVID-19 products” that exceeded “approved shelf-lives.” And Moderna on Nov. 3 lowered sales predictions for its COVID vaccine.“Not many people are going to go out and get their fourth, fifth, and sixth boosters if there’s no major new variant,” said Geoff Meacham, an analyst at Bank of America. “If you’ve had the two mRNAs and a booster, you are pretty well protected. Do you need it annually?”That lagging interest in COVID products has investors pushing Pfizer to show where it can make up revenue for three bestsellers—the breast cancer drug Ibrance, the rheumatoid arthritis drug Xeljanz, and Eliquis, a blood thinner—whose patents run out this decade.While conducting its own research, Pfizer fattened its development portfolio in the past two years by buying companies that already had developed promising drugs. The company hopes these purchases, and its own work, will give it $25 billion in new annual revenue by 2030.Meanwhile, the company has treated investors to $25 billion in dividends over the past three years and spent $9 billion jacking up share prices with stock buybacks.All this is due to the huge profit bulge from its COVID products, which has enabled Pfizer to outpace Johnson &amp; Johnson as the biggest industry revenue earner so far in 2022. From late 2020 through September, Pfizer earned about $80 billion from sales of 3.8 billion COVID vaccines and Paxlovid, and the company expects an additional $15 billion in the remainder of this year. Until recently, investors had been predicting that number would fall to around $11 billion annually by 2026, but Pfizer’s recent commercial pricing announcement increased that figure, potentially, by up to $3 billion, according to a Wells Fargo analysis.Still, “from the investor’s point of view, the focus is not on COVID as much at this point. The focus is, what do they do with this money and expertise?” Bansal said, and how to “use it to grow their core business.”To grow that core, Pfizer since last year has acquired several midsize companies with promising or licensed drugs. It spent $11.6 billion for Biohaven, whose migraine drug Nurtec ODT brought in $324 million in the first half of 2022. Pfizer predicts up to $6 billion in annual revenue from the drug.Its hopes are also high for Oxbryta, a sickle cell anemia drug produced by Global Blood Therapeutics, which Pfizer bought for $5.4 billion. Priced at $125,000 a year, the drug, which raises oxygen levels in patients, earned $100 million in the first two quarters of the year but might be worth $2.5 billion annually with a powerful marketing engine behind it, according to Wall Street analysts.Pfizer is strengthening its franchise in respiratory vaccines and treatments, Dr. Mikael Dolsten, the chief scientific officer, said on the Nov. 1 call. It’s racing against GSK and Moderna to be first to license a vaccine that protects older adults as well as pregnant women and their newborns against RSV, a respiratory virus that has overwhelmed children’s hospitals this fall. The company also has released an updated version of its bacterial pneumonia vaccine, which brought in $5.3 billion in 2021.The other mRNA vaccine companies are also rolling in cash but have narrower strategies. Moderna is testing 32 infectious-disease vaccines and developing a long-shot individualized cancer vaccine. Pfizer’s German partner, BioNTech, which did most of the original development of their COVID vaccine, has a similar focus.Pfizer and Moderna both began advanced clinical trials this year for their first non-COVID mRNA vaccines—against influenza. If flu season is widespread enough, the tests could show whether the vaccines are any better than standard flu shots, and whether one works better than the other.Investors expect a lot from Pfizer, with its 80,000 employees and $81 billion in 2021 revenue. And they are likely to get it.Nurtec, the migraine drug it acquired with Biohaven, will be a good test case. Pfizer and giants like it each have at least 2,000 sales reps marketing to primary care physicians in the United States, Calkins said. An operation like that probably costs $400 million a year, he said, far more than a company like Biohaven could afford.Pfizer will use its marketing prowess, particularly among primary care physicians, to “build the world’s leading migraine franchise,” CEO Bourla said on the Nov. 1 call. Pfizer has the resources to flood the media with direct-to-consumer ads and negotiate with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers to make sure patients can get this and other drugs, said Bansal, the Wells Fargo analyst.Sickle cell patients are harder to reach, but Pfizer “has relationships in the hospital setting, the heft of their investment in commercialization” to increase sales of Oxbryta, said Evan Seigerman, a research analyst at BMO Capital Markets.Pfizer also plans to make a blockbuster of etrasimod, an experimental drug against ulcerative colitis that it acquired with its $6.7 billion purchase of Arena Pharmaceuticals.Pfizer’s GLP-1 formulation is key to its goals. The GLP-1 drugs are similar to a gut peptide, or small protein, that stimulates biochemical pathways that help release insulin, diminish appetite, and lower certain immune responses. While the drugs were invented and licensed to fight Type 2 diabetes, the FDA has approved one of them for obesity treatment as well, and companies are testing GLP-1 formulations against fatty liver disease, sleep apnea, kidney disease, congestive heart failure, and even Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.Pfizer executives said they hope to decide by 2024 which of two candidate drugs to take into large clinical trials. The company sees itself finding a niche with a pill that can be taken with or without food, according to Dolsten. Most of the current products are injectables, which turn off many people.Assuming one of the drugs gets licensed, marketing will do the rest.KHN (Kaiser Health News) is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues.

(PFE) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pfizer-inc-pfe-attracting-investor-140002149.html,1667916002,STORY,['PFE'],"[Pfizer (PFE) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this drugmaker have returned +12.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.7% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Pfizer belongs, has gained 10.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Pfizer is expected to post earnings of $1.14 per share, indicating a change of +5.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -13.4% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.46 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +46.2%. This estimate has changed -1.2% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.91 indicates a change of -23.9% from what Pfizer is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -8.8%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Pfizer is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PFE _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Pfizer, the consensus sales estimate of $24.4 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.3%. The $100.32 billion and $77.44 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +23.1% and -22.8%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPfizer reported revenues of $22.64 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -6%. EPS of $1.78 for the same period compares with $1.34 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.04 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.61%. The EPS surprise was +21.09%.Over the last four quarters, Pfizer surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Pfizer is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Pfizer. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

200,bd7b04b9-b13c-3ab6-b3db-31a906a8c8a8,FOXA,2022-11-09,EnLink Midstream and Ball Corporation have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/enlink-midstream-ball-corporation-highlighted-153703928.html,1667921823,STORY,"['BALL', 'FOXA', 'DKNG', 'VZIO', 'ENLC']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – November 8, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares EnLink Midstream ENLC as the Bull of the Day and Ball Corporation BALL as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Fox Corporation FOXA, VIZIO VZIO and DraftKings DKNG.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:EnLink Midstream, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, has benefitted immensely from the commodity price surge this year. After falling under $1/share during the initial onset of the coronavirus pandemic, the stock has surged over 1,500% since March 2020 and continues to make a series of higher highs. Only stocks that are garnering extreme buying pressure are able to make this type of price move, going from penny stock to double digits in just a two-year time span. ENLC is currently trading near new highs on the year, even as the market continues to hover in a correction.ENLC boasts our highest-possible ‘A’ ratings for each of our Zacks Growth and Momentum Style Score categories, indicating a strong likelihood that the stock propels higher on the powerful combination of positive earnings estimate revisions and stock price performance. The company is a component of the Zacks Oil &amp; Gas – Refining &amp; Marketing industry, which ranks in the top 2% of all Zacks Ranked Industries. The group is up more than 43% this year while the S&amp;P is down more than 20%.Quantitative research studies have repeatedly shown that roughly half of a stock’s future price appreciation is due to its industry grouping. Because this group is ranked in the top half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect it to outperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months. By targeting stocks contained within top industry groups, investors can dramatically improve their rate of success.Company DescriptionEnLink Midstream, LLC provides midstream energy services domestically. The company is engaged in the gathering, processing, transporting, storing, and selling of natural gas and crude oil. Its midstream network includes over 12,000 miles of pipelines and more than 20 natural gas processing plants.Story continuesENLC is also involved in carbon capture, in an effort to obtain real progress in terms of the decarbonization of the global economy. Just last month, the company announced that it entered a transportation service agreement with a subsidiary of ExxonMobil, where it will utilize portions of its existing pipeline network as well as new facilities to deliver carbon dioxide from the Mississippi River corridor to ExxonMobil’s carbon dioxide storage location.Earnings Trends and Future EstimatesENLC has exceeded earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters, sporting an average 92.58% beat over that timeframe. Last week, the oil and gas company reported third-quarter earnings of $0.18 cents per share, which translated to a 63.64% positive surprise versus the $0.11/share consensus estimate.Looking ahead, earnings estimates for the current quarter as well as 2023 have been skyrocketing. Analysts are in agreement and in the past 30 days, Q4 EPS estimates have been increased by 25% to $0.15 per share. This reflects a 36.4% growth rate relative to the same quarter last year. It’s obvious the growth is there and looks set to continue.Charting the CourseENLC has continued its winning ways over the past few months while the market has been in correction mode. This is the kind of stock we want to include in our portfolio – one that is trending well and experiencing positive earnings estimate revisions. The stock has soared more than 80% this year and continues to make a series of higher highs. Only stocks that are in extremely powerful uptrends are able to weather bear markets so gracefully.Notice how the 50 and 200-day moving averages as evidenced by the blue and red lines, respectively, are both sloping up. The stock is displaying relative strength versus the market – a bullish sign.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. And as we know, EnLink Midstream has seen a steady batch of positive revisions as of late. As long as this trend remains intact (and ENLC continues to post earnings beats), the stock should continue its bullish run through the end of this year and beyond.Bottom LineWith a history of surpassing earnings estimates and an improving future outlook, EnLink Midstream represents a great opportunity. With a $0.45 (3.81%) dividend yield, it’s not difficult to see why this stock is a compelling investment.Solid institutional buying and a high-performing industry group should continue to provide a tailwind for the stock price. Recent positive earnings estimate revisions will help to provide a cushion during any further market decline. If you’re looking for a way to diversify your portfolio, make sure to put ENLC on your shortlist.Bear of the Day:Ball Corporation supplies aluminum packaging products for the beverage, personal care, and household industries globally. The company manufactures and sells aluminum containers of carbonated soft drinks, beer, energy drinks, and related beverages. BALL also develops sensors and instruments, radio frequency systems, and other technologies for the civil and national security aerospace markets to governmental and commercial customers. Ball Corp. was founded in 1880 and is based in Westminster, CO.The Zacks RundownBALL is part of the Zacks Containers – Metal and Glass industry group, which currently ranks in the bottom 1% out of approximately 250 industry groups. Because this industry is ranked in the bottom half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect it to underperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months. This industry has widely underperformed the market this year with a -34% return year-to-date.Candidates in the bottom tiers of industry groups can often represent solid potential short candidates. While individual stocks have the ability to outperform even when included in poor-performing industries, their industry association serves as a headwind for any potential rallies. BALL is fighting an uphill battle and the stock is confirming this notion as it continues to make a series of lower lows.Despite this year’s price decline, BALL is still overvalued relative to its industry group, irrespective of the metric used.Weak Foundation: Falling Short on Earnings and Deteriorating ForecastsEarnings misses have been a sore spot for BALL during the past year. The packaging company has fallen short of estimates in three of the past four quarters. BALL most recently reported Q3 EPS last week of $0.75, missing the $0.76 consensus estimate by -1.32%.BALL has posted an average earnings miss of -2.42% over the past four quarters. This is the type of negative trend that the bears like to see. Consistently missing earnings estimates is a recipe for stock price underperformance, and BALL is no exception.Analysts have been revising earnings estimates downward as of late. For the current quarter, estimates have been slashed -11.49% over the past 60 days. The Q4 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate now stands at $0.77, translating to a -20.62% earnings regression relative to the same quarter last year.Technical OutlookBALL stock has been steadily falling since last year and has now established a well-defined downtrend. Notice how both the 50-day (blue line) and 200-day (red line) moving averages are sloping down. Shares have declined more than 45% this year. The stock continues to trade below both averages, while the 50-day moving average has acted as steady resistance throughout the down move.BALL has continued to make a series of lower lows during the fourth quarter, even as many stocks have shown strength.Final ThoughtsThe recent earnings misses in addition to deteriorating estimates are both huge red flags and need to be respected. These will likely serve as a ceiling to any potential rallies, nurturing the stock’s downtrend.BALL’s characteristics have resulted in a worst-possible Zacks Growth Style Score of ‘F,’ indicating further downside is likely. The fact that BALL is included in a bottom-performing industry group simply adds to the growing list of concerns. Investors will want to steer clear of BALL until the situation shows major signs of improvement, or possibly include it as part of a hedge or short strategy.Additional content:Fox to Buy a Stake in FanDuelFox Corporation has recently received a green flag towards buying a stake in FanDuel, one of the biggest brands in U.S. online gambling.Fox had been facing a dispute with Flutter, the parent organization of FanDuel, over this deal over the past year, as the latter was demanding too high a price for an option to buy an 18.6% stake in FanDuel.However, recently, an arbitrator has ruled that Fox has the option to buy a stake in sports-betting operator FanDuel Group from parent company Flutter for about $3.7 billion.This comes as a strong tailwind for Fox as the deal would aid the performance of Fox Bet, the online sports betting brand of Fox, which has been struggling as it failed to gain traction in the U.S. betting market due to its poor reach and tech.The deal would help Fox in successfully diversifying itself into the booming wagering business which per Custom Markets Insight is expected to reach around USD 145.6 Billion by 2030 at a CAGR of 12%.Fox to Bolster Growth with Other M&amp;A’s and PartnershipsFox Corp recently announced its merger with News Corp. This merger would bring back high-profile business divisions under one roof after a split in 2013. Fox’s Fox News, Fox broadcast network, local TV stations and the Tubi streaming service would be combined with News Corp’s Dow Jones, The Wall Street Journal, as well as other assets, including HarperCollins Publishers and news organizations in the United Kingdom and Australia.This would diversify and broaden the portfolio of Fox Corporation, hence gaining traction with more customers and adding new sources of revenue.Fox Corporation price-consensus-chart | Fox Corporation QuoteFox has also entered a multi-year deal with VIZIO to expand its distribution partnership. The Fox Sports app will now be available on VIZIO smart TVs along with the Fox Weather channel being added to VIZIO WatchFree+ besides existing Fox ad-supported LiveNOW and Fox Soul. VIZIO Ads will also have access to Fox’s premium inventory for audience-based opportunities with advertisers.In August, Fox announced the completion of a multi-year renewal of its distribution agreement with Verizon for its Fios TV platform.The agreement included the continued distribution of the entire portfolio of FOX brands, including FOX News Media, FOX Sports, FOX Network and local FOX O&amp;O TV stations in markets including New York, Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia. FOX Weather has also been added to the Fios TV lineup and Tubi is included in both Fios TV set-top boxes, as well as on many other platforms.Threats Attached to the DealsThese mergers and acquisitions and partnerships are expected to bolster Fox’s top line, but they also bring certain headwinds for the company. The wagering business, into which Fox is expanding, is highly competitive with companies like DraftKings having already established a secure market position in the sports betting industry.DraftKings is focusing on its iGaming products as it launched a sportsbook in Kansas at the start of this month. Its Same Game Parlay, which allows multiple betting outcomes from the same game into one parlay bet and feature enhancements like the Web3 strategy, has gained significant anticipation among players.The merger with News Corporation also brings some risks for Fox. Readers’ preference for accessing news online, mostly free, has made News Corporation’s print-advertising model increasingly redundant. Besides, a major portion of News Corporation’s total revenues is generated outside the United States. The ongoing foreign exchange fluctuation or the U.S. dollar gaining strength may hurt both the top and bottom lines of the company.This has not boded well among the investors. The shares of Fox Corporation, which currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), have declined 19.1% year to date compared to Zacks Consumer Discretionary Sector, which fell 38.4%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

EPS of $1.08 for the same period compares with $1.11 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.82 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.4%. The EPS surprise was +13.68%.Over the last four quarters, Paypal surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Paypal is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Paypal. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A challenging macroeconomic landscape with rising inflation is also a concern. Soaring prices and persistent delays in customer acceptance have resulted in high levels of backlog and cast a pall on the industry’s prospects. Nonetheless, International Business Machines, ZoomInfo, Agilysys and PAR Technology are a few industry participants to watch as they are benefiting from the rise in advanced forms of data management, the rapid shift from traditional silos, increased demand for integration of deployment techniques as well as modern application development.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Computer – Integrated Systems industry comprises companies that provide advanced information technology solutions, including computer systems, software, storage systems and microelectronics. These industry players are increasing investments in data modernization and analytics, cyber defense, remote work, automation and contact-less services, customer &amp; employee experience, and supply-chain modernization, which accelerate growth in digital transformation services.Some industry participants also provide technological solutions (both products and services) to aid organizations in connecting, interacting and transacting with customers. Others develop and market information recognition, data entry software, systems as well as technologies.4 Computer - Integrated Systems Industry Trends in FocusIntegrated Solutions Driving Demand: The industry is benefiting from rising demand for integrated solutions across small, medium and large-scale enterprises, along with increasing investments in IoT, big data, AI and blockchain software technologies. Moreover, business analytics, cloud computing, mobile, and security and social businesses present significant opportunities to an increasing number of remote workers in the wake of the coronavirus-induced work-from-home wave. The industry players are anticipated to benefit from recovering global IT spending, as predicted by Gartner.Story continuesSolid Adoption of Multi-Cloud Model: The growing adoption of the multi-cloud model to achieve better scalability and attain improved resource utilization is also expanding the scope of the industry participants. Cloud and hardware/software virtual technologies are anticipated to favorably impact the industry. As growth and investment opportunities in developed countries continue to slow down, we believe that emerging economies will play a crucial role in the days ahead.Supply-Chain Bottlenecks and Backlogs: Industry participants are witnessing supply constraints, softness in server demand and cognitive applications, as well as delays in customer acceptance, in turn resulting in high levels of backlog, particularly in Compute, High Performance Computing &amp; Mass Storage Class and Storage. Moreover, volatility in foreign exchange — primarily due to the current macroeconomic scenario and headwinds in emerging markets — does not bode well for the industry.Semiconductor Chip Shortage Mars Prospects: Industry participants are facing challenges owing to the ongoing and heavily time-consuming business model transition to the cloud. Further, lower spending across Data-Center Systems — primarily due to component shortages like memory and CPUs, as well as deceleration in hyperscale spending — is likely to dampen the prospects of the industry participants.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Computer – Integrated Systems industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #185, which places it in the bottom 27% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued underperformance in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are pessimistic on this group’s earnings growth potential. Since Nov 30, 2021, the industry’s earnings estimate for 2022 has moved down 15.6%.Despite the gloomy industry outlook, a few stocks are worth watching based on a strong earnings outlook.

It is also below the sector’s trailing 12-month P/S of 4.26X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 2.15X and as low as 1.14X, with the median being at 1.61X.4 Computer-Integrated Systems Providers to WatchAgilysys:The company operates as a developer and marketer of hardware and software products as well as services, with special expertise in select vertical markets, including retail and hospitality in North America, Europe, the Asia-Pacific and India.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s expertise in enterprise architecture and high availability, infrastructure optimization, storage and resource management, as well as business continuity, is a major growth driver.Shares of AGYS have risen 43.7% year to date.

204,e3207781-ab74-3eb9-b99b-b7e35b98d3e4,IBM,2022-11-09,A International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) insider lowered their holding by 9.6% earlier this year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/international-business-machines-corporation-nyse-110028571.html,1667991628,STORY,['IBM'],"[From what we can see, insiders were net sellers in International Business Machines Corporation's (NYSE:IBM ) during the past 12 months. That is, insiders sold the stock in greater numbers than they purchased it.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for International Business Machines The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At International Business MachinesOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Robert Del Bene, for US$222k worth of shares, at about US$139 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at below the current price (US$140). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 9.6% of Robert Del Bene's stake. Robert Del Bene was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 1.08k shares worth US$135k. But they sold 1.60k shares for US$222k. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At International Business Machines Have Bought Stock RecentlyIt's good to see that International Business Machines insiders have made notable investments in the company's shares. Specifically, Independent Director David Farr bought US$125k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any sales whatsoever. This makes one think the business has some good points.Story continuesDoes International Business Machines Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It appears that International Business Machines insiders own 0.08% of the company, worth about US$100m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At International Business Machines Tell Us?It's certainly positive to see the recent insider purchase. However, the longer term transactions are not so encouraging. We don't take much heart from transactions by International Business Machines insiders over the last year. But they own a reasonable amount of the company, and there was some buying recently. Overall they seem reasonably aligned. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. At Simply Wall St, we've found that International Business Machines has 4 warning signs (1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that deserve your attention before going any further with your analysis.But note: International Business Machines may not be the best stock to buy.

A challenging macroeconomic landscape with rising inflation is also a concern. Soaring prices and persistent delays in customer acceptance have resulted in high levels of backlog and cast a pall on the industry’s prospects. Nonetheless, International Business Machines IBM, ZoomInfo ZI, Agilysys AGYS and PAR Technology PAR are a few industry participants to watch as they are benefiting from the rise in advanced forms of data management, the rapid shift from traditional silos, increased demand for integration of deployment techniques as well as modern application development.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Computer – Integrated Systems industry comprises companies that provide advanced information technology solutions, including computer systems, software, storage systems and microelectronics. These industry players are increasing investments in data modernization and analytics, cyber defense, remote work, automation and contact-less services, customer &amp; employee experience, and supply-chain modernization, which accelerate growth in digital transformation services. Some industry participants also provide technological solutions (both products and services) to aid organizations in connecting, interacting and transacting with customers. Others develop and market information recognition, data entry software, systems as well as technologies.4 Computer - Integrated Systems Industry Trends in FocusIntegrated Solutions Driving Demand: The industry is benefiting from rising demand for integrated solutions across small, medium and large-scale enterprises, along with increasing investments in IoT, big data, AI and blockchain software technologies. Moreover, business analytics, cloud computing, mobile, and security and social businesses present significant opportunities to an increasing number of remote workers in the wake of the coronavirus-induced work-from-home wave. The industry players are anticipated to benefit from recovering global IT spending, as predicted by Gartner.Solid Adoption of Multi-Cloud Model: The growing adoption of the multi-cloud model to achieve better scalability and attain improved resource utilization is also expanding the scope of the industry participants. Cloud and hardware/software virtual technologies are anticipated to favorably impact the industry. As growth and investment opportunities in developed countries continue to slow down, we believe that emerging economies will play a crucial role in the days ahead.Supply-Chain Bottlenecks and Backlogs: Industry participants are witnessing supply constraints, softness in server demand and cognitive applications, as well as delays in customer acceptance, in turn resulting in high levels of backlog, particularly in Compute, High Performance Computing &amp; Mass Storage Class and Storage. Moreover, volatility in foreign exchange — primarily due to the current macroeconomic scenario and headwinds in emerging markets — does not bode well for the industry.Semiconductor Chip Shortage Mars Prospects: Industry participants are facing challenges owing to the ongoing and heavily time-consuming business model transition to the cloud. Further, lower spending across Data-Center Systems — primarily due to component shortages like memory and CPUs, as well as deceleration in hyperscale spending — is likely to dampen the prospects of the industry participants.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Computer – Integrated Systems industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #185, which places it in the bottom 27% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued underperformance in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

(NASDAQ:ISRG) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical Is Intuitive Surgical Fairly Valued?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.13bUS$2.47bUS$2.71bUS$3.10bUS$3.39bUS$3.62bUS$3.82bUS$3.99bUS$4.14bUS$4.27bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 9.15%Est @ 7%Est @ 5.5%Est @ 4.44%Est @ 3.7%Est @ 3.19% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.6% US$2.0kUS$2.2kUS$2.2kUS$2.4kUS$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$23bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.3b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.6%– 2.0%) = US$95bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$95b÷ ( 1 + 6.6%)10= US$50bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$73b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$241, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Intuitive Surgical as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.895. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Relative to the current share price of US$54.3, the company appears quite good value at a 48% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Royal Caribbean Cruises as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 11%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.855. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 5 Best Technology Dividend Stocks To Buy. Dividend investing has come to limelight again in 2022 as the broader market suffered a massive downturn which is expected to last well into 2023. Investors are looking for high-dividend stocks that are also reliable and have safe and secure dividend payments. The Federal Reserve is continuing to increase interest rates to control inflation. These rate hikes could result in job losses in the near future. Equities are also taking a beating and they are not expected to recover anytime soon. This has created a lot of uncertainty in the market, especially among average investors with budget constraints. They want to avoid investing in tech growth stocks but at the same time don’t want to just keep the cash in their accounts. Dividend investing is one of the best ways to park your cash given you choose dividend stocks carefully.According to a CNBC article, Sam Stovall, the chief investment strategist at CFRA research, believes that dividend stocks reduce the overall volatility and provide a “cushion to offset price declines.” The CNBC report cites data to back this claim. As of September, the S&amp;P 500 was down about 23% year to date. On the other hand, the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index was down just about 5% in the same period. This shows that dividend stocks can easily offset the market volatility.Stovall also highlighted the importance of dividend reinvestment plans. The analyst said that reinvested dividends account for a whopping 33% of the total returns of the S&amp;P 500 since 1945 through September. This data point shows that dividend stocks do not only perform when the market conditions are tough. Wise investors have been enjoying the compounding effect of their dividend income in all market cycles. The analyst, according to CNBC, said that dividend investing can improve “your performance by a third without doing anything.”Story continuesThis compounding effect becomes more notable if we change the time period to calculate the returns of reinvested dividends. The CNBC article said that the S&amp;P 500 has gained 1,455% since 1988. This would mean that if you invested $10,000 in 1988, your invested amount would now be about $155,500. But if you take into account reinvested dividends, your $10,000 would be $329,000. This is the power of compounding. Investors can offset risks and also earn stable income by investing in solid dividend stocks.Photo by Alexandr Bormotin on UnsplashMethodologyFor this article we picked tech dividend stock with decent yields and solid dividend history. These companies not only offer stable income but can also see a boost in their share prices once the market starts to rebound. These companies have long-term growth catalysts and they are also popular among the 895 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey as of the end of the second quarter of this year.Best Technology Dividend Stocks To Buy10. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is quickly gaining popularity as a strong dividend-paying company in the technology sector. Apple is one of those rare stocks that offer both long-term share appreciation opportunities as well as a stable dividend income. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has increased its dividend consistently for the last 9 years. Apple stock recently jumped close to 9% after the company posted upbeat quarterly results, defying skeptics who were forecasting weak iPhone sales data. Dan Ives of investment firm Wedbush said in a note that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) proved to be ""the one bright spot"" in an otherwise ""horror show week"" of tech earnings.Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the ninth most popular stock in the database of 895 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey as of the end of the second quarter. Among the major hedge funds which have been enjoying stable dividend income from the company include Warren Buffett’s Berkshire and Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management.Here is what Wedgewood Partners specifically said about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) grew revenues +5% (foreign exchange adjusted and excluding Russia) driven by record iPhone revenues that were up about +3% on an exceptional year ago comparison of +50%. Apple’s installed base is over 1.8 billion devices which helps drive a software and services business that has generated almost $80 billion of revenue over the past 4 quarters. As we have highlighted in the past, Apple’s relentless focus on the development and integration between hardware (especially ICs) as well as software, continues to add significant value for customers of its products and services. We expect this favorable competitive dynamic to continue for the foreseeable future.”9. Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI)Massachusetts-based Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) is a semiconductor company that specializes in signal conversion, data processing and power management technologies. Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) has a dividend yield of 2.1% as of October 29. In February, the company upped its dividend by a whopping 10%. This marked the19th increase in dividend from the company in the past 18 years.In October, Citi analyst Christopher Danely said in a note to investors that Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) is expected to be one of the outperformers during the current downturn that he thinks is the worst ""in at least a decade."" The analyst thinks the downturn is affecting “every company and end market” including Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) but said the company’s management is honest about the effects of the downturn and is taking steps to prepare the company for the possible problems. He has a $195 price target on Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI).Here is what Madison Funds has to say about Analog Devices, Inc. in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“At its 2017 investor day, Analog Device’s VP of Automotive, Mark Gill, described how the company’s content on well-equipped electric vehicles was $600 per car compared to $250 per car for the traditional 2017 internal combustion engine car. Since then, Analog has highlighted the success of its EV battery management systems (BMS) product nearly every quarter. The BMS product is hardware and software that manages the power into and out of the battery systems. It’s the brains of the operation. Analog says it’s on its fifth generation BMS product, that it has the no. 1 market share in high voltage products, and that it is on 5 of the top 10 selling EVs. While we think that the BMS product is just 1 to 1.5% of Analog’s product mix, we think that it could add nearly a point of revenue growth per year to the company’s top-line given the expected ramp in EV production. This is a material amount of growth atop an already nicely growing company revenue line.”8. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is one of the best technology dividend stocks. The semiconductor and infrastructure software company has been increasing its dividend consistently for over a decade now.In October, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya reiterated a Buy rating on Broadcom Inc.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Tech stocks, including Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), were one of the hardest-hit sectors due to fears over a weakening macroeconomic environment. Broadcom, however, outperformed semiconductor peers as its end-market exposures provided relatively more defensive characteristics.”7. Comtech Telecommunications Corp. (NASDAQ:CMTL)Comtech (NASDAQ:CMTL) is a relatively unknown tech stock which is trading at around $11 as of October 29. However, the stock’s dividend yield stands at 3.68%.

On an adjusted basis, our revenues grew a healthy three percent, building on the robust results from last year.Profitability for the quarter was $350 million, down 15 percent, although that reflects the forex headwinds and a fundamental reset by Amazon of its book inventory levels and warehouse footprint. We view neither factor as reflective of core business conditions or of our long-term potential.Story continuesDow Jones posted its best first quarter results since its acquisition with revenues rising 16 percent and Segment EBITDA an even more impressive 19 percent, benefiting from the successful integration of OPIS and Chemical Market Analytics, strong digital advertising growth, record digital subscriptions and continued momentum at Risk &amp; Compliance.News Corp is building on a sturdy base.

The decline was primarily due to a $153 million, or 6%, negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations and lower revenues at the Book Publishing segment due to lower physical book sales from Amazon, partially offset by higher Dow Jones segment revenues, which includes the acquisitions of OPIS and Chemical Market Analytics (""CMA""). Adjusted Revenues (which excludes the foreign currency impact, acquisitions and divestitures as defined in Note 2) increased 3%.Net income for the quarter was $66 million, a 75% decline compared to $267 million in the prior year, primarily due to lower Other, net and lower Total Segment EBITDA, as discussed below, partially offset by lower tax expense.The Company reported first quarter Total Segment EBITDA of $350 million, a 15% decline compared to $410 million in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in costs, partly due to inflationary pressures, lower revenues, as discussed above, and a $23 million, or 6%, negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations.

Segment EBITDA in the quarter decreased $19 million, or 14%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $9 million, or 7%, negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations and higher employee and marketing costs related to strategic investments at both Move and REA Group, partially offset by lower broker commissions at REA Group. Adjusted Revenues and Adjusted Segment EBITDA (as defined in Note 2) increased 3% and declined 7%, respectively.In the quarter, revenues at REA Group increased $6 million, or 2%, to $252 million, driven by higher Australian residential revenues due to price increases, the contribution from Premiere Plus, increased depth penetration and growth in national listings. The growth was partially offset by a $20 million, or 9%, negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations and lower financial services revenues due to declines in settlement activity. Australian national residential buy listing volumes in the quarter increased 5% compared to the prior year, with listings in Melbourne up 12% and Sydney up 5%, partly due to a number of state lockdowns in the prior year.Move’s revenues in the quarter decreased $11 million, or 6%, to $169 million, primarily as a result of lower real estate revenues, partially offset by higher advertising revenues.

Revenues from the traditional lead generation product and the referral model, which includes the ReadyConnect Concierge℠ product, decreased due to these factors, partially offset by continued improvements in yield at Connections℠ Plus and higher home prices.

Higher revenues were partially offset by higher costs related to the acquisitions and higher employee costs. Adjusted Segment EBITDA decreased 1%.Book PublishingRevenues in the quarter decreased $59 million, or 11%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower physical book sales due to Amazon’s reset of its inventory levels and rightsizing of its warehouse footprint which resulted in lower order volume and higher returns, despite consumer sales data remaining consistent with prior quarters. The decline also reflects a $22 million, or 4%, negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Key titles in the quarter included Portrait of an Unknown Woman by Daniel Silva, Live Wire: Long-Winded Short Stories by Kelly Ripa and Breaking History by Jared Kushner. Adjusted Revenues decreased 7%. Digital sales increased 1% compared to the prior year due to higher sales of downloadable audiobooks, partially offset by lower e-book sales.

The decline was partially offset by cover price increases, higher content licensing revenues and digital subscriber growth.Advertising revenues decreased $10 million, or 4%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $22 million, or 9%, negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations, lower print advertising at News UK and lower revenues at Wireless Group, partly due to the absence of the Euro 2020, which occurred in the prior year period. The decline was partially offset by growth in digital advertising, primarily at News UK (mainly at The Sun), and the recovery of print advertising at News Corp Australia.In the quarter, Segment EBITDA decreased $16 million, or 47%, compared to the prior year, reflecting lower revenues, as discussed above, and a $2 million, or 6%, negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations.

The positive contributions from News Corp Australia and the New York Post were more than offset by the negative contributions from News UK and Wireless Group and negative foreign currency fluctuations. Adjusted Segment EBITDA decreased 44%.Digital revenues represented 36% of News Media segment revenues in the quarter, compared to 33% in the prior year, and represented 33% of the combined revenues of the newspaper mastheads. Digital subscribers and users across key properties within the News Media segment are summarized below:Closing digital subscribers at News Corp Australia as of September 30, 2022 were 1,012,000 (929,000 for news mastheads), compared to 897,000 (850,000 for news mastheads) in the prior year (Source: Internal data)The Times and Sunday Times closing digital subscribers, including the Times Literary Supplement, as of September 30, 2022 were 468,000, compared to 380,000 in the prior year (Source: Internal data)New York Post’s digital network reached 151 million unique users in September 2022, compared to 151 million in the prior year (Source: Google Analytics)CASH FLOWThe following table presents a reconciliation of net cash (used in) provided by operating activities to free cash flow and free cash flow available to News Corporation:For the three months endedSeptember 30,20222021(in millions)Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities$(31)$68Less: Capital expenditures(104)(101)Free cash flow(135)(33)Less: REA Group free cash flow(37)(35)Plus: Cash dividends received from REA Group5043Free cash flow available to News Corporation$(122)$(25)Net cash used in operating activities of $31 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $99 million lower than net cash provided by operating activities of $68 million in the prior year, primarily due to lower Total Segment EBITDA, as noted above, higher working capital and higher interest payments, partially offset by lower restructuring payments.Free cash flow in the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $(135) million compared to $(33) million in the prior year. Free cash flow available to News Corporation in the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $(122) million compared to $(25) million in the prior year period. The decrease in both free cash flow and free cash flow available to News Corporation was primarily due to lower cash provided by operating activities, as mentioned above. Foxtel’s capital expenditures for the three months ended September 30, 2022 were $40 million compared to $48 million in the prior year.Free cash flow and free cash flow available to News Corporation are non-GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, and free cash flow available to News Corporation is defined as free cash flow, less REA Group free cash flow, plus cash dividends received from REA Group.The Company believes free cash flow provides useful information to management and investors about the Company’s liquidity and cash flow trends. The Company believes free cash flow available to News Corporation, which adjusts free cash flow to exclude REA Group’s free cash flow and include dividends received from REA Group, provides management and investors with a measure of the amount of cash flow that is readily available to the Company, as REA Group is a separately listed public company in Australia and must declare a dividend in order for the Company to have access to its share of REA Group’s cash balance. The Company believes free cash flow available to News Corporation provides a more conservative view of the Company’s free cash flow because this presentation includes only that amount of cash the Company actually receives from REA Group, which has generally been lower than the Company’s unadjusted free cash flow. A limitation of both free cash flow and free cash flow available to News Corporation is that they do not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period. Management compensates for the limitation of free cash flow and free cash flow available to News Corporation by also relying on the net change in cash and cash equivalents as presented in the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows prepared in accordance with GAAP which incorporates all cash movements during the period.OTHER ITEMSExploration of Potential Combination with Fox Corporation (""Fox"")In October 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors (the ""Board""), following the receipt of letters from K. Rupert Murdoch and the Murdoch Family Trust, has formed a special committee of independent and disinterested members of the Board (the ""Special Committee"") to begin exploring a potential combination with Fox (the ""Potential Transaction""). The letters indicated that Mr. Murdoch and the Murdoch Family Trust will not vote in favor of a transaction unless it is both recommended by the Special Committee and approved by a majority vote of the shares held by non-affiliated stockholders entitled to vote. The Special Committee, in consultation with its independent financial and legal advisors, will evaluate the Potential Transaction. The Special Committee has not made any determination with respect to the Potential Transaction, and there can be no certainty that the Company will engage in the Potential Transaction. Neither the Company nor the Special Committee intends to disclose further developments regarding the Special Committee’s work until it deems such disclosure is appropriate or required.COMPARISON OF NON-GAAP TO U.S. GAAP INFORMATIONAdjusted Revenues, Total Segment EBITDA, Adjusted Total Segment EBITDA, Adjusted Segment EBITDA, adjusted net income attributable to News Corporation stockholders, Adjusted EPS, free cash flow and free cash flow available to News Corporation are non-GAAP financial measures contained in this earnings release. The Company believes these measures are important tools for investors and analysts to use in assessing the Company’s underlying business performance and to provide for more meaningful comparisons of the Company’s operating performance between periods. These measures also allow investors and analysts to view the Company’s business from the same perspective as Company management. These non-GAAP measures may be different than similar measures used by other companies and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations for the differences between non-GAAP measures used in this earnings release and comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP are included in Notes 1, 2 and 3 and the reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow available to News Corporation is included above.Conference callNews Corporation’s earnings conference call can be heard live at 5:00 p.m. EST on November 8, 2022.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Goldman Sachs Semiconductor Stocks: Top 5 Picks. As per Washington-based Semiconductor Industry Association, global semiconductor sales dropped 3% in September compared to last year, and Korean chipmakers produced 3.5% less than a year earlier in September. The Korean economy, which is highly dependent on the semiconductor industry, experienced low demand given weakening currencies, high trade deficits, and tightening interest rates around the world. Meanwhile, the Biden administration is trying to boost investments in US chipmaking, in order to compete with China and to manufacture components essential for national security. The US effort increased after the semiconductor industry faced massive shortages in late 2020 and 2021, which revealed how essential chips were in the digital economy, for the production of everything from cars to smartphones. The most recent effort to help establish the US semiconductor industry is the CHIPS Act, which lent $39 billion in government funding for the local semiconductor manufacturing plants, in addition to billions of dollars for research and development initiatives.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is planning to construct a second US plant next to a $12 billion complex it is already building, which will advance American efforts to support local chipmaking. To benefit from the ongoing semiconductor initiatives amid lower competition from Korean and Chinese manufacturers, some of the best semiconductor stocks to consider according to investment firm Goldman Sachs are Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM). Our Methodology We selected the top 10 semiconductor stocks from the Goldman Sachs portfolio as of the end of the second quarter of 2022 for this analysis. Insider Monkey’s database of 895 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2022 was used to assess the hedge fund sentiment around the securities. Story continuesGoldman Sachs Semiconductor Stocks: Top 10 PicksPhoto by Redd on UnsplashGoldman Sachs Semiconductor Stocks: Top Picks10. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65Goldman Sachs’ Stake Value: $535,779,000Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is a California-based multinational technology corporation that operates in the semiconductors, computer hardware, autonomous cars, automation, and artificial intelligence sectors. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is one of the elite Goldman Sachs semiconductor stocks to monitor, with the firm holding 14.3 million shares worth nearly $536 million, representing 0.12% of the total securities. On October 31, Citi analyst Christopher Danely maintained a Neutral rating on Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) but lowered the price target on the shares to $27 from $30. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) posted mixed results and guided well below consensus due to the PC downturn, the analyst told investors. The company also disclosed a cost control plan, ""which should help but doesn't help the core problems of manufacturing and wasting money on growth markets that will never pan out,"" added the analyst.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 65 hedge funds were long Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) at the end of June 2022, compared to 76 funds in the last quarter. David Blood and Al Gore’s Generation Investment Management held the largest stake in the company, comprising 14.7 million shares worth $552.5 million. Like Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is one of the favorite semiconductor picks of elite hedge funds. Here is what Baron Funds specifically said about Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Then, there is the case of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). A blue-chip tech champion with a market capitalization of over $500 billion in early 2000, the stock was trading at a P/E multiple of 42. It was a fast-growing company whose stock price and multiple declined more or less in line with its peers. However, unlike Google, Intel’s net income has grown from $7.3 billion in 1999 to $19.9 billion in 2021, a compounded annual growth rate of just 4.7%. Its growth from the dot com era has not proven to be durable, and Intel has yet to trade at the price it attained in 1999.”9. Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63Goldman Sachs’ Stake Value: $569,242,000Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) is a Delaware-based company that designs, develops, and sells analog, mixed-signal, digital signal processing, embedded, and standalone integrated circuits. In Q2 2022, Goldman Sachs owned more than 13 million shares of Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) worth $569.2 million, representing 0.12% of the total portfolio. On October 18, Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore maintained a Buy recommendation on Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) but lowered the price target on the shares to $55 from $65. Fears of fundamental deterioration are ""leading to very bearish investor positioning"" into the Q3 results for semiconductors, the analyst told investors in a research note. According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 63 hedge funds were long Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL), with combined stakes worth $1.6 billion, compared to 63 funds in the prior quarter worth $2.4 billion. Paul Marshall and Ian Wace’s Marshall Wace LLP is the biggest position holder in the company, with approximately 5 million shares worth $214 million. Here is what Carillon Tower Advisers specifically said about Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) provides infrastructure semiconductor solutions. Investors have recently become concerned about the semiconductor cycle and how demand for Marvell’s products will fare in a slowing economic environment. We remain confident that the company’s portfolio of products is extremely important in parts of the datacenter server market, which remains healthy and possesses long-term secular trends. The company also has secured strong contract wins in upcoming global 5G wireless infrastructure build-outs, which are generally insulated from macroeconomic pressures. With supply chain issues easing, we believe Marvell remains in a strong position to post continued robust growth.”8. QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71Goldman Sachs’ Stake Value: $663,132,000QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a California-based company focused on the development and commercialization of foundational technologies for the wireless industry worldwide. QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is one of the most prominent Goldman Sachs semiconductor stocks to invest in. The firm owned 5.19 million shares of QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) in Q2 2022, worth $663 million and representing 0.14% of the total portfolio. On October 14, QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.75 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is distributable on December 15, to shareholders of record on December 1. The dividend yield on November 8 came in at 2.67%. KeyBanc analyst John Vinh on November 3 reiterated an Overweight rating on QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) and lowered the firm's price target on the stock to $150 from $170. The analyst noted that QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) reported in-line Q4 results and ""shockingly bad"" Q1 guidance. According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 71 hedge funds were bullish on QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), compared to 73 funds in the last quarter. Alkeon Capital Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 4.2 million shares worth $541.15 million. In its Q4 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Market strength continued in the fourth quarter, with only the communication services sector down in the Russell 1000 Value Index. Portfolio returns benefited from the strong performance of semiconductor maker QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), which has executed exceptionally well in pursuing the transition to 5G, growing both content and share due to its leadership position in cellular technology. The chipmaker recently outlined a number of peripheral growth opportunities outside of mobile markets, including automotive (where it hopes to leverage its strong presence in the automotive infotainment space into advanced driver assistance systems), Internet of Things (including opportunities in the PC market, VR/AR market, and factory automation) and radio frequency (where mmWave adoption globally, including China, would drive substantial upside).”7. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Goldman Sachs’ Stake Value: $791,115,000Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is headquartered in San Jose, California, and the company designs, develops, and supplies digital and analog semiconductor devices and related products worldwide. In the second quarter of 2022, Goldman Sachs owned 1.6 million shares of Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) worth $791 million, representing 0.17% of the total securities. On October 18, Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore reiterated a Buy rating on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) but slashed the firm's price target on the shares to $575 from $635. The analyst expects the Q3 earnings season to ""yield more pervasive signs of weakness"" and for the second consecutive quarter, he sees downside risk to 2023 estimates. As for the semiconductor stocks, the analyst is becoming ""incrementally more constructive,"" noting the decline in the sector and relative underperformance versus the S&amp;P 500 ""have clearly priced in significant rev/EPS estimate cuts"" and left the group valuation 20% below its 5-year average.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 66 hedge funds were bullish on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 71 funds in the last quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management owned the leading stake in the company, with 1.5 million shares worth $716.3 million.Here is what Carillon Tower Advisers specifically said about Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Tech stocks, including Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), were one of the hardest-hit sectors due to fears over a weakening macroeconomic environment. Broadcom, however, outperformed semiconductor peers as its end-market exposures provided relatively more defensive characteristics.”6. KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43Goldman Sachs’ Stake Value: $835,425,000KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) is a California-based company that designs, manufactures, and markets process control, process-enabling, and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and electronics industries worldwide. In the second quarter of 2022, Goldman Sachs owned 2.6 million shares of KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) worth $835.4 million, representing 0.18% of the total holdings. On November 3, KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) declared a quarterly dividend of $1.30 per share, in line with previous.

The dividend yield on November 8 came in at 1.52%. Susquehanna analyst Mehdi Hosseini on October 27 raised the price target on KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) to $355 from $350 and reiterated a Positive rating on the shares. The analyst said he finds the more conservative 2023 WFE view as constructive, though he argues that the full extent of Logic/Foundry weakness is not yet completely factored in.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 43 hedge funds were long KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 52 funds in the last quarter. Brian Ashford-Russell and Tim Woolley’s Polar Capital is a significant position holder in the company, with 498,135 shares worth about $159 million. In addition to Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), Goldman Sachs is backing KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) in the semiconductor space. Here is what Vltava Fund has to say about KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“We then used the money freed up to, among other things, open three new positions. The stock price declines during the Russian invasion brought a lot of good prices to the market. Out of all the possibilities we considered, we picked the stock of KLA Corporation (KLAC).KLA Corporation develops leading-edge equipment and services that enable innovation throughout the electronics industry. It specialises in process management and control in semiconductor manufacturing and the related nanoelectronics industries. During manufacturing processes, products must be inspected for defects and correct critical dimensions in order to identify and eliminate possible sources of problems. As customers continue to enforce Moore’s Law, smaller chips must meet more precise specifications, which in turn increases the need for advanced inspection and diagnostic tools. This is a key step within the entire manufacturing process and one in which the company has built a very strong, and in places dominant, global position. We have been watching and waiting for an opportunity to acquire this stock for some time already, and this year’s drop in its price finally prompted us to buy.” Click to continue reading and see Goldman Sachs Semiconductor Stocks: Top 5 Picks.  Suggested articles:14 Largest Lithium Producers in the World12 Best Financial Dividend Stocks To Buy10 Stocks That Are On Sale Now Disclosure: None.

246,8f29dc68-4f4f-36d3-ab90-48a325523eb0,VZ,2022-11-09,Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-communications-inc-vz-trending-140002397.html,1667916002,STORY,['VZ'],"[Verizon Communications (VZ) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this largest U.S. cellphone carrier have returned +1.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.7% change. The Zacks Wireless National industry, to which Verizon belongs, has gained 9.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Verizon is expected to post earnings of $1.22 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -6.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.2%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.19 points to a change of -3.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.1%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.13 indicates a change of -1.2% from what Verizon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.2%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Verizon.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VZ _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Verizon, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $35.26 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +3.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $136.8 billion and $138.96 billion estimates indicate +2.4% and +1.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVerizon reported revenues of $34.24 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4%. EPS of $1.32 for the same period compares with $1.41 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $33.78 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.36%. The EPS surprise was +3.13%.Over the last four quarters, Verizon surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Verizon is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Verizon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

TPR is likely to register an increase in the top line when it reports first-quarter fiscal 2023 numbers on Nov 10 before market open. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1,509 million, suggesting an improvement of 1.9% from the prior-year reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues from Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman brands is pegged at $1,131 million, $308 million and $70 million, indicating an increase of 1.4%, 2.8% and 5.3%, respectively.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings per share has declined by a penny to 74 cents over the past seven days. The consensus mark indicates a decline of 9.8% from the year-ago period. Tapestry has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 14.5%, on average.Factors to NoteA consumer-centric approach, omnichannel capabilities, brand awareness and an emphasis on high-growth areas are likely to have benefited Tapestry’s first-quarter performance.Its Acceleration Program has been a major contributing factor as well. The program is aimed at transforming the company into a leaner and more responsive organization with a clearly defined path and strategy for each brand. We also believe that continued strength in North America and Europe, with steady growth in the rest of Asia, might have offset the pandemic-related disruption in China.On its last earnings call, Tapestry guided mid-single-digit growth in revenues on a constant-currency basis, which included a decline of approximately 15% projected in Greater China. On a reported basis, it expects global sales to increase slightly, including a negative impact of approximately 350 basis points from FX.Also, we cannot ignore the impact of ongoing supply-chain issues and increasing freight costs. Meanwhile, any deleverage in SG&amp;A expenses might get reflected in margins.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Goldman Sachs Semiconductor Stocks: Top 5 Picks. As per Washington-based Semiconductor Industry Association, global semiconductor sales dropped 3% in September compared to last year, and Korean chipmakers produced 3.5% less than a year earlier in September. The Korean economy, which is highly dependent on the semiconductor industry, experienced low demand given weakening currencies, high trade deficits, and tightening interest rates around the world. Meanwhile, the Biden administration is trying to boost investments in US chipmaking, in order to compete with China and to manufacture components essential for national security. The US effort increased after the semiconductor industry faced massive shortages in late 2020 and 2021, which revealed how essential chips were in the digital economy, for the production of everything from cars to smartphones. The most recent effort to help establish the US semiconductor industry is the CHIPS Act, which lent $39 billion in government funding for the local semiconductor manufacturing plants, in addition to billions of dollars for research and development initiatives.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is planning to construct a second US plant next to a $12 billion complex it is already building, which will advance American efforts to support local chipmaking. To benefit from the ongoing semiconductor initiatives amid lower competition from Korean and Chinese manufacturers, some of the best semiconductor stocks to consider according to investment firm Goldman Sachs are Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM). Our Methodology We selected the top 10 semiconductor stocks from the Goldman Sachs portfolio as of the end of the second quarter of 2022 for this analysis. Insider Monkey’s database of 895 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2022 was used to assess the hedge fund sentiment around the securities. Story continuesGoldman Sachs Semiconductor Stocks: Top 10 PicksPhoto by Redd on UnsplashGoldman Sachs Semiconductor Stocks: Top Picks10. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65Goldman Sachs’ Stake Value: $535,779,000Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is a California-based multinational technology corporation that operates in the semiconductors, computer hardware, autonomous cars, automation, and artificial intelligence sectors. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is one of the elite Goldman Sachs semiconductor stocks to monitor, with the firm holding 14.3 million shares worth nearly $536 million, representing 0.12% of the total securities. On October 31, Citi analyst Christopher Danely maintained a Neutral rating on Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) but lowered the price target on the shares to $27 from $30. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) posted mixed results and guided well below consensus due to the PC downturn, the analyst told investors. The company also disclosed a cost control plan, ""which should help but doesn't help the core problems of manufacturing and wasting money on growth markets that will never pan out,"" added the analyst.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 65 hedge funds were long Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) at the end of June 2022, compared to 76 funds in the last quarter. David Blood and Al Gore’s Generation Investment Management held the largest stake in the company, comprising 14.7 million shares worth $552.5 million. Like Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is one of the favorite semiconductor picks of elite hedge funds. Here is what Baron Funds specifically said about Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Then, there is the case of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). A blue-chip tech champion with a market capitalization of over $500 billion in early 2000, the stock was trading at a P/E multiple of 42. It was a fast-growing company whose stock price and multiple declined more or less in line with its peers. However, unlike Google, Intel’s net income has grown from $7.3 billion in 1999 to $19.9 billion in 2021, a compounded annual growth rate of just 4.7%. Its growth from the dot com era has not proven to be durable, and Intel has yet to trade at the price it attained in 1999.”9. Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63Goldman Sachs’ Stake Value: $569,242,000Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) is a Delaware-based company that designs, develops, and sells analog, mixed-signal, digital signal processing, embedded, and standalone integrated circuits. In Q2 2022, Goldman Sachs owned more than 13 million shares of Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) worth $569.2 million, representing 0.12% of the total portfolio. On October 18, Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore maintained a Buy recommendation on Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) but lowered the price target on the shares to $55 from $65. Fears of fundamental deterioration are ""leading to very bearish investor positioning"" into the Q3 results for semiconductors, the analyst told investors in a research note. According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 63 hedge funds were long Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL), with combined stakes worth $1.6 billion, compared to 63 funds in the prior quarter worth $2.4 billion. Paul Marshall and Ian Wace’s Marshall Wace LLP is the biggest position holder in the company, with approximately 5 million shares worth $214 million. Here is what Carillon Tower Advisers specifically said about Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) provides infrastructure semiconductor solutions. Investors have recently become concerned about the semiconductor cycle and how demand for Marvell’s products will fare in a slowing economic environment. We remain confident that the company’s portfolio of products is extremely important in parts of the datacenter server market, which remains healthy and possesses long-term secular trends. The company also has secured strong contract wins in upcoming global 5G wireless infrastructure build-outs, which are generally insulated from macroeconomic pressures. With supply chain issues easing, we believe Marvell remains in a strong position to post continued robust growth.”8. QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71Goldman Sachs’ Stake Value: $663,132,000QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a California-based company focused on the development and commercialization of foundational technologies for the wireless industry worldwide. QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is one of the most prominent Goldman Sachs semiconductor stocks to invest in.

The dividend is distributable on December 15, to shareholders of record on December 1.

The analyst noted that QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) reported in-line Q4 results and ""shockingly bad"" Q1 guidance. According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 71 hedge funds were bullish on QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), compared to 73 funds in the last quarter. Alkeon Capital Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 4.2 million shares worth $541.15 million. In its Q4 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Market strength continued in the fourth quarter, with only the communication services sector down in the Russell 1000 Value Index. Portfolio returns benefited from the strong performance of semiconductor maker QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), which has executed exceptionally well in pursuing the transition to 5G, growing both content and share due to its leadership position in cellular technology. The chipmaker recently outlined a number of peripheral growth opportunities outside of mobile markets, including automotive (where it hopes to leverage its strong presence in the automotive infotainment space into advanced driver assistance systems), Internet of Things (including opportunities in the PC market, VR/AR market, and factory automation) and radio frequency (where mmWave adoption globally, including China, would drive substantial upside).”7. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Goldman Sachs’ Stake Value: $791,115,000Broadcom Inc.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) but slashed the firm's price target on the shares to $575 from $635. The analyst expects the Q3 earnings season to ""yield more pervasive signs of weakness"" and for the second consecutive quarter, he sees downside risk to 2023 estimates. As for the semiconductor stocks, the analyst is becoming ""incrementally more constructive,"" noting the decline in the sector and relative underperformance versus the S&amp;P 500 ""have clearly priced in significant rev/EPS estimate cuts"" and left the group valuation 20% below its 5-year average.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 66 hedge funds were bullish on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 71 funds in the last quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management owned the leading stake in the company, with 1.5 million shares worth $716.3 million.Here is what Carillon Tower Advisers specifically said about Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Tech stocks, including Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), were one of the hardest-hit sectors due to fears over a weakening macroeconomic environment. Broadcom, however, outperformed semiconductor peers as its end-market exposures provided relatively more defensive characteristics.”6. KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43Goldman Sachs’ Stake Value: $835,425,000KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) is a California-based company that designs, manufactures, and markets process control, process-enabling, and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and electronics industries worldwide.

Brian Ashford-Russell and Tim Woolley’s Polar Capital is a significant position holder in the company, with 498,135 shares worth about $159 million. In addition to Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), Goldman Sachs is backing KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) in the semiconductor space. Here is what Vltava Fund has to say about KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“We then used the money freed up to, among other things, open three new positions.

It specialises in process management and control in semiconductor manufacturing and the related nanoelectronics industries. During manufacturing processes, products must be inspected for defects and correct critical dimensions in order to identify and eliminate possible sources of problems. As customers continue to enforce Moore’s Law, smaller chips must meet more precise specifications, which in turn increases the need for advanced inspection and diagnostic tools. This is a key step within the entire manufacturing process and one in which the company has built a very strong, and in places dominant, global position. We have been watching and waiting for an opportunity to acquire this stock for some time already, and this year’s drop in its price finally prompted us to buy.” Click to continue reading and see Goldman Sachs Semiconductor Stocks: Top 5 Picks.  Suggested articles:14 Largest Lithium Producers in the World12 Best Financial Dividend Stocks To Buy10 Stocks That Are On Sale Now Disclosure: None.

Nvidia's new lineup features similar specs with less bandwidth. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley. He has the details here. Dan, we're talking about A100 versus A800. At the end of the day, these are not the advanced chips that Nvidia used to ship over to China, correct?DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, these are different than the AA100. The A800 does have similar performance rates, that speed, that bandwidth that you discussed, that's slower. And when you're talking about trying to train these massive AI models that these kinds of chips are designed for, that can be a real detriment. And the idea here is for the US to limit the ability for China to catch up when it comes to AI in its military. And so that's why these restrictions were put in place.Now the A100 was going to be a potential big money option for NVIDIA, though they said they had to cut $400 million out of potential China sales. Because of that, they did move to this A800, and some Chinese companies are preparing to offer it, though. And this also comes, though, as we saw Nvidia really struggle in Q2. It missed on earnings expectations. Its net income fell 72% year over year.And that has to do with its gaming segment, which dropped 33% year over year and 44% quarter over quarter from Q2. The company also had guided for lower than expected. It was expected to bring in $6.9 billion in the next quarter, Q3. They said that they were going to bring in $5.9 billion, though. So really a tough comparison for NVIDIA, especially since we're rounding the holiday season where COVID was still a big issue as far as gaming, and it was pushing gaming higher.They still make a huge amount of money off gaming and the data center, obviously. So it's kind of a one-two punch. The gaming industry isn't doing particularly well. And then you have this issue with China that Nvidia is dealing with. So it's not as good for them as it could be.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, certainly not an issue unique to Nvidia, but interesting to see how they're dealing with that. Dan Howley, thanks so much for that.]"

HRB, ParkerHannifin Corp. PH, Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. ADM, Insperity Inc. NSP and McKesson Corp. MCK.Top 5 Dividend Stocks to Cheer You Up This Holiday SeasonDividend investing remains a popular strategy for investors even in the face of rising yields. The Fed has raised interest rates by 75 bps for the fourth consecutive time. This is the sixth rate hike this year and has pushed the yields to elevated levels.Although dividend does not offer dramatic price appreciation, the strategy is a major source of consistent income for investors to create wealth when returns from the equity market are at risk. Currently, the stock market is struggling with low economic growth, slowing payroll growth and four-decade-high inflation.Stocks with a strong history of dividend growth year over year form a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those that have high yields. We have selected five dividend growth stocks — H&amp;R Block Inc., ParkerHannifin Corp., Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., Insperity Inc. and McKesson Corp. — that could be compelling picks for your portfolio ahead of the holiday season.Why Dividend Growth?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future.Story continuesMoreover, a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields. Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.Here are five of the 21 stocks that fit the bill:Missouri-based H&amp;R Block is a leading provider of tax preparation services.

261,b9431c0d-793e-3394-9fd3-8d5b6affccce,MCK,2022-11-09,3 Reasons Growth Investors Will Love McKesson (MCK),Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reasons-growth-investors-love-174505479.html,1667929505,STORY,['MCK'],"[Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Our proprietary system currently recommends McKesson (MCK) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this prescription drug distributor is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for McKesson is 16.3%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 4.5% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 0.5%.Impressive Asset Utilization RatioGrowth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.Story continuesRight now, McKesson has an S/TA ratio of 4.31, which means that the company gets $4.31 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.79, it can be said that the company is more efficient.While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And McKesson looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well. The company's sales are expected to grow 4.3% this year versus the industry average of 0%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for McKesson. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1.6% over the past month.Bottom LineWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made McKesson a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that McKesson is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The facility, already being executed, will make Edmonton, Alberta the centre of western Canada's hydrogen economy and set the stage for Air Products to operate one of the most competitive and lowest-carbon-intensity hydrogen networks in the world.At the event held at the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology, Air Products' Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Seifi Ghasemi, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry Canada the Honourable François-Philippe Champagne, Alberta Minister of Energy the Honourable Peter Guthrie, and several other esteemed federal, provincial and City of Edmonton officials gathered to make the joint announcement.Under separate agreements, Air Products will receive:$300 million (CAD) from the Strategic Innovation Fund (SIF), the Government of Canada's program designed to spur innovation for a better Canada by providing funding for large projects and national innovation ecosystems. Air Products' project funding specifically comes from the Net-Zero Accelerator Program targeting industrial decarbonization in support of Canada's 2030 greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets and its 2050 net zero emissions goal, among other objectives.Over $160 million (CAD) from the Alberta Petrochemicals Incentive Program (APIP), part of Alberta's Recovery Plan to bring multi-billion dollar investments to industrial projects throughout Alberta, add value to natural gas production in the province, and help to strengthen, diversify and bring new life into the province's economy and create new opportunities and jobs for Albertans.$15 million (CAD), which was previously announced, from Emissions Reduction Alberta's Shovel-Ready Challenge, which aims to help deliver on the province's environmental and economic goals by investing in clean technology that cuts greenhouse gases, attracts investment and creates jobs in Alberta.Story continues""From the beginning, Air Products has truly and sincerely appreciated the partnership of the Government of Canada and the Government of Alberta, as well as the continued support of the City of Edmonton, in welcoming this visionary clean energy complex to Alberta. We are pleased to recognize the successful completion of support agreements that have allowed us to make additional engineering enhancements to reach an even cleaner world-class design. This facility will be a first mover in helping to decarbonize mobility and industrial markets, further demonstrated by an already announced and substantial off-take supply contract. Today's announcement represents visionary leadership and a commitment to move humanity forward in the energy transition. It shows what is possible when effective collaboration and governmental support align to drive the energy transition,"" said Ghasemi.The Honourable François-Philippe Champagne, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry said, ""We need to be bold and seize the moment, and that's exactly why we're investing in Air Products. We are prioritizing a strong and sustainable economy, helping create well-paying jobs, and ensuring a cleaner future. Hydrogen is one of the key elements for our path to net zero, and that's why we're making these important investments in Canada's energy sector. We're also ready to build on this ambition by supporting and working with high-emitting sectors in decarbonizing, creating more jobs across the country and growing for generations to come.""The Honourable Danielle Smith, Premier of Alberta said, ""Alberta is Canada's hydrogen powerhouse and projects like this will create jobs, diversify the economy, and build additional clean energy capacity for use across Western Canada. With such a huge attachment in the hydrogen market, our government's Alberta Petrochemicals Incentive Program is making us the most attractive jurisdiction for companies looking to invest in hydrogen. Alberta's economy will continue to charge ahead full steam with an investment climate that encourages businesses to grow and fuel job growth.""The Honourable Johnathan Wilkinson, Minister of Natural Resources said, ""Unlocking the potential of hydrogen is an essential part of the federal government's plan for a sustainable economic future – not just for the domestic opportunities for emissions reductions but also for its potential as an export opportunity: to provide clean energy to countries around the globe.""The Honourable Randy Boissonnault, Minister of Tourism and Associate Minister of Finance // Member of Parliament for Edmonton Centre said, ""Today's announcement is an historic investment in the net-zero economy of the future, and in the Edmonton region. This investment will further position our city as a leading hydrogen production hub for Canada and North America and is part of our government's plan to ensure prosperity for generations to come. This investment is more proof that we are building an economy that works for everyone.""The Honourable Pete Guthrie, Minister of Energy, Government of Alberta said, ""Alberta's hydrogen sector is growing rapidly, with more and more hydrogen-powered projects coming online over the coming years. With more than $161 million in funding for Air Products' clean hydrogen facility, we are creating jobs, growing the energy sector and bringing clean hydrogen to customers across Western Canada.""Edmonton Mayor Amarjeet Sohi said, ""Today's announcement brings Edmonton one step closer on the energy transition journey towards becoming a carbon-neutral city. Investing in an Edmonton-based clean hydrogen facility will help with our city's post-pandemic economic recovery efforts and will allow Canada to advance clean energy in the global hydrogen market. I am appreciative that both our federal and provincial government partners and Air Products are prioritizing Edmonton's climate and hydrogen goals, and I look forward to future collaborations that will advance this work.""Today's announcement marks the milestone of the successful completion of Memorandum of Understanding agreements referenced in June 2021 when Air Products, the world leader in hydrogen production, and its subsidiary Air Products Canada Ltd., in conjunction with the Government of Canada and the Province of Alberta, initially announced the multi-billion-dollar plan to build the landmark net-zero hydrogen energy complex.Canada's clean energy diversification strategy and regulatory framework make clear that hydrogen is a key enabler for carbon neutrality by 2050. Aligned with that vision, Air Products began development in 2018 on the core of this world-scale energy complex in Edmonton, which will begin with a transformative net-zero hydrogen production and liquefaction facility.Since the initial facility announcement, Air Products has proceeded with engineering, procurement, and construction preparatory site work, as well as marketing the clean hydrogen to be produced. In September 2022, Air Products announced a customer agreement for approximately 50 percent of the low-carbon hydrogen output from the 165 million standard cubic feet per day hydrogen production complex. This off-take agreement also saw Air Products increase its facility investment from $1.3 billion (CAD) to $1.6 billion (CAD), as well as including beneficial engineering enhancements to the production process, further substantially reducing greenhouse gases at the net-zero facility.The Alberta project relies on an innovative combination of well-established technologies to jump-start an ambitious transition to carbon neutrality and is consistent with Air Products' growth strategy of executing global megaprojects that enable a transition to a cleaner, more sustainable energy future. It will take advantage of Canada's abundant and low-cost natural resources, extensive infrastructure, highly skilled workforce, and innovative spirit to be a model for other jurisdictions around the globe.""This new complex is just the beginning for this site. The showcase facility will have it all – a world scale auto-thermal reformer, carbon capture operations achieving 95 percent removal, a power generation facility fueled 100 percent by hydrogen, a 35 tonnes-per-day hydrogen liquefaction facility, a world-scale air separation facility producing clean liquid oxygen and nitrogen, and connection to Air Products' existing Alberta Heartland Hydrogen Pipeline network for enhanced customer reliability, and phased decarbonization of the entire network. This will truly be a state-of-the-art facility,"" said Dr. Samir J. Serhan, Chief Operating Officer at Air Products.Serhan added that as Canada's leading hydrogen supplier, Air Products is also considering further investments in both existing and new hydrogen facilities in Alberta and across Canada, helping customers improve their sustainability performance while bolstering the hydrogen economy and Canada's energy transition.The hydrogen liquefaction facility will play a critical role in the developing hydrogen economy across Western Canada. Hydrogen will help to meet society's need for sustainable transportation, especially for heavy duty vehicles where hydrogen excels compared to other technologies. Hydrogen is seen as having a substantial technological advantage over battery electric vehicles in heavy-duty applications due to those vehicles' duty-cycles, especially in Canada's extreme climate conditions.Hydrogen Experience in Canada and BeyondAs the world's largest hydrogen producer, Air Products has experience across the full value chain for hydrogen and is driving sustainable growth by building, owning, and operating the world's largest production, gasification, carbon capture, transportation and fueling projects. With over 60 years of global hydrogen experience operating in over 50 countries, Air Products has the proven capability and know-how to make hydrogen through all available production methods and to distribute this increasingly important emission-free fuel safely, reliably, and economically.Air Products Canada currently operates three hydrogen production facilities in Alberta, and a 55-kilometer hydrogen pipeline in the Alberta Industrial Heartland. The company also operates a hydrogen production facility, a 30-kilometer pipeline network and a liquefaction facility in Sarnia, Ontario. The company's excellent safety record includes operating over 1,100-kilometers of hydrogen pipelines worldwide with no incidents.For more detailed background information about the project: www.airproducts.com/bluebutbetter.Media EventThe Government of Canada and Air Products will host a livestream event at 10:30 a.m. MDT/12:30 p.m. USET on November 8, 2022.

265,bd7b04b9-b13c-3ab6-b3db-31a906a8c8a8,FOX,2022-11-09,EnLink Midstream and Ball Corporation have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/enlink-midstream-ball-corporation-highlighted-153703928.html,1667921823,STORY,"['BALL', 'FOXA', 'DKNG', 'VZIO', 'ENLC']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – November 8, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares EnLink Midstream ENLC as the Bull of the Day and Ball Corporation BALL as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Fox Corporation FOXA, VIZIO VZIO and DraftKings DKNG.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:EnLink Midstream, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, has benefitted immensely from the commodity price surge this year. After falling under $1/share during the initial onset of the coronavirus pandemic, the stock has surged over 1,500% since March 2020 and continues to make a series of higher highs. Only stocks that are garnering extreme buying pressure are able to make this type of price move, going from penny stock to double digits in just a two-year time span. ENLC is currently trading near new highs on the year, even as the market continues to hover in a correction.ENLC boasts our highest-possible ‘A’ ratings for each of our Zacks Growth and Momentum Style Score categories, indicating a strong likelihood that the stock propels higher on the powerful combination of positive earnings estimate revisions and stock price performance. The company is a component of the Zacks Oil &amp; Gas – Refining &amp; Marketing industry, which ranks in the top 2% of all Zacks Ranked Industries. The group is up more than 43% this year while the S&amp;P is down more than 20%.Quantitative research studies have repeatedly shown that roughly half of a stock’s future price appreciation is due to its industry grouping. Because this group is ranked in the top half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect it to outperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months. By targeting stocks contained within top industry groups, investors can dramatically improve their rate of success.Company DescriptionEnLink Midstream, LLC provides midstream energy services domestically. The company is engaged in the gathering, processing, transporting, storing, and selling of natural gas and crude oil. Its midstream network includes over 12,000 miles of pipelines and more than 20 natural gas processing plants.Story continuesENLC is also involved in carbon capture, in an effort to obtain real progress in terms of the decarbonization of the global economy. Just last month, the company announced that it entered a transportation service agreement with a subsidiary of ExxonMobil, where it will utilize portions of its existing pipeline network as well as new facilities to deliver carbon dioxide from the Mississippi River corridor to ExxonMobil’s carbon dioxide storage location.Earnings Trends and Future EstimatesENLC has exceeded earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters, sporting an average 92.58% beat over that timeframe. Last week, the oil and gas company reported third-quarter earnings of $0.18 cents per share, which translated to a 63.64% positive surprise versus the $0.11/share consensus estimate.Looking ahead, earnings estimates for the current quarter as well as 2023 have been skyrocketing. Analysts are in agreement and in the past 30 days, Q4 EPS estimates have been increased by 25% to $0.15 per share. This reflects a 36.4% growth rate relative to the same quarter last year. It’s obvious the growth is there and looks set to continue.Charting the CourseENLC has continued its winning ways over the past few months while the market has been in correction mode. This is the kind of stock we want to include in our portfolio – one that is trending well and experiencing positive earnings estimate revisions. The stock has soared more than 80% this year and continues to make a series of higher highs. Only stocks that are in extremely powerful uptrends are able to weather bear markets so gracefully.Notice how the 50 and 200-day moving averages as evidenced by the blue and red lines, respectively, are both sloping up. The stock is displaying relative strength versus the market – a bullish sign.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. And as we know, EnLink Midstream has seen a steady batch of positive revisions as of late. As long as this trend remains intact (and ENLC continues to post earnings beats), the stock should continue its bullish run through the end of this year and beyond.Bottom LineWith a history of surpassing earnings estimates and an improving future outlook, EnLink Midstream represents a great opportunity. With a $0.45 (3.81%) dividend yield, it’s not difficult to see why this stock is a compelling investment.Solid institutional buying and a high-performing industry group should continue to provide a tailwind for the stock price. Recent positive earnings estimate revisions will help to provide a cushion during any further market decline. If you’re looking for a way to diversify your portfolio, make sure to put ENLC on your shortlist.Bear of the Day:Ball Corporation supplies aluminum packaging products for the beverage, personal care, and household industries globally. The company manufactures and sells aluminum containers of carbonated soft drinks, beer, energy drinks, and related beverages. BALL also develops sensors and instruments, radio frequency systems, and other technologies for the civil and national security aerospace markets to governmental and commercial customers. Ball Corp. was founded in 1880 and is based in Westminster, CO.The Zacks RundownBALL is part of the Zacks Containers – Metal and Glass industry group, which currently ranks in the bottom 1% out of approximately 250 industry groups. Because this industry is ranked in the bottom half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect it to underperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months. This industry has widely underperformed the market this year with a -34% return year-to-date.Candidates in the bottom tiers of industry groups can often represent solid potential short candidates. While individual stocks have the ability to outperform even when included in poor-performing industries, their industry association serves as a headwind for any potential rallies. BALL is fighting an uphill battle and the stock is confirming this notion as it continues to make a series of lower lows.Despite this year’s price decline, BALL is still overvalued relative to its industry group, irrespective of the metric used.Weak Foundation: Falling Short on Earnings and Deteriorating ForecastsEarnings misses have been a sore spot for BALL during the past year. The packaging company has fallen short of estimates in three of the past four quarters. BALL most recently reported Q3 EPS last week of $0.75, missing the $0.76 consensus estimate by -1.32%.BALL has posted an average earnings miss of -2.42% over the past four quarters. This is the type of negative trend that the bears like to see. Consistently missing earnings estimates is a recipe for stock price underperformance, and BALL is no exception.Analysts have been revising earnings estimates downward as of late. For the current quarter, estimates have been slashed -11.49% over the past 60 days. The Q4 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate now stands at $0.77, translating to a -20.62% earnings regression relative to the same quarter last year.Technical OutlookBALL stock has been steadily falling since last year and has now established a well-defined downtrend. Notice how both the 50-day (blue line) and 200-day (red line) moving averages are sloping down. Shares have declined more than 45% this year. The stock continues to trade below both averages, while the 50-day moving average has acted as steady resistance throughout the down move.BALL has continued to make a series of lower lows during the fourth quarter, even as many stocks have shown strength.Final ThoughtsThe recent earnings misses in addition to deteriorating estimates are both huge red flags and need to be respected. These will likely serve as a ceiling to any potential rallies, nurturing the stock’s downtrend.BALL’s characteristics have resulted in a worst-possible Zacks Growth Style Score of ‘F,’ indicating further downside is likely. The fact that BALL is included in a bottom-performing industry group simply adds to the growing list of concerns. Investors will want to steer clear of BALL until the situation shows major signs of improvement, or possibly include it as part of a hedge or short strategy.Additional content:Fox to Buy a Stake in FanDuelFox Corporation has recently received a green flag towards buying a stake in FanDuel, one of the biggest brands in U.S. online gambling.Fox had been facing a dispute with Flutter, the parent organization of FanDuel, over this deal over the past year, as the latter was demanding too high a price for an option to buy an 18.6% stake in FanDuel.However, recently, an arbitrator has ruled that Fox has the option to buy a stake in sports-betting operator FanDuel Group from parent company Flutter for about $3.7 billion.This comes as a strong tailwind for Fox as the deal would aid the performance of Fox Bet, the online sports betting brand of Fox, which has been struggling as it failed to gain traction in the U.S. betting market due to its poor reach and tech.The deal would help Fox in successfully diversifying itself into the booming wagering business which per Custom Markets Insight is expected to reach around USD 145.6 Billion by 2030 at a CAGR of 12%.Fox to Bolster Growth with Other M&amp;A’s and PartnershipsFox Corp recently announced its merger with News Corp. This merger would bring back high-profile business divisions under one roof after a split in 2013. Fox’s Fox News, Fox broadcast network, local TV stations and the Tubi streaming service would be combined with News Corp’s Dow Jones, The Wall Street Journal, as well as other assets, including HarperCollins Publishers and news organizations in the United Kingdom and Australia.This would diversify and broaden the portfolio of Fox Corporation, hence gaining traction with more customers and adding new sources of revenue.Fox Corporation price-consensus-chart | Fox Corporation QuoteFox has also entered a multi-year deal with VIZIO to expand its distribution partnership. The Fox Sports app will now be available on VIZIO smart TVs along with the Fox Weather channel being added to VIZIO WatchFree+ besides existing Fox ad-supported LiveNOW and Fox Soul. VIZIO Ads will also have access to Fox’s premium inventory for audience-based opportunities with advertisers.In August, Fox announced the completion of a multi-year renewal of its distribution agreement with Verizon for its Fios TV platform.The agreement included the continued distribution of the entire portfolio of FOX brands, including FOX News Media, FOX Sports, FOX Network and local FOX O&amp;O TV stations in markets including New York, Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia. FOX Weather has also been added to the Fios TV lineup and Tubi is included in both Fios TV set-top boxes, as well as on many other platforms.Threats Attached to the DealsThese mergers and acquisitions and partnerships are expected to bolster Fox’s top line, but they also bring certain headwinds for the company. The wagering business, into which Fox is expanding, is highly competitive with companies like DraftKings having already established a secure market position in the sports betting industry.DraftKings is focusing on its iGaming products as it launched a sportsbook in Kansas at the start of this month. Its Same Game Parlay, which allows multiple betting outcomes from the same game into one parlay bet and feature enhancements like the Web3 strategy, has gained significant anticipation among players.The merger with News Corporation also brings some risks for Fox. Readers’ preference for accessing news online, mostly free, has made News Corporation’s print-advertising model increasingly redundant. Besides, a major portion of News Corporation’s total revenues is generated outside the United States. The ongoing foreign exchange fluctuation or the U.S. dollar gaining strength may hurt both the top and bottom lines of the company.This has not boded well among the investors. The shares of Fox Corporation, which currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), have declined 19.1% year to date compared to Zacks Consumer Discretionary Sector, which fell 38.4%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

Riley Financial.A surprise victory for Democrats could raise concerns about tech-sector regulation as well as budget spending that could add to red-hot inflation, according to market strategists.Investors have increasingly priced in a Republican win this quarter as stocks including energy and defense - expected to perform well under a Republican sweep - have outperformed clean energy shares that typically benefit under a Democratic leadership.The S&amp;P 500 has posted a gain in every 12-month period after the midterm vote since World War Two, according to Deutsche Bank.At 8:02 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 78 points, or 0.24%, S&amp;P 500 e-minis were down 2.75 points, or 0.07%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 1.5 points, or 0.01%.Story continuesMeanwhile, some market participants expect October U.S. inflation data due on Thursday to be more market-moving.Holger Schmieding, an economist at Berenberg, does not expect election results to have any impact on U.S. fiscal or monetary policies and believes the Federal Reserve's actions to curb inflation will continue to dictate markets.Among individual stocks, Meta Platforms Inc climbed 5.8% in premarket trading as the Facebook-parent said it would let go of 13% of its workforce, or more than 11,000 employees, in one of the biggest tech layoffs this year.Tesla Inc rose 1.5% after filings showed Chief Executive Elon Musk has sold $3.95 billion worth of shares in the electric-vehicle maker days after he closed the $44-billion Twitter deal.Kroger Co gained 2.4% after the U.S. federal court denied requests to temporarily block Albertsons Companies Inc's $4 billion dividend payment to shareholders.Separately, Evercore upgraded the grocer's stock to ""outperform"" from ""in line"".Walt Disney Co slumped 7.4% the entertainment giant racked up more losses from its push into streaming video.News Corp dropped 9.6% after the media conglomerate reported downbeat first-quarter revenue and profit.(Reporting by Medha Singh, Bansari Mayur Kamdar and Amruta Khandekar in Bengaluru; Editing by Savio D'Souza and Arun Koyyur)]"

Little.Finance chief Christine McCarthy, in a call with analysts on Tuesday, said the ad tier was not expected to meaningfully impact results until later in the financial year.Subscriber growth in Disney+ was expected to accelerate in the second quarter, she added, a sign analysts said indicated a soft first quarter.""As the platform aims for profitability, it's placing some of that burden on its user base in the form of price hikes that could stall growth during a time of economic pinch,"" said Mike Proulx, research director at Forrester.A weaker-than-expected annual revenue growth forecast also dragged shares. Disney estimated a ""high single-digit"" percentage growth, while the Street was expecting 12%.At least 13 brokerages cut their price targets on Disney stock.McCarthy said streaming operating results would improve by at least $200 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, compared with the latest reported quarter.""We expect that the 'achieving profitability' breakthrough will likely occur in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024,"" Morningstar analyst Neil Macker said.Shares have fallen more than 35% this year, compared with a 20% drop in the S&amp;P 500, battered by a cautious outlook for ad sales and recessionary fears.(Reporting by Eva Mathews and Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila, Devika Syamnath and Krishna Chandra Eluri)]"

If you want to explore more nuclear ETFs that you can add to your portfolio, you can also take a look at 5 Best Nuclear ETFs to Buy Now.Nuclear energy has been the center of bad press for a long time now. Whenever the word nuclear comes to mind, most people recall the Chernobyl and Fukushima Daiichi incidents. These two disasters have had a negative impact on the world and turned it more cautious toward generating energy from nuclear power. However, the benefits of nuclear power over fossil fuels cannot be overlooked. One of the biggest benefits of nuclear energy over matter-dense energy sources, such as fossil fuels, is its lack of carbon emissions. According to the Nuclear Energy Institute, energy generated from nuclear power in the U.S. reduces over 470 million metric tons of carbon emissions every year.The U.S. draws roughly 50% of its carbon-free energy from nuclear sources. In efforts to battle climate change, on April 19, the Biden administration poured $6 billion into the nuclear energy industry to extend the life of nuclear plants in the U.S. that were at risk of shutting down.The Energy Crisis in Europe: Nuclear Energy to the RescueThe Russian-Ukraine conflict has sent prices to all-time highs around the globe. No other region is experiencing the repercussions of the war more than Europe. On August 31, Russia completely cut off gas supplies to Europe, claiming that the Nord Stream 1 pipelines need to go through routine repairs. Russia previously shut down the Nord Stream 1 pipeline in July. Inflation in Europe attained a record high of 9.1% in August, with the energy index contributing the most. The energy index was the highest contributor and recorded a reading of 38.3% in August, down from 30.6% in July, but still alarmingly high.High energy prices and hurdles in getting gas from Russia have spiked interest in European governments to consider nuclear energy as a solution. On March 17, the Czech Republic announced an investment of EUR 6 billion to fund the building of a new nuclear reactor at the Dukovany nuclear plant. On September 1, Britain's outgoing Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that the UK will invest roughly $800 million to fund a new nuclear power plant to ensure the nation's national and energy security.Story continuesThe energy crisis in Europe has triggered hefty investments in nuclear energy infrastructure. As economies around the globe push further to achieve carbon neutrality, the nuclear energy industry is expected to experience significant growth. Some of the best nuclear energy stocks that investors and analysts have turned bullish on include Denison Mines Corp. (NYSE:DNN), NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), and Cameco Corporation (NYSE:CCJ).Best Nuclear ETFs to Buy Nowdan-meyers-F_DSvG5Fb0A-unsplashOur MethodologyFor risk-averse investors that are seeking exposure to the lucrative nuclear energy market, we have compiled a list of the best nuclear ETFs to buy now.

However, the market is not giving the company credit for the material improvements CEO Larry Culp has made in his tenure. The balance sheet today is stronger than it has been in a very long time, and each of the three primary business segments each have strong paths to increasing earnings, regardless of the economic environment. Healthcare has historically not been a cyclical business. While Aviation typically has some economic sensitivity, the business still has a strong COVID rebound tailwind that should continue even in an uncertain environment. Power is a less cyclical business, and GE maintains a steady business servicing approximately one-third of the world’s electricity. GE is another example of strong insider buying indicating management’s confidence in the business, while the company also began buying back discounted shares. GE is still on track to break the company into three separate businesses, and we believe this will help the market properly weigh the value of each core segment.”In addition to investing in ETFs, investors can look to nuclear stocks such as Denison Mines Corp.

If you want to see more of the best consumer discretionary stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Buy.Consumer discretionary companies are companies that sell non-essential products and services such as entertainment or premium priced products.Given consumers don't have to buy consumer discretionary products or services, many consumer discretionary companies do well when the economy is strong and they don't do as well when the economy is weak. During times when the economy is strong, consumers generally have more money to spend and many consumers spend more on premium items or services they don't necessarily need. When the economy isn't strong, many consumers will spend less on discretionary items.2022Given high inflation in 2022, the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates six times this year alone and many analysts expect the central bank to raise rates further.As a result of the rate increases, the odds of a recession in the United States have increased. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said in October, ""There's a reasonable chance of a recession in the U.S., but it's not certain."" Meanwhile ratings agency Fitch said, ""Fitch expects the U.S. economy to enter genuine recession territory — albeit relatively mild by historical standards — in 2Q23.""As a result of the uncertainty, many consumer discretionary stocks have declined this year as investors anticipate potentially softer demand if a recession occurs next year. With the decline, many leading consumer discretionary stocks trade for fairly attractive valuations if the economy recovers and inflation normalizes in the long term.In the near to medium term, however, there could be more downside if economic data doesn't meet expectations. Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Story continuesmexican, grill, exterior, corner, sign, building, outdoor, vegetarian, windows, street, brick, brand, name, restaurantSusan Law Cain / Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our 12 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Buy list, we chose 12 leading consumer discretionary stocks that had competitive advantages and strong businesses.Some companies are both consumer staple and consumer discretionary such as The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) given the company's huge product portfolio which spans multiple categories. For the purposes of this article, we included The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) and the other companies that might also fit into other sectors as consumer discretionary stocks.Using the collective wisdom of hedge funds, we ranked the 12 consumer discretionary stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that owned shares of the same stock at the end of Q2 2022.12 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Buy12. The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31Although The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX) makes consumer staples such as bleach and disinfectant wipes, many of the company's products are premium priced, and as a result, some consumers are not buying as much of the company's products as they once did. For FY23, for example, The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX) sees sales potentially falling 4% year over year to rising 2% year over year. Shares of the company are also down 17.7% year to date given the headwinds. In the long term, however, The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX) has quality earnings power given its strong brands.Alongside Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX) is a consumer discretionary stock that many hedge funds in our database owned at the end of the second quarter.11. Darden Restaurants, Inc. (NYSE:DRI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32Darden Restaurants, Inc. (NYSE:DRI) is a leading restaurant operator that operates chains such as the Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse. In October, Eric Gonzalez of KeyBance raised his price target on Darden Restaurants, Inc. (NYSE:DRI) to $150 from $136 and kept an 'Overweight' rating. Gonzalez thinks Darden Restaurants, Inc. (NYSE:DRI)'s scale, data insights, results orientated culture can help its stock perform well in the long term. Of the 895 hedge funds in our database, 32 were long Darden Restaurants, Inc. (NYSE:DRI) at the end of the second quarter.10. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) is a leading burrito chain whose shares are down 17.4% year to date. In October, Joshua Long of Stephens trimmed his price target on Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) to $1,760 from $1,900 but kept an 'Overweight' rating after the company's third quarter report.Pershing Square Holdings commented on Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) in a Q2 2022 investor letter,We believe Chipotle is one of the best-positioned consumer companies for the current inflationary world. Given significant inflation in food and labor costs, management has planned a menu price increase of approximately 4% for August following a similarly-sized price increase in March. The company has tremendous pricing power due to the superb quality of its food which is priced at a discount to many competitors with inferior offerings, marketing focused on food quality and freshness rather than cost, and a customer base that over-indexes to higher-income consumers, some of whom are trading down from pricier alternatives. Chipotle’s economic model remains firmly intact, with restaurant-level margins in excess of 25% in the second quarter, up 0.8% year-over-year, and a consistent level of profitability expected for the current quarter. The company is debt-free and generates nearly all its sales in the U.S., insulating its earnings from the foreign currency headwinds facing many other large consumer companies. …”9. Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) is a leading restaurant operator that either franchises or operates around 53,000 restaurants under various company brands such as KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and more. On 11/2, Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) reported Q3 adjusted EPS of $1.09 versus the consensus estimate of $1.14 given the strong U.S. dollar. Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) sales, however, were above expectations as consumers have not pulled back spending as much as expected.8. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is a leading restaurant operator and franchisor that could potentially benefit from high inflation if enough consumers choose to go to McDonald's rather than more expensive restaurants. Although a recession would still be a headwind for McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), shares of the stock have rallied 2.9% year to date as investors anticipate the company's business to remain relatively steady. On 10/28, Christpher Carril of RBC Capital raised his price target on McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) to $295 from $275 and kept an 'Outperform' rating on shares.7. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is a leading coffee chain whose shares have fallen 22.5% year to date given the broader market weakness and recession worries. In terms of the fourth quarter, however, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) reported adjusted EPS of $0.81 and revenue of $8.4 billion versus the consensus of $0.72 and $8.31 billion. 55 hedge funds in our database held shares of Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) at the end of Q2 2022, ranking the company #7 on our list of 12 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Buy.6. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55While Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) makes consumer staples products such as toothpaste, the company's products are still discretionary in that they are often not the lowest price. As a result, Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) has faced some headwinds this year given the high inflation and potential softer economy. For Q3, Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) reported adjusted EPS of $0.74 on sales of $4.46 billion versus the expected earnings of $0.73 on sales of $4.47 billion.Like Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are consumer discretionary stocks that many hedge funds in our database owned at the end of Q2 2022.Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Buy.Suggested articles:22 Biggest Economies in the World in 202215 Largest IPOs of All Time Worldwide15 Biggest Global Tech Companies by Market CapDisclosure: None. 12 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Earlier this month, the company announced that it has completed the investigation and plans to release third-quarter 2022 results around Nov 9.Per the preliminary second-quarter results, the company estimated its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to be at or above 60 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same was pegged at 54 cents. The company has a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 1.61%.Q3 EstimatesFor the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $992.77 million, indicating a decline of 7.1% from the year-ago quarter. The consensus mark for earnings stands at 59 cents per share, suggesting a decline of 13.2% from the prior-year quarter.Factors to NoteDENTSPLY SIRONA’s Technologies &amp; Equipment segment witnessed growth in the second quarter of 2022. Strength in CAD/CAM, Implants and Orthodontics contributed to the improvement. This momentum is likely to have continued in the third quarter as well.Organic sales were strong on the back of regional performance in Europe, continued demand for CAD/CAM, Equipment &amp; Instruments, and Restorative and Preventive Consumables during the second quarter. Moreover, product launches and pricing adjustments during the quarter aided sales. The trend is likely to have continued in the third quarter and boosted sales.However, the company continued to experience supply shortages and softness in sales in China due to COVID-related shutdowns. Moreover, unfavorable currency movement is expected to have affected sales growth during the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Gross margin and adjusted EPS are likely to have been adversely impacted by certain expenses that favored second-quarter 2022 margins due to their time of recognition.Story continuesDENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.

The company stated that it expects a decline in forecast revenues, lower operating margins, and reduced expectations for future cash flows.

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Oracle Crunching The NumbersWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$10.9bUS$13.4bUS$16.1bUS$19.6bUS$21.0bUS$22.0bUS$22.8bUS$23.6bUS$24.3bUS$25.0bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x15Analyst x16Analyst x9Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 4.8%Est @ 3.95%Est @ 3.36%Est @ 2.95%Est @ 2.66% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.2% US$10.1kUS$11.4kUS$12.7kUS$14.3kUS$14.1kUS$13.7kUS$13.1kUS$12.6kUS$11.9kUS$11.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$125bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$25b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.2%– 2.0%) = US$408bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$408b÷ ( 1 + 8.2%)10= US$185bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$311b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$75.6, the company appears quite good value at a 34% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Oracle as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.215. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For Oracle, we've put together three pertinent elements you should assess:Risks: For instance, we've identified   4 warning signs for Oracle (2 are a bit unpleasant)  you should be aware of.Future Earnings: How does ORCL's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

(NASDAQ:MU) institutional owners after losing 23% over the past year",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/recent-uptick-might-appease-micron-110039458.html,1667991639,STORY,['MU'],"[A look at the shareholders of Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 83% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).After a year of 23% losses, last week’s 4.8% gain would be welcomed by institutional investors as a likely sign that returns might start trending higher.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Micron Technology. See our latest analysis for Micron Technology ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Micron Technology?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Micron Technology already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Micron Technology's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Micron Technology is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that Capital Research and Management Company is the largest shareholder with 9.2% of shares outstanding. With 8.4% and 7.8% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and BlackRock, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 19 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Micron TechnologyThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Micron Technology, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$195m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 17% stake in Micron Technology. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Micron Technology that you should be aware of before investing here.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

If you want to see more of the best consumer discretionary stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Buy.Consumer discretionary companies are companies that sell non-essential products and services such as entertainment or premium priced products.Given consumers don't have to buy consumer discretionary products or services, many consumer discretionary companies do well when the economy is strong and they don't do as well when the economy is weak. During times when the economy is strong, consumers generally have more money to spend and many consumers spend more on premium items or services they don't necessarily need. When the economy isn't strong, many consumers will spend less on discretionary items.2022Given high inflation in 2022, the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates six times this year alone and many analysts expect the central bank to raise rates further.As a result of the rate increases, the odds of a recession in the United States have increased. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said in October, ""There's a reasonable chance of a recession in the U.S., but it's not certain."" Meanwhile ratings agency Fitch said, ""Fitch expects the U.S. economy to enter genuine recession territory — albeit relatively mild by historical standards — in 2Q23.""As a result of the uncertainty, many consumer discretionary stocks have declined this year as investors anticipate potentially softer demand if a recession occurs next year. With the decline, many leading consumer discretionary stocks trade for fairly attractive valuations if the economy recovers and inflation normalizes in the long term.In the near to medium term, however, there could be more downside if economic data doesn't meet expectations. Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Story continuesmexican, grill, exterior, corner, sign, building, outdoor, vegetarian, windows, street, brick, brand, name, restaurantSusan Law Cain / Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our 12 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Buy list, we chose 12 leading consumer discretionary stocks that had competitive advantages and strong businesses.Some companies are both consumer staple and consumer discretionary such as The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) given the company's huge product portfolio which spans multiple categories.

The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31Although The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX) makes consumer staples such as bleach and disinfectant wipes, many of the company's products are premium priced, and as a result, some consumers are not buying as much of the company's products as they once did.

(NYSE:CMG) in a Q2 2022 investor letter,We believe Chipotle is one of the best-positioned consumer companies for the current inflationary world. Given significant inflation in food and labor costs, management has planned a menu price increase of approximately 4% for August following a similarly-sized price increase in March. The company has tremendous pricing power due to the superb quality of its food which is priced at a discount to many competitors with inferior offerings, marketing focused on food quality and freshness rather than cost, and a customer base that over-indexes to higher-income consumers, some of whom are trading down from pricier alternatives. Chipotle’s economic model remains firmly intact, with restaurant-level margins in excess of 25% in the second quarter, up 0.8% year-over-year, and a consistent level of profitability expected for the current quarter. The company is debt-free and generates nearly all its sales in the U.S., insulating its earnings from the foreign currency headwinds facing many other large consumer companies. …”9. Yum! Brands, Inc.

304,a3fd6aa0-0eb1-3907-912a-cdd9a0c0064c,TRIP,2022-11-09,How Kayak Fared 10 Years After Priceline’s Offer to Buy It,Skift,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kayak-fared-10-years-priceline-123000756.html,1667997000,STORY,"['BKNG', 'GOOGL', 'TRIP', 'ABNB']","[Kayak co-founders Steve Hafner and Paul English speaking at Skift events in London and New York in 2017 and 2018. SkiftOnline Travel This WeekTen years ago this week, on November 9, 2012, the Priceline Group (today’s Booking Holdings) announced a deal to acquire Kayak, the Connecticut-based metasearch engine, which had been a public company for less than four months.“A bomb just dropped in the online travel world: Priceline the world’s largest travel company, has agreed to acquire travel meta-search company Kayak, for about $1.8 billion,” wrote Skift founder Rafat Ali, adding, “Priceline will gain a great online and mobile team to build its portfolio and will put muscle behind the Kayak brand.” After regulatory scrutiny, Priceline welcomed Kayak into the fold on May 21, 2013.To understand the context, Kayak was among the hottest things in U.S. online travel in those days, although Google had acquired flight-tech company ITA Software in 2011.When Kayak, which was co-founded in 2004 by Steve Hafner and Paul English, went public on Nasdaq on July 20, 2012, Skift published a blog with around 18 updates documenting every move that day. When the closing bell clanged on its initial trading day, Kayak’s share price had increased 26 percent to $33.18, while 70 percent of Nasdaq’s other listings headed downward.So what has been the outcome for Kayak so far under Booking Holdings, and in an era when Google’s fight and hotel metasearch products have established a global footprint and sucked some of the life out of numerous competitors? From a financial standpoint, It’s tough to say with certainty because Booking doesn’t reveal much about Kayak’s earnings.Asked about Kayak’s fate under Booking Holdings over the last nine-plus years, Kayak CEO Hafner told Skift: “We don’t report numbers, but I can assure you that our business has prospered since the acquisition. Booking Holdings has supported our international expansion (from 14 countries to over 40), mergers and acquisitions (more than $550 million for Momondo and Hotelscombined), and anything else that we’ve tried like Kayak Miami Beach.”Story continuesKayak/Booking Holdings acquired metasearch companies Momondo in 2017 and Hotelscombined in 2018. In partnership with hotel operator Life House, there are now three Kayak-branded hotels, one in Miami Beach, Florida, and two in Playa del Carmen, Mexico.“If it hadn’t worked, I still wouldn’t be at Kayak,” Hafner said, contrasting his tenure of 18 years or so at Kayak with leadership changes over the years at Expedia-controlled Trivago and Trip.com Group-owned Skyscanner.One person close to Kayak, who has some knowledge of Kayak’s financials, said “they continue to crush it.”Google has certainly adversely impacted Kayak’s stature. And at times one has to question whether Booking Holdings could be committing more advertising and marketing dollars to keep Kayak front and center in travelers’ trip-planning considerations. In 2015, then-Priceline Group CEO Darren Huston even questioned the value of metasearch, although his own company, now called Booking Holdings, already owned Kayak; Expedia had a majority stake in Trivago; and Trip.com Group acquired Skyscanner the next year, in 2016.“The Google threat is real,” said Kayak co-founder Paul English, who left the company in late 2013. “I wonder if there will ever be any antitrust against Google for taking over search results vertical by vertical, and starving what were previously strong companies.”English added that rivals such as Tripadvisor, which is currently formulating a turnaround plan, “were much more vulnerable than Kayak, since I think most of TripAdvisor’s traffic was SEO (search engine optimization), where most of Kayak’s traffic was self-directed.”English said he’s disappointed that Kayak hasn’t done more with taking direct bookings, especially mobile ones. “It is so harsh to do a search in the Kayak app, and then when I find what I want, I have to open another app and start all over again,” he said.Martin Lumbye, the CEO of North East Venture, was one of four people who launched Momondo in 2006. He left Momondo in 2014, and Kayak acquired it three years later.Lumbye said Momondo’s front end doesn’t appear to have undergone any radical changes in recent years, but he believes its back-end technology is likely faster and deeper.“The biggest developments probably lie in the access to capital needed to scale internationally, and the ability to have more power in negotiations with online travel agencies and airlines regarding the costs per click they pay to Momondo and Kayak because size does matter,” Lumbye said.Kayak, as well as Tripadvisor, used to be must-use marketing vehicles for travel companies, at least in North America. Is Kayak still important?Clayton Reid, CEO of travel and tourism marketing company MMGY Global, said he’s surprised how well Kayak has withstood Google’s “aggressive tactics.Kayak “is still very much relevant for travelers in our survey of travel influence” Reid said. “Kayak has certainly fared better than Tripadvisor and Trivago, with a more consistent place in the travel making decision process. The other two have tried to move more up funnel with, I would argue, poorer outcomes.”In BriefAirbnb to Start Showing U.S. Guests Total Price Up-FrontAirbnb will next month begin showing U.S. customers the total price of a booking, minus the taxes, up-front in its listings and on maps when they opt in to view it in that way. Under regulatory pressure, the company has done this in Europe for an extended period. Airbnb said it will also curb some hosts onerous checkout task requirements. SkiftTripadvisor Hints at Turnaround PlanTripadvisor officials hinted that its Viator tours and activities brand, as well as hotel metasearch, will be anchor elements of its turnaround plan under new company leadership (new CEO and chief financial officer).

This downside is induced by higher spending on search engine marketing and other online traffic acquisitions across all segments and businesses to meet rising consumer travel demand amid the travel-sector recovery period.General and administrative costs were up 22% from the year-ago quarter’s level to $45 million, caused by additional headcount and higher digital services taxes in Europe.Technology and content costs of $55 million increased 6% on a year-over-year basis.TRIP reported an operating income of $70 million for the third quarter compared with $16 million in the same quarter last year.In the reported quarter, total adjusted EBITDA margin was 25% compared with 24% in the third quarter of 2021.Balance Sheet &amp; Cash FlowAs of Sep 30, 2022, cash and cash equivalents were $1.07 billion, up from $1.05 billion reported on Jun 30, 2022.Long-term debt as of Sep 30, 2022, was $836 million.

Jefferies out moments ago with an underperform rating on Tripadvisor, saying they're tired of the management team focusing on unprofitable businesses. So Tripadvisor getting slammed by the folks at Jefferies.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, and this is kind of a year ago comparison story, too. They talked about within this most recent earnings report a year ago, Delta, Omicron strains impacting travel, especially in Europe as well. And some of those year over year comps come back to how customers are changing some of their own booking appetites. Tripadvisor, for them, revenue improved significantly from a year ago.Of course, the inputs or the factors that you're dealing with are not the same. Investors right now are looking at Tripadvisor shares down 21%. Perhaps they're looking at the fact that, OK, if people aren't booking travel or going to continue to book travel in the future because of their own tightening of their expenditures or travel and that revenge travel starts to dry up, what does that mean for a Tripadvisor?BRIAN SOZZI: Not a good thing.BRAD SMITH: According to the market.BRIAN SOZZI: Really, a bad thing.

Tripadvisor saw Viator as its top-performing brand in the third quarter of 2022. TripAdvisorFurther investments in Tripadvisor’s Viator tours and activities brand, as well as making Tripadvisor’s core hotel price-comparison feature more relevant to travelers will likely be key elements of the company’s turnaround strategy, executives hinted, although they plan on first laying out their complete vision to investors in 2023.That was one of the takeaways of Tripadvisor’s third quarter earnings call Tuesday.Tripadvisor invested in Viator brand advertising in social media and podcasts during the third quarter and is continuing to do so in the fourth quarter, as Viator was clearly the top performer in Tripadvisor’s portfolio of brands.Outgoing chief financial officer Ernst Teunissen told financial analysts that Viator “has been on a spectacular path this year” with improved conversion and retention rates, as well as travelers booking more experiences before and during trips. Given Viator’s large supply of attractions, and the fact that 80 percent of the sector is still offline, there is tremendous upside, he said.New Tripadvisor Chief Financial Officer Mike Noonan, who’s been on the job for a week or so, likewise said the company thinks it has an attractive opportunity to take advantage of a growing travel and experiences market. Teunnissen will stay on in a transitional role through the end of 2022.“In light of this opportunity, we will assess areas of investment, opportunities to reallocate capital as well as look for ways to continue to drive operating efficiencies,” Noonan said. “We will continue to do so with a disciplined ROI-driven approach. I’m looking forward to catching up with everyone over the coming weeks.”CEO Matt Goldberg, who started at his post in July, replacing longtime boss Steve Kaufer, was likewise bullish about the company’s hotel auction, which enables online travel agencies and hotels to bid for position in Tripadvisor’s price comparison search results.This Tripadvisor metasearch service, he said, has bounced back strongly, and is providing high value to hotels and online travel agencies because consumers using it generally have a high intent to travel. Goldberg said there are opportunities to make the service more relevant to travelers, and improving its mobile features and grabbing certain geographic opportunities may be on the agenda.Story continuesAsked about competition from the online travel agencies and Google, Goldberg said:“You have to think about what you’re going to do that’s going to be different than Google. And I think we have a lot that we can do that will be different from Google. If we focus on our content and our trust and the security that travelers have with us when they think about the decision that they’re going to make, the way that we’re able to guide with a point of view and leverage the community, we know that we’re ranked above Google, Facebook, Airbnb, Booking when we track our brand in terms of trust.”Goldberg said he’s been meeting with teams across Tripadvisor and the company is formulating a new strategy in a structured way. He added that more details with be forthcoming next year.He said the company is likewise exploring appealing more directly to consumers, instead of mostly through hotels and online travel agencies, and officials are mulling how its Tripadvisor Plus subscription plan might fit in.Goldberg said Tripadvisor might also look to tweak its media products.“I think as I talked about product before, when we think about the product and services that we want to provide to deliver performance, leveraging engagement and data and productivity as well as with media, getting into those formats where we’re experimenting already, but we primarily played in the display ad category, which we know is declining,” Goldberg said.Goldberg stressed that Tripadvisor has the potential to build on its status as a trusted brand, and to take advantage of its content and community.“We know that our community has value,” Goldberg said. “We know that curating content and really thinking about a more longitudinal relationship to serve consumers at every step along the journey not just at a moment when they’re ready to make a particular search, I think, are all ways that we’re thinking about how to do that.”There wasn’t any talk during the call of spinning off Viator into a public company. Tripadvisor filed the paperwork early last year to potentially take Viator public, but hasn’t pulled the trigger as market conditions changed.Both Viator and Tripadvisor now sell experiences under their respective brands, and Goldberg said there may be opportunities in approaching the market in a different way than has been tried in the past.“We can think differently about the relationship between Viator and TripAdvisor, and that’s something we’re really excited to think about because the two together give them a very distinct advantage in the marketplace,” he said.The Bottom LineTripadvisor saw its net income rise to $25 million during the third quarter, up from $1 million a year earlier. Revenue jumped 51 percent to $459 million.“We are very pleased with the progress we’ve made year to date,” the company stated in its shareholder letter. “Throughout the year we’ve seen quarter over quarter improvements in recovery levels. Despite some variability across regions, currency impacts, and the macro uncertainty, all of which we expect to continue, we believe performance in 2022 has been reflective of the overall travel market trends in the various distinct sub-categories in which we compete.”Tripadvisor’s Viator tours and activities brand, and to a lesser extent its dining reservations platform, TheFork, showed particular strength, reaching 179 percent and 103 percent of 2019 revenue, respectively. Europe-oriented, Currency headwinds adversely impacted TheFork’s revenue numbers by 9 points compared with the comparable period in 2019.The Tripadvisor Core segment, which includes its hotel advertising auction, display ads, experiences and dining revenue, still lagged the recovery at several online travel peers, reaching $284 million in revenue, or just 88 percent of its 2019 marks. That core segment confronted 3 percentage points of currency headwinds relative to the third quarter of 2019.Tripadvisor’s share price was trading at $18.50, down about 22 percent for the day on Tuesday morning after issuing a fourth quarter outlook containing a “moderate step-down” of core segment revenue versus the third quarter. That was based on an especially robust August “and unique items in Q4 2019” making for a tough comp, the company said.Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

Leading industry players, including UPS, transport millions of packages each day across the globe. Apart from operating a ground fleet of multiple vehicles, some of these companies maintain an air fleet. While some players focus on providing air-transportation services for passengers and cargo, others deliver services to entities that outsource air-cargo lifting requirements.3 Key Trends to Watch in the Transportation-Air Freight &amp; Cargo IndustryE-commerce Demand Remains Strong: Agreed that e-commerce demand shrank from the levels witnessed at the peak of the pandemic, as economies reopen and normal economic activities gain traction.

This behavior emerges as retailers face staffing shortages and anticipated fulfillment delays. There is some good news, though. A survey from American Express shows that shoppers are expecting to spend the same or a little more this year as compared to 2021. Of course, inflation is expected to drive up spending overall. Still, shoppers polled are optimistic and said they’re more thoughtful about what they are buying.More from WWDDiwali in New York PartyThe Top Searched Celebrity Halloween Costumes of 2021Halloween 2021 Pop Culture-inspired CostumesIn the company’s latest Amex Trendex report, 64 percent of consumers polled said the holiday season is their favorite time to shop and said they are looking forward to making up for lost time this year, due to the pandemic, through holiday gifts, travel and celebrations. Over half (52 percent) of survey respondents reported canceled plans last holiday season.With 76 percent of consumers reporting they plan to spend more or about the same on gifts and decorations this holiday season, travel, gift shopping, and other celebratory plans are in full swing. Still, as consumers move ahead, they told the company they want to “ensure they are spending time and money on gifts and experiences that matter.” Seventy-eight percent of consumers agree that they want to be more selective with gift shopping and 77 percent said they would spend more on a purchase if it meant getting the right gift.As they consider where to find the “right gift,” 72 percent of consumers told the company they prefer to shop at small businesses during the holidays to get more personalized and unique gifts, with 77 percent of consumers saying they believe it’s more important than ever to support small businesses this holiday season. For 72 percent of consumers, supporting small businesses will mean dining out at favorite local restaurants.Story continuesMeanwhile, another 72 percent said they are looking for holiday gift options and discounts earlier in the year, with 53 percent of consumers reporting they have been saving credit card rewards for holiday shopping.As the holidays drive a desire to celebrate, 59 percent of consumers surveyed shared they want to buy themselves a gift this holiday. Additionally, 58 percent of consumers said they want to start or renew a tradition of traveling during the holiday season, and 53 percent of consumers say they plan to take time off before or after the holidays to travel. Sixty-two percent of consumers agree they would rather purchase experiences as gifts for friends and family rather than material gifts.In a survey of 1,000 consumers conducted by RetailMeNot, the savings company said in its report that the last couple of holiday seasons “have been a wild ride for retailers and shoppers alike. The pandemic, supply chain issues, staffing challenges, and shipping delays have all drastically changed the holiday shopping landscape, leading to unprecedented shopping season after unprecedented shopping season. As for the 2022 season? Another set of challenges is looming, with inflation driving up costs and economic uncertainty throwing shoppers and retailers alike for a loop.”In contrast to the Amex data, RetailMeNot found that shoppers will be spending 8 percent less than they did last year — $725 on average versus $786 last year. The company said the top categories include gift cards, apparel, toys, food/beverages and electronics.RetailMeNot noted that 85 percent of respondents said “they have been impacted in some way by inflation. Specifically, 41 percent of consumers were forced to reduce their overall budgets. Another 24 percent are tapping into their savings, and yet another 23 percent are prioritizing which bills to pay.”To cope with inflation, the survey revealed that 51 percent of those polled said they’re buying fewer things this year, while 36 percent are using more coupons. Twenty-seven percent said they’re scaling back on gift-giving, while 24 percent said they’re spacing out purchases over time. Twenty-two percent of respondents noted they’re buying more used items this year.Consumers are also shopping earlier, which echoes other recent shopper surveys. In the RetailMeNot poll, the company said about half of the respondents “plan to get started before Thanksgiving (traditionally the gateway to the holiday shopping season).”The survey showed that 56 percent of respondents were closely eyeing early deals. And 53 percent were planning to shop on Black Friday, while 55 percent were doing so on Cyber Monday. And similar to the Amex report, 42 percent of those polled were planning to shop on Small Business Saturday.Regarding electronics, a traditionally popular holiday gift item, Arris, a maker of composites, said in their report that consumers this season and in 2023 are “looking for the latest and greatest technology. More than half (53 percent) are looking forward to cellphone upgrades and new releases in 2023, that’s followed by 1 in 4 (25 percent) excited about laptop improvements and 19 percent anticipating updates in handheld video games.”And with the metaverse being pushed by brands and retailers, 14 percent of consumers polled said they plan to buy a virtual headset. Overall, though, 40 percent of consumers polled said they have no plans to buy electronics.Looking at staffing and workforce issues, research from Verint found that 60 percent of retailers polled said “they are challenged to find qualified candidates to staff their stores, while 45 percent are struggling to fill contact center and back-office positions.” Automation might be the solution.“Faced with labor shortages and challenged to meet consumer demands for superior shopping experiences across numerous engagement channels, Verint says this year’s holiday shopping season may be a reckoning for retailers in realizing the new reality of the automation imperative,” the company said in its report.The survey found that 94 percent of retailers polled plan to hire new workers for the holiday season, while nearly 30 percent said they do not have enough human resources staff “to handle the number of vacancies that need to be filled. Automation that helps retailers expand their organizational capacity to interview and qualify candidates can provide relief in this area,” Verint said.Jenni Palocsik, vice president of marketing insights, experience, and enablement at Verint, said staffing shortages “in stores, in the back office, and contact center roles will challenge retailers in their efforts to provide exceptional customer experiences to satisfy shoppers during the busy holiday shopping season this year. Leveraging automation is absolutely critical to fill workforce gaps and create a connected customer engagement strategy of humans and bots.”Other findings include that automation is either in place or planned for retail activities “such as tracking orders (81 percent), inventory management (81 percent), sending customized offers or recommendations (79 percent) and processing returns (69 percent).” Verint also noted 56 percent of those polled “currently have automation in place for customer support, and 21 percent plan to implement it while 23 percent don’t use or plan to use that type of automation.”Verint offered several ideas to help retailers engage shoppers this year, which include leaning into private messaging and automation “to scale this highly personalized channel. Bots can automate the use of private messaging channels at scale for customer communications in areas such as customized offers and recommendations and returns.”They also suggested employing “intelligent hiring solutions,” which can be used to streamline staff acquisition and assessment. “A virtual interviewing and hiring process creates an extra layer of evaluation by pre-assessing candidates and reducing the workload on HR and hiring managers,” Verint said in the report. “Intelligent hiring solutions that streamline the hiring process are becoming fundamental to talent acquisition strategies.”Verint said another solution could be automating contact or service center operations. “By automating responses to common queries or deflecting conversations to FAQs or community forums, the pressure on human agents is reduced, leaving them free to handle more complex issues, as well as lowering the cost to serve and creating a more seamless customer experience,” the company said.]"

NetApp (NTAP), which belongs to the Zacks Computer- Storage Devices industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This data storage company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 10.45%.For the last reported quarter, NetApp came out with earnings of $1.20 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.10 per share, representing a surprise of 9.09%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.27 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.42 per share, delivering a surprise of 11.81%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor NetApp, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.NetApp has an Earnings ESP of +0.06% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on November 29, 2022.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This compares to earnings of $0.87 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -1.61%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this oil and gas exploration and production company would post earnings of $2.93 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.16, delivering a surprise of 7.85%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Occidental , which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, posted revenues of $9.5 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.58%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $6.82 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Occidental shares have added about 162.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -20.1%.What's Next for Occidental?While Occidental has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Occidental: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this drugmaker a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Vertex is 73.2%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 12.2% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 0.6%.Impressive Asset Utilization RatioAsset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator in growth investing. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.Story continuesRight now, Vertex has an S/TA ratio of 0.58, which means that the company gets $0.58 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.15, it can be said that the company is more efficient.While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And Vertex is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 17.6% this year versus the industry average of 0%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Vertex. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 2.6% over the past month.Bottom LineVertex has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that Vertex is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, earnings were up 24.4% year over year. Unfavorable currency movements and higher operating expenses hurt earnings in the quarter, which was offset by strategic pricing initiatives undertaken by management. Excluding the negative currency impact, earnings rose 44.4%.Net sales increased 5.5% year over year to $1.10 billion but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14 billion. Excluding the negative currency impact, earnings rose 12.3%. The upside was driven by sales from the newly-acquired HRA Pharma, strong demand for cough/cold products globally and higher demand for infant formula in the United States. These were partially offset by unfavorable currency movements and divested Latin American businesses. Organic net sales (excluding the effects of acquisitions and divestitures and the impact of currency) were up 7.7% year over year.Segment DiscussionPerrigo reports its results under the following segments — Consumer Self Care Americas (“CSCA”) and Consumer Self Care International (“CSCI”). Per management, the company gained market share in both business segments during the quarter, as compared to the year-ago period.CSCA: Net sales of the segment in the third quarter of 2022 came in at $722.3 million, up 4% year over year. Sales increased due to strategic price increases, strong demand for store-brand infant formula and new product launches.CSCI: The segment reported net sales of $377.9 million, up 8.4% from the year-ago period. At constant-currency (cc) rates, sales were up 28.6% year over year. Organically sales increased 8.3%. Segment revenues benefitted from the higher sales of HRA Pharma brands, strong demand for cough/cold products and Women’s Health products, partially offset by lower sales of products from the Healthy Lifestyle category. Sales were negatively impacted by unfavorable currency movement.Story continues2022 Guidance RevisedPerrigo lowered its earnings guidance for 2022. The company now expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $2.00-$2.10, down from the previous guidance of $2.25-$2.35, to account for the worse-than-previously-expected impact of currency translation.Shares of Perrigo were down 7% in pre-market trading on Nov 8, likely due to a slash in earnings guidance for the full year. The stock has gained 1% this year against the industry’s decrease of 47.5%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchManagement reaffirmed total revenues in 2022 to grow 8.5%-9.5%.

But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. One great example is Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) which saw its share price drive 105% higher over five years. It's down 2.8% in the last seven days.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Vertex Pharmaceuticals achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 74% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 15% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Vertex Pharmaceuticals has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Vertex Pharmaceuticals has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 58% in the last twelve months. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 15% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

The company's market valuation decreased by US$3.9b after the stock price dropped 4.7% over the past week, but insiders were spared from painful losses.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Stryker Stryker Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe VP &amp; CFO, Glenn Boehnlein, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$606k worth of shares at a price of US$261 each. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$210. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.In the last year Stryker insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Stryker Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Stryker. In total, insiders sold US$205k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Insider Ownership Of StrykerLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Stryker insiders own about US$8.8b worth of shares (which is 11% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Stryker Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. But since Stryker is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 2 warning signs with Stryker and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

The Oracle of Omaha, as of the end of the second quarter of this year, owns 52.4 million shares of the company, worth about $2.5 billion. The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR)’s planned acquisition of Albertsons is currently a topic of debate in the Wall Street as the deal is expected to go through a lot of scrutiny from regulators.

(NYSE:C) is gaining the market's attention as investors flock to bank stocks amid rising interest rates. Warren Buffett’s hedge fund built a stake in the bank in the first quarter of this year and at the end of June, it reported having a stake worth $2.5 billion in the company. Recently, the bank posted strong third-quarter results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at $1.50, as compared to the Wall Street consensus of $1.45. Citigroup also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.51/share quarterly dividend.Of the 895 funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 82 had stakes in Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) as of the end of the second quarter, compared to 88 in the previous quarter. Harris Associates was the second-biggest shareholder of the bank after Berkshire, with a $1.2 billion stake.Here is what Diamond Hill Long-Short Fund has to say about Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Shares of Citigroup declined in the quarter as investors became increasingly negative on capital markets activity. The company is also continuing to divest certain consumer banking geographies which may be dilutive to earnings in the near term.”13. DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA)Warren Buffett’s hedge fund has been holding a stake in healthcare company DaVita (NYSE:DVA) for over 10 years now. At the end of June, the fund had owned 36 million shares of the company, worth $2.9 billion. DaVita (NYSE:DVA) is trading at an attractive PE ratio of 11 as of October 20. In August, investment firm UBS upgraded DaVita (NYSE:DVA) to Buy from Neutral, citing strong EPS growth prospects in the coming years. The investment firm also upped its price target for the company to $117 from $106. UBS analyst Andrew Mok said that he believes the company can deliver $200M-300M of OI growth in 2023.A total of 28 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in DaVita (NYSE:DVA) as of the end of the June quarter.12. The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK)Another strong financial services player in Buffett’s portfolio, Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) is currently trading in oversold territory, having lost 31% year to date. The bank has increased its dividend consistently for the last 11 years. It has a strong dividend yield of over 3%. Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) is already benefitting from rising interest rates. It crushed analysts’ estimates for the third quarter despite a decline in assets under custody and management. The bank’s CEO Robin Vince said the company’s performance “benefitted” from higher interest rates and continued strength in client volumes. Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK)'s adjusted EPS in the third quarter came in at $1.21, versus the consensus estimate of $1.08.In October, JPMorgan upgraded Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) to Buy from Neutral due to limited credit risk and strong return capacity.Here is what Ariel Investments has to say about The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“Rising interest rates, after a surprisingly long period of low absolute rates and negative “real” rates, will create a headwind. While there has been much debate about the cause of these low rates, we believe the most important factor has been the $120 billion in monthly federal reserve open market bond purchases and the accumulation of an $8 trillion balance sheet. The former will end, and the latter will shrink. It is not just the Fed that has aggressively purchased bonds, bidding up prices and lowering yields. Bond traders and hedge fund managers have added to positions, confident that being on the same side as the Fed was the wise place to be. Now as the Fed is about to become a seller of bonds rather than a buyer, Wall Street’s “smart money” is likely to follow suit. Against this backdrop, fixed income securities and bond substitutes such as high dividend paying utilities and absolute return hedge funds are substantially overpriced and are not likely to produce attractive returns going forward.This expectation of a reversion to the mean for interest rates helped 2021 performance, though not as much as we had hoped. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury did indeed increase from +0.92% at the beginning of the year to +1.52% at year-end. An underreported story was the poor performance of bonds last year. The Barclays Aggregate Index declined -1.67% for the year ending December compared to a return of +28.71% for equities as measured by the S&amp;P 500. Interest rates have continued to climb in 2022 with the 10-year Treasury at +1.79% as we go to print. This move higher in rates has contributed to our good, early start to 2022. Smaller positions in The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) also benefited from higher rates, principally with their ability to invest customer cash.”11. HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ)HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) is one of the best Warren Buffett stocks to buy because of its stability and strong growth prospects. Berkshire Hathaway owns 104.5 million shares of HP Inc. These shares were worth $3.4 billion at the end of June.  In September, UBS added HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) to its top tech picks list and said that the company is “well-positioned in the still-nascent 3D printing market."" Not only does HP have strong chances of share price growth, its dividend also makes it an attractive tech stock. Since 2016, its dividend has more than doubled. Currently it has a dividend yield of over 3%. Its PE ratio is just 4.67 which indicates that it’s overvalued and can rebound when the market begins to turn the corner.As of the end of the second quarter, 35 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ), which indicates no change in hedge fund sentiment when compared to the previous quarter.10. Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI)Warren Buffett’s hedge fund upped its stake in Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) by 7% in the second quarter. The fund ended the period with 68.4 million shares of the company, worth $5.33 billion. Investors are holding their breath as regulators in Europe and US continue to scrutinize Microsoft’s $68.7 billion takeover of Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI). Reports suggest that the FTC is expected to reach a decision in this regard in November, and authorities in the UK have set March as a deadline for a decision. Nevertheless, in October, Wells Fargo added Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) to its high-momentum portfolio. The firm said that long-term momentum “typically outperforms in stressful times by keeping investors away from adverse stock situations.”Despite the MSFT deal uncertainty, hedge fund sentiment around Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) remains strong. Of the 895 funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 84 reported having stakes in the company at the end of June, up from 80 funds in the quarter earlier.Here is what Cooper Investors specifically said about Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) – our investment preceded news that the company was under investigation for workplace bullying. When it became clear management had misled the market on the extent of the problem we sold, led by our principles of Responsible Investing. We did not benefit from the subsequent M&amp;A premium paid by Microsoft.”9. U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB)U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is another strong dividend-paying stock in Warren Buffett’s portfolio. The company has been increasing its dividend consistently for the last 10 years. It has a dividend yield of over 4%. US Bancorp recently posted strong third quarter results, driven by growth in interest income, loan and deposit growth. Like other major banks, US Bancorp numbers were buoyed by rising interest rates. Adjusted EPS in the third quarter totaled $1.18, compared to the Wall Street estimate of $1.16. Revenue in the quarter came in at $6.33 billion, surpassing estimates of $6.20 billion.A total of 43 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in the bank at the end of June, compared to 40 funds in the previous quarter.Here is what ClearBridge Investments Dividend Strategy has to say about U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“Over the last year, we have repositioned our portfolio to navigate the course we see ahead. We have increased our exposure to interest-rate sensitive banks by adding to existing positions in U.S. Bancorp.”8. Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO)Warren Buffett owns about 25 million shares of Moody's (NYSE:MCO), worth $6.7 billion, as of the end of the second quarter. Berkshire has been holding stakes in the ratings company for over a decade now. Warren Buffett has been enjoying healthy dividends from Moody's (NYSE:MCO) over these past years. The company has increased its payout for 13 consecutive years. Its payout ratio is just one-fifth of earnings. Famous investors like Chuck Akre, Chris Hohn and Nicolai Tangen have major stakes in the company as of the end of the second quarter.In August, Deutsche Bank analyst Faiza Alwy slashed  Moody's (NYSE:MCO) shares to Neutral from Buy, adding that the stock could have a limited upside when compared to its valuation.Here is what Smead Value Fund has to say about Occidental Petroleum Corporation in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Our top-performing stocks in the quarter includes Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). Oil and gas have been the best game in the stock market town this year and it was a pleasant surprise to see home builders pick up even with dour news on interest rates and the economy. For the first three quarters of the year, we should change the name of our fund to the Jed Clampett Fund. Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), was one of the standouts. Up through the bear market came a “bubblin’ crude!”7. Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY)Warren Buffett increased his hold in Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) by 17% in the second quarter of 2022. His hedge fund now owns 159 million shares of the energy company. These shares have a total worth of $9.3 billion. The fund now owns 21% of the energy company. In light of this, Truist said in a report that Buffett now has a “clear path” towards acquiring Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY).Truist analyst Neal Dingmann said in a note to investors that the “total” purchase of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) would make “logical sense” for Berkshire, given the oil company has a strong FCF forecast, declining debt and is showing strong progress on low carbon ventures.Despite the bloodbath in the stock market in 2022, Occidental has gained 129% year to date.6. The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC)The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) is an important defensive stock that is gaining investors’ attention in 2022 amid recession fears. But Berkshire has been a long-time shareholder of the stock. At the end of the second quarter, Buffett’s fund owned 325 million shares of The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC), worth $12.42 billion. Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to Buy from Neutral. Goldman’s analyst Jason English cited attractive valuation and favorable conditions for the upgrade. Analysts see The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) favorably in this high-inflation environment as it’s relatively easier for food companies to pass on the price increases to consumers. The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) is a high-dividend stock, with a yield of 4.5% as of October 21.Hedge fund sentiment for The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) is increasing.

If you want to explore more nuclear ETFs that you can add to your portfolio, you can also take a look at 5 Best Nuclear ETFs to Buy Now.Nuclear energy has been the center of bad press for a long time now. Whenever the word nuclear comes to mind, most people recall the Chernobyl and Fukushima Daiichi incidents. These two disasters have had a negative impact on the world and turned it more cautious toward generating energy from nuclear power. However, the benefits of nuclear power over fossil fuels cannot be overlooked. One of the biggest benefits of nuclear energy over matter-dense energy sources, such as fossil fuels, is its lack of carbon emissions. According to the Nuclear Energy Institute, energy generated from nuclear power in the U.S. reduces over 470 million metric tons of carbon emissions every year.The U.S. draws roughly 50% of its carbon-free energy from nuclear sources. In efforts to battle climate change, on April 19, the Biden administration poured $6 billion into the nuclear energy industry to extend the life of nuclear plants in the U.S. that were at risk of shutting down.The Energy Crisis in Europe: Nuclear Energy to the RescueThe Russian-Ukraine conflict has sent prices to all-time highs around the globe. No other region is experiencing the repercussions of the war more than Europe. On August 31, Russia completely cut off gas supplies to Europe, claiming that the Nord Stream 1 pipelines need to go through routine repairs. Russia previously shut down the Nord Stream 1 pipeline in July. Inflation in Europe attained a record high of 9.1% in August, with the energy index contributing the most. The energy index was the highest contributor and recorded a reading of 38.3% in August, down from 30.6% in July, but still alarmingly high.High energy prices and hurdles in getting gas from Russia have spiked interest in European governments to consider nuclear energy as a solution. On March 17, the Czech Republic announced an investment of EUR 6 billion to fund the building of a new nuclear reactor at the Dukovany nuclear plant. On September 1, Britain's outgoing Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that the UK will invest roughly $800 million to fund a new nuclear power plant to ensure the nation's national and energy security.Story continuesThe energy crisis in Europe has triggered hefty investments in nuclear energy infrastructure. As economies around the globe push further to achieve carbon neutrality, the nuclear energy industry is expected to experience significant growth. Some of the best nuclear energy stocks that investors and analysts have turned bullish on include Denison Mines Corp. (NYSE:DNN), NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), and Cameco Corporation (NYSE:CCJ).Best Nuclear ETFs to Buy Nowdan-meyers-F_DSvG5Fb0A-unsplashOur MethodologyFor risk-averse investors that are seeking exposure to the lucrative nuclear energy market, we have compiled a list of the best nuclear ETFs to buy now.

However, the market is not giving the company credit for the material improvements CEO Larry Culp has made in his tenure. The balance sheet today is stronger than it has been in a very long time, and each of the three primary business segments each have strong paths to increasing earnings, regardless of the economic environment. Healthcare has historically not been a cyclical business. While Aviation typically has some economic sensitivity, the business still has a strong COVID rebound tailwind that should continue even in an uncertain environment. Power is a less cyclical business, and GE maintains a steady business servicing approximately one-third of the world’s electricity. GE is another example of strong insider buying indicating management’s confidence in the business, while the company also began buying back discounted shares. GE is still on track to break the company into three separate businesses, and we believe this will help the market properly weigh the value of each core segment.”In addition to investing in ETFs, investors can look to nuclear stocks such as Denison Mines Corp.

Securities validly tendered and not validly withdrawn on or before the Early Participation Date will be accepted for purchase in priority to other Securities tendered after the Early Participation Date, even if such Securities tendered after the Early Participation Date have a higher Acceptance Priority Level than Securities tendered on or before the Early Participation Date. Furthermore, if the amount of Securities validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to or at the Early Participation Date exceeds the Total Maximum Amount, Holders who validly tender Securities in the Tender Offer after the Early Participation Date will not have any of their Securities accepted for purchase regardless of the Acceptance Priority Level of such Securities unless GE increases the Total Maximum Amount.GE reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion and in accordance with applicable law, to waive or modify any one or more of the conditions to the Tender Offer in whole or in part at any time on or prior to the date that any Securities are first accepted for purchase or to (i) increase the Total Maximum Amount or (ii) decrease the Total Maximum Amount. Any such increase or decrease may be made on the basis of Securities validly tendered through the Early Participation Date and promptly announced on the business day immediately following the Early Participation Date. Any such increase or decrease may be made without extending the Withdrawal Date or otherwise reinstating withdrawal rights, except as required by applicable law.If GE exercises its right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to purchase the Securities on an Early Payment Date and, on such Early Payment Date, or on the Final Payment Date, if there are sufficient remaining funds to purchase some, but not all, of the remaining tendered Securities in any Acceptance Priority Level without exceeding the Total Maximum Amount, GE will accept for payment such tendered Securities on a prorated basis, with the proration factor for such Acceptance Priority Level depending on the aggregate principal amount (converted into U.S. Dollars where applicable as described above) of Securities of such Acceptance Priority Level validly tendered.The ""Total Consideration"" payable for each series of Fixed Spread Securities will be a price per $1,000, £1,000 or €1,000 principal amount of such series of Fixed Spread Securities validly tendered pursuant to the Tender Offer on or prior to the Early Participation Date, and accepted for purchase by us (subject to the Acceptance Priority Levels, the Total Maximum Amount and proration, if any), equal to an amount in the currency in which the applicable Securities are denominated, calculated in accordance with Schedule C-1, C-2 or C-3 to the Offer to Purchase, as applicable, that would reflect, as of the Early Payment Date or, to the extent GE does not exercise its right to purchase the Securities on such Early Payment Date, as of the Final Payment Date: (i) for each series of Fixed Spread Dollar Securities and Fixed Spread Sterling Securities, a yield to the applicable maturity date of such series of Securities equal to the sum (such sum being annualized in the case of the Fixed Spread Sterling Securities) of (a) the Reference Yield (as defined below) of the applicable Reference Security, determined at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the first business day following the Early Participation Date (the ""Reference Yield Determination Date""), plus (b) the fixed spread applicable to such series, as set forth in the table above (the ""Fixed Spread""); and, (ii) for each series of Fixed Spread Euro Securities, a yield to the applicable maturity date of such series of Securities equal to the sum of (a) the Reference Yield (corresponding to the applicable Interpolated Rate as set forth in the table above) determined at the Reference Yield Determination Date, plus (b) the applicable Fixed Spread for such series of Securities; in each case, minus accrued and unpaid interest on such Securities from, and including, the most recent interest payment date prior to the applicable Payment Date up to, but not including, such Payment Date.

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company to watch right now is Par Pacific (PARR). PARR is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) and an A for Value.Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. PARR has a P/S ratio of 0.21. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.33.Finally, our model also underscores that PARR has a P/CF ratio of 3.60. This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook. PARR's P/CF compares to its industry's average P/CF of 5.16. Over the past year, PARR's P/CF has been as high as 81.73 and as low as -19.79, with a median of 3.63.Another great Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing stock you could consider is Valero Energy (VLO), which is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value Score of A.Valero Energy is currently trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 6.37 while its PEG ratio sits at 1.06. Both of the company's metrics compare favorably to its industry's average P/E of 5.46 and average PEG ratio of 0.68.Story continuesVLO's Forward P/E has been as high as 57.89 and as low as 4.79, with a median of 10.80. During the same time period, its PEG ratio has been as high as 12.91, as low as 0.80, with a median of 1.80.Additionally, Valero Energy has a P/B ratio of 2.09 while its industry's price-to-book ratio sits at 1.98. For VLO, this valuation metric has been as high as 2.90, as low as 1.47, with a median of 1.87 over the past year.These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that Par Pacific and Valero Energy are likely being undervalued right now. Considering this, as well as the strength of its earnings outlook, PARR and VLO feels like a great value stock at the moment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

MUSA has gained 6.1% since its third-quarter earnings announcement on Oct 26. The company managed to comfortably beat top and bottom-line estimates.What Did Murphy USA’s Earnings Unveil?Murphy USA announced third-quarter 2022 earnings per share of $9.28, which handily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.82 and improved significantly from the year-earlier bottom line of $3.98. The outperformance could be attributed to a rise in the retail gasoline price and a higher retail margin of 37.6 cents per gallon, up 41.4% year over year.In more good news for investors, MUSA’s board of directors recently declared a quarterly cash dividend of 35 cents per share to its common shareholders of record on Nov 8. The payout, which represents a 9% sequential increase, will be made on Dec 1.Meanwhile, Murphy USA’s operating revenues of $6.2 billion rose 34.7% year over year and beat the consensus mark by $230 million, primarily due to improved merchandise sales.Merchandise sales, at $1 billion, rose 7.7% year over year and outperformed the consensus mark of $983 million. However, revenues from petroleum product sales came in at $5.1 billion, falling 3.7% short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate but up 42.1% from the third quarter of 2021.Halliburton Company Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseHalliburton Company Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseHalliburton Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Halliburton Company Quote Key TakeawaysMUSA’s total fuel contribution rose 59.8% year over year to $468.1 million due to margin expansion and higher volumes. Total fuel contribution (including retail fuel margin plus product supply and wholesale results) came in at 37.6 cents per gallon, which improved more than 41% from the third quarter of 2021.Retail fuel contribution increased 85.1% year over year to $489.5 million as margins widened to 39.3 cents per gallon from 24 cents in the corresponding period of 2021. Retail gallons rose 13.2% from the year-ago period to 1,245.6 million in the quarter under review and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.7%. Volumes on an SSS basis (or fuel gallons per store) improved 10.6% from the third quarter of 2021 to 251.8 thousand. Meanwhile, the average retail gasoline price during the quarter came in at $3.67 per gallon, up from $2.89 per gallon a year ago.Contribution from Merchandise increased 9.8% to $205.7 million on higher sales and better unit margins, which, at 20%, moved up from the year-ago period’s 19.6%. On an SSS basis, total merchandise contribution was up 7.5% year over year, primarily on the back of 8.9% higher non-tobacco margins. Meanwhile, merchandise sales increased 5.4% on an SSS basis due to an increase in tobacco as well as non-tobacco sales.The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s fuel gallons were up 10.7% from the prior-year period, while merchandise sales increased 5.4% on an average per store month basis.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Story continuesBalance SheetAs of Sep 30, Murphy USA — which opened 7 new retail locations in the quarter to take its store count to 1,700 — had cash and cash equivalents of $192.7 million and long-term debt (including lease obligations) of $1.8 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization of 70.1%.During the quarter, MUSA bought back shares worth $211.5 million.Some Key Refining EarningsWhile we have discussed MUSA’s third-quarter results in detail, let’s see how some other refining companies have fared this earnings season.Phillips 66 PSX reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.46, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.98. The bottom line also more than doubled from a profit of $3.18 per share in the year-ago quarter.PSX’s worldwide margins surged to $26.58 per barrel from the year-ago quarter’s $8.57. The same in the Central Corridor and Atlantic Basin/Europe increased to $38.76 and $19.22 per barrel from the year-ago levels of $12.47 and $9.27, respectively. In the Gulf Coast, Phillips 66 saw the metric jump to $21.29 per barrel from $5.75 in the prior-year quarter. The West Coast witnessed an increase in margins from $7.46 per barrel in the year-ago quarter to $28.64 in the September-end quarter of 2022.Another refining giant Valero Energy VLO reported adjusted earnings of $7.14 per share compared to a meager $1.22 in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7 per share. VLO’s strong quarterly results were supported by increased refinery throughput volumes and a higher refining margin.For the quarter, Valero’s refining throughput volumes were 3,005 thousand barrels per day (MBbls/d), up from 2,864 MBbls/d in third-quarter 2021. Meanwhile, VLO’s refining margin per barrel of throughput increased to $21.34 from the year-ago level of $10.07.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This factor can impact your investment portfolio as well as help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.Another thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in UnitedHealth Group (UNH) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to UNH for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?UnitedHealth Group's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at UnitedHealth Group's main business drivers.UnitedHealth Group, Inc. provides a wide range of health care products and services, such as health maintenance organizations (HMOs), point of service plans (POS), preferred provider organizations (PPOs), and managed fee-for-service programs.UnitedHealth has the largest and most diverse membership base within the managed-care organization market, which gives it significant competitive advantages. It has built its prescription drug business through OptumRx division, with the acquisition of Catamaran. The company has acquired a number of competing healthcare providers. These acquisitions have transformed it from a pure health insurer to a comprehensive healthcare provider.UnitedHealth reports through two segments: UnitedHealthcare and Optum. Its strategy is to meld the provision of medical care from its Optum unit with UnitedHealthcare brand insurance products, which help in cross-selling of products and services. The company is consistently working toward expanding both these units to reach more clients, in turn boosting its growth possibilities.UnitedHealthcare (contributed 58.9% of revenues in 2021) is divided into UnitedHealthcare Employer &amp; Individual; UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement; UnitedHealthcare Community &amp; State and UnitedHealthcare Global. This segment is responsible for providing health care benefits globally. It serves individuals as well as employers. Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries consist a large chunk of its client list.Story continuesOptum (41.1%) is a technology-enabled health services business serving the broad health care marketplace, including those who need care: the consumers who need the right support, information, resources and products; those who provide care: pharmacies, hospitals, physicians, practices and other health care facilities. The segment is divided into OptumHealth, OptumInsight, OptumRx and Optum eliminations.Bottom LinePutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For UnitedHealth Group, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in November 2012 would be worth $10,044.60, or a 904.46% gain, as of November 8, 2022, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.The S&amp;P 500 rose 172.98% and the price of gold increased -7.23% over the same time frame in comparison.Analysts are anticipating more upside for UNH.UnitedHealth Group’s third-quarter earnings beat estimates. Its shares have outperformed the industry in a year. Its top line has been growing and the momentum should continue in the years ahead on the back of a strong market position, new deals, renewed agreements and expansion of service offerings. Our estimates suggest revenues for 2022 to rise 12% from the 2021 level. Its solid health services segment provides diversification benefits. UNH's Government business remains well-poised for growth. Adjusted net earnings per share are anticipated in the $21.85-$22.05 band, up from the prior projection of $21.40-$21.90. A sturdy balance sheet enables investments. However, softness in commercial business due to COVID-induced volatilities persists. Rising operating costs are hurting margins. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.Shares have gained 9.25% over the past four weeks and there have been 11 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2022 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

363,9e8d468e-fb51-3425-9bd9-5c2ff72407ed,ADP,2022-11-09,Add These 4 GARP Stocks to Your Portfolio for Maximum Returns,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/add-4-garp-stocks-portfolio-130501090.html,1667912701,STORY,"['GWW', 'NFG', 'ADP', 'JHX']","[If you are looking for a profitable portfolio of stocks offering the best value and growth investing, try the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy.The strategy helps investors gain exposure to undervalued stocks with impressive prospects. Unlike a blend strategy, a portfolio that uses GARP investing is expected to include stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing. W.W. Grainger GWW, National Fuel Gas Company NFG, Automatic Data Processing ADP and James Hardie Industries JHX are some GARP stocks that hold promise.GARP Metrics — Mix of Growth &amp; Value MetricsThe GARP strategy seeks to offer an ideal investment by utilizing the best features of both value and growth investing. Investors adopting the GARP approach prefer buying stocks priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Growth MetricsBoth a strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric that both growth and GARP investors consider is the return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for a strong and higher ROE than the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flows find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing prioritizes the popular value metrics — the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and the price-to-book (P/B) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios.Using the GARP principle, we ran a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Story continuesScreening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS &amp; projected 3-5-year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE than the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than the M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicate that the stocks are undervalued.)Here are four stocks that made it through the screen:W.W.

The hedge fund boosted its stake in Bowlero Corp. (NYSE:BOWL) by 3% in the June quarter. Story continuesOn October 27, Bowlero Corp. (NYSE:BOWL) announced that it has bought two additional bowling centers in California and Iowa, bringing its total to 17 this year. For FY 2023, the company entered into nine definitive agreements, and concluded seven acquisitions. Oppenheimer analyst Ian Zaffino initiated coverage of Bowlero Corp. (NYSE:BOWL) with an Outperform rating and a $16 price target. Bowlero Corp. (NYSE:BOWL), the biggest operator of bowling centers in North America, it is about seven times larger than the number two player, and ""represents an interesting investment opportunity,"" the analyst said. The rest of the industry is very fragmented and Bowlero Corp. (NYSE:BOWL)’s emphasis on ""bowling first"", its diverse and sophisticated customer base, and proprietary operating system give it market-leading margins, the analyst added.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 18 hedge funds were bullish on Bowlero Corp. (NYSE:BOWL) at the end of June 2022, compared to 23 funds in the prior quarter. In addition to Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI), Bowlero Corp. (NYSE:BOWL) is one of the top stock picks from the George Soros stock portfolio. 9. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 116Soros Fund Management’s Stake Value: $103,564,000Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a California-based company offering customer relationship management technology to companies and individuals worldwide. Soros Fund Management boosted its Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) stake by 139% in Q2 2022, holding 627,509 shares worth $103.5 million. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is one of the top stock picks from the George Soros stock portfolio. On November 2, Macquarie analyst Sarah Hindlian-Bowler took over coverage of Salesforce, Inc.

Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 15.6 million shares worth $2.6 billion. Vulcan Value Partners made the following comment about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a leading customer relationship management (CRM) platform with a broad suite of products that help its customers with sales, service, marketing, and analytics. Salesforce has steadily gained market share within its addressable market, that itself is growing 13% per year. Salesforce has used both organic innovation and selective M&amp;A to expand its menu of products. This has improved penetration as customers increase the number of products, or clouds, they buy from Salesforce. As a customer moves from one Salesforce cloud to two clouds, annual recurring revenue (ARR) increases 3X on average. With 3 clouds, ARR is 9X higher vs. 1 cloud, and we believe this exponential growth dynamic will increase with each successive cloud. In addition to generating recurring revenue for Salesforce, each incremental cloud helps Salesforce increase its position within the daily operations of its customers, making its products stickier. Long term, we believe these secular trends will continue, and that Salesforce will continue to gain market share, expand margins, and innovate to address the needs of its customers.”8. Aramark (NYSE:ARMK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27Soros Fund Management’s Stake Value: $110,770,000Aramark (NYSE:ARMK) is a Pennsylvania-based company that offers food, facilities, and uniform services to education, healthcare, business, sports, leisure, and corrections clients in the United States and internationally.

The dividend is payable on December 5, to shareholders of the company as of November 22. The dividend yield on November 8 came in at 1.24%. Jefferies analyst Stephanie Moore assumed coverage of Aramark (NYSE:ARMK) on October 25 with a Hold rating and a price target of $36, down from $40. The analyst believes Aramark (NYSE:ARMK)’s turnaround strategy is seeing positive results, but her Hold rating is due to valuation and a view that the uniform business spin is not a short-term catalyst as its expected timing is during spring/summer 2023.According to Insider Monkey’s Q2 data, 27 hedge funds were bullish on Aramark (NYSE:ARMK), compared to 25 funds in the prior quarter. Thomas Steyer’s Farallon Capital is the leading position holder in the company, with 16 million shares worth $490.3 million. 7. Alphabet Inc.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 160 funds in the earlier quarter.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“The share prices of both Meta and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have declined significantly over the past twelve months. We believe this is due to a combination of a weakening ad market, depreciation of foreign currencies, and increased competitive intensity. On the positive side, we anticipate each company to continue to generate significant amounts of free cash flow even during these challenging times, which we expect to be redeployed into a combination of growth projects and share buybacks.”6. Biohaven Ltd. (NYSE:BHVN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58Soros Fund Management’s Stake Value: $182,866,000Biohaven Ltd. (NYSE:BHVN) is a Connecticut-based clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, focused on discovering and developing therapies for neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases in the United States.

(NYSE:BHVN) but slashed the firm's price target on the shares to $25 from $165 following its spin off. The analyst said the target is based mainly on BHV-7000 in epilepsy, but there is a potential for upside via the emerging pipeline. According to Insider Monkey’s Q2 data, 58 hedge funds were long Biohaven Ltd. (NYSE:BHVN), compared to 41 funds in the preceding quarter. Phill Gross and Robert Atchinson’s Adage Capital Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with more than 3 million shares worth $442.8 million. Like Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI), Biohaven Ltd. (NYSE:BHVN) is one of the top stock picks of George Soros. Here is what Baron Health Care Fund has to say about Biohaven Ltd. (NYSE:BHVN) in their Q1 2021 investor letter:“Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company Ltd. is a biotechnology company dedicated to neurologic drug discovery. It launched its lead asset, migraine medication Nurtec, last year, and the company is transitioning towards profitability. Shares declined when Biohaven issued a secondary offering in March that took investors by surprise and seemed early in relation to an expected second indication for Nurtec in the prophylactic prevention of migraine, which expands its market.

President Joe Biden has been pushing for more investment in clean energy technologies and regulation, agenda items that could be challenged by a Congress that shifts toward Republican control.Investors were also awaiting a closely watched report on inflation for October. The consumer price index on Thursday is expected to show a deceleration in prices over 12 months from the prior reading, a potentially welcome sign that the Federal Reserve would decide to ease back on the pace of its interest rate increases beginning in December.The Fed has been looking at inflation and labor market data as it decides what move to make next, after raising its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage points at four consecutive meetings.Data on the number of new jobless claims for the prior week are also due out on Thursday morning.Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:1. Rivian earningsElectric vehicle maker Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN) is expected to report a loss of $1.81 a share on revenue of $568 million. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is getting ready to introduce 1,000 Rivian delivery vehicles during the holiday season.2. DR Horton earningsHomebuilder DR Horton Inc (NYSE:DHI) is expected to report earnings per share of $5.18 on revenue of $10.17 billion.

The September reading on inflation was anything but encouraging. On a year-over-year basis, the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 8.2% compared with 8.3% in August. Again, year over year, the core CPI (excluding volatile food and energy items) increased 6.6% in September compared with the August reading of 6.5%.To check the sky-high inflation, the Fed adopted a hawkish stance, having raised the benchmark lending rate 3% year to date. Fed chair Jerome Powell indicated categorically that the central bank will continue hiking interest rates as long as inflation remains elevated. Higher interest rates shoot up the cost of borrowing, escalating the chances of an economic slowdown. Underlining the sorry state of affairs, the S&amp;P 500 Index posted the third straight quarter of losses for the first time since 2009.Despite the current turmoil, evading equities is never advisable for investors. So what’s the way forward? One solution is to pay heed to broker advice while designing one’s portfolio in the current scenario of high-interest rates. Broker-friendly stocks like American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, CVR Energy, Covenant Logistics Group and Cross Country Healthcare are the only recourse for investors to net healthy returns amid this market bloodbath.As brokers indulge in extensive research on stocks under their coverage, they have access to a much-detailed dope on a company. To this end, they attend company conference calls/presentations and scrutinize every piece of document available in the public domain before instructing investors.Direction of Earnings Estimates: A Key ParameterSince brokers follow the stocks under their coverage in great detail, they revise their earnings estimates after carefully examining the pros and cons of an event for the concerned company. The estimate revisions serve as an important yardstick regarding a stock price.Story continuesFor example, a company’s earnings beat generally leads to upward estimate revisions with prices moving north. Similarly, lackluster earnings often cause stock price depreciation. Naturally, adhering to such well-researched information stands investors in good stead in their bid to glean attractive returns from their respective portfolios. Investors tend to be guided by the direction of estimate revisions and the stock price while formulating their investment strategy.Making the Most of Broker KnowhowThe above write-up clearly suggests that by following broker actions, one can arrive at a promising basket of stocks. Keeping this in mind, we designed a screen to shortlist stocks based on improving analyst recommendations and upward earnings estimate revisions over the last four weeks.Also, since the price/sales ratio is a strong complementary valuation metric in the presence of analyst information, it is considered in designing a winning portfolio of stocks. The price/sales ratio takes care of the company’s top line, making the strategy extremely effective.Here are five of the 10 stocks that passed the screen test:American Airlines is based in Fort Worth, TX. The gradual increase in air-travel demand (particularly for leisure) is aiding AAL. However, high fuel costs are hurting the bottom line.Over the past 60 days, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings being revised 69.6% upward. AAL currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Delta, currently carrying a Zacks Rank of 3, is based in Atlanta, GA. DAL is being bolstered by the uptick in demand for air travel (particularly for leisure). High fuel costs are, however, a bane.Delta’s earnings outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters (missing the mark in the remaining two quarters). The average beat is 7.9%.CVR Energy is an independent refiner and marketer of high-value transportation fuels. CVI is also a producer of ammonia and urea ammonia nitrate fertilizers. CVI's petroleum business includes a full-coking sour crude refinery in Coffeyville, KS. Its efforts to reward its shareholders underline its strong financial position. The robust Nitrogen Fertilizer unit is supporting growth.CVR Energy, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3, has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 7.7% over the past 60 days.Covenant Logistics offers a portfolio of transportation and logistics services, including asset-based expedited, dedicated and irregular route truckload capacity besides asset-light warehousing, transportation management and freight brokerage capability.The gradually improving freight market scenario is a tailwind to Covenant.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Airline Stocks To Buy Now. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) expects passenger revenues to account for $498 billion of total industry revenues in 2022, more than double the $239 billion generated in 2021. Scheduled passenger numbers are forecasted to reach 3.8 billion and yields are expected to increase 5.6%. In 2022, industry revenues are expected to touch $782 billion, up 54.5% as compared to 2021 and 93.3% of the 2019 levels. The number of flights operated in 2022 will amount to 33.8 million as per IATA, which is 86.9% of 2019 levels, when total flights amounted to 38.9 million. Overall, expenses are expected to climb to $796 billion, which is a 44% increase as compared to 2021, reflecting the costs of expanding operations and the inflationary impact.IATA expects that the airline industry will be profitable in 2023 as pent-up travel demand leads to higher airline bookings even as the global economy weakens. Bloomberg cited IATA Director General Willie Walsh, who told a group of airline chiefs in June 2022: “Industry-wide profit should be on the horizon in 2023. We are rebounding. By next year, most markets should see traffic reach or exceed pre-pandemic levels.”While Walsh did not overlook the harsh economic and political climate, he noted that “the desire to travel and the necessity of moving goods are both solid.” The North American market is on its way to profitability, and airlines are forecasted to collectively report a net income of $8.8 billion this year. Some of the best airline stocks to buy in order to benefit from the boom in the sector include Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL), Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV), and American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL). Our Methodology We selected the following airline stocks based on growth fundamentals, positive analyst coverage, and strong hedge fund sentiment as of June 2022.

(NASDAQ: REGN) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the PD-1 inhibitor Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc) in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with no EGFR, ALK or ROS1 aberrations. Patients must either have metastatic or locally advanced tumors that are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation. Patients may be treated with this combination irrespective of PD-L1 expression or histology.""This second FDA approval for cemiplimab-rwlc in advanced non-small cell lung cancer greatly broadens the scope in which a cemiplimab-rwlc-based regimen can be prescribed to encompass a wide range of patients, either as single agent in those with PD-L1 ≥50% or now in combination with chemotherapy irrespective of PD-L1 expression or tumor histology,"" said David R. Gandara, M.D., Professor Emeritus and Senior Advisor of the Thoracic Oncology Program at the University of California Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center. ""The approval is based on a Phase 3 trial designed to closely resemble a patient population with varied disease presentations that physicians manage in everyday clinical practice. Even with these diverse disease presentations, cemiplimab-rwlc combined with chemotherapy demonstrated a marked increase in overall survival, at a median of 22 months versus 13 months with chemotherapy alone. Clearly, this is an advance which is clinically meaningful for our patients with advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer.""Story continuesThe FDA approval is based on data from the global Phase 3 trial, EMPOWER-Lung 3, that investigated Libtayo in combination with a physician's choice of platinum-doublet chemotherapy (Libtayo combination), compared to platinum-doublet chemotherapy alone. The trial enrolled 466 patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, irrespective of PD-L1 expression or tumor histology, and with no ALK, EGFR or ROS1 aberrations. Among those enrolled, 43% had tumors with squamous histology, 67% had tumors with &lt;50% PD-L1 expression, 15% had inoperable locally advanced disease not eligible for definitive chemoradiation, and 7% had pretreated and clinically stable brain metastases.""Libtayo is now approved for extending the survival of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer as both a monotherapy in high PD-L1 expressors and in combination with chemotherapy irrespective of PD-L1 expression levels, achieving a high bar that has only been met by one other PD-1 targeting agent,"" said Israel Lowy, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President, Translational and Clinical Sciences, Oncology at Regeneron. ""With this FDA approval, Libtayo can expand its role as a key treatment option for advanced non-small lung cancer, in addition to serving as a standard-of-care for two advanced non-melanoma skin cancers. We are committed to investigating Libtayo through ongoing trials as a monotherapy and as a backbone of combination treatments in multiple cancers. We thank the many investigators, patients and their families who have participated in our pivotal trials.""Efficacy in EMPOWER-Lung 3 was assessed in 466 patients who were randomized 2:1 to receive either Libtayo 350 mg (n=312) or placebo (n=154) intravenously every 3 weeks, plus histology-specific platinum-doublet chemotherapy. The trial was stopped early based on a recommendation by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee after the Libtayo combination demonstrated a significant improvement in overall survival (OS), the primary endpoint. Efficacy results comparing the Libtayo combination to chemotherapy alone showed a:22-month median OS versus 13 months, representing a 29% relative reduction in the risk of death (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.53 to 0.93; p=0.014). The 12-month probability of survival was 66% for the Libtayo combination versus 56% for chemotherapy, per Kaplan-Meier estimates.8-month median PFS versus 5 months, representing a 44% reduction in the risk of disease progression (HR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.44 to 0.70; p&lt;0.0001). The 12-month probability of PFS for the Libtayo combination was 38% versus 16% for chemotherapy.43% overall response rate versus 23%.16-month median DOR (range: 2 to 19+) versus 7 months (range: 2 to 19+).Safety was assessed in 312 patients in the Libtayo combination group (median duration of exposure: 38 weeks) and 153 patients in the chemotherapy group (median duration of exposure: 21 weeks). The most common adverse reactions occurring in &gt;15% of patients  were alopecia (37% Libtayo combination, 43% placebo), musculoskeletal pain (30% Libtayo combination, 36% placebo), nausea (25% Libtayo combination, 16% placebo), fatigue (23% Libtayo combination, 18% placebo), peripheral neuropathy (23% Libtayo combination, 19% placebo) and decreased appetite (17% Libtayo combination, 12% placebo). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 25% of patients, with treatment discontinuations due to adverse reactions in 5% and fatal adverse reactions in 6%. No new Libtayo safety signals were observed.""The approval of Libtayo in the combination setting builds on the monotherapy indication in advanced non-small cell lung cancer and furthers our excitement for what's to come as we continue our potentially transformative oncology research,"" said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron. ""Libtayo is the backbone of our oncology strategy, designed to synergistically combine multiple modalities to provide more options for more patients. We look forward to delivering on the promise of our research in other meaningful combinations that leverage Libtayo and our homegrown pipeline of investigational bispecific antibodies.""""We welcome this latest approval for Libtayo as a first-line combination treatment for appropriate patients with advanced lung cancer,"" said Andrea Ferris, President and CEO at the LUNGevity Foundation. ""Lung cancer remains one of the most common cancers worldwide, and every new treatment option is an important step forward against this deadly cancer.""About Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. In recent years, more than 236,000 and 2.2 million annual new cases have been diagnosed in the U.S. and globally, respectively. Approximately 84% of all lung cancers are NSCLC, with 75% of these cases diagnosed in advanced stages. Additionally, 70% of all NSCLC cases will have &lt;50% PD-L1 expression, making it the most common treatment setting.About LibtayoLibtayo is a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1 on T-cells and was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology. By binding to PD-1, Libtayo has been shown to block cancer cells from using the PD-1 pathway to suppress T-cell activation. In the U.S. and other countries Libtayo is indicated in certain patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC), advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) and advanced NSCLC, as well as in advanced cervical cancer in Canada and Brazil. As of July 1, 2022, Libayo is developed and marketed globally by Regeneron.In the U.S., the generic name for Libtayo in its approved indications is cemiplimab-rwlc, with rwlc as the suffix designated in accordance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by the FDA. Outside of the U.S., the generic name of Libtayo in its approved indication is cemiplimab.The extensive clinical program for Libtayo is focused on difficult-to-treat cancers. Libtayo is currently being investigated in trials as a monotherapy, as well as in combination with either conventional or novel therapeutic approaches for other solid tumors and blood cancers. These potential uses are investigational, and their safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. FDA-approved IndicationsLibtayo is a prescription medicine used to treat:People with a type of skin cancer called advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) that has spread or cannot be cured by surgery or radiation.People with a type of skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma (BCC):Adults with a type of lung cancer called NSCLC:It is not known if Libtayo is safe and effective in children.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR U.S. PATIENTSWhat is the most important information I should know about LibtayoLIBTAYO is a medicine that may treat certain cancers by working with your immune system.

(NASDAQ:CSCO) Shares Could Be 38% Below Their Intrinsic Value Estimate",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-systems-inc-nasdaq-csco-120009840.html,1667995209,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) as an investment opportunity by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Cisco Systems Step By Step Through The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$15.8bUS$16.7bUS$16.6bUS$16.3bUS$17.0bUS$17.2bUS$17.4bUS$17.6bUS$17.9bUS$18.2bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x8Analyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 0.91%Est @ 1.23%Est @ 1.46%Est @ 1.61%Est @ 1.72% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.2% US$14.7kUS$14.5kUS$13.4kUS$12.3kUS$12.0kUS$11.3kUS$10.7kUS$10.1kUS$9.6kUS$9.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$118bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$18b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.2%– 2.0%) = US$353bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$353b÷ ( 1 + 7.2%)10= US$176bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$293b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$44.6, the company appears quite good value at a 38% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Cisco Systems as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.026. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 5 Best Technology Dividend Stocks To Buy. Dividend investing has come to limelight again in 2022 as the broader market suffered a massive downturn which is expected to last well into 2023. Investors are looking for high-dividend stocks that are also reliable and have safe and secure dividend payments. The Federal Reserve is continuing to increase interest rates to control inflation. These rate hikes could result in job losses in the near future. Equities are also taking a beating and they are not expected to recover anytime soon. This has created a lot of uncertainty in the market, especially among average investors with budget constraints. They want to avoid investing in tech growth stocks but at the same time don’t want to just keep the cash in their accounts. Dividend investing is one of the best ways to park your cash given you choose dividend stocks carefully.According to a CNBC article, Sam Stovall, the chief investment strategist at CFRA research, believes that dividend stocks reduce the overall volatility and provide a “cushion to offset price declines.” The CNBC report cites data to back this claim. As of September, the S&amp;P 500 was down about 23% year to date. On the other hand, the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index was down just about 5% in the same period. This shows that dividend stocks can easily offset the market volatility.Stovall also highlighted the importance of dividend reinvestment plans. The analyst said that reinvested dividends account for a whopping 33% of the total returns of the S&amp;P 500 since 1945 through September. This data point shows that dividend stocks do not only perform when the market conditions are tough. Wise investors have been enjoying the compounding effect of their dividend income in all market cycles. The analyst, according to CNBC, said that dividend investing can improve “your performance by a third without doing anything.”Story continuesThis compounding effect becomes more notable if we change the time period to calculate the returns of reinvested dividends. The CNBC article said that the S&amp;P 500 has gained 1,455% since 1988. This would mean that if you invested $10,000 in 1988, your invested amount would now be about $155,500. But if you take into account reinvested dividends, your $10,000 would be $329,000. This is the power of compounding. Investors can offset risks and also earn stable income by investing in solid dividend stocks.Photo by Alexandr Bormotin on UnsplashMethodologyFor this article we picked tech dividend stock with decent yields and solid dividend history. These companies not only offer stable income but can also see a boost in their share prices once the market starts to rebound. These companies have long-term growth catalysts and they are also popular among the 895 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey as of the end of the second quarter of this year.Best Technology Dividend Stocks To Buy10. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is quickly gaining popularity as a strong dividend-paying company in the technology sector. Apple is one of those rare stocks that offer both long-term share appreciation opportunities as well as a stable dividend income. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has increased its dividend consistently for the last 9 years. Apple stock recently jumped close to 9% after the company posted upbeat quarterly results, defying skeptics who were forecasting weak iPhone sales data. Dan Ives of investment firm Wedbush said in a note that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) proved to be ""the one bright spot"" in an otherwise ""horror show week"" of tech earnings.Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the ninth most popular stock in the database of 895 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey as of the end of the second quarter. Among the major hedge funds which have been enjoying stable dividend income from the company include Warren Buffett’s Berkshire and Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management.Here is what Wedgewood Partners specifically said about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) grew revenues +5% (foreign exchange adjusted and excluding Russia) driven by record iPhone revenues that were up about +3% on an exceptional year ago comparison of +50%. Apple’s installed base is over 1.8 billion devices which helps drive a software and services business that has generated almost $80 billion of revenue over the past 4 quarters. As we have highlighted in the past, Apple’s relentless focus on the development and integration between hardware (especially ICs) as well as software, continues to add significant value for customers of its products and services. We expect this favorable competitive dynamic to continue for the foreseeable future.”9. Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI)Massachusetts-based Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) is a semiconductor company that specializes in signal conversion, data processing and power management technologies. Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) has a dividend yield of 2.1% as of October 29. In February, the company upped its dividend by a whopping 10%. This marked the19th increase in dividend from the company in the past 18 years.In October, Citi analyst Christopher Danely said in a note to investors that Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) is expected to be one of the outperformers during the current downturn that he thinks is the worst ""in at least a decade."" The analyst thinks the downturn is affecting “every company and end market” including Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) but said the company’s management is honest about the effects of the downturn and is taking steps to prepare the company for the possible problems. He has a $195 price target on Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI).Here is what Madison Funds has to say about Analog Devices, Inc. in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“At its 2017 investor day, Analog Device’s VP of Automotive, Mark Gill, described how the company’s content on well-equipped electric vehicles was $600 per car compared to $250 per car for the traditional 2017 internal combustion engine car. Since then, Analog has highlighted the success of its EV battery management systems (BMS) product nearly every quarter. The BMS product is hardware and software that manages the power into and out of the battery systems. It’s the brains of the operation. Analog says it’s on its fifth generation BMS product, that it has the no. 1 market share in high voltage products, and that it is on 5 of the top 10 selling EVs. While we think that the BMS product is just 1 to 1.5% of Analog’s product mix, we think that it could add nearly a point of revenue growth per year to the company’s top-line given the expected ramp in EV production. This is a material amount of growth atop an already nicely growing company revenue line.”8. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is one of the best technology dividend stocks. The semiconductor and infrastructure software company has been increasing its dividend consistently for over a decade now.In October, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya reiterated a Buy rating on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock along with several other peers, adding that the group will benefit from an increase in cloud spending despite the current industry headwinds. The analyst specifically mentioned the Tomahawk 5 switch of Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) for the expected strength. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) has a relatively high dividend yield in the tech sector, coming in at 3.4% as of October 29.As of the end of the second quarter, 66 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), compared to 71 funds in the previous quarter. Ken Fisher’s hedge fund was the biggest stakeholder in the company at the end of June with a $716 million stake.Here is what Carillon Tower Advisers specifically said about Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Tech stocks, including Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), were one of the hardest-hit sectors due to fears over a weakening macroeconomic environment. Broadcom, however, outperformed semiconductor peers as its end-market exposures provided relatively more defensive characteristics.”7. Comtech Telecommunications Corp. (NASDAQ:CMTL)Comtech (NASDAQ:CMTL) is a relatively unknown tech stock which is trading at around $11 as of October 29. However, the stock’s dividend yield stands at 3.68%. In September, Comtech (NASDAQ:CMTL) announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share. This was the forty-ninth consecutive quarterly dividend by the company.

(NASDAQ:CSCO).Here is what Carillon Eagle Growth &amp; Income Fund has to say about Cisco Systems, Inc.

In 2017, Cisco launched a 5-year, $10 million partnership with Mercy Corps called Technology for Impact. Our goal was to help Mercy Corps use technology to deliver humanitarian aid faster, more efficiently, and to more people.When crisis strikes, upending households and their sense of stability, the security in knowing that basic needs will still be met is a critical first step in resiliency. At the intersection of humanitarian assistance, innovation, and development, Mercy Corps, Mercy Corps Ventures, and Sempo co-developed a digital basic needs wallet (BNW) that allows users to redeem digital cash in exchange for basic goods such as rice, maize, flour, cooking oil, and soap at participating retailers and vendors. The BNW technology utilizes near-field communication (NFC), which is a short-range wireless connection that enables two devices to communicate, similarly to how a credit card machine can read a chip. Through NFC-enabled phones and e-voucher cards, the team was able to retain a record of the value of redeemed items as well as the purchases participants made in an online platform accessible by Mercy Corps and Sempo staff.From February to June 2022, Mercy Corps, Mercy Corps Ventures, and Sempo piloted the tool in Kampala, Uganda as part of the Technology for Impact (T4I) partnership with Cisco. The pilot is indicative of a shared vision to advance humanitarian programming through the ethical and responsible application of frontier technologies. The design and implementation of BNW sought to address long standing barriers present within financial inclusion programming. With traditional cash assistance, approval processes and manual verification of identification can often hinder the ability to deliver aid in a timely manner. BNW is a collaborative intervention intended to increase efficiencies for cash assistance, enabling program participants to access their immediate basic needs with fewer barriers. 63.5% of the participants were refugees, underscoring the urgency of timely, effective, and transparent aid delivery in the path towards resilience. The remaining 36.4% of participants were from Ugandan host communities also impacted by economic and food insecurity. Based on insights from qualitative interviews with participants, as well as a quantitative account of how the pilot performed relative to its indicators of success, the pilot has yielded critical insights on how to optimize cash programming through digital means.Story continuesWho BNW Supported - In Numbers:250 households redeemed the equivalent of 360,000 UGX (about 97 USD) per month on basic items at participating vendorsThe average household supported had 5 membersThere were 1,315 program participants (722 female, 593 male)80% of participants' basic needs wallet was redeemed for food with around 20% left to redeem for mobile money to cover other expensesHelping Households CopeHousehold costs often far exceed what household members are able to earn on a monthly basis. Securing food, shelter, transportation, utilities, and other bills has only become more difficult as the price of goods, such as firewood, continue to increase. For Robert, a participant, breaking beyond poverty begins with feeling strengthened:""Before being supported by the program, our family situation was not good. But now it is much better. We have enough food for the household, and now I have the strength to stand up and walk around because I feel much stronger.""A leg injury has kept him home, requiring his wife to do informal work with earnings of 5,000 - 10,000 UGX (1.35 - 2.70 USD) per day. With 500,000 UGX (135 USD) in expenses facing their household each month, her earnings are just a drop in the bucket. By covering the costs of food, BNW was successful in removing a key financial burden for this vulnerable household.Establishing food security also proved to be beneficial for the matriarch of another household. She remarked to our team, ""we no longer lack food, and it feels like someone still cares despite all the problems we have."" Kahindo, another program participant, noted that BNW afforded an extra meal for his entire household:""Before the program, we would have a light meal before supper (porridge), but now we can have two full meals."" Despite the program's success in improving food security, participants encountered some challenges that are worth understanding in order to optimize cash assistance in aid delivery.Lessons For the Future of BNWFor increased usability and uptake, participants need more freedom in using BNW. Some participants remarked that the location of retailers and vendors who accepted BNW were not always located near their household. In some instances, participants would travel lengthy distances to redeem their digital wallet only to find that the store was closed or the vendor was out for the day, leaving them without essential resources.Participants also noted that the redemption windows need to be longer to ensure users have an adequate amount of time to redeem the wallet. Similarly, the option to cash out remaining balances of up to 150,000 UGX (40.50 USD) to cover other expenses such as rent, utilities, or medical bills was a benefit to households but could sometimes take longer than expected as some participants were unreachable on the phone as they had either changed their number or submitted a family member or friend's phone number to be used for mobile money transfers.The predetermined list of basic needs did not always neatly fit the specific needs of a household. Many participants expressed the desire for more options, from culturally-relevant food items for refugee families, to water pumps for families struggling to access certain commodities at home. Also, the rising price of items made digital redemptions a less appealing option than traditional cash. One household noted that using cash allows for bargaining power. With an e-voucher, there is no opportunity to bargain the price.These observations and insights illuminate a core theme of importance for participants: increased agency enables households to make the best decisions to urgently address their unique situations. Such improvements to flexibility should be pursued to further support households in coping with shocks to their finances and overall sense of stability.ConclusionAlthough humanitarians and development practitioners are exploring innovations in digital cash assistance, traditional cash has not lost its relevance. Just 45% of participants indicated a preference for digital cash versus traditional cash after being introduced to BNW. Mobile money (MoMo) remains a preference with just 48% of participants preferring BNW to MoMo. These performance metrics reflect the state of digital cash assistance in humanitarian response today: a promising innovation with the potential to reach vulnerable populations, yet one which requires community buy-in to be embraced fully. For participants, the predetermined list of redeemable items when using BNW or other e-vouchers can feel limiting. For humanitarians, BNW performed well in addressing a common pressing need: food security.With the prevalence and accessibility of MoMo, it currently remains the more appealing option for participants over BNW. Likewise, traditional cash is still preferred as it grants more freedom in buying from a vendor of their choosing, increasing bargaining power in transactions, and having more agency in deciding what to spend money on as it relates to which needs are most pressing.Overall, BNW yielded a 56% reduction in the time spent initiating and completing cash transfer to participants. This reduction in timing fulfills one of the main intended targets of the program and signals a promising future for innovating digital solutions to ensure that humanitarian and development programming can offer support to those in need with deliberate speed and efficiency.The Technology for Development (T4D) team supported the Mercy Corps Uganda Team in the delivery of this pilot through partnership with Cisco, under a 5-year program aimed at using technology to deliver aid and development assistance faster, better, and to more people.Learn more about Cisco's partnership with Mercy CorpsView original content hereView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: http://csr.cisco.com/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/724537/Mercy-Corps-Digital-Solutions-for-Basic-Needs]"
