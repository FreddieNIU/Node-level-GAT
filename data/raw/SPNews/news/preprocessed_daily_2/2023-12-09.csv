If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on retiring early, you may go to 5 States with Lowest Average Retirement Age in the US.', 'Examining the March 2022 Current Population Survey by the U.S. Census Bureau reveals an important detail: Social Security is helping lift 15.4 million individuals aged 65 and above, out of poverty. However, given the shaky future of these funds, policymakers are adamant on pushing Social Security’s Full Retirement Age (FRA) to 70 and beyond. As per the proposal, individuals born in 1978 or later would experience a full retirement age of 70.', 'The retiring of the Baby Boomer generation is, in large part, to blame for this retirement crisis. With this generation leaving the workforce by the droves, both Social Security and Medicare are under immense stress. The simultaneous decrease in the workforce, coupled with an increased demand for healthcare and pension benefits, is further creating a precarious imbalance. As a result, policymakers face the daunting challenge of ensuring that these social safety nets remain sustainable, facing backlash in the process.', ""The US, however, isn't the only country that has been proposing to increase its retirement age. As of 2020, the average retirement age in the world was equal to 64.2 years for men and 63.4 years for women. According to the OECD, numerous developed countries with aging demographics are expected to witness a two-year rise in the average effective retirement age by the mid-2060s. Currently, the full retirement age in the USA is 67 for those born in 1960 and later. At this age, workers are entitled to receive 100% of the benefits that they have earned. However, provided the FRA is pushed to 70, new retirees will have their average lifetime benefits cut by nearly 20%."", ""Regardless, there are many people who choose to retire before the full retirement age. According to The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), the magic number needed to last a comfortable retirement is $1.8 million. However, Credit Karma notes that 27% of seniors aged 59 or older have no retirement savings at all. Having zero savings is a major reason many retirees don’t wait until the full retirement age. A Schroders study backs up this claim, stating that 36% of those surveyed said that they'd need the money way before they turn 70. Unsurprisingly, 44% are also of the view that the funds won't last so it's better to grab what's left."", 'As such, retirees are witnessing a new strategy to work for themselves post-retirement. According to a study by T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TROW), many retirees are choosing to work part-time as part of their transition strategy. This is, in fact, a brilliant money move baby boomers are making in retirement. The study reveals that 57% of retirees wish to continue working in some form after retirement, as opposed to the 43% who wish to stop working once and for all.', '""Many retirees either choose to work or need work to be included in their retirement lifestyle. The decision can have many powerful positive effects, not least of which is financial well-being.”', '- Judith Ward, CFP®, a thought leadership director at T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TROW).', ""Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TROW) also notes in their survey that out of those individuals who consider themselves retired, 20% work either full-time or part-time, and 7% are reportedly looking for work. However, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) informs retirees that returning to work after retirement can temporarily reduce social security benefits and Medicare. The benefits are recalculated and credit is provided for the months in which the benefit wasn't received."", 'With the average retirement age in the US being 64 years, those retirees who think they’ve made a mistake by retiring early and settling for a smaller social security check, there is another way out. In such a case, individuals who have taken their benefits early at a reduced rate can pay back to the government and start later with a higher payout, notes The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW).', 'While discussions on proposals to raise the retirement age persist, many seniors are still opting for early retirement due to insufficient savings, health concerns, and various other factors. On that note, let’s check out where retirees, on average, are retiring the earliest.', 'Sean Pavone/Shutterstock.com', 'To compile the list of states with the lowest average retirement age in the US, we began by listing out all the states along with their average retirement ages.

This is especially true as ETFs with low expense ratios significantly outperform their expensive counterparts when other factors remain constant. This can be explained by the following example (see: all the ETFs with Low Expense Ratios here).Consider two funds with expense ratios of 0.10% and 0.50% and invest $10,000 in both. Now, both funds have delivered the same annual returns of 10% in 10 years. The fund with an expense ratio of 0.10% will grow to $25,703 in 10 years, while the same fund with a 0.50% expense ratio will grow by a lower amount of $24,782. Further, the difference in total returns (after expenses) becomes more significant if we increase the holding period. The same funds with an expense ratio of 0.10% and 0.50%, when invested for 30 years, would have a value of $169,797 and $152,203, respectively, after 30 years.Keeping the importance of the expense ratio in mind, we have highlighted the 25 cheapest ETFs currently on the market, which have an AUM of more than $50 million:BNY Mellon US Large Cap Core Equity ETF (BKLC) – Expense ratio: 0.00%BNY Mellon US Large Cap Core Equity ETF provides investors with broad exposure to large-capitalization stocks and tracks the Solactive GBS Unites States 500 Index TR.

(NASDAQ:TXN) in my portfolio for a while. I originally bought the company as a hedge against the more severe geopolitical risks associated with an investment in semiconductor behemoth Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM). However, I wanted to understand more about the business as I consider increasing my exposure to the semiconductor space in the coming months. Therefore, I performed a deep dive to discover more intricacies that make the company stand out.', 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with TXN.', 'The global semiconductor company designs, manufactures and sells integrated circuits, embedded processors and other components.', 'Semiconductors are a vital ingredient in modern electronics. They are materials with electrical conductivity between a conductor, such as aluminum, and an insulator, such as glass. These components are integral in controlling the flow of electrical current and make it possible to store data, perform computations and manipulate signals.', ""According to GuruFocus, Texas Instruments' primary revenue stream is its Analog segment, bringing in 76.70% of the total income. Embedded Processing takes home 16.30% and other revenue sources 7%."", 'The Analog segment refers to products dealing with analog signals. These signals differ from digital signals, as analog signals are continuous and vary smoothly, while digital technology uses binary signals (0s and 1s) for precision and noise reduction.', 'Embedded Processing relates to specialized semiconductor chips. These are integrated into electronics and perform specific computational tasks. For example, microcontrollers are small computers on single chips found in washing machines, microwaves and automobiles, among other devices.', 'The other revenue streams include a range of products and services. However, here are the top three I have found:', 'Digital Signal Processing: processors for efficiently manipulating digital signals in audio, telecommunications and digital images.', 'Educational Technology: graphing calculators have been a successful revenue stream for Texas Instruments.', 'Power Management: semiconductor products for regulating and distributing power for electronic devices.', ""Looking at the company's geographic revenue diversification is equally fascinating. GuruFocus shows us that 33% of the revenue comes from the U.S. and 24% from China."", ""I find it particularly interesting to compare this to Taiwan Semiconductor's revenue diversification. Of these, 66% come from the U.S. and only 10.8% from China. Partly, I think this is due to the tailored operations of Taiwan Semiconductor as opposed to Texas Instruments' analog and embedded processing segments. The company is particularly useful for advanced semiconductor manufacturing driven by some of the biggest technology companies in the world, most based in the U.S., including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). In comparison, Texas Instruments does not specifically cater to these companies, but focuses on a larger market of various industries and sectors."", 'On that note, Taiwan Semiconductor is not a direct competitor to Texas Instruments as it is a semiconductor foundry manufacturing chips designed by major technology players. Texas Instruments, on the other hand, designs and manufactures its semiconductor products. This contrast can be most powerfully divided as such: Taiwan Semiconductor is a foundry service, while Texas Instruments is an integrated device manufacturer.', 'Instead, the three most prominent competitors to Texas Instruments based on my analysis (and there are many) are:', 'Analog Devices Inc.

Most notably, Texas Instrumens has a vast portfolio of products that treat the needs of various industries. This is a crucial differentiator from some of its main competitors. In addition, the company can produce 300 millimeter wafers, which significantly lowers costs. Highly efficient production such as this allows for scalability and keeps supply flowing to demand.', ""However, the company's research and development spending of between 8% and 10% of total revenue over the past few years is lower than its major competitors. For comparison, Analog Devices currently has 13.5% R&D spending, Qualcomm 24.6% and NXP 17.5%. This could leave Texas Instruments behind over the long term if other companies advance at higher rates due to deeper research on core advanced technologies driving revenue growth. In the semiconductor industry, advanced knowledge and technological capabilities are paramount in the race for better, faster, more attractive products."", ""The GF Score of 93 out of 100 for Texas Instruments presents a favorable picture for investors. The strongest aspects of the chart are growth and profitability; interestingly, the company's value is rated as less strong. Let's have a look at why."", ""The company's gross margins are almost 65%, which boils down to 44% for operating margin and only a 5% decrease to a 39% net margin. Those are very high figures. For reference, the company's operating margin is in the top 2% of companies in the semiconductor industry."", ""Texas Instruments' 300mm wafer technology is a significant factor causing higher margins. This is because larger wafers mean more chips produced on a single wafer, decreasing the cost of chip production. The company also focuses explicitly on high-margin products from analog and embedded processing segments, and vertically integrating manufacturing to distribution reduces third-party spending. In my opinion, the company has a shrewd, efficient business model."", ""While the company's three-year revenue growth rate is 12.7%, which is only better than 51% of companies in the semiconductor industry, the growth rates are still relatively stable and strong, moving up consistently over time."", ""I think the company's revenue growth rates could be stronger. I am a shareholder because the company presents compelling operational advantages and significant semiconductor exposure. To me, it is the margins that really shine, and those have grown significantly from 32.4% in December 2014 to 51.9% in December 2022."", 'While the GF Value rank suggests a score of 6 out of 10, some compelling points to the valuation make the company a stable, well-valued investment.', ""For instance, while the company's forward price-earnings ratio is relatively high at almost 24 and it has a price-to-tangible book value of nearly 12 (in the bottom 7% of semiconductor companies), it performs well on a discounted cash flow analysis."", ""Given that the organization has a 10-year average annual earnings per share without non-recurring items growth rate of 17.5%, computing this into GuruFocus' DCF calculator gives us a wonderful 23% margin of safety. This makes up for the inferior book value and meager price-earnings ratio."", 'Texas Instruments is essential to my portfolio because it provides semiconductor exposure without the geopolitical risk associated with Taiwan Semiconductor.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Thus, you can purchase Range Resources' shares before the 14th of December in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 29th of December."", ""The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.08 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$0.32 per share to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Range Resources has a trailing yield of approximately 1.1% on its current stock price of $29.7. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to investigate whether Range Resources can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Range Resources ', 'If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Range Resources is paying out just 5.7% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Range Resources generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. Luckily it paid out just 9.6% of its free cash flow last year.', ""It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. That's why it's comforting to see Range Resources's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 33% per annum for the past five years. Range Resources looks like a real growth company, with earnings per share growing at a cracking pace and the company reinvesting most of its profits in the business."", ""Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Range Resources has lifted its dividend by approximately 7.2% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders."", ""From a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Range Resources? Range Resources has grown its earnings per share while simultaneously reinvesting in the business. Unfortunately it's cut the dividend at least once in the past 10 years, but the conservative payout ratio makes the current dividend look sustainable. Range Resources looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely."", ""In light of that, while Range Resources has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. For example, we've found 3 warning signs for Range Resources (1 is potentially serious!) that deserve your attention before investing in the shares."", ""If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks."", 'Have feedback on this article?

Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad."", ""If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in PVH (NYSE:PVH). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it."", ' Check out our latest analysis for PVH ', ""Over the last three years, PVH has grown earnings per share (EPS) at as impressive rate from a relatively low point, resulting in a three year percentage growth rate that isn't particularly indicative of expected future performance. Thus, it makes sense to focus on more recent growth rates, instead. PVH's EPS shot up from US$6.80 to US$8.78; a result that's bound to keep shareholders happy. That's a commendable gain of 29%."", ""One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. While we note PVH achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 2.8% to US$9.2b. That's a real positive."", ""The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. For finer detail, click on the image."", ""Fortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of PVH's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting."", ""We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$6.3b company like PVH. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they hold US$29m worth of its stock. That's a lot of money, and no small incentive to work hard. Despite being just 0.5% of the company, the value of that investment is enough to show insiders have plenty riding on the venture."", ""If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into PVH's strong EPS growth. This EPS growth rate is something the company should be proud of, and so it's no surprise that insiders are holding on to a considerable chunk of shares. On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research. Of course, just because PVH is growing does not mean it is undervalued. If you're wondering about the valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry."", 'The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

Other healthcare spinoffs from larger companies include GE shedding its health group and Johnson & Johnson breaking off its consumer health brands into an independent company. 3M also plans to spin off its healthcare business in the first half of next year.', 'Critical care is Edwards’ third-largest business unit, trailing TAVR, which makes up the majority of the company’s revenue, and surgical structural heart. The business brought in $855 million in sales in 2022 and has brought in $677.6 million in the first three quarters of 2023.', 'Critical care develops and sells patient monitoring products for hospital settings, such as the operating room (OR) and intensive care units. Its products include monitoring platforms, sensors and catheters, as well as predictive software and apps. Edwards hopes to expand critical care’s monitoring and software capabilities and grow the number of patients for which the technology is used.', 'Katie Szyman, who has been corporate vice president of critical care since 2015, will become CEO of the new company when the move is complete. Szyman told analysts at the investor event that the critical care unit has grown since its inception, differentiating itself from the company’s main focus of cardiac procedures and implantable devices.', ""“Critical care originally was cardiac surgery OR and intensive care unit patients. Now we're really broad OR, intensive care for all types of patients. And now, we're looking to go even beyond that,” Szyman said. “So, the patient groups are diverging more and more.”"", 'Szyman added that pathways for device authorization are also different, with critical care using the 510(k) process “versus implantable devices that take a lot longer.”', 'CFO Scott Ullem was not specific on how Edwards would benefit from the spinoff and what the new company would look like standing alone. Ullem explained that the remaining company should “go up,” as critical care’s gross and operating margins are lower than Edwards’ consolidated margins.', ""“But we're not going to quantify any of that right now,” Ullem said. “Over the next six months, we'll do a lot of work around the numbers and putting together pro-formas and then, ultimately, culminating in a submission of a Form 10 with the [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission] mid-year next year. And that's a point at which we'll be able to give you a lot more detail about what this looks like.”"", 'Edwards forecast a 2024 sales range for critical care of from $900 million to $1 billion. The company expects one-time charges associated with the spinoff but no core financial impact next year.', 'J.P. Morgan analysts wrote in a note to investors that the move should allow Edwards to “focus on its core efforts in structural heart, which has long overshadowed the company’s initiatives in Critical Care. With lower growth (mid-single digits) and relatively less innovation in this segment, we think this should be well received by investors.”', 'Edwards’ 2024 financial forecast was not much of a surprise for Wall Street. The company projected TAVR sales to fall in a range of from $4 billion to $4.3 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 8% to 10%.', 'The company forecast sales for its surgical structural heart unit to grow mid-single-digits to roughly $1 billion and sales for TMTT in a range of from $280 million to $320 million.', 'Edwards expects to return to double-digit sales growth or better beginning in 2025 when excluding critical care.', 'This story was originally published on MedTech Dive.

The US labor market surged after the Covid recession in 2022. Unemployment rates went down with a surge in job creation in the market. The job growth in the market can be attributed to policy interventions such as unemployment insurance reform and economic impact payments. These initiatives facilitated a much faster recovery compared to previous economic downturns."", 'Despite the positive trajectory in the US job market, inflationary shocks continued to present a significant challenge. In 2022, payroll employment surged by 4.3% and the average nominal wage increased by 5.4%, but this growth was challenged by a significant 8% rise in inflation. Rising inflation rates resulted in a decline in real wages, ultimately affecting the living standards of most Americans. This trend of inflationary shocks is particularly concerning in states including California, Arizona, and Colorado, as they are currently experiencing the highest inflation rates in the US.', 'The United States is one of the most expensive countries in the world. With rising inflation, the cost of living has become one of the biggest challenges faced by families living in the US.

According to an article by Bloomberg, published on November 27, the price of buying the same goods and services for a family has increased to $119.27 from $100 after the pandemic. The prices in the US have surged since early 2020, surpassing levels not seen in a decade before the pandemic. Since January 2020, grocery prices have risen 25%, and rents have increased by nearly 20% in 2023. These price hikes have left the residents dissatisfied with the economy and their living standards. Housing affordability has plunged to its lowest level. Homeownership has become out of reach for many Americans, as median home prices continue to climb. These rising costs are particularly alarming in some of the US states with the highest average home prices such as Hawaii, California, and Colorado. The median home prices in these states have exceeded $700,000.', ""While many sectors struggle amidst rising costs in the US, with inflation corrupting purchasing power in the country, consumer staples companies are rather secure from such market fluctuations.

When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well.

Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 31% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio."", ""It's positive to see that Motorola Solutions's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. For this reason, we're glad to see Motorola Solutions's earnings per share have risen 16% per annum over the last five years. Earnings per share are growing rapidly and the company is keeping more than half of its earnings within the business; an attractive combination which could suggest the company is focused on reinvesting to grow earnings further. Fast-growing businesses that are reinvesting heavily are enticing from a dividend perspective, especially since they can often increase the payout ratio later."", ""The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Motorola Solutions has delivered 14% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years."", ""From a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Motorola Solutions? We love that Motorola Solutions is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. Motorola Solutions looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely."", 'With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. Our analysis shows 2 warning signs for Motorola Solutions and you should be aware of them before buying any shares.', ""Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

Anything that moves bargaining forward in a positive way is most welcome,” Fox said.', 'Workers United said the last bargaining session between the two sides was May 23.', 'Saturday marks the two-year anniversary of a Starbucks store in Buffalo, New York, voting to unionize. It was the first company-owned store to join a union in more than three decades.', 'Since then, at least 370 company-owned U.S. Starbucks stores have voted to unionize, according to the National Labor Relations Board. There are about 9,600 company-owned Starbucks stores in the U.S.', 'Workers at 19 U.S. Starbucks stores have filed petitions with the NLRB to decertify the union as the bargaining representative at their stores, but none of those stores has voted on whether to remove the union. The NLRB can delay a decertification vote if an employer refuses to bargain.', ""Unionizing workers say they're seeking higher pay, more consistent schedules and more say in issues like store safety and workload during busy times. Seattle-based Starbucks has said its stores run more efficiently if it can work directly with its employees and not through a third party."", 'But the process has been contentious. Twice, federal courts have ordered Starbucks to reinstate workers who were fired after leading unionization efforts at their stores. Regional offices of the National Labor Relations Board have issued 120 complaints against Starbucks for unfair labor practices, including refusal to bargain and reserving pay raises and other benefits for non-union workers.', 'In October, Starbucks sued Workers United in federal court, demanding it stop using the name Starbucks Workers United for the group organizing its workers after that group posted a pro-Palestinian message on social media. Workers United countersued, saying Starbucks defamed the union by suggesting it supports violence. Starbucks said Friday that lawsuit is proceeding.', 'Starbucks said Friday that its changing stance reflects its wish to support all of its employees. In her letter to Fox, Kelly pledged that the company would respect bargaining participants and refrain from disparaging conduct or language.', 'But Starbucks may also be shifting its position for business reasons. It reported record revenue in its fiscal fourth quarter, which ended in September, and its full-year revenue climbed nearly 12% to $35.9 billion.', ""But the company's stock has fallen 10% since Nov. 16, when 5,000 workers at more than 200 unionized Starbucks stores went on strike. Placer.ai, an analytics company, said that after a strong fall, U.S. holiday visits to Starbucks appear to be down from a year ago."", ""The company may also be trying to head off an effort by the Strategic Organizing Center, a labor group, to elect three pro-union candidates to Starbucks' board of directors next year.""]"

The increase can be linked to steady demand across end markets and higher order volumes. With healthy fundamentals, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company appears primed for further appreciation.', 'Higher demand from distributors and end users across the oil and gas, material handling, cars and light trucks, and farm and agriculture markets in the North American region and increasing sales in Europe and Latin America within the international region are aiding the company’s Diversified Industrial segment. The segment’s revenues increased 3.8% year over year in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended September 2023).Revenues in the Aerospace Systems segment are being buoyed by higher volume across all businesses, especially the commercial and military aftermarket businesses. In the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the Aerospace Systems’ revenues increased 64.7% year over year.PH’s unique Win Strategy, which focuses on innovation, strategic positioning, distribution growth and incentive plans to drive organic growth, is supporting its margin performance. In the first three months of fiscal 2024, the company’s adjusted EBITDA margin increased 150 basis points year over year, driven by the benefits of the Win strategy.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Parker-Hannifin has been strengthening and expanding its business through asset additions for a while. The company acquired Meggitt plc in September 2022, which expanded its presence in the UK, thus positioning it well to provide a broader suite of solutions for aircraft, and aero-engine components and systems. It is worth noting that Meggitt sales of $386 million in the fiscal first quarter aided the Aerospace Systems segment.Moreover, the company remains committed to boosting shareholders’ value by leveraging strong cash flows. In the first three months of fiscal 2024, Parker-Hannifin paid out cash dividends of $704.05 million, up 11.2% from the year-ago period. In April 2023, PH hiked its dividend by 11% to $1.48 per share (annually: $5.92).', 'The company’s effective pricing and supply-chain management actions are likely to be beneficial in the near term.

Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.', 'Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.', ""This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement.

It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', 'Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.', 'On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.', 'Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.', 'There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.', 'Should You Invest in ADM?', 'In terms of earnings estimate revisions for ADM, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $7.26.', ""Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for ADM.

Strength in the smoke-free product arena as a response to consumers’ changing preferences has also been working well for players in the industry.However, players are grappling with the impacts of the inflationary environment on Adult Tobacco Consumers’ (“ATC”) spending patterns and the elevated cost of some direct materials. However, a focus on smoke-free transformation presents solid growth prospects for companies like Philip Morris International Inc. PM, Altria Group, Inc. MO and British American Tobacco p.l.c. BTI.', 'About the Industry ', 'The Zacks Tobacco industry includes companies that manufacture and sell cigarettes as well as tobacco and nicotine-based products, such as cigars, snuffs and oral tobacco. Some companies also offer RRPs, such as e-cigarettes, vaping and heat-not-burn variants. A few of the firms are engaged in making devices and attachments needed in vaping and heat-not-burn products. Most products manufactured by the tobacco industry participants fall under the strict vigilance of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and are required to follow the permissible levels of nicotine in manufacturing. Players in this space sell products mostly through large retailers, distributors, convenience stores, drugstores, wholesalers and grocery chains. Additionally, some international tobacco firms operate in the country through subsidiaries.', '4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Tobacco Industry', 'Pricing Power: Players in the tobacco industry have been leveraging the strong pricing influence of tobacco products, which also helps them make up for high taxes and soft cigarette sales volumes. Since smokers tend to be less responsive to price hikes due to their addiction, this approach is anticipated to continue benefiting companies within the tobacco sector. Prudent pricing of cigarettes has been supporting revenues of players in the tobacco industry in the face of declining volumes.Smoke-Free Products Gain Prominence: Rising health consciousness and stringent government regulations aimed at reducing cigarette smoking have driven many consumers toward reduced-risk products (RRPs) or smoke-free alternatives. These products are promoted as having a less adverse impact on health due to their scientific composition and way of consumption. An increasing number of consumers are turning to these alternatives as a means to quit smoking traditional cigarettes. Major players in the tobacco industry have been allocating resources to expand their presence in this category, including investing in innovations to make these products more user-friendly and energy-efficient. Companies have been experiencing significant revenue growth in the RRP or smoke-free product space. Notably, Philip Morris and British American Tobacco have been proactively working towards transitioning into predominantly smoke-free companies in the coming years. The resilience of these products is likely to continue delivering favorable outcomes for industry participants as they undergo business transformations.', 'Cigarette Volume Trends: The cigarette industry is grappling with the challenges posed by the inflationary environment, which has influenced consumer spending habits. Given the ever-changing external landscape, economic factors like inflation, increased interest rates, global supply-chain hurdles and ATC dynamics, such as purchasing patterns, the adoption of smoke-free products and disposable income, are likely to impact cigarette sales volumes. Further, cigarette volumes have been affected by strict government regulations pertaining to sales, marketing and manufacturing. Such regulatory norms are imposed due to health hazards caused by the consumption of nicotine. Some guidelines issued by the FDA include the mandatory use of precautionary labels on cigarette packets and self-critical advertisements. As cigarette sales constitute a significant portion of revenue for tobacco industry companies, the decrease in sales volumes within this category raises concerns.Inflationary Cost Pressures: The performance of numerous industry participants has been adversely affected by cost inflation. Global inflationary challenges linked to essential materials such as tobacco leaf, energy, and labor costs have been a worry. Elevated expenses related to the research, development, and marketplace activities of smoke-free products further present risks to profit margins.', 'Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid Prospects', 'The Zacks Tobacco industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector.

The company has grappled with the 2020 commodity price crash, leading to substantial spending cuts. Concerns include high sensitivity to oil prices and a 10-year reserve replacement ratio of 100%, indicating challenges in replenishing produced energy. Considering all these factors, investors are advised to wait for a better entry point.Nevertheless, Chevron is positioned as one of the top global integrated oil firms, set for sustainable production growth, particularly due to its dominant position in the lucrative Permian Basin. Further, the recent acquisition of Hess Corp. is expected to significantly strengthen Chevron's presence in oil-rich Guyana.(You can read the full research report on Chevron here >>>)Shares of SAP have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the year-to-date period (+56.3% vs. +55.2%). The company’s performance is benefiting from continued strength in its cloud business (especially the new Rise with SAP and Grow with SAP solutions) across all regions.Momentum in SAP’s business technology platform, particularly the S/4HANA solution along with opportunities presented by proliferation of generative AI bode well. Management also reaffirmed its 2023 guidance as well as its long-term targets. Frequent product launches, and strategic acquisitions and collaborations are other tailwinds.However, continued softness in the Software license and support business segment coupled with global macroeconomic weakness and geopolitical instability remain concerning. Also, increasing research & development costs, and stiff competition in the cloud space are headwinds.(You can read the full research report on SAP here >>>)Shares of United Parcel Service have underperformed the Zacks Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo industry over the past year (-8.4% vs. +6.7%). The company now expects revenues in 2023 to be between $91.3-$92.3 billion. The new forecast is not only below the previous outlook of around $93 billion but also much lower than 2022's actual figure.Management trimmed its revenue forecast for the full year due to weak e-commerce delivery demand and lost clients during the turbulent labor negotiations. The five-year deal with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters for better pay and working conditions is worth less than $30 billion. It is likely to keep labor cost at high levels.UPS is looking to drive growth in this uncertain scenario by improving efficiencies.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Accordingly, Leggett & Platt investors that purchase the stock on or after the 14th of December will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 12th of January."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.46 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$1.84 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Leggett & Platt has a trailing yield of 7.0% on the current share price of $26.17. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Leggett & Platt's dividend is reliable and sustainable. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing."", ' View our latest analysis for Leggett & Platt ', 'Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Leggett & Platt paid out 115% of profit in the past year, which we think is typically not sustainable unless there are mitigating characteristics such as unusually strong cash flow or a large cash balance. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It distributed 50% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.', ""It's good to see that while Leggett & Platt's dividends were not covered by profits, at least they are affordable from a cash perspective. Still, if the company repeatedly paid a dividend greater than its profits, we'd be concerned. Very few companies are able to sustainably pay dividends larger than their reported earnings."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Companies with falling earnings are riskier for dividend shareholders. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. Readers will understand then, why we're concerned to see Leggett & Platt's earnings per share have dropped 5.8% a year over the past five years. Such a sharp decline casts doubt on the future sustainability of the dividend."", ""The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Leggett & Platt has delivered 4.7% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. The only way to pay higher dividends when earnings are shrinking is either to pay out a larger percentage of profits, spend cash from the balance sheet, or borrow the money. Leggett & Platt is already paying out 115% of its profits, and with shrinking earnings we think it's unlikely that this dividend will grow quickly in the future."", ""Is Leggett & Platt an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? It's not a great combination to see a company with earnings in decline and paying out 115% of its profits, which could imply the dividend may be at risk of being cut in the future. Yet cashflow was much stronger, which makes us wonder if there are some large timing issues in Leggett & Platt's cash flows, or perhaps the company has written down some assets aggressively, reducing its income. Bottom line: Leggett & Platt has some unfortunate characteristics that we think could lead to sub-optimal outcomes for dividend investors."", ""Although, if you're still interested in Leggett & Platt and want to know more, you'll find it very useful to know what risks this stock faces.

(NYSE:AIG) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Accordingly, American International Group investors that purchase the stock on or after the 13th of December will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 28th of December."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.36 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$1.44 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, American International Group stock has a trailing yield of around 2.2% on the current share price of $65.53. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. As a result, readers should always check whether American International Group has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut."", ' View our latest analysis for American International Group ', 'If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation.

If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. It's encouraging to see American International Group has grown its earnings rapidly, up 47% a year for the past five years."", ""Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. American International Group has delivered 14% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it."", ""From a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid American International Group? When companies are growing rapidly and retaining a majority of the profits within the business, it's usually a sign that reinvesting earnings creates more value than paying dividends to shareholders. This is one of the most attractive investment combinations under this analysis, as it can create substantial value for investors over the long run. American International Group ticks a lot of boxes for us from a dividend perspective, and we think these characteristics should mark the company as deserving of further attention."", ""While it's tempting to invest in American International Group for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved.

Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine."", ""We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you."", ' View our latest analysis for Public Service Enterprise Group ', ""We have to calculate the value of Public Service Enterprise Group slightly differently to other stocks because it is a integrated utilities company. In this approach dividends per share (DPS) are used, as free cash flow is difficult to estimate and often not reported by analysts. This often underestimates the value of a stock, but it can still be good as a comparison to competitors. The 'Gordon Growth Model' is used, which simply assumes that dividend payments will continue to increase at a sustainable growth rate forever. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a company's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In this case we used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%). The expected dividend per share is then discounted to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.2%. Compared to the current share price of US$62.4, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out."", 'Value Per Share = Expected Dividend Per Share / (Discount Rate - Perpetual Growth Rate)', '= US$2.4 / (6.2% – 2.2%)', '= US$61.2', ""Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Public Service Enterprise Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business."", 'Strength', 'Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.', 'Debt is well covered by earnings.', 'Weakness', 'Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Integrated Utilities market.', 'Opportunity', 'Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.', 'Threat', 'Debt is not well covered by operating cash flow.', 'Dividends are not covered by cash flow.', 'Annual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.', ""Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

To skip the detailed analysis of the semiconductor industry, go directly to the 5 Best Semiconductor Stocks According to Billionaires.', 'The semiconductor industry is arguably one of the most important segments of the market. It is the backbone of our modern digital era. Our society’s dependence on electronic devices and interconnected systems increases day by day, and due to that, the importance of the semiconductor industry becomes more and more definite. The semiconductor industry is directly or indirectly connected to all the sectors of the market.', 'Over the last few years, the importance and demand of semiconductors have become ever more pronounced. Initially, it started from an increased interest in blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. As that trend started to fade away, the generative AI trend led to another boom in the industry. The computational needs for such technologies paved the way for some of the best semiconductor stocks, like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), to create ample opportunities for investors. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s market cap was somewhere around $400 billion in December 2022 and jumped to $1 trillion by the second quarter of 2023. At the time of writing on December 8, the company had a market cap of $1.17 trillion. Furthermore, its stock has gained over 230% year-to-date (YTD)', 'Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is the company that makes all of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s chips. While the company’s third-quarter revenues fell year-over-year (YoY), its stock price is up nearly 35% YTD at the time of writing on December 8. However, its stock price gain is not solely dependent on the AI boom but also on better-than-expected sales due to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s iPhone 15 launch. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is the primary chip supplier of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).', 'Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has also made some noise in the AI segment as it unveiled its latest AI accelerator, Instinct MI300X, on December 6. The company also raised its AI Accelerator total addressable market to $400 billion from the prior $150 billion. At the Barclays’ Global Technology Conference, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)’s CFO Jean Hu said:', ""“It's actually a very important milestone and inflection point for AMD to be a strong player in AI compute space. We all know the opportunities are tremendous, and we are really pleased we get to the point we can be very competitive in this marketplace. There are so many announcements yesterday. So, what I'll do today is just highlight some of the key things we announced yesterday. You can absolutely listen to the webcast and it's super exciting. First and foremost is, we formally launched MI300A and MI300X and highlighted the performance advantage we have, especially when you think about the inference, MI300X has the industry-leading memory bandwidth and capacity. So, it provide better TCOs for customers. You can either run more models or you can use less GPUs. So, it's a great product, very competitive. And as we said during our last earnings call, MI300 will be the fastest revenue, $2 billion in our history. And we are very confident about the $2 billion-plus revenue number we talk about for 2024.”"", 'A report by the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) states that the semiconductor industry’s workforce will increase from 345,000 in July 2023 to 460,000 jobs by 2030, representing a 33.33% growth. While the availability of jobs is something that should be considered good news, the SIA predicts that 58% of projected new jobs are at risk of being unfilled, considering the current degree completion rates. Additionally, while AI is just one growth catalyst of the industry that we mentioned, McKinsey believes that due to autonomous and e-mobility technologies, the semiconductor demand in the automotive sector could triple by 2030. These factors can lead to labor and supply shortages in the future.', 'While the SIA predicts this labor shortage at the end of the decade, recent events have shown that the industry is already lacking skilled labor. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)’s Arizona plant has been delayed till 2025 due to labor shortages. Furthermore, the company’s plan to build a facility in Germany is also facing the problem of insufficient skilled labor.', 'A December report by the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics organization predicts that the annual global semiconductor sales will decline by 9.4% YoY in 2023 yet increase by over 13% in 2024 to $588.4 billion. The previously mentioned McKinsey report believes that it will become a trillion-dollar industry by 2030, growing at the rate of 6%-8%.', 'We previously reported that the global semiconductor market was valued at $664.2 billion in 2023 and will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 12.28% through 2032, reaching $1.88 trillion.', ""Going by the forecasts, it is evident that there is no stopping the semiconductor industry's growth. Billionaires are also buying into the industry.

(NYSE:MRK) is about to go ex-dividend in just 4 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. In other words, investors can purchase Merck's shares before the 14th of December in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 8th of January."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.77 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$2.92 per share. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Merck has a trailing yield of approximately 2.8% on its current stock price of $103.75. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to investigate whether Merck can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow."", ' View our latest analysis for Merck ', 'Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Merck distributed an unsustainably high 159% of its profit as dividends to shareholders last year. Without more sustainable payment behaviour, the dividend looks precarious. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Over the last year it paid out 56% of its free cash flow as dividends, within the usual range for most companies.', ""It's good to see that while Merck's dividends were not covered by profits, at least they are affordable from a cash perspective. Still, if the company repeatedly paid a dividend greater than its profits, we'd be concerned. Very few companies are able to sustainably pay dividends larger than their reported earnings."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. Fortunately for readers, Merck's earnings per share have been growing at 16% a year for the past five years."", ""The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Merck has delivered an average of 5.4% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. Earnings per share have been growing much quicker than dividends, potentially because Merck is keeping back more of its profits to grow the business."", ""Has Merck got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Growing earnings per share and a normal cashflow payout ratio is an ok combination, but we're concerned that the company is paying out such a high percentage of its income as dividends. In summary, it's hard to get excited about Merck from a dividend perspective."", ""However if you're still interested in Merck as a potential investment, you should definitely consider some of the risks involved with Merck.

If you want to skip our overview of the healthcare industry, then you can take a look at 5 Best Healthcare Stocks For the Long-Term. ', 'The healthcare industry is one of the biggest industries in the world. Its products range from everyday generic medicines to the highly technological genetic engineering and biotechnology industries. In terms of monetary value, the global healthcare industry is slated to be worth $7.3 trillion by the end of this year, after growing at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.92%. The sector is quite unique in the sense that within the healthcare segment, there are several specific highly valuable markets each of which cater to the needs of different niches. For instance, one sector is the healthcare services market which was worth $10.3 trillion in 2021 and is expected to post a CAGR of 8.2% between 2023 and 2030 for a final value of $21 trillion.', '2023 has seen healthcare return to normalcy after it soared to record highs on the stock market during the coronavirus pandemic. However, with the advent of A.I., there are several potential catalysts in the waiting as well. A.I. can disrupt the healthcare industry in nearly every end of the supply chain. Starting from downstream, one of the biggest use cases for A.I. comes in the form of enabling drug discovery. A.I. and machine learning models are capable of sifting through vast sums of data and information to generate inferences, and this allows researchers to combine ingredients to check whether any new drugs can be discovered. Moving further upstream, A.I. can also enable healthcare service providers such as hospitals to sift through patient data and discover new patterns.', 'These use cases are also on the mind of the consulting firm McKinsey. The U.S. healthcare system is one of the largest in the world and is infamous for its high costs that result in absurd prices for non insured patients. McKinsey believes that by employing generative A.I., automation, and analytics, could lead the healthcare industry to save anywhere between $200 billion and $360 billion in administrative functions, and could lead to lower burnout for doctors to eventually improve patient outcomes.', 'One of the biggest drivers of corporate spending and risk in the healthcare industry is research and development for drug discovery. The process is quite tedious and it requires companies such as Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) to invest millions if not billions of dollars and then take the gamble of clinical trials to convince regulatory bodies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve drugs for mass market use. Within this cycle, a randomized clinical trial is one of the most important processes and also one of the most time consuming ones. McKinsey believes that by using A.I. healthcare firms can utilize real world data in mass volumes to improve the chances of clinical trial success by matching the right patients with the right drug combination and enabling better decisions about patient selection.', ""Shifting gears to focus on the latest healthcare industry news, just like A.I. has piqued interest in the technology industry, the pharmaceutical sector of the healthcare industry has been dealing with its own revolution. This has come in the form of weight loss drugs, which are repurposed diabetes medications that work with insulin production to give the user the feeling of being full. Right now, there are three 'premier' weight loss drugs. Two of these, Wegovy and Ozempic, are made by the pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO). Both use the same primary ingredient and the only difference between them is their strength. The third weight loss drug is Eli Lilly's Mounjaro, which is selling like hot cakes if we believe the company's management. Mounjaro raked in a cool $1.4 billion in revenue for Eli Lilly during 2023's third quarter, and sources quoted by Reuters believe that the firm plans to invest as much as $2 billion in Germany to beef up Mounjaro's supply. This plant will mark the firm's first major production in the European economic giant, and while the sources did not explicitly mention the weight loss drug by name, they added that it would focus on making diabetes drugs that could also help with weight loss."", 'So, as the healthcare industry looks to the post COVID world, we decided to take a look at which healthcare stocks might be suitable for the long term.

When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We can see that Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) does use debt in its business. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?"", ""Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together."", ' See our latest analysis for Pfizer ', 'As you can see below, at the end of October 2023, Pfizer had US$64.1b of debt, up from US$37.0b a year ago. Click the image for more detail. However, it does have US$44.2b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$20.0b.', 'We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Pfizer had liabilities of US$31.1b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$86.7b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$44.2b in cash and US$15.0b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$58.6b.', 'Pfizer has a very large market capitalization of US$161.7b, so it could very likely raise cash to ameliorate its balance sheet, if the need arose. But we definitely want to keep our eyes open to indications that its debt is bringing too much risk.', ""In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio)."", ""Pfizer has a low debt to EBITDA ratio of only 1.4. But the really cool thing is that it actually managed to receive more interest than it paid, over the last year. So it's fair to say it can handle debt like a hotshot teppanyaki chef handles cooking. In fact Pfizer's saving grace is its low debt levels, because its EBIT has tanked 80% in the last twelve months. When it comes to paying off debt, falling earnings are no more useful than sugary sodas are for your health. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Pfizer can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts."", ""But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. During the last three years, Pfizer generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so."", ""Pfizer's EBIT growth rate was a real negative on this analysis, although the other factors we considered were considerably better. In particular, we are dazzled with its interest cover. Considering this range of data points, we think Pfizer is in a good position to manage its debt levels. Having said that, the load is sufficiently heavy that we would recommend any shareholders keep a close eye on it. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it.

Maybe Jason, just for our audience, for our viewers, could you explain sort of broad strokes why that is and what the sector needs to do to kind of get out of that rut?"", ""JASON KUPFERBERG: Well, first of all, thanks very much for having me. It has been a really tough couple of years. And there's a couple of reasons for that.

Were we going to go into recession? Were we not? What are consumers buying, discretionary goods, non-discretionary goods?

And I would say that these concerns were really a combination of cyclical and in some cases structural, in other words, shifts in the competitive landscape, who was gaining share, who was losing share.', ""So now, let's look forward to 2024. What can possibly get this sector out of its rut? We identified a couple of potential dynamics that could do just that. Number one, greater visibility on forward estimates in 2024. And along with that, what we're talking about is really increased confidence in a soft landing scenario."", ""Now, that's the base case that Bank of America's economists are calling for. And we think that as we go through the year to the extent that confidence builds in that scenario, then people will be more comfortable with where forward estimates are. And therefore, they'll be comfortable putting a higher multiple on those estimates. And hence, we could see appreciation that way."", ""Industry M&A is a possibility. We did see a couple of transactions in the second half of 2023. If there's a pickup in that activity in a more stable interest rate environment in 2024, that could be a catalyst. And then the third would simply be potential investor rotation out of other subsectors, either in tech or in financials. Payments kind of sits at the intersection of those two industries. So those are really the three factors that we're looking for in 2024 to break payments out of this rut."", ""- Hey, Jason, I'm also curious. When you talk about sort of the secular or structural changes that we're looking at in the industry, I'm curious about the effect of buy now, pay later. I mean, when you talk about the competitive landscape, that's been part of it. Some of the companies that you talk about do that. But then there are some pure plays too. How is that sort of changed how these companies operate and how they do?"", ""JASON KUPFERBERG: Some of our companies have definitely made a bigger play into buy now, pay later.

We are seeing in a certain consumer demographic-- this isn't for everyone, but for a certain consumer demographic the flexibility of being able to expand your purchasing power, particularly in the case of a 0% APR offer, definitely has its appeal.

If you want to skip our primer of the blockchain industry and want to jump to the top five stocks in this list, then take a look at the 5 Most Undervalued Blockchain Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. ', 'The blockchain industry is one of the most transformative technologies right now. The dawn of the digital era and the subsequent migration of important sectors such as defense, banking, and healthcare to the digital realm have changed the way in which humans live their lives in the 21st century. They reduce paperwork and streamline processing, but at the same time also end up creating new security risks. While bank robbers before the computing age had to plan their robberies, arrange cars, and weapons, and then make their way to banks, now, hackers can transfer funds simply by sitting at a remote location and running code. At the same time, organizations such as the Pentagon originally had to store their secrets in hard copy which made espionage trickier. Now, if a system is compromised, then hackers and foreign threat actors can hope to glean national security secrets from compromised systems as well.', ""Blockchains provide a unique security solution to all these risks. For those out of the loop, a blockchain system is a ledger of sorts made of computers. Each time a 'transaction' is made on this system, a record is stored on each node and secured through cryptography. This provides a reliable data backup since records are not contingent on a single storage point and network administrators can monitor the entire system to accurately determine if there is a fault. At the heart of the blockchain is Bitcoin, the world's premier cryptocurrency. Blockchains and Bitcoin go hand in hand as each Bitcoin is simply a computational record of a calculation performed for which the computer performing the computation receives a token that can be traded."", ""The immense potential of blockchains to be applied to several industries also makes it quite valuable. For instance, research from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) shows that some areas that can benefit from blockchains include identity management, contracts, banking and finance, supply chain and logistics, and identity management. Specifically, the firm points out that within these areas, a supply chain is one of the biggest beneficiaries due to blockchain's potential to transform tracking and tracing. In supply chain management, tracking and tracing refer to following a product's path downstream and upstream of the supply chain, respectively."", 'This is crucial for product recalls, particularly in the food industry, as companies have a short time to figure out where a faulty ingredient originated from. According to PwC, blockchains for track and trace can boost economic productivity by $962 billion by 2030, to account for a sizeable chunk of the $1.76 trillion in total economic benefits to the global gross domestic product (GDP).', ""Since cryptocurrency and blockchain go hand in hand, any discussion of the latter is incomplete without the former. On this front, while 2022 was a devastating year for cryptocurrencies, the tail end of 2023 is providing cryptocurrency investors with some optimism as Bitcoin is up by 164% year to date. One major reason behind the surge is growing confidence that a Bitcoin ETF that allows stock market investors to profit from the currency might be approved by the U.S. government soon. But even if an ETF still isn't official, the finance industry as a whole has been making big moves in the blockchain industry for years."", ""As an example, Franklin Resources, Inc. (NYSE:BEN) became the first financial company in the U.S. to launch a mutual fund that uses a blockchain for record keeping purposes. Building on this, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) - the world's biggest private banks in terms of assets - expanded its banking services to include blockchain technologies this month by going live on the Partior interbank network. Partior is hosted on a blockchain, and it seeks to speed up interbank processing which typically sees global funds flow through intermediary accounts before being deposited into the receiver's account."", ""Today, we'll take a look at the most undervalued blockchain stocks to buy, with the notable picks being PayPal Holdings, Inc.

After peaking just shy of $4 per gallon earlier this year, and touching $5 in June 2022, the national average pump price for a gallon of regular has sunk to $3.23 as of Dec. 5, according to AAA. This general energy-market trend has been unwelcome news for refiners, though. The 3-2-1 refinery crack spread, a gauge of profitability for that industry and charted below, plunged from an Aug. 25 high to a low notched in early October. This is a key metric to watch for Marathon Petroleum Corp. (NYSE:MPC).', 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MPC.', 'I am neutral on Marathon Petroleum shares given the turn lower in cracks and a stock that appears near fair value in my view. Still, the technicals and momentum appear strong.', 'Source: RBN Energy', 'For background, Marathon Petroleum, along with its subsidiaries, operates as an integrated downstream company primarily within the United States. It has two operating segments: Refining & Marketing and Midstream. Its Refining & Marketing segment refines crude oil and other products across several regions of the contiguos U.S. along with other activities. Its Midstream segment transports, stores, distributes and sells crude oil and refined products through various energy logistics channels.', 'With a $57.5 billion market cap, the Ohio-based oil and gas refining and marketing company within the energy sector trades at a lofty 22.5 forward non-GAAP price-earnings ratio and pays an above-market 2.2% forward dividend yield. Ahead of earnings, which are not due out until the end of January, shares trade with a moderate 27% implied volatility percentage, per Options Research & Technology Services, and short interest on the stock is modest, though material, at 2.6% as of Dec. 4.', 'Back in October, Marathon Petroleum reported a strong quarter. Third-quarter non-GAAP earnings per share of $8.14 topped Wall Street expectations by 39 cents while $41.6 billion of quarterly revenue was a 12% decline from year-ago levels, but it handily beat the consensus estimate by $2.6 billion. Shares rose 3% in the following session. The comapny produced strong operating cash flow to the tune of $5 billion and adjusted Ebitda totaled $5.7 billion during the period that featured extremely high crack spreads I do not expect that to continue given the steep fall off in gasoline prices.', 'The robust quarter also came with a continued execution of a stock buyback plan. Bank of America notes that 40% of outstanding shares have been repurchased since Marathon divested its retail business. The revamped capital structure and high net cash position should help it weather macro risks should they come about in the first half of next year. Still, weaker cracks will likely negatively impact margins going forward. What was positive before the third-quarter report was the company hiking its quarterly dividend by 10% and approving an additional $5 billion stock repurchase plan. These shareholder-accretive activities are encouraging.', 'Key risks include adverse commodity price trends (high oil prices, low prices for refined products), poor capital expenditure execution and weaker demand due to lower U.S. gross domestic product growth in the coming quarters.', 'On valuation, analysts at Bank of America see earnings moderating over the next few years. Operating earnings per share is forecasted to be around $23 this year with a significant decline to just $15 in 2024. By 2025, normalized per-share profits are seen closer to $13. Following an extraordinarily strong 2022, sales trends are expected to be in the red over the out years compared to this year and 2022.', ""Dividends, meanwhile, are forecasted to rise, helping to boost the company's yield. Assuming normalized non-GAAP earnings of $13 per share and applying a low teens price-earnings rato (above the sector median, but well below Marathon's five-year average valuation multiple), the stock should close to $160, suggesting not too much further upside from its current share price. What's positive, though, is that Marathon has very strong free cash flow trends, with total free cash flow per share in the last four quarters of more than $35, though that should moderate over the coming quarters."", 'Source: BofA Global Research', 'Looking ahead, corporate event data provided by Wall Street Horizon show an unconfirmed fourth-quarter 2023 earnings date of Tuesday, Jan. 30. Before that, Marathon Petroleum pays a quarterly dividend of 82.5 cents on Monday, Dec. 11. No other volatility catalysts are seen on the calendar.', 'Source: Wall Street Horizon', 'Marathon Petroleum has been among the strongest large-cap performers on the year. Up more than 33% on a total return basis in 2023, outperforming the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE) and the S&P 500 Trust ETF (SPY), the stock has stagnated somewhat since hitting a September closing high above $156. Notice in the chart below that Marathon has been consolidating in a bull flag in the last three months as volume also trends lower. These are bullish technical factors, in my opinion, given the broader trend up.', 'With a long-term 200-day moving average that is positively sloped, and with a pronounced uptrend line in place, the bulls are in control. There is also an uptrend resistance line that would come into play near $165 today. I see near-term support around the fourth-quarter 2023 lows at $140 that is also near where the stock peaked during the first half of 2023 thus, it is a key area of polarity (former resistance becomes new support). A cautionary note is seen with its relative strength index momentum oscillator at the bottom of the chart there is some bearish negative divergence (poorer momentum as the stock advances).', ""Overall, Marathon Petroleum's chart is constructive despite the turn lower in momentum. I see the current price trend as a bullish consolidation and $140 is important support."", 'Source: GuruFocus', 'I see Marathon near fair value, so long-term investors might want to look elsewhere.

Despite this volatility constraint, investors could consider dividend-paying companies belonging to the industry. This is because, generally, companies with stable dividend-paying history are usually relatively less volatile than stocks with no dividend history.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Delta Air Lines DAL, American Airlines AAL and United Airlines UAL.', 'Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.', 'Griffon’s stock has offered investors the steady growth and value they look for in the portfolio and lands the Bull of the Day after being added to the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) list on Thursday.', 'The multinational conglomerate and holding company has an expanding presence in the home and building products market along with the consumer and professional products markets.', 'After hitting 52-week highs of $50 a share this week there could still be plenty of upside for Griffon’s stock with the Average Zacks Price Target of $64.25 a share being 29% above current levels.', 'Operating through several subsidiaries including The Ames Companies, Griffon’s stock has popped +39% in 2023 and has now soared over +150% in the last three years to largely outperform the broader indexes.', 'As one of its most lucrative subsidiaries, The Ames Companies has operations in Massachusetts that date back to 1774 etching its name in American history while becoming a leading North American manufacturer and a global provider of branded tools and products for home storage, organization, and landscaping.', 'Extending its impeccable price performance over the last few years was that Griffon was able to beat its fiscal fourth quarter earnings expectations by 22% last month.', 'Although Griffon’s current fiscal 2024 earnings are expected to dip -7% following a tougher-to-compete-against year, FY25 EPS is projected to rebound and soar 32% to $5.56 per share. More importantly, earnings estimate revisions for both FY24 and FY25 are nicely up over the last 60 days.', ""This is very compelling considering Griffon’s stock trades at a 12X forward earnings multiple which is a lofty discount to the S&P 500’s 21.2X and its Zacks Diversified Operations Markets' 22.9X with some of the notable names in the space including GM, 3M and Honeywell."", 'In addition to sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Griffon’s stock has an “A” Zacks Style Scores grade for both Value and Growth. Checking many fundamental trading boxes there appears to be more room to run for GFF shares with Griffon offering a respectable 1.21% annual dividend yield as well.', 'The long-term prospects of alternative energy player Clearway Energy may still be perplexing but unfortunately, there may be more short-term risk ahead landing its stock a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and the Bear of the Day.', 'After widely missing earnings expectations for two consecutive quarters investors may want to curb their enthusiasm for Clearway’s luring 6.34% annual dividend yield amid weak renewable resource conditions and lower natural gas prices.', 'Weak Q3 Results: Notably, the Zacks Alternative Energy-Other Industry is in the bottom 39% of over 250 Zacks industries and Clearway’s Q3 results in November alluded to a tougher operating environment.', 'While Q3 sales of $371 million topped estimates by 8% earnings of $0.03 a share fell a very concerning -94% below expectations of $0.55 a share. This comes after Q2 earnings of $0.33 a share missed the Zacks Consensus of $0.55 a share by -40% in August.', 'Weaker Outlook: Largely attributing to Clearway’s strong sell rating, annual earnings estimates for fiscal 2023 are down -10% over the last 60 days while FY24 EPS estimates have fallen -11%.', 'On top of this, Clearway’s stock is already down -21% this year to vastly underperform the broader indexes and trail its Zacks Subindustry’s -14%.', 'While it’s far too soon to call Clearway Energy’s stock a value trap, investors may want to think twice before investing in the company at the moment considering its lucrative dividend yield but poor performance of late.', 'Wednesday, Dec 6, saw U.S. airline stocks perform exceedingly well on the bourses. Shares of industrial heavyweights like Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and United Airlines gained 3.54%, 2.67% and 3.38%, respectively, on Dec 6 over Dec 5’s closing. Consequently, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index appreciated 2.19% at the close of trading on Dec 6.', 'All of the above-mentioned companies currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.', 'The catalyst behind the impressive performance on the bourses was the bullish commentary of Delta’s management at the Morgan Stanley Global Consumer & Retail Conference. After a record-breaking performance during the Thanksgiving holiday period, management expects another rosy performance in terms of traffic during Christmas, thereby ending the year on a strong note.', 'We remind investors that more than 5.3 million customers availed of DAL flights between Nov 17 and Nov 26. DAL operated more than 43,000 flights systemwide during this period to meet the buoyant air travel demand witnessed during the Thanksgiving holiday period.', 'At the investor event, management also sounded optimistic about international air travel in 2024 and stated that its performance with respect to Trans-Atlantic travel had been particularly strong in the current year, leading to a significant increase in capacity to meet the buoyant demand scenario. Management expects the strong Trans-Atlantic performance to continue next year, as advanced bookings remain strong and are anticipated to pick up as we approach March.', 'Highlighting that air travel demand has held up well over the past few weeks, DAL maintained the fourth-quarter and 2023 outlook that it provided in October with its third-quarter results. Fourth-quarter earnings are expected to be $1.05-$1.30 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $1.15 per share.', 'The adjusted operating margin in the December quarter is expected to be 9-11%.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $6.10 per share. For 2023, the adjusted operating margin is expected to be 11.5%. Management projects full-year total revenues (adjusted) to increase 20% on a year-over-year basis.', 'The record traffic during the Thanksgiving period has provided the much-needed boost to airline stocks after a tough few months due to headwinds like high labor and fuel costs, and a slowdown in domestic air travel demand. We note that airline stocks have been performing well of late and the uptick on Dec 6 was part of that uptrend.', 'Over the past month, stocks in the Zacks Airline industry have gained 11.5%, handily outperforming the S&P 500’s 3.9% appreciation.', 'Similar to DAL, American Airlines and United Airlines have attracted huge traffic in the Thanksgiving travel period. AAL flights attracted 6.5 million customers over the Thanksgiving holiday, thereby establishing a record for the airline, with Nov 26 being its busiest day. UAL flights, too, were packed, with a record 3.2 million passengers flying between Nov 17 and Nov 23.', 'The upbeat air-traffic scenario apart, the decline in oil price from the 2023 highs reached in late September bodes well for airlines.

Also, sustainable capital distributions are a positive. However, an elevated cost base and commercial loan concentration are concerning.', 'PNC Financial enjoys a strong balance sheet position with loan and deposit balances rising over the years. In October 2023, capitalizing on growth opportunities, the company acquired loan commitments from Signature Bank worth approximately $16 billion. Going forward, management expects that the acquisition will be accretive to earnings per share (EPS), with fourth-quarter 2023 EPS seeing an accretion of around 10 cents.', 'The company expects average loans to rise around 3% sequentially. Our model estimates total loans and deposit balances to inch up at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 1.5% and 0.8%, respectively, over the next three years (ended 2025).', 'PNC Financial remains committed to strengthening its business through strategic initiatives. Notably, in 2022, the company closed the buyout of Linga, a POS and payment solutions firm, in a bid to expand corporate payments capabilities in the hospitality and restaurant industry space. Thus, its bottom line is likely to get further support, if it continues to make planned investments and diversify its business mix.', 'PNC continues to progress with its capital distribution strategy. In the third quarter of 2023, the firm returned $0.6 billion of capital to shareholders by way of dividends on common shares. Also, it has 46% of its 100 million repurchase plan as of Sep 30, 2023. Given the company’s earnings strength, its capital-distribution activities seem sustainable and might stoke investors’ confidence in the stock.', 'However, PNC’s non-interest expenses have witnessed a four-year CAGR (2018-2022) of 6.3%. Going forward, a rising expense base on inflationary pressures and investments in technological advancements are likely to continue affecting the bottom-line growth. Management expects adjusted non-interest expenses to rise 3-4% in fourth-quarter 2023 on a sequential basis. We estimate the metric to grow 1% to $13.31 billion in 2023.', 'Despite the company’s NII rising over the years, higher funding costs are expected to affect NII going forward. Hence, moving ahead, a decline in NII might impede its top-line growth to some extent. Accordingly, management expects the metric to inch down 1-2% sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2023. Though we anticipate the metric to rise 6.6% in 2023, it will dip 3.8% in 2024.', 'The majority of PNC Financial’s loan portfolio, around 68% of total loans as of Sep 30, 2023, comprises total commercial loans. The current rapidly changing macroeconomic backdrop may put some strain on commercial lending. Thus, lack of loan portfolio diversification is likely to hurt the company’s financials if the economic situation worsens.', 'Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have fallen 9.3% against growth of 2.3% recorded by the industry\xa0over the past year.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'A couple of better-ranked stocks from the banking space are\xa0JPMorgan Chase & Co.\xa0JPM and\xa0Park National Corporation\xa0PRK.

The power will be enough to supply low-carbon electricity to more than 1 million people.The Mirny wind project will require an investment of nearly $1.4 billion and TotalEnergies, with its knowledge and expertise, will be its primary operator. TTE will develop this wind project in partnership with the National Wealth Fund Samruk-Kazyna and the National Company KazMunayGas.\xa0 Each Kazak partner will own a 20% interest in the project.TotalEnergies has been working actively to expand its renewable energy generation portfolio and fully supports the commitment of more than 110 nations to triple their renewable energy capacity by 2030.', 'TotalEnergies has already decided its long-term renewable energy goal of generating more than 100 Terawatt hours of clean energy by 2030.

Large projects like Mirny will assist the company in meeting its long-term renewable goal.This oil and gas major is gradually building a portfolio of low-carbon businesses that could account for 15-20% of its sales by 2040.', 'A transition in the energy space is evident, with industries now focusing on lowering emissions and planning to use energy generated from clean sources. Utilities are expanding their clean energy generation portfolios.

Its long-term objective is to add 24 GW of battery storage, solar, hydro and wind (offshore as well as onshore) projects by 2036.Alliant Energy’s geographic location and favorable regulatory developments bode well for the development of wind projects. In August 2023, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin approved two Alliant Energy battery energy storage projects — the 100-MW Grant County Battery project and the 75-MW Wood County Battery project.Pinnacle West aims to develop 1,600 MW of clean energy and storage that are expected to be placed in service by 2024 for Arizona Public Service Company customers.

The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making."", 'Earnings Estimate Revisions', ""Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements."", 'Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is expected to post earnings of $1.47 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +19.5%.

To skip the detailed analysis of the semiconductor industry, go directly to the 5 Best Semiconductor Stocks According to Billionaires.', 'The semiconductor industry is arguably one of the most important segments of the market. It is the backbone of our modern digital era. Our society’s dependence on electronic devices and interconnected systems increases day by day, and due to that, the importance of the semiconductor industry becomes more and more definite. The semiconductor industry is directly or indirectly connected to all the sectors of the market.', 'Over the last few years, the importance and demand of semiconductors have become ever more pronounced. Initially, it started from an increased interest in blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. As that trend started to fade away, the generative AI trend led to another boom in the industry. The computational needs for such technologies paved the way for some of the best semiconductor stocks, like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), to create ample opportunities for investors. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s market cap was somewhere around $400 billion in December 2022 and jumped to $1 trillion by the second quarter of 2023. At the time of writing on December 8, the company had a market cap of $1.17 trillion. Furthermore, its stock has gained over 230% year-to-date (YTD)', 'Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is the company that makes all of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s chips. While the company’s third-quarter revenues fell year-over-year (YoY), its stock price is up nearly 35% YTD at the time of writing on December 8. However, its stock price gain is not solely dependent on the AI boom but also on better-than-expected sales due to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s iPhone 15 launch. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is the primary chip supplier of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).', 'Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has also made some noise in the AI segment as it unveiled its latest AI accelerator, Instinct MI300X, on December 6. The company also raised its AI Accelerator total addressable market to $400 billion from the prior $150 billion. At the Barclays’ Global Technology Conference, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)’s CFO Jean Hu said:', ""“It's actually a very important milestone and inflection point for AMD to be a strong player in AI compute space. We all know the opportunities are tremendous, and we are really pleased we get to the point we can be very competitive in this marketplace. There are so many announcements yesterday. So, what I'll do today is just highlight some of the key things we announced yesterday. You can absolutely listen to the webcast and it's super exciting. First and foremost is, we formally launched MI300A and MI300X and highlighted the performance advantage we have, especially when you think about the inference, MI300X has the industry-leading memory bandwidth and capacity. So, it provide better TCOs for customers. You can either run more models or you can use less GPUs. So, it's a great product, very competitive. And as we said during our last earnings call, MI300 will be the fastest revenue, $2 billion in our history. And we are very confident about the $2 billion-plus revenue number we talk about for 2024.”"", 'A report by the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) states that the semiconductor industry’s workforce will increase from 345,000 in July 2023 to 460,000 jobs by 2030, representing a 33.33% growth. While the availability of jobs is something that should be considered good news, the SIA predicts that 58% of projected new jobs are at risk of being unfilled, considering the current degree completion rates. Additionally, while AI is just one growth catalyst of the industry that we mentioned, McKinsey believes that due to autonomous and e-mobility technologies, the semiconductor demand in the automotive sector could triple by 2030. These factors can lead to labor and supply shortages in the future.', 'While the SIA predicts this labor shortage at the end of the decade, recent events have shown that the industry is already lacking skilled labor. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)’s Arizona plant has been delayed till 2025 due to labor shortages. Furthermore, the company’s plan to build a facility in Germany is also facing the problem of insufficient skilled labor.', 'A December report by the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics organization predicts that the annual global semiconductor sales will decline by 9.4% YoY in 2023 yet increase by over 13% in 2024 to $588.4 billion. The previously mentioned McKinsey report believes that it will become a trillion-dollar industry by 2030, growing at the rate of 6%-8%.', 'We previously reported that the global semiconductor market was valued at $664.2 billion in 2023 and will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 12.28% through 2032, reaching $1.88 trillion.', ""Going by the forecasts, it is evident that there is no stopping the semiconductor industry's growth. Billionaires are also buying into the industry. Some of the best semiconductor stocks, according to billionaires, include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), and Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX). One of the most famous hedge fund billionaires, Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Capital, kept NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as his 13F portfolio’s top stock pick in the third quarter of 2023 and said:"", '""If it\'s as big as I think it is, Nvidia is something we are going to want to own for at least two or three years [...] I do believe, unlike crypto, AI is real … it could be as transformative as the internet.""', 'If you aren’t sure about which semiconductor stocks you should invest in, here are the 10 Best Semiconductor ETFs.

(NASDAQ:TXN) in my portfolio for a while. I originally bought the company as a hedge against the more severe geopolitical risks associated with an investment in semiconductor behemoth Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM). However, I wanted to understand more about the business as I consider increasing my exposure to the semiconductor space in the coming months. Therefore, I performed a deep dive to discover more intricacies that make the company stand out.', 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with TXN.', 'The global semiconductor company designs, manufactures and sells integrated circuits, embedded processors and other components.', 'Semiconductors are a vital ingredient in modern electronics. They are materials with electrical conductivity between a conductor, such as aluminum, and an insulator, such as glass. These components are integral in controlling the flow of electrical current and make it possible to store data, perform computations and manipulate signals.', ""According to GuruFocus, Texas Instruments' primary revenue stream is its Analog segment, bringing in 76.70% of the total income. Embedded Processing takes home 16.30% and other revenue sources 7%."", 'The Analog segment refers to products dealing with analog signals. These signals differ from digital signals, as analog signals are continuous and vary smoothly, while digital technology uses binary signals (0s and 1s) for precision and noise reduction.', 'Embedded Processing relates to specialized semiconductor chips. These are integrated into electronics and perform specific computational tasks. For example, microcontrollers are small computers on single chips found in washing machines, microwaves and automobiles, among other devices.', 'The other revenue streams include a range of products and services. However, here are the top three I have found:', 'Digital Signal Processing: processors for efficiently manipulating digital signals in audio, telecommunications and digital images.', 'Educational Technology: graphing calculators have been a successful revenue stream for Texas Instruments.', 'Power Management: semiconductor products for regulating and distributing power for electronic devices.', ""Looking at the company's geographic revenue diversification is equally fascinating. GuruFocus shows us that 33% of the revenue comes from the U.S. and 24% from China."", ""I find it particularly interesting to compare this to Taiwan Semiconductor's revenue diversification. Of these, 66% come from the U.S. and only 10.8% from China. Partly, I think this is due to the tailored operations of Taiwan Semiconductor as opposed to Texas Instruments' analog and embedded processing segments. The company is particularly useful for advanced semiconductor manufacturing driven by some of the biggest technology companies in the world, most based in the U.S., including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). In comparison, Texas Instruments does not specifically cater to these companies, but focuses on a larger market of various industries and sectors."", 'On that note, Taiwan Semiconductor is not a direct competitor to Texas Instruments as it is a semiconductor foundry manufacturing chips designed by major technology players. Texas Instruments, on the other hand, designs and manufactures its semiconductor products. This contrast can be most powerfully divided as such: Taiwan Semiconductor is a foundry service, while Texas Instruments is an integrated device manufacturer.', 'Instead, the three most prominent competitors to Texas Instruments based on my analysis (and there are many) are:', 'Analog Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) is a strong player in the analog semiconductor sector with a product portfolio driven by acquisitions. It has a market cap around $90 billion and a 10-year price return of around 320%.', 'Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a wireless communications company focused on developing 5G. It has a market cap of $145 billion and a 200% 10-year price return.', 'NXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ:NXPI) is honed in on automotive and industrial semiconductors. It focuses on electronics in vehicles, for example. It has a market cap of $50 billion and a 10-year price return of around 390%.', 'For comparison, Texas Instruments has a market cap of $140 billion and a 10-year price return of around 280%.', 'The company has significant competitive advantages over other semiconductor companies. Most notably, Texas Instrumens has a vast portfolio of products that treat the needs of various industries. This is a crucial differentiator from some of its main competitors. In addition, the company can produce 300 millimeter wafers, which significantly lowers costs. Highly efficient production such as this allows for scalability and keeps supply flowing to demand.', ""However, the company's research and development spending of between 8% and 10% of total revenue over the past few years is lower than its major competitors. For comparison, Analog Devices currently has 13.5% R&D spending, Qualcomm 24.6% and NXP 17.5%. This could leave Texas Instruments behind over the long term if other companies advance at higher rates due to deeper research on core advanced technologies driving revenue growth. In the semiconductor industry, advanced knowledge and technological capabilities are paramount in the race for better, faster, more attractive products."", ""The GF Score of 93 out of 100 for Texas Instruments presents a favorable picture for investors. The strongest aspects of the chart are growth and profitability; interestingly, the company's value is rated as less strong. Let's have a look at why."", ""The company's gross margins are almost 65%, which boils down to 44% for operating margin and only a 5% decrease to a 39% net margin. Those are very high figures. For reference, the company's operating margin is in the top 2% of companies in the semiconductor industry."", ""Texas Instruments' 300mm wafer technology is a significant factor causing higher margins. This is because larger wafers mean more chips produced on a single wafer, decreasing the cost of chip production. The company also focuses explicitly on high-margin products from analog and embedded processing segments, and vertically integrating manufacturing to distribution reduces third-party spending. In my opinion, the company has a shrewd, efficient business model."", ""While the company's three-year revenue growth rate is 12.7%, which is only better than 51% of companies in the semiconductor industry, the growth rates are still relatively stable and strong, moving up consistently over time."", ""I think the company's revenue growth rates could be stronger. I am a shareholder because the company presents compelling operational advantages and significant semiconductor exposure.

But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. One great example is Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) which saw its share price drive 108% higher over five years. And in the last month, the share price has gained 9.7%. But the price may well have benefitted from a buoyant market, since stocks have gained 4.9% in the last thirty days.', ""So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Analog Devices ', ""To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement."", ""During five years of share price growth, Analog Devices achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 11% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 16% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth."", 'The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).', 'We know that Analog Devices has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.', ""When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Analog Devices' TSR for the last 5 years was 129%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!"", ""Analog Devices shareholders gained a total return of 11% during the year. Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. On the bright side, the longer term returns (running at about 18% a year, over half a decade) look better. Maybe the share price is just taking a breather while the business executes on its growth strategy. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Analog Devices   you should know about."", 'We will like Analog Devices better if we see some big insider buys.

This transaction has prompted a closer look into the insider's trading behavior and its potential implications for the stock."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 11 Warning Signs with SWK.', ""Graham Robinson is a seasoned executive with a wealth of experience in the industrial sector. As the Senior Vice President & President of the Industrial segment at Stanley Black & Decker Inc, Robinson is responsible for overseeing the strategic direction and operational execution of this critical division. His role is pivotal in driving growth and maintaining the company's competitive edge in a rapidly evolving market."", ""Stanley Black & Decker Inc is a global provider of tools, storage, industrial, and security solutions. With a rich history dating back to 1843, the company has established a strong brand presence and a diverse portfolio of products that cater to professional, industrial, and consumer markets. Its well-known brands include Stanley, Black & Decker, DeWalt, Craftsman, and many others. The company's commitment to innovation and quality has solidified its position as a leader in its field, with operations spanning across various geographies and market segments."", ""Insider trading activity, particularly sells, can provide valuable insights into a company's internal perspective on its stock's valuation. In the case of Stanley Black & Decker Inc, the insider, Graham Robinson, has sold 2,000 shares over the past year without any recorded purchases. This one-sided activity might raise questions among investors regarding the insider's confidence in the company's future prospects."", ""On the day of the insider's recent sell, shares of Stanley Black & Decker Inc were trading at $91.83, giving the company a market cap of $14.317 billion. This price point is significantly below the GuruFocus Value (GF Value) of $137.10, suggesting that the stock is undervalued.

When an insider sells at a price well below the GF Value, it could be interpreted in several ways. The insider might need liquidity for personal reasons, believe the stock is fully valued despite the GF Value, or see potential headwinds that could affect the stock's performance."", ""However, it's important to note that insider sells do not always signal a lack of confidence in the company. Executives may have diverse portfolios and personal financial planning strategies that necessitate selling shares, regardless of the company's intrinsic value or stock performance."", 'The insider trend image above provides a visual representation of the insider trading activity over the past year. With no insider buys and two insider sells, the trend might suggest a cautious stance from the insiders. Nevertheless, without additional context, it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions from this data alone.', ""The GF Value image further illustrates the disparity between the current stock price and the estimated intrinsic value. This discrepancy could present a buying opportunity for investors who believe in the company's long-term value proposition and are willing to look past the recent insider sell."", ""The recent insider sell by SVP & President Graham Robinson of Stanley Black & Decker Inc has prompted a detailed examination of the company's stock valuation and insider trading trends. While the sell activity might raise some concerns, the stock's significant undervaluation according to the GF Value suggests that the current price could be an attractive entry point for long-term investors. As always, it is crucial for investors to conduct their own due diligence and consider the broader context of insider trading activity when making investment decisions."", ""Investors should also keep an eye on the company's upcoming financial reports, market trends, and any potential strategic moves that could impact the stock's performance. Insider trading is just one piece of the puzzle, and a holistic approach to investment analysis is essential for making informed decisions in the dynamic landscape of the stock market."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

As of July this year, 130 LLMs had been released by Chinese companies and research institutes, leading to what has been termed a ""tussle of a hundred large models"".', 'Robin Li Yanhong, co-founder and chief executive of search engine giant Baidu, said last month that the launch of multiple, competing LLMs in China was ""a huge waste of resources"" and that companies should focus more on applications.', '""No platform has emerged as predominant in terms of technology or market size currently,"" said Luo Yuchen, CEO of Shenzhen Yantu Intelligence and Innovation.

Shen Dou, who heads Baidu\'s AI Cloud Group, has indicated that open-sourcing foundational LLMs can be difficult due to ""lack of effective feedback loops"" and heavy upgrade costs.', 'AI is certainly an expensive business. Building and training LLMs requires thousands of advanced chips to process huge amounts of data, not including the wages of highly-trained engineers.', ""For instance, Meta's Llama model used 2,048 Nvidia A100 GPUs to train on 1.4 trillion tokens, a numerical representation of words, and took about 21 days, according to a CNBC report in March."", 'To be sure, while it is clear that China has a tough fight on its hands when it comes to sourcing advanced computing power and equipment - it does have access to vast treasure troves of data and a huge array of market applications - the two advantages highlighted by President Xi five years ago. It also has a multitude of resourceful entrepreneurs.', ""For example, Lee Kai-fu, a prominent venture capitalist and former president of Google China, has transformed his AI start-up 01.AI into a US$1 billion venture within just eight months despite some controversy over its use of the structure from Meta's Llama LLM."", ""And China's Big Tech firms aim to monetise the technology in one form or another."", '""Open or closed, AI is essentially a booster for a cloud business in the eyes of cloud service providers,"" said Omdia\'s Su.

The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Accordingly, Devon Energy investors that purchase the stock on or after the 14th of December will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 29th of December."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.77 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$2.87 per share. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Devon Energy has a trailing yield of 6.5% on the current share price of $44.09. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Devon Energy's dividend is reliable and sustainable. As a result, readers should always check whether Devon Energy has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut."", ' See our latest analysis for Devon Energy ', 'Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Devon Energy paid out more than half (58%) of its earnings last year, which is a regular payout ratio for most companies. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Over the last year, it paid out more than three-quarters (78%) of its free cash flow generated, which is fairly high and may be starting to limit reinvestment in the business.', ""It's positive to see that Devon Energy's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. That's why it's comforting to see Devon Energy's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 48% per annum for the past five years."", ""Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Devon Energy has lifted its dividend by approximately 13% a year on average. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years."", ""From a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Devon Energy? It's good to see earnings are growing, since all of the best dividend stocks grow their earnings meaningfully over the long run. That's why we're glad to see Devon Energy's earnings per share growing, although as we saw, the company is paying out more than half of its earnings and cashflow - 58% and 78% respectively. In summary, while it has some positive characteristics, we're not inclined to race out and buy Devon Energy today."", ""While it's tempting to invest in Devon Energy for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved.

One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.31 in profit."", ""Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, United Rentals has a better ROE than the average (17%) in the Trade Distributors industry."", ""That's what we like to see. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk."", 'Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.', 'United Rentals clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.53. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.', 'Return on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.', 'But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.', 'If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.', 'Have feedback on this article?

Our society’s dependence on electronic devices and interconnected systems increases day by day, and due to that, the importance of the semiconductor industry becomes more and more definite.

Initially, it started from an increased interest in blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. As that trend started to fade away, the generative AI trend led to another boom in the industry. The computational needs for such technologies paved the way for some of the best semiconductor stocks, like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), to create ample opportunities for investors. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s market cap was somewhere around $400 billion in December 2022 and jumped to $1 trillion by the second quarter of 2023.

So, what I'll do today is just highlight some of the key things we announced yesterday. You can absolutely listen to the webcast and it's super exciting. First and foremost is, we formally launched MI300A and MI300X and highlighted the performance advantage we have, especially when you think about the inference, MI300X has the industry-leading memory bandwidth and capacity. So, it provide better TCOs for customers. You can either run more models or you can use less GPUs. So, it's a great product, very competitive.

While the availability of jobs is something that should be considered good news, the SIA predicts that 58% of projected new jobs are at risk of being unfilled, considering the current degree completion rates.

The fast-food icon enjoyed a fast bounce back from the weight-loss-drug-fueled plunge and could be headed to even higher highs as the company looks to jolt growth with two transformative efforts: a complete burger overhaul and the launch of the CosMc’s store model.', 'I’m incredibly bullish on MCD stock as the company looks to move forward with its incredibly forward-thinking projects under the leadership of fantastic CEO Chris Kempczinski. Indeed, there’s a lot of market share to nibble away at if a new burger formulation and store concept are able to draw even larger crowds. Personally, I believe both efforts will help McDonald’s command a higher multiple as it looks to give its sales growth a shot in the arm.', 'McDonald’s has ambitious plans to revamp its burger in 2024 to better compete with the crowded high-end burger rivals. That’s not to say there’s anything wrong with the current burger formulation. Nonetheless, I do think there is a lot to gain by rolling out changes to make its food taste better, perhaps more like the original McDonald’s burgers that were offered many decades ago before McDonald’s went all-in on value and cost efficiencies.', 'By making changes to everything from the bun to lettuce and even how the beef patties are prepared, McDonald’s hopes to win new customers by focusing on improving upon the quality factor. Indeed, driving costs lower has been a focal point of traditional fast-food firms for quite a while now. Low prices are the main reason why people go to fast-food restaurants over dine-in ones, after all.', 'The times are changing, though. With all the intense competition in the quick-service restaurant scene and the rise of new upscale fast-food burger chains (think Culver’s Restaurant), it’s no longer good enough to just be “fast” or offer low-cost eats.', 'McDonald’s has seemingly mastered the art of getting meals in customers’ hands as quickly and efficiently as possible. As the company looks to balance higher-quality burgers with its competitive prices, I think the company may be kicking off a new leg of growth that could take its stock to epic, new highs.', 'Undoubtedly, it’s always risky to introduce big changes to a flagship item. That said, I don’t view McDonald’s as having as much to lose, given the nature of the improvements. Who wouldn’t want their McDonald’s burger to have crispier lettuce, a moister bun, meltier cheese, and perfectly grilled beef patties?', 'Such major changes to a major menu item, I believe, could change the way we all look at McDonald’s. Sure, the chain will probably never be viewed as gourmet, but it may be able to stack up with the likes of the very best in the higher end of the fast-food chain.', 'As long as they don’t change their fries, I welcome any menu changes with open arms.', 'This week, McDonald’s opened its very first CosMc’s store, and an early glimpse into the new store concept is intriguing, to say the least. The opening marks the first of 10 as the firm looks to test the waters with the innovative, new concept that’s geared towards folks seeking to grab a quick coffee and snack.', 'Only time will tell if the new concept is able to disrupt the chain coffee store scene. Given the company’s expertise in the drive-thru, I believe the new concept has the potential to be a profound success. Of course, we’ll have to wait and see what the reviews are like for the new exclusive menu offerings, which include very intriguing beverage items like S’Mores Cold Brew and Tropical Spiceade.', 'In any case, if I were an independent coffee chain, I’d be pretty worried if there were a CosMc’s location opening up close by. It definitely stands out as a spin-off concept with disruptive potential.', 'On TipRanks, MCD stock comes in as a Strong Buy. Out of 28 analyst ratings, there are 23 Buys and five Hold recommendations. The\xa0average McDonald’s price target is $314.85, implying upside potential of 9.8%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $270.00 per share to a high of $383.00 per share.', 'McDonald’s seems destined for greater growth as it innovates with new store concepts while seeking to roll out positive changes with its burgers. If either the reformulated burger or CosMc’s hits the spot, McDonald’s will have a new growth driver on its hands that can help it gain market share in the burger and coffee-and-snack markets, respectively. McDonald’s under the Kempczinski (MCD’s current CEO) era has proven bold and could become even bolder going into the new year.', 'Disclosure']"

Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TROW) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Therefore, if you purchase T. Rowe Price Group's shares on or after the 14th of December, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 29th of December."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.22 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$4.88 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that T. Rowe Price Group has a trailing yield of 5.0% on the current share price of $98.44. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to investigate whether T. Rowe Price Group can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow."", ' Check out our latest analysis for T. Rowe Price Group ', 'Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. T.

Rowe Price Group earnings per share are up 3.1% per annum over the last five years."", ""Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. T. Rowe Price Group has delivered 12% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on retiring early, you may go to 5 States with Lowest Average Retirement Age in the US.', 'Examining the March 2022 Current Population Survey by the U.S. Census Bureau reveals an important detail: Social Security is helping lift 15.4 million individuals aged 65 and above, out of poverty. However, given the shaky future of these funds, policymakers are adamant on pushing Social Security’s Full Retirement Age (FRA) to 70 and beyond. As per the proposal, individuals born in 1978 or later would experience a full retirement age of 70.', 'The retiring of the Baby Boomer generation is, in large part, to blame for this retirement crisis. With this generation leaving the workforce by the droves, both Social Security and Medicare are under immense stress. The simultaneous decrease in the workforce, coupled with an increased demand for healthcare and pension benefits, is further creating a precarious imbalance. As a result, policymakers face the daunting challenge of ensuring that these social safety nets remain sustainable, facing backlash in the process.', ""The US, however, isn't the only country that has been proposing to increase its retirement age. As of 2020, the average retirement age in the world was equal to 64.2 years for men and 63.4 years for women. According to the OECD, numerous developed countries with aging demographics are expected to witness a two-year rise in the average effective retirement age by the mid-2060s. Currently, the full retirement age in the USA is 67 for those born in 1960 and later. At this age, workers are entitled to receive 100% of the benefits that they have earned. However, provided the FRA is pushed to 70, new retirees will have their average lifetime benefits cut by nearly 20%."", ""Regardless, there are many people who choose to retire before the full retirement age. According to The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), the magic number needed to last a comfortable retirement is $1.8 million. However, Credit Karma notes that 27% of seniors aged 59 or older have no retirement savings at all. Having zero savings is a major reason many retirees don’t wait until the full retirement age. A Schroders study backs up this claim, stating that 36% of those surveyed said that they'd need the money way before they turn 70. Unsurprisingly, 44% are also of the view that the funds won't last so it's better to grab what's left."", 'As such, retirees are witnessing a new strategy to work for themselves post-retirement. According to a study by T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TROW), many retirees are choosing to work part-time as part of their transition strategy. This is, in fact, a brilliant money move baby boomers are making in retirement. The study reveals that 57% of retirees wish to continue working in some form after retirement, as opposed to the 43% who wish to stop working once and for all.', '""Many retirees either choose to work or need work to be included in their retirement lifestyle. The decision can have many powerful positive effects, not least of which is financial well-being.”', '- Judith Ward, CFP®, a thought leadership director at T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TROW).', ""Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TROW) also notes in their survey that out of those individuals who consider themselves retired, 20% work either full-time or part-time, and 7% are reportedly looking for work. However, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) informs retirees that returning to work after retirement can temporarily reduce social security benefits and Medicare. The benefits are recalculated and credit is provided for the months in which the benefit wasn't received."", 'With the average retirement age in the US being 64 years, those retirees who think they’ve made a mistake by retiring early and settling for a smaller social security check, there is another way out. In such a case, individuals who have taken their benefits early at a reduced rate can pay back to the government and start later with a higher payout, notes The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW).', 'While discussions on proposals to raise the retirement age persist, many seniors are still opting for early retirement due to insufficient savings, health concerns, and various other factors.

The new forecast is not only below the previous outlook of around $93 billion but also much lower than 2022's actual figure.Management trimmed its revenue forecast for the full year due to weak e-commerce delivery demand and lost clients during the turbulent labor negotiations.

Bluebird bio, which also received FDA clearance for its genetic medicine Lyfgenia the same day, chose a higher price of $3.1 million.', 'The twin approvals make for a momentous day for sickle cell patients, who have had few treatment options to battle a disease that drugmakers long neglected in their hunt of new medicines. In testing, both Casgevy and Lyfgenia eliminated sickle cell’s characteristic pain crises, which can cause serious health problems, including death.', '“This is thrilling,” said Alexis Thompson, hematology division chief at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, in an interview Friday. “It could not be a more exciting day to not only have one, but two options to be considered.”', 'But the seven-figure price tags immediately raise questions about access, particularly for a patient population that’s regularly faced discrimination and barriers to care. While similar to the cost of gene therapies for other rare diseases, Casgevy and Lyfgenia are now among the most expensive medicines on the market.', 'Bluebird, in a statement, said it settled on Lyfgenia’s price “in recognition of the value the therapy may deliver through robust and sustained clinical benefits.” The company also cited the “lifetime impact” that reducing or eliminating pain crises could have on healthcare costs.', 'Those costs can be substantial. Pain crises can be serious enough to warrant long stays in the hospital, and the damage they wreak on the body leads to bone and organ complications. Both Bluebird and Vertex estimate the cost of managing sickle cell over a lifetime for someone with recurrent pain crises is between $4 million and $6 million.', 'To some insurers, preventing the regular hospital visits and other negative consequences associated with pain crises could be a compelling proposition. Bluebird and Vertex also say they are exploring “outcomes-based” contracts that link reimbursement to how well patients do on treatment.', 'However, many of the approximately 16,000 people Vertex estimates are eligible for Casgevy in the U.S. are covered by Medicaid. The government insurance program is limited in its ability to strike such outcomes-based deals by budget and price-reporting rules, although the Biden administration is planning a pilot to develop workarounds.', 'Bluebird plans to make a contract option available specifically to Medicaid agencies that’s able to tie Lyfgenia’s cost to performance. The biotechnology company said it is in “advanced discussions” with commercial payers and more than 15 state Medicaid agencies.', '""We feel very confident in how we priced Lyfgenia,"" Tom Klima, Bluebird bio\'s chief commercial and operating officer, said in a conference call Friday. ""We\'ve already been engaged with payers and have not seen any significant pushback.”', 'Treatment can come with other costs, too. Both Casgevy and Lyfgenia are made from patients’ own stem cells, which are collected and genetically modified in such a way that, when reinfused, they can curb red blood cell sickling. The process is long and intensive, involving testing, a preconditioning chemotherapy regimen and follow-up monitoring. Patients who travel to treatment centers for the therapies may face out-of-pocket expenses, such as for nearby lodging.', '“Cost is a worry, [as is] worrying about where to receive treatment,” said Victoria Gray, the first person with sickle cell to receive Casgevy in Vertex’s clinical trial.', '“If [Casgevy] was being offered at a hospital I was mistreated at, I wouldn’t have done it,” added Gray, who traveled to Tennessee to enroll in the study. “People may feel more comfortable doing it outside of town rather than at their usual place where they have been judged.”', 'Vertex said they have nine treatment centers across seven states and Washington, D.C., ready to offer Casgevy, while Bluebird said there are 27 sites qualified to provide Lyfgenia once it’s avalible early next year.', 'The preparatory chemotherapy regimen can also cause infertility. While Vertex plans to offer fertility support to commercially insured patients, a spokesperson said the company is unable to do the same for people in Medicaid. Freezing eggs and sperm can cost thousands of dollars, and in vitro fertilization even more.', 'Such hurdles may slow uptake of both therapies. Additionally, Lyfgenia comes with an FDA warning about the risk of blood cancer, and as a result requires blood monitoring every six months.', '“The dramatic difference in pricing, plus a black box warning, in our opinion, likely renders Casgevy the more appealing option for patients,” wrote Dae Gon Ha, an analyst at Stifel, in a note to clients. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets and Mizuho Securities also predicted Casgevy would have faster adoption, for similar reasons.', 'Shares in Bluebird fell 40% Friday, while Vertex’s stock was down 1%.

Today I will analyse the most recent data on General Electric’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.', ' See our latest analysis for General Electric ', 'Good news, investors! General Electric is still a bargain right now. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $163.95, but it is currently trading at US$121 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. However, given that General Electric’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.', ""Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Though in the case of General Electric, it is expected to deliver a highly negative earnings growth in the next few years, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. It appears that risk of future uncertainty is high, at least in the near term."", 'Are you a shareholder? Although GE is currently undervalued, the adverse prospect of negative growth brings about some degree of risk. Consider whether you want to increase your portfolio exposure to GE, or whether diversifying into another stock may be a better move for your total risk and return.', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on GE for some time, but hesitant on making the leap, I recommend you dig deeper into the stock. Given its current undervaluation, now is a great time to make a decision. But keep in mind the risks that come with negative growth prospects in the future.', ""With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

We'll use ROE to examine The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), by way of a worked example."", 'Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.', ' View our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies ', 'The formula for return on equity is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Estée Lauder Companies is:', '9.0% = US$556m ÷ US$6.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.09 in profit."", 'One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As shown in the graphic below, Estée Lauder Companies has a lower ROE than the average (13%) in the Personal Products industry classification.', ""Unfortunately, that's sub-optimal. That being said, a low ROE is not always a bad thing, especially if the company has low leverage as this still leaves room for improvement if the company were to take on more debt. When a company has low ROE but high debt levels, we would be cautious as the risk involved is too high. You can see the 4 risks we have identified for Estée Lauder Companies by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here."", 'Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.', 'Estée Lauder Companies clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.34. The combination of a rather low ROE and significant use of debt is not particularly appealing. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.', 'Return on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.', 'But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.', 'But note: Estée Lauder Companies may not be the best stock to buy.

The US labor market surged after the Covid recession in 2022. Unemployment rates went down with a surge in job creation in the market. The job growth in the market can be attributed to policy interventions such as unemployment insurance reform and economic impact payments. These initiatives facilitated a much faster recovery compared to previous economic downturns."", 'Despite the positive trajectory in the US job market, inflationary shocks continued to present a significant challenge. In 2022, payroll employment surged by 4.3% and the average nominal wage increased by 5.4%, but this growth was challenged by a significant 8% rise in inflation. Rising inflation rates resulted in a decline in real wages, ultimately affecting the living standards of most Americans. This trend of inflationary shocks is particularly concerning in states including California, Arizona, and Colorado, as they are currently experiencing the highest inflation rates in the US.', 'The United States is one of the most expensive countries in the world. With rising inflation, the cost of living has become one of the biggest challenges faced by families living in the US.

According to an article by Bloomberg, published on November 27, the price of buying the same goods and services for a family has increased to $119.27 from $100 after the pandemic. The prices in the US have surged since early 2020, surpassing levels not seen in a decade before the pandemic. Since January 2020, grocery prices have risen 25%, and rents have increased by nearly 20% in 2023. These price hikes have left the residents dissatisfied with the economy and their living standards. Housing affordability has plunged to its lowest level. Homeownership has become out of reach for many Americans, as median home prices continue to climb.

But as the year rolled on, value retreated and growth stocks yet again prevailed. This was mostly due to the AI-fueled rally that boosted major tech stocks like Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, among others. T. Rowe Price in its report titled Why Value Stocks Are Becoming More Competitive Again published in February 2023 said that value stocks “came back with a vengeance” in 2022 and the strengths of value stocks were expected to continue. The MSCI World Value Index outperformed its growth counterpart by more than 20 percentage points in 2022. T. Rowe Price correctly predicted at the time that it believed inflation will ease in 2023. But it also said that chances of very low interest rates were negligible in the near future as the firm believes we are entering an era of elevated inflation and rates. The T. Rowe Price report said that when rates are high, investors tend to favor current earnings instead of future earnings, and this environment bodes well for value stocks.', 'But despite these expectations, growth stocks crushed value stocks in 2023. Questions are now arising about the future of value investing. Despite being a value investor, David Einhorn last year said value investing might never recover. Einhorn was lamenting the fact that in today’s financial markets, using traditional metrics to value companies and caring about intrinsic value of stocks is no more relevant.', 'On the other hand, Tom Hancock, GMO’s portfolio manager, gave an interesting perspective on value investing in a program on CNBC. Hancock said that value investing doesn’t mean just focusing on low-priced indexes and multiples. According to Hancock intrinsic value is what matters the most. He said our focus should be the companies that can grow with high return on capital and are reasonably priced.', 'While the value versus growth debate might never end, one thing remains constant: investing in companies with solid businesses that can grow over time has been rewarding over longer periods of time. This is a game mastered by elite hedge funds, and in this article we decided to take a look at some value stocks with low PE ratios attracting the interest of hedge fund managers.', 'Photo by Kaleidico on Unsplash', 'Methodology', 'For this article we first used a stock screener to identify value stocks with PE ratios under 15.

(DAL) reversed course in the third quarter, falling 24% from its highs in July. The airlines in general were hurt from rising commodity prices that are leading to increased cost per available seat mile (CASM). Historically, airlines have passed on higher fuel prices to customers with a lag. We see Delta as a premium global consumer brand that is materially misunderstood by the market. The market still sees airlines as a cyclical, bankruptcy prone industry. An improved supply-demand picture, management discipline and a better business mix make Delta a more resilient business. Their loyalty program with American Express is a source of stable and growing revenues with $6.5B in remunerations this year with a goal of reaching $10B by the end of the contract in 2028. Premium and ancillary service revenue should generate 65-70% of the total in the next year or two. The company should continue to generate consistent mid-teens returns on capital. As the market begins to understand, we believe the company will continue to be rewarded. On top of this, free cash flow is expected to expand generating a cumulative ~$11B from ’23-’25, or one-half of its current market cap.

Before making this announcement, Aflac was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.', 'EPS is set to fall by 2.6% over the next 12 months. If the dividend continues along the path it has been on recently, we estimate the payout ratio could be 26%, which is comfortable for the company to continue in the future.', 'The company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.70 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.00. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 11% over that duration. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.', ""Some investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. However, Aflac has only grown its earnings per share at 3.1% per annum over the past five years. If Aflac is struggling to find viable investments, it always has the option to increase its payout ratio to pay more to shareholders."", 'In summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. The company is generating plenty of cash, and the earnings also quite easily cover the distributions. However, it is worth noting that the earnings are expected to fall over the next year, which may not change the long term outlook, but could affect the dividend payment in the next 12 months. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.', ""Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable.

Today I will analyse the most recent data on Sherwin-Williams’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.', ' View our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams ', 'According to my valuation model, Sherwin-Williams seems to be fairly priced at around 7.21% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Sherwin-Williams today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $270.33, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Sherwin-Williams’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.', ""Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Sherwin-Williams' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 22%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value."", 'Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in SHW’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on SHW, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.', ""If you want to dive deeper into Sherwin-Williams, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.
