AYI is making significant strides in its Lighting and Spaces businesses with a solid strategy. Its focus on innovation through product vitality and increasing service levels for the benefit of customers has delivered strong results.During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the company launched Design Select to elevate its services for the specification community.

This development is in line with the current refrigeration industry’s rising demand for CO2 solutions, where digital controls ensure safety, efficiency, reliability and cost savings for customers.Story continuesHeadwindsThe company operates in a highly competitive industry that is affected by volatility owing to a number of general business and economic factors, such as gross domestic product growth, employment levels, credit availability, energy costs and commodity costs. During third-quarter fiscal 2023, the company reported net sales of $1.0 billion, falling 5.7% from $1.1 billion reported in the prior-year period. The downside was due to declines in sales within ABL segment, consistent with lead-time normalization trends and the impact of the wider macro-environment.

Although the incremental cost of the technology is relatively low, real cost of installation of that technology is still growing.Key PicksSome top-ranked stocks from the Zacks Construction sector are: Dycom Industries, Inc.

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.85%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.14%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 5.61%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the insurance company had gained 5.19% over the past month. This has outpaced the Finance sector's gain of 3.29% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 3.18% in that time.Unum will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be August 1, 2023. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.86, down 2.62% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $3.07 billion, up 0.92% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $7.49 per share and revenue of $12.3 billion, which would represent changes of +20.61% and +2.41%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Unum. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.01% higher. Unum is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Digging into valuation, Unum currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 6.35. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 11.86, so we one might conclude that Unum is trading at a discount comparatively.Story continuesWe can also see that UNM currently has a PEG ratio of 0.76. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. Insurance - Accident and Health stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 1.67 based on yesterday's closing prices.The Insurance - Accident and Health industry is part of the Finance sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 34, putting it in the top 14% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

STNE and Varex Imaging Corp. VREX.5 Low Price-to-Book Stocks Worth Buying in JulyWhen evaluating a company's value, investors mostly look at a stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) or price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio. While P/E is the ratio of annual earnings to stock price, P/S reflects the amount investors pay for each dollar of revenues generated by the company.Though P/E and P/S valuation tools are more commonly used for stock selection, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is also an easy-to-use metric for identifying low-priced stocks with high-growth prospects.P/B is the ratio of stock price to book valueIt is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equityThe P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks that have high growth prospects. Magna International, Paramount Group, Unum Group,StoneCo Ltd. and Varex Imaging Corp. are some such stocks.Now let us understand the concept of book value.Understanding Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company's balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders' equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company's balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.Story continuesA P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and, therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.For example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock's price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses — like finance, investments, insurance, and banking or manufacturing companies — with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&amp;D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Here are our five picks out of the nine stocks that qualified the screening:Based in Aurora, Canada, Magna International is a manufacturer and supplier of complete automotive components.

GIII, StoneCo Ltd. STNE, Unum Group UNM and Magna International Inc. MGA.Pick These 4 Low P/CF Stocks to Garner Superior ReturnsWe always try to hit the jackpot while picking stocks. But striking the right chord each time is not easy unless blessed with Midas touch. When it comes to the investment market, experts consider value style as one of the most effective approaches. Value investing is essentially about selecting stocks that have good things going on for them, even at a time when they have been beaten down by some external factors.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock's inherent strength but a random selection of ratios cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company's financial position. For this, we recommend Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) as one of the key metrics. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis — the lower the number, the better. G-III Apparel Group, Ltd., StoneCo Ltd., Unum Group and Magna International Inc. boasts a low P/CF ratio.Price to Cash Flow Reveals Financial HealthQuestions may arise as to why we are considering the Price to Cash Flow valuation metric, when the most widely used metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, what makes P/CF stand out is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly reflecting the financial health of a company.Analysts caution that a company's earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. It is net cash flow that reveals how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is putting the same to use.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company's liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, shell out for its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Then again, a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company's liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.Story continuesWhat's the Best Strategy?An investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and also consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.Here are four of the eight stocks that qualified the screening.G-III Apparel, which designs, sources, and markets women's and men's apparel, sports a Zacks Rank #1.

REUTERS/Marco BelloThe result kicked off a closely watched earnings season where banks of all sizes will be trying to show that they recovered from one of the most challenging periods for the industry since the 2008 financial crisis.JPMorgan demonstrated its hold over the rest of the industry during the chaos of the spring by winning a government-run auction to purchase the bulk of operations of First Republic after regulators seized the San Francisco lender.First Republic was one of three sizable regional banks to fail, along with Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Their seizures triggered a panic in the banking system and outflows of depositors from a number of smaller banks.First Republic added a net of $2.4 billion in income to JPMorgan in the quarter, the bank said Friday.JPMorgan’s results demonstrated that it is still able to make lots of money from its loans while leaning on its sprawling franchises to generate additional revenue.Its net interest income, which measures the difference between what it charges to make loans and pays for deposits, rose 44% from a year ago to $21.9 billion.Many of its smaller rivals are revising down their expectations of how much net interest income they can earn due to rising deposit costs and high interest rates from the Federal Reserve.JPMorgan’s results, however, do point to some challenges that the entire industry is facing at the moment.It set aside $2.9 billion to cover future loan losses, which were up 163% from a year ago, a sign the bank expects the economy to slow in the coming quarters. Many banks are expected to add more such provisions to their second quarter results.Story continuesThe bank also struggled with trading and a recent drought of deal making that is making day-to-day life more difficult for Wall Street. Its investment banking fees fell by 6% from a year ago to $1.5 billion. Its trading revenues from equities and fixed income also fell.Some of its rivals that depend even more heavily on this revenue, such as Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS), are expected to be particularly challenged by this recent slowdown. They both report results next week.Across the industry, global investment banking revenues for the second quarter fell by 52% from a year ago, according to Dealogic.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

DotDash Meredith has shown some recovery from January ad-recession lows as it continues to migrate Meredith’s print publications to its digital platform.

Shares performed well in the first quarter following strong year-end business results and expectations for strong growth in 2023.We remain optimistic about the prospects for MGM because:We expect growth prospects in Las Vegas, which represent approximately 65% of the company’s cash flow, to remain strong due to strength in business group and convention activity, an increase in international visitation, and events throughout the calendar year (concerts, shows, and sports such as Formula 1 racing), which should appeal to leisure travelers…” (Click here to read the full text)MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) ranks among the likes of FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), CNX Resources Corporation (NYSE:CNX), and Warner Bros.

Given U.S. Bancorp's substantial exposure to commercial and industrial loans, as well as tighter lending standards, the company’s lending book is likely to have been affected.This is likely to have negatively influenced the average earning asset balance for the second quarter. Notably, management expects average earning assets between $600 billion and $605 billion, indicating a decline from the $607.6 billion recorded in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $610.89 billion for average interest-earning assets indicates a 6.7% sequential improvement.Story continuesThe Federal Reserve raised interest rates by another 25 basis points in the June-ended quarter. The policy rate now stands at a 15-year-high of 5-5.25%.In the first quarter, USB’s deposit mix became slightly unfavorable, with the composition of interest-bearing deposits increasing. This, along with higher interest rates, is likely to have increased funding costs in the quarter. Moreover, the investment securities portfolio balance declined in first-quarter 2023, having offered limited scope for growth in interest income in the second quarter.Hence, these are anticipated to have a negative impact on the NII and net interest margin (NIM).The consensus estimate for NII suggests a 3.2% sequential decline to $4.58 billion. The company projects a NIM (FTE basis) of 3%, whereas it recorded 3.1% in the first quarter.Non-Interest Income: Market volatility and client activity were subdued in the second quarter due to the Congressional debate over the debt ceiling. Also, the risks of an economic downturn/recession, the central bank’s hawkish monetary policy stance to stem out “sticky” inflation and geopolitical concerns led to ambiguity among investors.Thus, these factors resulted in lower volatility in equity markets and other asset classes. Hence, USB is likely to have recorded a weak performance in trading revenues this time. This is expected to have hindered commercial product revenues.Mortgage originations, both purchase and refinancing, continued to decline in the second quarter. Mortgage banking revenues have also been facing tough comps from the prior year, which were boosted by lower mortgage rates. In the to-be-reported quarter, mortgage rates continued to rise, with the rate on 30-year fixed mortgage reaching 6.81% in June, up from the 4.6% reported in the prior-year quarter.Higher mortgage rates, which kept home buyers on the sidelines, led to a smaller origination volume. These factors are likely to have weighed on USB’s mortgage banking revenues. Nonetheless, a favorable change in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights is expected to have aided such revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for mortgage banking revenues is pegged at $143 million, suggesting an 11.7% sequential rise.The consensus mark for trust and investment management fees is pegged at $600 million, indicating a sequential rise of 1.7%. The consensus mark of $327 million indicates marginal rise from the prior quarter in revenues from service charges on deposits.Rising rates and high inflation are expected to have increased transactions and spend volumes. This, along with the acquisition of MUFG Union Bank, is likely to have supported USB’s card fees in the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $390 million, indicating an 8.3% increase from the prior quarter’s reported figure.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the total non-interest income is pegged at $2.66 billion, implying a rise of 6.2% on a sequential basis.Expenses: As USB continues to invest in digital initiatives, payment capabilities and technology modernization, such costs are likely to have weighed on its expense base to some extent in the to-be-reported quarter. Moreover, higher merger and integration costs and the negative impacts of MUFG Union Bank’s operating expenses are expected to have increased costs.Management expects non-interest expenses (excluding merger and integration charges) of $4.3-$4.4 billion, whereas it reported $4.3 billion in the first quarter. The estimate includes core deposit intangibles amortization related to the Union Bank acquisition of $120 million. The company anticipates merger and integration charges between $250 million and $300 million.Asset Quality: With expectations of economic slowdown due to macroeconomic headwinds, USB is expected to have built reserves in the second quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total non-performing assets of $1.26 billion implies a 7.1% jump from the prior quarter.What the Zacks Model PredictsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for U.S. Bancorp this time around.

15,8298d911-bb46-3e01-ae3a-3ef3cdda6667,USB,2023-07-14,Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fifth-third-bancorp-fitb-earnings-140049777.html,1689256849,STORY,"['FITB', 'USB']","[The market expects Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 20. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.83 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +5.1%.Revenues are expected to be $2.18 billion, up 8.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 7.09% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Fifth Third Bancorp?For Fifth Third Bancorp, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.30%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Fifth Third Bancorp will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Fifth Third Bancorp would post earnings of $0.79 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.78, delivering a surprise of -1.27%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Fifth Third Bancorp doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, U.S. Bancorp (USB) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.13 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +3.7%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $7.16 billion, up 19.6% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for U.S. Bancorp has been revised 7.7% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.39%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that U.S. Bancorp will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We're proud of these results and the efforts of our employees whom we call partners. I'll now turn the call over to Mike to provide details of our fourth quarter results.J. Michael HansenThank you, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal '23 fourth quarter revenue was $2.28 billion compared to $2.07 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate, adjusted for acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 10.3%. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 was $1.77 billion compared to $1.6 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 9.1%. As we've done in the past, I will share revenue mix of the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment for the fourth quarter. Keep in mind, there can be small fluctuations in mix between quarters. Uniform Rental was 48%, dust was 18%; hygiene was 16%; shop towels were 4%; linen, which includes microfiber wipes, towels and aprons was 10%; and catalog revenue was 4%. These percentages are consistent with last year, which speaks to the robust demand across all of our products and services. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the fourth quarter was $249.8 million compared to $218.2 million last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 14.1%. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All Other revenue was $261.5 million compared to $226.2 million last year. The Fire business revenue was $173.5 million, and the organic revenue growth rate was 17.3% resulting in a strong finish to the year. The Uniform Direct Sale business revenue was $88 million, and the organic growth rate was 11.5%. This strong performance exceeded our expectations as robust demand continued for these products and services. Gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 was $1.09 billion, compared to $946.2 million last year, an increase of 15.1%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 47.7% and for the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 compared to 45.6% last year, an increase of 210 basis points. Energy expenses comprised of gasoline, natural gas and electricity were a tailwind, decreasing 65 basis points from last year. Strong volume growth from new customers and the penetration of existing customers with more products and services help generate great operating leverage. Gross margin percentage by business was 47.7% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 51% for First Aid and Safety Services, 47.9% for Fire Protection Services and 36% for Uniform Direct Sale. Fourth quarter SG&amp;A was 27.1%, which was up 100 basis points from last year. We've continued to invest in selling resources and branding initiatives, and our insurance costs were higher. We are self-insured, which means our insurance costs can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. Fourth quarter operating income was $470.8 million compared to $404.4 million last year. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 20.6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 compared to 19.5% in last year's fourth quarter. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 22.4% compared to 22.8% last year. Net income for the fourth quarter was $346.2 million compared to $294.5 million last year. This year's fourth quarter diluted EPS was $3.33 compared to $2.81 last year. I'll now turn the call back over to Todd to provide his thoughts and our financial expectations for fiscal '24.Todd M. SchneiderThank you, Mike. As we move into fiscal '24, we will celebrate our 40th anniversary of being a publicly traded company. Back then, we were excited about what laid ahead. Today, we are equally excited about the significant opportunities that the future holds. Our value proposition remains strong, and our prospects for continued profitable growth are great. Every business, goods producing or services providing has a need for image, safety, cleanliness and compliance. We work with businesses to help them build a better Workday. We provide the products and perform the services better, faster and more economically freeing businesses to concentrate on their core competency. A year ago, I introduced 3 priorities: branding, ESG and technology to help drive our focus, continue to differentiate us in the marketplace and provide increased competitive advantages. I'm pleased with our progress in each of these key areas. Our branding efforts continue as more and more businesses have learned how we can help them get Ready for the Workday. We continue to make progress on our ESG goals and our sustainable solutions focus on reducing, reusing, recycling and repurposing our textiles. These solutions continue to resonate with our customers and prospects as we help them achieve their sustainability initiatives. I want to spend a minute speaking about technology, in particular, our digital transformation journey. We've been very successful thus far in using technology to drive efficiencies in our production facilities, efficiencies out on the routes with our trucks via our proprietary SmartTruck technology, and we are in the early innings of our myCintas customer portal, which makes it easier for our customers to do business with us. As we look to the future, we're very excited to have great technology partners in SAP and Verizon, which are helping us to provide a better customer experience and improve efficiencies within our business. We are excited to announce today that we have an additional strategic technology partner with Google, leveraging their Google Cloud platform. As a result of these relationships, it positions us at the forefront of technology innovation. We are still in the very early stages of our digital transformation journey, and we are excited about the impact it will have on our customers and our company in total. We are confident technology will have -- will be a competitive advantage for us now and well into the future. I will now provide our guidance for fiscal '24. Our fiscal year '24 -- for our fiscal year '24, we expect our revenue to be in the range of $9.35 billion to $9.5 billion, a total growth rate of 6.1% to 7.8%. We expect diluted EPS to be in the range of $13.85 to $14.35, a growth rate of 6.6% to 10.5%. Please note the following: fiscal year '24 interest expense is expected to be approximately $98 million compared to $109.5 million in fiscal year '23, predominantly as a result of lower variable rate debt. This may change as a result of future share buybacks or acquisition activity. Our fiscal '24 effective tax rate is expected to be 21.3% compared to a rate of 20.4% for fiscal '23. The higher effective tax rate negatively impacts fiscal '24 EPS guidance by about $0.16 and diluted EPS growth by about 120 basis points. Guidance does not include any future share buybacks or significant economic disruptions or downturns. And guidance include the impact of having one more workday in fiscal '24 compared to fiscal '23. This extra workday comes in our fiscal third quarter. We're excited about next year and beyond. The future of Cintas remains bright. I'll turn the call back over to Jared.Jared S. MattingleyThat concludes our prepared remarks. Now we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up as needed. Thank you.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And our first question today comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan Securities.Andrew Charles SteinermanI'd like to talk about net realized price as part of the organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter and into the guide. And I think you might need to remind me, I think there's no explicit gas surcharge that Cintas puts on, but obviously, gas prices are down year-over-year. And how does that factor into pricing? And just overall, how has Cintas done in terms of raising price to their B2B customers versus the input costs?Todd M. SchneiderAndrew, thanks for the question. Yes, good question. We're -- from a pricing standpoint, as we have spoken about in past quarters is our pricing has been certainly above historical during fiscal '23. And it needed to be because of the cost inputs. When we think about what that will look like moving forward in our '24 guide, we expect that pricing will return closer to historical and our cost inputs are in a similar spot, as you saw in the CPI report that came out yesterday and the PPI report that came out this morning. We are seeing inflation coming down. I think our team has done a pretty amazing job of managing input costs, both our operational team but our supply chain team which has really benefited us. So it's -- we do not rely upon pricing as the only lever to gain leverage to expand margin. We are committed to extracting out inefficiencies in our business, and you're seeing that. And you've seen that in fiscal '23. And our guide for fiscal '24 reflects incremental -- attractive incremental margins, and we're going to do it successfully, and we're going to expect that in efficiencies in our business to help us expand margins.J. Michael HansenAndrew, I might just add 2 things. One, specifically, we do not have a fuel surcharge. And secondly, you made a comment about our price increases offsetting input costs and I think the best way to think about that is margins in the fourth quarter were up 110 basis points. Margin for the fiscal '23 year were up 70 basis points and our guidance implies margin improvement throughout the range of guidance for next year. So keep that in mind as we think about pricing versus input costs, et cetera, we're still raising margins, improving margins.OperatorOur next question will come from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank Securities.Faiza AlwyI wanted to talk about the type of economic or macro environment that you're embedding in your guide. I know you said that significant economic disruptions or downturn is not assumed, but give us a sense of what type of economic environment you're assuming?Todd M. SchneiderFaiza, thank you for the question. We're not guiding towards a significant economic disruption. Trying to predict economic indicators is certainly very challenging. But I can tell you what's going on, what we're seeing in our business, which is we haven't seen much change in our customer behavior. Our sales productivity is very good. Our customer retention levels remain quite strong. And there is -- there's still really good interest in our products and our services. No-programmers are still going very well. And there's still the majority of the new accounts that we sell. So we like that very much. We like expanding the pie and those customers are seeing value in what we're providing. And we also like our vertical strategy that -- the vertical sales strategy that has been working quite nicely for us. So I would say, reasonably so, business as usual is what we would expect. We recognize there will be ups and downs in macro environments, but we're not guiding towards anything -- any economic downturn.Faiza AlwyGreat. And then if I could just follow up on the -- you mentioned the Google partnership. Maybe give us a sense of where you see that partnership going over the next few years? What some of the benefits might be as you think about your digital transformation strategy?Todd M. SchneiderCertainly. Our relationship with Google gives us a better, faster, smarter, cheaper way to store our critical data but we see it as it can do so much more, due in large part because of the relationship that Google has with SAP and the relationship we have with SAP and now Google. As you all know, we have had a very successful relationship with SAP for over a decade now. And we've spoken in the past that it is much more than just a customer-vendor relationship. It's a strategic relationship. So you combine that with just a couple of months ago, SAP and Google announced that they have an expanded partnership. And what that's going to do is it's going to allow our SAP data to be connected with the Google Cloud data and analytics technology. which will give us access to their advanced AI and machine learning capabilities. So we're excited about that. it's going to -- we think we can benefit for many years to come as this type of relationship. But you asked, Faiza, for a few examples. So I'll give you a few to help give a little color around it. We see having these technologies connected, the opportunity to put in front of our sales organization instead of calling, I'll say, more blindly on who to try to sell our services to, we call it next best prospect for our sales team to have real technologies to push in front of them. Here's where you go spend your time. We think that's significant and can have an impact on our productivity and our retention and morale productivity, all those things, next best product for the customer. So instead of just trying to figure that out, we can put that in front of our sales team to -- and our service team to make sure that they're talking to our customers about the next best product that would fit based upon other customer behaviors. We think certain customer service functions could be enhanced nicely over the coming years. There is -- we all use Google Maps, and we see an opportunity to leverage Google Maps to even further enhance our SmartTruck technology to make routing even more dynamic, which will save us time, saves us energy, saves us -- allows for more time in front of our customers instead of on the road. And then just one more, I would say that our service team, we're blessed to have a lot of customers. We want to make sure that they're spending -- they're in front of the right customers at the right time. And we see the potential to leverage that type of technology to point them in the right direction to make sure that they're focused on any at-risk customers and customers that we need to enhance the effort with them with the people in front of them. So hopefully, that gives you a little color around it. Again, this is not -- we don't see this as an event. We see this as a process and in the coming years, we think it can be very impactful for our business and our customers.OperatorNext question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC.Ashish SabadraI wanted to turn down into the First Aid and Safety Services, we saw some material acceleration and growth there. I was wondering if you can talk about what's driving that strength. And then as we think about '24 any puts and takes that you would call out? Or how do we think about that momentum going forward?Todd M. SchneiderThank you, Ashish. I'll start, and if Mike wants to chime in. The First Aid and Safety business is going quite well. We really like that business. We've -- we see significant opportunities in the future there. And we're getting leverage there, really growth -- the strong growth is really helping us get some real leverage but the mix of business is very attractive. We spoke about during the peaks of the pandemic now, there was more PPE sales and safety sales. And the mix is now back to what we really like. It's a cabinet sales that are repeat in nature and higher margin. So we really like the mix, but the growth in total is great. And I would tell you that the value proposition is really resonating. Our customers are trying to make sure that they're reinvesting in their people. Health and wellness is a concept that is resonating very strongly in the marketplace, and we're leveraging that and benefiting from that. And on top of that, we're also -- we have inefficiencies in that business as well. So we're extracting out those inefficiencies. They're going to help us continue to expand our margins. But we like the position we're in. We like the tailwinds we have with the health and wellness, and we think the future is quite bright in that area.Ashish SabadraThat's very helpful color. I just wanted to drill down further on the vertical sales strategy. Obviously, you mentioned you're seeing some pretty good success on that front. I was wondering if you could drill down further on the key verticals. And then also on your healthcare initiative, how those are trending, but also any other verticals that you would call out.Todd M. SchneiderCertainly. Our key verticals where we're focusing our time is healthcare, education and government. We've organized around those verticals. We have products and services that are attractive to them. Certain service functions dedicated to them. And as a result, we're really benefiting from it. And we very much think that they're smart verticals to invest in. And as a result, they're growing really attractively. And customer retention is good. New business is good. And we think that there's a real long opportunity here for us to continue to invest in these into the future. Certainly, the demographics of healthcare are quite attractive. But education and government are doing well in addition, and we're going to continue to invest in those areas. So it's paying dividends for us.OperatorYour next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.Manav Shiv PatnaikGood. I think historically, you've talked about how almost 2/3 of that -- 2/3 of new sales come from those known programs. I just wanted an update that and kind of tied to that. What does the competitive environment look like? Have there been any changes? Because your 2 public comps, obviously, there's a lot of changes going on at each of the organizations.Todd M. SchneiderYes, Manav, you were -- I couldn't hear the first part, but I think I understand your question. I'll try to answer it. And if I don't, then please let me know. The no-programmers are -- it's going quite well. And it has historically been a significant portion of what we sell, and it continues to be a significant portion of what we sell. And we have products and services that are attractive to them. We have a sales effort that is, I'd say, skilled at identifying and delivering the message to those folks. And I think it's important to understand that with no-programmers, it's not always -- I would say rarely is it just all incremental new spend to them. Many, many cases, we are able to -- they're spending those dollars somewhere in many cases, with other vendors, maybe not a direct competitor, but they're spending money on compliance and image and safety and cleanliness, those types of things. And as a result, we're able to redirect those dollars to us, in many cases, save them money. So don't think of it all as ,oh my gosh, is there an end to that because if the economy, there's any stress in it that they're not going to be able to sell no-programmers, quite the opposite. We're -- we see a very, very long runway there. So that's attractive. As far as the competitive set, I mean, we operate in a very competitive industry, a very competitive environment. I would say I haven't seen any changes to the competitive landscape from that standpoint. So I'll leave it at that.Manav Shiv PatnaikOkay. And then just one quick follow-up I had -- I think I understand the Google partnership and the benefits it potentially brings with, any sense of time line? Like when does this start happening, when you get the data on the cloud and then you start seeing some of these benefits?Todd M. SchneiderWell, it's certainly going to be a process. We just entered into our relationship with them recently. We've had meetings with them to talk about where we're going to go here. And as I mentioned, it's not an event. It's a process. but we see some low-hanging fruit, I guess, is the best way to say it. But as we have gone down this path, more ideas are coming out. So we think we can benefit for years to come with this opportunity. And I won't go into too much detail just because we see some competitive advantages there. And so as a result, we'll keep those to ourselves. But we think the runway is long and attractive.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Josh Chan with UBS.Joshua K. ChanTodd, Mike and Jared, congrats on a strong quarter. Yes. My first question, when you are selling First Aid and Fire, basically those adjacent businesses, how much of that growth is selling to existing customers? And how much of it gets you kind of entirely new customers that don't run Uniform from you?Todd M. SchneiderYes. Josh, it's a good question. It's a mix. Cross-sell has been -- has been very helpful for us over the last number of years and will continue to be. But we love new customers. And the Fire and First Aid, there is some overlap, but not complete overlap. And so it allows us to get into speaking to customers about that. And the first time they may have done business with us at all. So -- and then we -- separately, we have an enterprise sales organization that will call a customer or prospect. And frankly, it doesn't really matter to us what they start with. It's whatever the customer is interested in. If a customer doesn't do any business with us and they want to start -- their interest is in Fire, wonderful, or if it's in First Aid, wonderful, or rental, garments, then we go where the interest is and then we expand out that relationship from there. So we love the fact that there isn't complete overlap, and it gets us into new opportunities and then we cross-sell like crazy.Joshua K. ChanGreat. That makes sense. Thanks for the color. And I guess for my follow-up, if I look at your incremental margin, it's climbed pretty steadily through 2023. I assume if you got better alignment between price and cost. So how are you thinking about the cadence of incremental margins looking into 2024?J. Michael HansenJosh, our incremental margin for the total company in fiscal '23 was 26.8%, a little bit up from the previous year. And Josh, it's -- there can be ups and downs from quarter-to-quarter in the way that we invest or in the cost that we see. And so we don't necessarily try to predict 1 quarter at a time. We do certainly believe we can get incremental operating margins in that 20% to 30% range from quarter-to-quarter generally, but it's going to go up and down, again, based on what we are doing within the business, some initiatives that we may or may not roll out. So the bigger focus for us is on the full year, and our goal is to get those incrementals attractive enough that it improves margins over the year. So I wouldn't call it linear at all. I wouldn't call it flat. It's going to be based on how we're managing the business.OperatorOur next question comes from Justin Hauke with R.W. Baird.Justin P. HaukeI wanted to -- I guess, my first question, maybe a follow-up on Andrew's question, just on the implied revenue growth, the 7% in 2024. And maybe you can kind of pull out the puts and takes, but that's coming off of a 12% you just did here in '23, and that was off of already a really strong 10%. 7% is more, I guess, kind of in line with kind of your long-term historical organic growth. And so -- maybe you can just give us the puts and takes. Is it all pricing that accounts for the delta because it sounds like your new business and retention and kind of existing sales are all still very strong. So I'm just trying to understand the moving pieces.Todd M. SchneiderThanks for the question, Justin. I'll try to answer and see if Mike wants to expand upon it. So when you think about our growth, Q4 growth was around 10%, which is really nice growth, especially considering a strong comp of last year of 12.7%, which was our strongest growth of the year, that year. So if you compare that 10% to the -- I'll call it the top end of our guide or in the mid-7s to higher-7s, you can think of that as really pricing returning back to closer to historical levels. And as I mentioned earlier, the reason that we see this as appropriate is we're seeing an easing of inflation and we saw that -- you can see that in the drop in the cost of energy that we've seen, the benefit we've received in Q4. And as I mentioned earlier, also you saw it in the CPI report yesterday and the PPI report today. So -- and as you appropriately said, I mean, we're guiding towards a more historical type of growth. Volume growth is really good still. Pricing will return closer to historical and appropriately so. But all that being said, we will still have -- we're guiding towards incremental margins and operating margin expansion. So pricing is a lever, but it's not our only lever available to us in order to expand margins.Justin P. HaukeOkay. No, that's helpful. I mean that's I guess, kind of what you were implying, but I wanted to clarify that, that was kind of the magnitude of the change. I guess the second question, just on the insurance cost increase, and maybe SG&amp;A as a percentage of revenue in general, how much of an impact was that in the quarter? And then is that kind of a run rate headwind that you'll face next year? And the reason why I ask is, obviously, you're implying margin expansion here, but your SG&amp;A as a percentage of revenue is still pretty low versus kind of pre-COVID levels. And so just trying to understand how much structural SG&amp;A leverage gain you have here versus returning to more of a normalized level?J. Michael HansenJustin, because we are self-insured, those claims can -- they can kind of move up and down throughout the year. There's nothing that we would say is structural related to that. It's just a product of being self-insured. We ended the year at 26.9% in SG&amp;A -- that is, oh gosh, a couple of hundred basis points maybe lower than pre-COVID in the last few years, and you've heard us speak about this. Look, we've worked hard to get it to that level, and we don't want to get back to historical levels. So our expectation is we're going to continue to find ways to better leverage SG&amp;A, particularly G&amp;A to make sure that it contributes to our margin expansion into the future. So we're going to continue to work hard to look for opportunities to bring it down and do not expect it to return to those higher 20 places that we were in pre-COVID.OperatorAnd we'll hear next from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.Keen Fai TongYou mentioned there hasn't been much change in customer behaviors based on what you're seeing. Can you elaborate on how customer budgets, sales cycles in the sales pipeline are evolving with the current environment?Todd M. SchneiderGeorge, yes. It's a pretty -- the environment hasn't changed significantly. The health of customers is -- varies based upon geographic, what type of business they're in, small, medium, large, those types of things. But generally speaking, the sales process and has not elongated, the sales pipe looks very good. We like the spot we're in. And we have invested appropriately. We're in the right -- we've got the right products and services. We've got the right focus on our customers, and we think that we're well positioned for the future. And we certainly are trying to make sure that we're planning for the long-term. And we're -- as I mentioned earlier, not trying to be an economic forecasting business, but we are making sure that we're watching our business very closely and hoping for clear sailing ahead with the economy. That being said, we will find a way to be successful as we have in the past.Keen Fai TongGot it. That's helpful. And then I wanted to drill down further into your healthcare vertical, which you touched on earlier, COVID certainly provided a notable lift to the healthcare business. Can you talk a little bit about how quickly the healthcare business is growing, what new business trends there look like and what mix of revenue we currently represent?Todd M. SchneiderCertainly, George. The healthcare business is -- has been strong for us for a number of years. And it has -- in it's large part not just having a sales focus, but organizing around those customers, products, services, our service organization. So it's more than just sales. It is making sure that we look at it as a business. And it's growing -- it's accretive to our growth rates. We see a very long runway there. As I mentioned earlier, the demographics are really attractive. But the pipeline of sales growth looks robust. And that's because of years of investment in making sure we're really well positioned, and we see that continuing.Keen Fai TongGot it. And just the mix of revenue?J. Michael HansenI don't have that in front of us, George, right now. In the past, it's been about 7%. And it's -- I'd say that it's growing faster than average.OperatorYour next question comes from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair.Timothy Michael MulrooneyOn the First Aid business, specifically, pre-pandemic operating margins were closer to 15%. They went down several hundred basis points. I know from the sell through a lower-margin PP&amp;E in '21 and '22. But now it looks like you're sitting at 19%. I mean that's a big jump from pre-pandemic levels. Would you expect, I guess, micro tie a little bit of a give back at some point? Or do you expect to keep and build on those margin gains that you've made this year?Todd M. SchneiderYes, Tim, we do not expect to give back. We expect to maintain and build on those improvements. And we're leveraging certainly the total growth, the benefits of health and wellness being important to people in the marketplace. The mix of business being attractive. And we've fundamentally focused on extracting out inefficiencies in the business. So -- and we're not giving those back. So yes, we see -- the future is bright for that business. .Timothy Michael MulrooneyYes. Okay. It was more than just sales mix. It sounds like you did some structural things. But I have a question...J. Michael HansenWe've talked a lot about the mix certainly returning, and that's being -- that's a big part of it. But as Todd mentioned, we've -- our First Aid Safety partners have a lot of things going on in terms of business improvement opportunities from sourcing better to routing better, to sales productivity improving, to penetration opportunities. There's a lot going on in that business. And we've attributed a lot, you're correct, to the revenue mix, and that has been important in terms of the [tide] of the pandemic to today. But there's also a lot that's going on in the business that is working towards structural improvements in the business that create long-term efficiencies and you're seeing that. And that's why we don't expect to give it back. There's nothing that we are underspending or under-investing in to get these margins. These are real business improvements that are sustainable. And that's what we love about the business. It has been growing nicely. It's resonating with our prospects and customers. And it's pretty exciting to think about that business in our fiscal '24 topping $1 billion for the first time. So we do love the business, and there's a lot of good work going on there.Timothy Michael MulrooneyThat is exciting, and I appreciate the extra color there, Mike. That's very clear. If I could just shift gears really quickly. One of your competitors recently commented that they saw customer retention rates come down a little bit recently. But it was kind of more of a normalization, okay, like following a boost over the last several years, when things were good. Now that they are kind of back towards historical rates. I'm curious and some investors are curious if you guys saw something similar to any material degree, did you see retention rates kind of jump up a little bit in fiscal '22 and '23? And have you seen that pull back or normalize, so to speak, more recently?Todd M. SchneiderGreat question, Tim. So over the past few years, we've seen a nice improvement to our customer retention levels through the pandemic. We think that we handle that really strategically, intelligently and thought about the long-term. And we saw our customer satisfaction scores go up at that same time. And we've continued to see those same levels of customer satisfaction and retention levels. So no, we have not seen a change from that standpoint. And we're always working on improving our business and making sure that we are super focused on making sure we're taking great care of our customers and staying attention -- or attentive to their needs, is a big part of what makes us successful. So we've not seen a change, and we're focused on making sure that doesn't happen.OperatorWe'll hear next from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.Kartik MehtaI wanted to ask your expectations for add-stops as we go into fiscal '24. It seems as though companies are starting to slow down their hiring. And I'm wondering what type of impact that's included in the guidance or what you're anticipating?Todd M. SchneiderKartik, we have not seen a change to our add-stops metrics, and we are -- expect that, that will continue. We're -- part of it is because of the diversity of our customer base, not just good producing, services providing and the broadness of our customer base. We're not dependent upon any one particular area and we expect to grow in multiples of GDP. And all that being said, we expect that add-stops metrics will continue on its path.Kartik MehtaPerfect. And then Mike, you might have said this, so I apologize if you already talked about this. But just the impact from energy costs in FY '24 versus FY '23, what you've included or anticipated.J. Michael HansenSo let me -- I'll give you a couple of numbers. Fourth quarter total energy for the total company was 1.8% for the fourth quarter. For the year, that was 2.2%. So for the year -- this year -- fiscal '23 compared to '22, it was down 10 basis points. So it's roughly flattish. As we think about '24, look, the prices at the pump spiked in June of last year. And so our first quarter numbers of last year were fairly high. And so we may get a little bit of a tailwind in Q1 and then our expectation is we'll turn roughly flattish.OperatorNext, we'll hear from Seth Weber with Wells Fargo.Seth Robert WeberI wanted to just circle back to the revenue guidance point again for a second. I'm just -- it sounds like First Aid Safety and the Fire business both have very strong momentum, so I'm just trying to understand the construct of the revenue guide, whether you think all 3 segments will be in that kind of 6% to 8% range or will there be some above and some below to kind of put out to that 6% to 8% range? Because it seems like there's still a lot of momentum in the First Aid Safety and Fire business.Todd M. SchneiderWell, Seth, we like the momentum in all of our businesses. So will there be some above, some below? Yes. But it's -- but generally speaking, we see in the mid- to high single digits would be probably where you can think of it. And it's -- and as I mentioned earlier, the -- we're up against comps that are significant, partly because of pricing being above historical in the past, well above historical, now it being closer to historical.Seth Robert WeberOkay. Maybe, Mike, a follow-up question just on CapEx. It's kind of pushing up towards that 4%-ish number again. Is that the right way to think about it for fiscal '24? And then can you just give us any color on what that -- whether that's brick-and-mortar or whether just where that spending might be going, from a capacity perspective or whatnot?J. Michael HansenSure. Yes, we would expect 3.5% to 4% of revenue. Look, when we've had a really good couple of years of volume growth, we have capacity needs in certain places. Capacity is local in our business, but we have capacity needs. And we want to continue to invest for growth. And so there will be everything from added washers and dryers and specific wash alleys to some of a few brick-and-mortar new buildings and other investments in the business that allow us to continue to have the capacity we need to grow. So it is kind of back to that historical 3.5% to 4% range. That would be our expectation.OperatorAnd we'll move next to Heather Balsky with Bank of America.Heather Nicole BalskyI know you've got a question earlier about sort of the trend in sales and the difference is related to pricing. I'm curious, focusing specifically on the Uniforms business. You've been growing organically 9% to -- and 11% the last few quarters. You presumably were well past the COVID recovery period. I'm just curious what's enabled you to drive that outperformance versus kind of pre-COVID levels? And if you think that's sustainable going forward?Todd M. SchneiderHeather. So yes, our Uniform Rental business is performing quite well. We've -- we think we have invested appropriately in the sales organization. We really like where we're going there. We like the productivity levels. They've continued to go up. And there's plenty of inputs to productivity and it's whether it's products that we launch, services that we launch, the retention levels of our people, the leadership of the organization to make sure that we're driving items that make them more successful. So new is going well, and our service organization is doing an outstanding job with customer retention, making sure, as I mentioned earlier, our customer satisfaction scores are near all-time highs. And as a result of that, our lost business, our customer retention, the appropriate way to say it. Our customer retention is really attractive. So our new is up and our customer retention is improved over pre-COVID levels. So those are big for us and having a really positive impact on the business.Heather Nicole BalskyGreat. That's really helpful. And I feel like I have to ask an AI question here. You guys talked about being early in your digital transformation journey. Are you guys looking at any investments on the AI side in terms of efficiencies and sort of behind the scenes type benefit? I'm just curious.Todd M. SchneiderYes, Heather, we're certainly investigating and investing in opportunities. And we think we're with the right partners. When you think about Verizon, SAP and Google, having those 3 as the -- our technology -- our strategic technology partners, we think we're with the right folks. And we don't just have a customer vendor relationship with them. We have a strategic relationship with them, and they're helping us -- they are and will help us to leverage those opportunities in the marketplace. So I can't lay out specifics for you, but I'll just tell you this, we're -- we see the opportunity to invest in that area, and we are doing so appropriately because we think it will pay big dividends. That being said, it will be -- we'll be speaking about this for many, many years to come because we think the benefit has a real -- has a lot of legs to it. .OperatorYour next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.Scott Andrew SchneebergerGuys, kind of a cautionary question. It sounds like things are going really well and recent economic indicators feel pretty good, but just curious to hear what the plan is if -- as your guidance expects no softness in the economy, how are you looking at what levers would you pull on the efficiency side? What should give us assurance you'll be in good shape if you're not able to get some of the leverage you've been getting on the top line?Todd M. SchneiderScott, let me make sure I understand. You're saying if we can't get to leverage or if the economic environment changes?Scott Andrew SchneebergerIf the economic environment dips in below kind of status quo and really deteriorate, just curious what kind of leverage you guys would pull to maintain the financial sense.Todd M. SchneiderYes. Certainly. Good question. I -- we have a very tenured, very experienced leadership team, management team that has been through the cycles. It seems like you name it, we've been through it, and we expect to be successful in all environments. Now -- so your question is a tough one to answer because the economic downturn, how deep is it? How long is it? How broad? And so trying to understand that is challenging. But we expect to be successful in all economic environments. If you're talking about a massive downturn in '08, '09, that might be different. But we're ready. We know how to do this. We have demonstrated our ability to be successful in all these different types of economic environments. We have grown our sales and profits in 52 -- in the last 54 years. And my expectation is we will absolutely do so and we will find and fight and a way to be successful in whatever economic environment. So plenty of levers available to us. And we think we've got the right team in place to manage that.Scott Andrew SchneebergerI appreciate that. And then for the follow-up, it's a bit of a 2-parter and one to your housekeeping. I was just curious, your -- thanks for answering on Seth's question on CapEx, what that will look like. Just other use of the capital as we head into fiscal '24, thoughts on buybacks, thoughts on M&amp;A, any other cleanup on the balance sheet you were considering? And then that second part would just be, if you could remind us what a one day -- one extra workday quantitative impact is that in fiscal '24 versus '23?J. Michael HansenSure. From a capital allocation, I'll start with our expectation is that cash flow is going to continue to be very good in fiscal '24. And secondly, our balance sheet is in great shape. We -- as of May 31, we have no variable debt. And so we can do a lot of things with great cash flow and a great balance sheet. We would love to use that on M&amp;A if the opportunities come along, and we'll be as -- we'll be as aggressive as we can be in terms of looking for them and making sure that they come at the right value, but we love that opportunity. Buyback is another great opportunity, again, with good cash flow and a great balance sheet, we can put that cash to work, and we certainly could do it in the form of a buyback. So look, our capital allocation philosophy and strategy hasn't changed. And with -- again, with a healthy balance sheet and a healthy cash flow, we can do some good things with that as we look forward to fiscal '24. Your second question of the one workday for a fiscal year. In this case, it would be about a 40 basis point benefit to growth -- sales growth. And think about it as about a 12 basis point benefit on bottom line on operating margin.OperatorYour next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel Nicolaus.Shlomo H. RosenbaumTodd, I wanted to just ask a little bit more on kind of the hiring environment at your clients. You said you're not expecting it to change. It's been a very strong hiring environment for the last several years since that kind of initial dip in COVID. Is there a way that you think about it in your mind in terms of the strong hiring environment and just kind of clients adding personnel driving some of that revenue growth, particularly in the Rental Uniforms division? Or do you think it's really a lot more of the company's own efforts in terms of cross-selling, finding new customers and pricing? Then I have a follow-up.Todd M. SchneiderGood question, Shlomo. We love it when our customers are hiring more employees and it certainly allows you to swim a little bit downstream then. But it's -- but we've got to find ways to add value to customers even when they're in the more flattish type environment. That being said, there is still almost 10 million job openings. So that's very encouraging. We'd love to see those jobs filled. But we are -- we're going to find a way to be successful whether our customers are hiring at rapid rates or at much lower rates, we're going to find a way to be successful. And that is impacted by our ability to -- we would call it cross-sell, bring more value to the customers in other products and services that they may have with maybe a new business unit, but maybe within that business unit, just selling more items. So there's a lot of inputs to that and how we categorize it. But we're -- we like the spot that we're in. And we think the products and services and the value proposition that we're providing is resonating with people and would certainly love the economic environment to continue or even improve.Shlomo H. RosenbaumOkay. Great. And then just on a follow-up. Maybe you could talk a little bit about the margin just on a sequential basis of looking at the First Aid and Safety. And then kind of the other division, you had a sequential decline despite revenue going up and the rental uniforms you have continuing to go up? Or was there something particular on the insurance side that hit the other divisions? Or is there some particular investments that are going on right now? Just if you can give a little bit of a sequential color on what's going on with the operating margins.J. Michael HansenSure, Shlomo. Look, the First Aid margin was at 18.8% in Q4, still a really healthy place to be. And nothing noteworthy other than growth is -- organic growth still is very good. Gross margin is still very good, and we continue to invest for the future. So nothing noteworthy there. From the All Other perspective, the Fire operating margin in Q4 was slightly over 20% and so that's a great place for us in that business. The direct sale business was 3.5%. So quite a bit lower. And that business can move up and down and have a little bit more volatility than the other businesses just because of the nature of it. We still love the business. It grew nicely, but mix can have an outsized effect on that operating margin and it sort of did in the fourth quarter. As we move forward, from a First Aid perspective, we still expect the really positive margins that we've seen as we've discussed a few minutes ago. And we still expect Fire to continue to perform very, very well like it has in fiscal '23.OperatorYour next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley.Toni Michele KaplanI wanted to follow up on First Aid growth. You talked about the cabinet business contributing it again, which is great. I was hoping you could talk about, is that sort of an industry penetration is growing? Or is it the product set relatively new. I know you're investing in it during COVID. Have you been sort of incentivizing your sales force to sell more cabinets? And are you taking share? Just wanted to get a sense on how long the sort of 20% growth in cabinets can continue and if there are any other factors you'd call out as well?Todd M. SchneiderThank you, Toni. We -- the answer is yes. All the above is what we're doing. We see a long runway in the First Aid business. We're -- the vast majority of what we sell are people that are do-it-yourself. There's -- as you think about, there's 16 million businesses in North America. There is a significant opportunity to sell our First Aid cabinet services, but our other services as well, whether they be AEDs, eyewash stations, those types of items that really have value to customers. And that health, safety, compliance tailwind, we don't see that changing. That's -- people are investing in their organizations, and we see that as a tailwind for many years to come. And the market is really, really big. So that's where we're -- we love the growth that we're seeing in that business, and we're continuing to invest appropriately to make sure that it continues.Toni Michele KaplanTerrific. And this should be a short one, but hoping you could talk about maybe the sensitivity of the business from inflation. So presumably, your costs come down as if inflation comes down, so how should we be thinking about maybe like the impact on margin for each point inflation comes down or however you want to frame the sensitivity there?J. Michael HansenToni, that's -- that's a really difficult thing to try to say 1 point of inflation equals x points of margin. That's pretty difficult to do. But I'd maybe say this. When you think about our cost structure, we've got a really nice mix of cost types, if you will. So we certainly have things like labor that are impacted by inflationary pressures. And we work very, very hard on that over the course of the last 5 years, I would say. And we're in a good spot. But then we also have this large part of our cost structure that is amortizing. And it allows us to effectively see any inflationary impacts coming if they are coming and plan for them accordingly. And so we may plan for that in terms of our pricing approach. We may plan for that in terms of other initiatives. But the point is because we're amortizing those costs, it takes a while for inflation to get to us. And during that period of time, we can plan and we can anticipate better. While we're on that bucket, I would say our global supply chain really does a nice job of not being single sourced. And so when there are some inflationary pressures in various parts of the world or in our supply chain, because we're not single source, we have the ability to move volume a little bit in flex, we have choices. And that's important for us. And it has been important for us over the course of the last 2 years in the high inflationary environment. And then the third bucket that I would throw out is sort of that infrastructure. We've got a large infrastructure, 400-plus locations around the country. And when we are growing really nicely, we're leveraging it very, very well, and we've done that over the course of the last few years. And so Toni, we're not a product company that is dramatically affected by today's inflation. And you hear us talk about pricing is just one lever that we have to get margin improvement. And that's because of, number one, we've got this sort of diverse cost structure. And number two, we've got a lot of initiatives and things that we're working on. And it gives us choices. And that's the -- that's really the key for us in terms of fighting inflation. So hopefully, that answers the question. It's not an easy metric for us because of the cost structure that we have and the initiatives that we have, and it also depends on where the inflation comes from.OperatorAnd this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Mattingley for any additional or closing remarks.Jared S. MattingleyThank you for joining us this morning. We will issue our first quarter fiscal '24 financial results in September. We look forward to speaking you -- speaking with you again at that time. Thanks.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending.]"

But a welcome sign for consumers' wallets isn't as straightforward a benefit for US retailers.With retailers largely achieving growth by raising prices for customers as input costs go up, concerns loom over what happens to companies' revenue as inflation cools.The answer to that conundrum depends on the retailer and the mix of products it carries, a Goldman Sachs team of analysts covering retail and consumer brands said during a media roundtable on Wednesday.Wednesday's inflation report showed June prices for food at home grew at their slowest pace since August 2021. In some categories, there was even a decline. Prices for staple food items like eggs and milk are now cheaper than they were a year ago. This will challenge sales at grocery stores that have relied on price increases to drive sales, Goldman analysts said.""We are in somewhat uncharted territory with how much inflation we've actually seen,"" Goldman Sachs managing director Kate McShane said. ""In fact, if you take a look at the sales growth composition of most of our retailers over the last 18 months, it's been driven by ticket inflation. In fact, units for most retailers have been down.""""What it generally means is you see top lines [sales] start to slow,"" McShane said.McShane doesn't expect all companies in the grocery space to take a hit to revenue growth, though. Despite 60% of its business being grocery, Walmart (WMT) is still a top pick from Goldman.""Walmart has been much more focused on price, so they won't be as impacted as some other retailers when it comes to a less inflationary environment,"" McShane said. ""They also have been getting solid traffic to their stores as they have taken market share.""Target (TGT), which sells some groceries, offers 40% consumable goods and 60% discretionary, per Goldman's analysis. Last quarter, the retailer warned of ""softness"" in its discretionary business. But the slowdown in price increases could help solve that problem, per McShane.Story continues""I can't help but think that Target is a little excited that this inflation is dissipating because the whole hope is that some of those dollars that get freed up from food go back to discretionary,"" McShane said. ""And for Target, that's huge because the margin in discretionary, especially in apparel and home, [is higher] than it is for food and beverage.""June prices for food at home grew at their slowest pace since August 2021. REUTERS/Sarah Silbiger (Sarah Silbiger / reuters)Elsewhere in retail, inflation might be stickier. McShane noted that home improvement goods and auto parts aren't likely to see prices ""take a step back.""And suppliers to retailers may continue to raise their prices even as inflation slows. Goldman Sachs managing director Jason English covers companies like Campbell Soup (CPB), General Mills (GIS), and Kraft Heinz (KHC). He noted historical analysis indicates packaged foods prices rarely decline after periods of high inflation.Josh is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.Click here for the latest economic news and economic indicators to help you in your investing decisionsRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Quality Dividend Stocks to Buy. During periods of uncertainty, such as recessions or inflationary environments, dividend stocks often become a preferred choice for investors. This is because dividend stocks can provide a certain level of stability and income even in turbulent times. When it comes to dividend stocks, investing in high-quality companies offers several advantages. Quality dividend stocks are those that have a track record of consistent and reliable dividend payments. These companies are well-established and have histories of generating steady cash flows, strong earnings growth, and solid balance sheets.Dividend growth rate plays a significant role in dividend investing by showcasing a company's capacity to raise its dividend payments over time. When companies can consistently increase their dividends at a healthy rate, it signals their strength and stability as investments. This growth reflects a strong and expanding cash flow, demonstrating their commitment to delivering value to shareholders. Moreover, dividend growers also showed robust performance in the past, compared to their counterparts. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we mentioned data from Ned Davis Research and Hartford Funds, which revealed that dividend growers achieved a return of 9.62% from 1972 to December 31, 2018. In contrast, dividend cutters experienced a negative return of 0.79%. During the same period, the S&amp;P 500 had an average annual return of 7.30%, indicating that dividend growers outperformed the broader market.Also read: 12 Best Long-Term Dividend Stocks To Buy NowInvestors showed great interest in stocks with substantial dividends last year, considering them popular trades in the stock market. However, this preference for dividend-heavy stocks has lost momentum since then due to growing investments in artificial intelligence (AI). According to data by Ned Davis Research, non-dividend-paying stocks in the S&amp;P 500 have experienced a collective gain of approximately 18% in 2023, as of July 1. In contrast, income-generating companies have only seen a modest 4% advance. This marks the weakest first-half performance for dividend-paying stocks compared to non-dividend-paying stocks since 2009.Story continuesHowever, it is important to note that the situation could change in the future, especially since dividend-paying stocks have historically demonstrated a tendency to outperform during periods of economic slowdown. According to a report by Wall Street Journal, there are concerns that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes could potentially lead the economy into a recession. If such a scenario unfolds, defensive companies with substantial dividends could once again outperform. This is because, during an economic downturn, consumers tend to prioritize essential expenses.Analysts also continue to support the stance on dividend stocks, as they see potential and favorable prospects for these stocks throughout the year. Paul Baiocchi, chief ETF strategist at SS&amp;C ALPS Advisors, spoke with WSJ and said that a significant part of the market’s total return has been generated by compounded dividends over time, rather than the price appreciation of the stock market itself. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) are some of the best dividend stocks with decades-long dividend growth track records. In this article, we will further discuss quality dividend stocks to consider.11 Best Quality Dividend Stocks to BuyImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur Methodology:For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 943 hedge funds as of Q1 2023 and selected blue-chip dividend companies with robust balance sheets.

Here is what the firm has to say:“During the most recent quarter, Appleseed Fund added three new equity holdings: Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK), and Synovus Financial (SNV). Medtronic is the world’s largest device manufacturer, and it holds the number one or number two market share in most of its product segments. Medtronic’s business is heavily weighted towards complicated in-patient procedures, which are typically quite profitable. Industry dynamics are quite attractive with an aging global population and the growth of improved healthcare in emerging markets; furthermore, most of its segments are highly concentrated with just 2-3 players that split each segment’s market share, affording the key participants with significant economies of scale and pricing power. The Company has been recently addressing several temporary headwinds including a strong dollar, inflation, a delayed recovery in surgical volumes from the coronavirus pandemic, and supply chain issues.

31,abb07124-4fb5-3477-8a5b-b1b8721f9c10,MMC,2023-07-14,Marsh & McLennan (MMC) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marsh-mclennan-mmc-reports-next-140054049.html,1689256854,STORY,['MMC'],"[The market expects Marsh &amp; McLennan (MMC) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 20, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis global professional services firm providing strategy, risk and people solutions is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.12 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +12.2%.Revenues are expected to be $5.73 billion, up 6.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 7.03% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Marsh &amp; McLennan?For Marsh &amp; McLennan, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.67%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Marsh &amp; McLennan will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Marsh &amp; McLennan would post earnings of $2.45 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.53, delivering a surprise of +3.27%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Marsh &amp; McLennan appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

As CEO Joey Levin pointed out in his Q1 quarterly letter, IAC traded at an enterprise value below its 18% stake in MGM Resorts International (Ticker: MGM) and 85% position in Angi (Ticker; ANGI)…meaning you effectively “get” 31% of Turo, the equity of publishing giant DotDash Meredith, Care.com, Vivian Health, and other IAC companies for “free.” Levin became CEO of Angi in late 2022 and has already shown tremendous progress in improving product, rationalizing services, and restoring profitability. DotDash Meredith has shown some recovery from January ad-recession lows as it continues to migrate Meredith’s print publications to its digital platform. MGM is seeing continued strength at its Vegas properties and now has the tailwind of China’s domestic re-opening for its Macau properties. This is one of our largest positions, and we remain confident in this portfolio of businesses and IAC’s ability to allocate capital.”6.

The stock outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.85%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.14%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 5.61%.Heading into today, shares of the chipmaker had gained 4.7% over the past month, outpacing the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 1.89% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 3.18% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Microchip Technology as it approaches its next earnings report date. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.64, up 19.71% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $2.29 billion, up 16.55% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $6.25 per share and revenue of $8.81 billion. These totals would mark changes of +3.82% and +4.45%, respectively, from last year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Microchip Technology should also be noted by investors. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.32% higher. Microchip Technology is holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) right now.In terms of valuation, Microchip Technology is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 14.51. This represents a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 20.29.Story continuesInvestors should also note that MCHP has a PEG ratio of 0.86 right now.

37,5995d17b-8fe2-3971-ab9c-697952e3f583,MCHP,2023-07-14,Microchip Technology Incorporated (MCHP) Hits Fresh High: Is There Still Room to Run?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microchip-technology-incorporated-mchp-hits-131509090.html,1689254109,STORY,"['MCHP', 'NXPI']","[Have you been paying attention to shares of Microchip Technology (MCHP)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 4.7% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $91.55 in the previous session. Microchip Technology has gained 29.1% since the start of the year compared to the 38.5% move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 31.7% return for the Zacks Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 4, 2023, Microchip Tech reported EPS of $1.64 versus consensus estimate of $1.62 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 0.53%.For the current fiscal year, Microchip Tech is expected to post earnings of $6.25 per share on $8.81 billion in revenues. This represents a 3.82% change in EPS on a 4.45% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $6.45 per share on $8.98 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 3.19% and 1.91%, respectively.Valuation MetricsMicrochip Tech may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Microchip Tech has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.Story continuesIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 14.5X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 20.3X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 11.8X versus its peer group's average of 13.2X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 0.86. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Microchip Tech currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Microchip Tech meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though Microchip Tech shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.How Does MCHP Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of MCHP have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NXPI). NXPI has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of B, a Growth Score of B, and a Momentum Score of D.Earnings were strong last quarter. NXP Semiconductors N.V. beat our consensus estimate by 5.63%, and for the current fiscal year, NXPI is expected to post earnings of $13.29 per share on revenue of $12.9 billion.Shares of NXP Semiconductors N.V. have gained 8.3% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 15.94X and a P/CF of 10.84X.The Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry is in the top 20% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for MCHP and NXPI, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

""I wouldn't be fighting that trend.""U.S. two-year Treasury yields, which tend to be most sensitive to the Fed policy outlook, languished at 4.65%, following a 28 basis point slide this week that extended its drop from last week's 16-year peak above 5%.Ten-year yields wallowed around 3.78% following a 27 basis point decline since last Friday, when it reached an eight-month high at 4.094%.Japan's bond market sold off though, with the 10-year yield rising as high as 0.485%, taking it the closest it's been to the Bank of Japan's 0.5% policy ceiling since March 10.Speculation that the BOJ could widen its 10-year yield band this month has been rising since a labour report a week ago showed solid growth in wages.""The market has frontloaded its expectations for BoJ policy revisions,"" Shinji Ebihara, an analyst at Barclays in Tokyo, wrote in a research report.""However, such an abrupt repricing appears to be an overshoot in light of current BOJ communications and domestic fundamentals,"" he said. ""We believe the risk ultimately remains skewed toward lower yields.""In Australia, the government's appointment of deputy governor Michele Bullock to lead the Reserve Bank of Australia from mid-September had little effect on markets.The Aussie dollar was flat at $0.6892, following back-to-back sessions of 1.5% gains against its U.S. peer to take it to the highest in a month.In commodities, gold edged to a new one-month high at $1,963.59, buoyed by the dollar's weakness. It has rallied about 1.9% this week.Brent crude futures added 5 cents, or 0.1%, to $81.41 per barrel.

That would be the lowest volume of oil the kingdom has produced in two years, the report said, which would cause it to slip below the ranks of Russia as the top oil producer in the OPEC+ cartel.The estimated drop largely stems from Saudi Arabia's voluntary oil production cut of 1 million barrels per day, which the nation said recently it would extend through the month of July in a bid to prop up crude prices.In June, Saudi Arabia produced 9.98 million barrels a day, and Russia produced 9.45 million barrels a day, according to IEA data.Russia also said earlier this month that it plans to curb output by 500,000 barrels per day starting in August. But its actual output has often exceeded the reduced levels it promised, setting Russia up to potentially pump more than Saudia Arabia.In fact, Saudi officials have complained that Russia isn't following through with its promised cuts, as its weakened economy is adding pressure to keep energy revenues afloat. In May, that caused the price of oil to fall below $81 a barrel, a key breakeven level for Saudi Arabia.Riyadh has worked to push oil prices higher for months, with the nation's energy chief citing market ""distortions"" that are keeping prices low. That led OPEC+ to issue a series of aggressive production cuts last year and Saudi Arabia's first voluntary cut in June.Meanwhile, Russian oil exports slumped in June to the lowest volume since 2021, suggesting that its crude production may finally have dipped as well, after months of robust exports earlier this year.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

A stronger greenback reduces oil demand, making crude more expensive for investors holding other currencies.Next week, however, the rally could resume as easing inflation, plans to refill the U.S. strategic reserve, supply cuts and disruptions could support the market, said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.""While oil prices are likely slightly overbought in the very near term, touching the highest levels since early May, the bias appears to be for a grind higher,"" Haworth said.Oil prices gained nearly 2% on a weekly basis, after supply disruptions in Libya and Nigeria heightened concerns that the markets will tighten in coming months.Several oilfields in Libya were shut down on Thursday because of a local tribe's protest against the kidnapping of a former minister. Separately, Shell suspended loadings of Nigeria's Forcados crude oil owing to a potential leak at a terminal.The Libya disruption is halting an estimated 370,000 barrels per day (bpd) while the loss from the Nigerian outage is pegged at 225,000 bpd, said PVM analyst John Evans.Russian oil exports have also decreased significantly and, if this trend continues next week, it would probably drive prices up further since Russian oil exports are set to be reduced by 500,000 bpd in August, added Commerzbank analysts.(This story has been corrected to change the Brent price unit to 'per barrel' in paragraph 2)(Reporting by Shariq Khan in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Natalie Grover in London, Sudarshan Varadhan in Singapore and Katya Golubkova in Tokyo; Editing by Louise Heavens, David Gregorio, Mark Potter and Deepa Babington)]"

Gillian Tett, The Financial Times Editor-at-Large, U.S., tells Yahoo Finance Live about what investors will be looking for from big banks' quarterly reports.Video Transcript- Citi, JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, they're all kicking off earnings season for the big banks tomorrow. There is a fair bit of caution following the sector after the earlier turmoil this year, but some are feeling bullish. Jefferies analysts upped their rating on JPMorgan recently to buy from hold citing the bank's stable outlook.Joining us now is Gillian Tett, chair of the Financial Times editorial board and US editor-at-large. It's great to see you. It seems like a lot of the focus is going to be on expenses for these banks, right? Current expenses and future expenses as well, both from regulation and what's been happening with rates.GILLIAN TETT: Absolutely. Well, I mean, several reasons. Firstly, the banks are facing a very uncertain regulatory climate that obviously benefits the big banks over the small banks because they have more money to throw at the problem. But that will be another issue that people are looking at.At the same time, though, they're also looking at questions about, what is the future of financial services and banking? And how much real estate do they really need or those bank branches? Which leads to the other big themes that investors are going to be looking at when it comes to the bank earnings. Firstly, what do they reveal about corporate real estate exposures?We've had lots of warnings from people like Jay Powell from the Fed about the level of potential pain being felt in the commercial real estate sector. So what everyone is asking is, how bad will that get? Which banks will be hit or not? And then last but not least, the baffling question of consumers, what on Earth is happening to consumers in America? Given that on the one hand, their fundamentals are remaining surprisingly strong, and they're still spending, it seems, to a degree albeit slowing down. But they keep telling all the surveys and polls that they are incredibly gloomy. So a lot to look for in the bank earnings.Story continues- To what extent do you believe that deposits will be a lingering theme this bank earnings season?GILLIAN TETT: They certainly will be a lingering theme because of course, the shadow of Silicon Valley Bank and the shock of seeing how quickly those deposits flooded out is something that nobody is going to forget quickly. And the reality is that in spite of all the Fed's reports and people like Michael Barr who's been-- did that big report for the Fed, the reality is we still haven't really seen a particularly convincing fix to these problems in terms of preventing these dramatic outflows if investors start to lose confidence in any particular banks.Now, the good news is that there's no sign they're losing confidence in the big banks, and there hasn't really been a sort of panic attack in the regional banking system since we had the STB crisis. But, of course, if things do start to turn nasty, if we do start to get say see commercial real estate loans creating real problems for smaller and regional banks, the question about whether there is time to overhaul the Federal Deposit Insurance scheme or not is going to come up on the agenda and you're going to see more questions looking at deposits.And of course, the other question is as banks are under pressure to raise the rate of return they gave to investors or depositors leaving their money with them, we're going to see which of the banks can actually cope with that kind of squeeze or not.- Talking of another kind of bank, Goldman Sachs, there's been some reporting that the company is sort of quietly trying to downplay expectations, which is different for Goldman. I just wonder what you make of that and what that tells us not just about that bank, but about the bigger environment. Or maybe it's just about Goldman, I don't know.GILLIAN TETT: Well, it's very interesting. I mean, Goldman doesn't report until next week after JPMorgan and Wells Fargo and Citi and groups like that. And in the past, it's been vociferously opposed to the idea of trying to guide earnings. This time for the first time, it is trying to guide earnings down. That may be because it's simply trying a new tactic in terms of its investor relations, but it may also be that Goldman has got more bad news to share, whether that's on the commercial real estate side or whether that's on some of the potentially hung bridges that it's been involved in. Or maybe it's back to the issue about Marcus again, there's considerable concern about its adventures in the retail banking sphere and why those have gone badly.So we simply don't know yet why Goldman's has changed its tactic and its tune, but it's certainly something that's causing quite a buzz on the street right now.- Is it all possible or is there a pathway towards us getting past even the falling action of the banking turmoil without there being a commercial real estate crisis?GILLIAN TETT: Well, the commercial real estate issue is very, very interesting indeed because if you look at the macro aggregate data, it's pretty nasty. I mean, you've had interest rates now jump up 500 basis points in the last 18 months. You've got about 250 plus billion worth of commercial real estate loans that are due to mature this year. And if you look across the next three years, it's about $1.5 trillion. So that's going to really hurt.And you've also got office occupancy collapsing. I mean, McKinsey is out with a big report this morning, which suggests that between now and say 2030, you're going to see a permanent decline in office usage by about 20% in a benign scenario. If it's a bad scenario, it could be 38% economic scenario. So there's a lot of pain there.But the critical thing that I think investors need to understand is that those aggregate numbers conceal a huge variation, not just between cities-- I mean, Houston is pretty different from San Francisco right now. And not just between city districts. I mean, what's happening in the East Village in New York and what's happening on Wall Street is quite different. But also between different buildings.And you're seeing a real split between the good buildings that are green, digitally connected, and suited for hybrid working whose for the most part are seeing rents increase and the values increase. And the legacy buildings, what the industry calls class B and class C that are really, really suffering right now.So the question that hangs over the bank earnings is, what kind of commercial real estate loans exactly are they exposed to? We don't always know. And then the other really big question politically is, can the city leaders in places like Manhattan or San Francisco get their act together and change the zoning laws to ensure that these buildings can be rapidly reconverted away from office buildings that are losing their values into the kind of buildings that people actually want, like cheap apartments for young professionals who still actually want to live in cities?- Yeah, well-noted, Gillian. If you kept running through New York neighborhoods, I thought you were going to get to downtown Brooklyn in my neck of the woods at some point. Great to speak with you here this morning. Gillian Tett, chair of the Financial Times editorial board and US editor-at-large. Thanks so much, Gillian.GILLIAN TETT: Thank you.]"

49,27845b39-01fe-32d6-bb55-54c427eb04ed,MS,2023-07-14,Investors Heavily Search Morgan Stanley (MS): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-morgan-stanley-130007683.html,1689253207,STORY,['MS'],"[Morgan Stanley (MS) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this investment bank have returned -2.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.2% change. The Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, to which Morgan Stanley belongs, has gained 2.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Morgan Stanley is expected to post earnings of $1.19 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -17.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -10%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.88 points to a change of -7.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -9.5%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.11 indicates a change of +20.9% from what Morgan Stanley is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -4.4%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Morgan Stanley.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Morgan Stanley, the consensus sales estimate of $12.84 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -2.2%. The $53.84 billion and $57.47 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +0.3% and +6.8%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMorgan Stanley reported revenues of $14.52 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.9%. EPS of $1.70 for the same period compares with $2.06 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.91 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.35%. The EPS surprise was +1.8%.Over the last four quarters, Morgan Stanley surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Morgan Stanley is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Morgan Stanley. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

50,aa7634bd-14ee-3bc7-881c-139441256d29,MS,2023-07-14,"Weak Trading, IB to Hurt Morgan Stanley's (MS) Q2 Earnings",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weak-trading-ib-hurt-morgan-111600513.html,1689246960,STORY,"['MS', 'USB']","[The performance of Morgan Stanley’s MS trading business (constituting a significant portion of its top line) is expected to have been subdued in the second quarter of 2023. Hence, the company’s quarterly numbers, slated to be announced on Jul 18 before the opening bell, are expected to be hit by weak trading performance.Unlike the past few quarters when huge market volatility and client activity drove trading revenues, capital markets were subdued in the second quarter of 2023. The Congressional debate over the debt ceiling, risks of an economic downturn/recession, the Federal Reserve’s hawkish monetary policy stance to stem out “sticky” inflation and geopolitical concerns led to ambiguity among investors.These factors, thus, resulted in lower volatility in equity markets and other asset classes, including commodities, bonds and foreign exchange. So, Morgan Stanley is likely to have witnessed a muted trading performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, tougher comps from the prior year are expected to have weighed on performance.Further, Morgan Stanley’s co-president Andy Saperstein, in an investor conference, noted that because of a more challenging economic environment, the company’s sales and trading “results will be notably down year over year versus a strong second quarter last year.”The Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity trading revenues is pegged at $2.61 billion, suggesting a fall of 11.9% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number. The consensus estimate for fixed-income trading revenues of $2.07 billion indicates a year-over-year decrease of 17.2%.Our estimates for equity trading revenues and fixed-income trading revenues are $2.5 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively.Other Key Factors at PlayInvestment Banking (IB) Income: Global deal-making continued to slump on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter, though green shoots were visible toward the end of the quarter. A host of factors like geopolitical tensions, stand-off over the U.S. debt ceiling, inflation, rising interest rates and fears of a global recession acted as major headwinds.Thus, the deal volume and total value numbers crashed in the second quarter. While Morgan Stanley’s position as one of the leading players in the space is likely to have provided some leverage, overall growth in advisory fees is not expected to have been that impressive in the quarter.The consensus estimate for advisory fees is pegged at $563.3 million, suggesting a decline of 5.9% year over year. Our estimate for the same is $552.4 million.For similar reasons, IPOs and follow-up equity issuances were lower in the to-be-reported quarter. Bond issuance volume was also muted as investors turned pessimistic. Hence, Morgan Stanley’s underwriting fees are expected to have been hurt in the quarter under review. Yet, compared with last year’s performance, underwriting revenues are not likely to have declined much.The consensus estimate for fixed-income underwriting fees is pegged at $340.5 million, suggesting a rise of 4.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity underwriting fees of $181.2 million indicates an increase of 22.4%. The consensus estimate for total underwriting fees of $521.7 million implies a rise of 10.1%.Our estimate for fixed-income underwriting fees is $314.7 million, while that for equity underwriting fees is $140.2 million.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for IB income of $1.1 billion indicates a rise of 2.6%. Our estimate for IB income is $1 billion.Net Interest Income (NII): Lending activities slowed down in the to-be-reported quarter. Per the Fed’s latest data, the demand for commercial and industrial loans was soft in April and May, while real estate loans and consumer loans (specifically credit cards) witnessed decent demand.Continuing with its efforts to curb inflation, the Fed raised the interest rates by another 25 basis points in May before pausing the hike in the June FOMC meeting. The policy rate is now at a 15-year high of 5-5.25%. While this is likely to have had a favorable impact on Morgan Stanley’s NIM and NII, the inversion of the yield curve in the June-ended quarter and higher deposit costs are expected to have weighed on it to some extent.The consensus estimate for NII is pegged at $2.27 billion, suggesting an increase of 2.5% on a year-over-year basis. Our estimate for NII is $2.32 billion.Expenses: Cost reduction, which has long been the main strategy of Morgan Stanley to remain profitable, is unlikely to have provided major support in the June-ended quarter. As the company has been investing in franchises, overall costs are anticipated to have flared.We expect total non-interest expenses of $9.7 billion to be relatively stable year over year.Story continuesWhat Our Quantitative Model PredictsAccording to our proven model, the chances of Morgan Stanley beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings this time are low. This is because it doesn’t have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for Morgan Stanley is -9.09%.Zacks Rank: The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Morgan Stanley Price and EPS SurpriseMorgan Stanley Price and EPS SurpriseMorgan Stanley price-eps-surprise | Morgan Stanley QuoteThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter earnings has moved 3.6% lower to $1.35 over the past seven days. The estimate suggests a 6.3% decline from the year-ago reported number. Our estimate for earnings is $1.55 per share.The consensus estimate for sales is pegged at $12.84 billion, which indicates a year-over-year fall of 2.2%. Our estimate for total revenues is $13.23 billion.Banks to ConsiderHere are a couple of bank stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time:The Earnings ESP for Wells Fargo WFC is +0.16% and it carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present.

It does this in part through its newest proprietary research tool, the Disruption Index. The Index processes survey responses from almost 8,000 participants in 18 countries to analyze Backslash's key cultural shifts, and explore how they are influencing consumer awareness and behavior.This report comes at a crucial time, as food is finding itself at the center of today's most urgent issues - ranging from climate change to social justice. This means that food is no longer being assessed as a standalone industry, but as a key ingredient in the push toward a brighter future. Sharing her insights within the foreword, renowned food journalist, author, and cook, Alicia Kennedy, notes: ""There is no one-size-fits-all solution for bringing the global food system in line with climate science, ecological limits, and cultural sensitivity. That's why it's so important to bring every category together into one report - where ideas can cross-pollinate. What is necessary for a better food future for all is that we build a coalition determined to deliver the abundance we need.""Agathe Guerrier, Global Chief Strategy Officer of TBWA\Worldwide continues: ""For a long time, progress in food meant convenience. But the result is that we've become disconnected from the natural processes through which ingredients become food — negatively impacting our health, the planet, and equal access to nutrition. It's time for hands-on participation from brands and consumers.""Story continuesAn easily digestible four-part report, the topics covered include:Food RX: Increasingly blurred lines between food and pharma are changing not only what we eat, but why we eat.While personalized nutrition and stress-reducing diets are elevating food's role in medicine, a growing number of drugs are also allowing people to continue eating poorly.As the relationship between Big Food and Big Pharma is exposed, individuals will look to businesses to fix the root of their health problems rather than sell them band-aid solutions.DISRUPTION INDEX ANALYSIS: ""Being able to make decisions about my health and body in my own best interest"" was the #1 category in the Index when ranked for the sector — with 79% of respondents agreeing to its importance.Food under review: The search for ""good"" food is now a search for ethical, sustainable, and inclusive food.While impressive technique and perfect plating may have been the markers of a good meal in the past, critical social and environmental issues are now requiring us to judge food through a more responsible lens.This heightened scrutiny will bring a rise in carbon-labeled products, tighter restrictions on beef, and a renewed appreciation for heritage dishes.DISRUPTION INDEX ANALYSIS: ""Spending money in a way that supports sustainability"" was the third most significant driver for buying behavior in food and beverage, with the decision to prioritize social and environmental good over convenience just outside the top 5 trends across all categories.Beyond consumption: As our food system gets an interactive redesign, passive consumers will become active participants.After years of chasing convenience in the form of fully stocked supermarkets and ultra-fast meal delivery apps, we're now realizing that a hands-off approach to food isn't serving us.In the search for stability, individuals are re-learning how to forage for food, grow their own produce, and even redistribute excess to people in need.DISRUPTION INDEX ANALYSIS: Crisis hacking ranked #5 for the sector, with 60% of consumers saying they ""recognize the importance of making lifestyle adjustments in response to resource scarcity,"" while just under half say they are ""actively changing their spending habits to reflect it.""Tech's Kitchen: Technology's role in food is being elevated.While longstanding cultural narratives have taught us to choose ""all-natural"" foods in favor of ones tainted by tech, an urgent need for innovation is now flipping the script.As we chase a more sustainable future, our aversion to tech in the food world will fade, thus opening the door for greater acceptance of lab-made proteins, anti-waste innovations, and AI-discovered ingredients.DISRUPTION INDEX ANALYSIS: The Disruption Index found that lab-made was not the most well-known of cultural shifts (just under half - 46% - of respondents agreeing to its significance). Among those early adopters though, it is growing in influence - making it one to watch for the future.The Future of Food report can be downloaded at https://www.backslash.com/reports/future-of-foodMethodologyThis report was born from months of in-depth qualitative and quantitative research, strategic ideation, and collaboration among 42 Culture Spotters from 15 global TBWA offices.

Borges' lawyers had recommended he get 1 1/2 years.Black's decision concerning Borges came a day after the judge sentenced the 64-year-old Householder to 20 years in prison, the maximum allowed under the law, and a year of probation. Householder also has appealed.During trial, Borges' attorneys argued that the lobbyist had only a minor, short-term role in the massive operation, in which two other individuals, a dark money group and FirstEnergy have all acknowledged their guilt.Several fired FirstEnergy executives and the former head of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio also have been investigated in a sweeping probe that remains open.]"

(NYSE: FE) has seeded nearly three acres of right of way along a high-voltage transmission line in Bradford and Susquehanna counties with a native seed mix designed to establish pollinator-friendly habitat.FirstEnergy Corp. Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)Mid-Atlantic Interstate Transmission (MAIT), a FirstEnergy subsidiary, is currently upgrading a 20-mile segment of the 115-kilovolt transmission line between the East Towanda and North Meshoppen substations, replacing wooden poles with steel monopoles and installing new, larger wires that can handle additional demand if other lines in the area are out of service. The project is expected to be complete in late 2023.Where a portion of the right of way was cleared to accommodate a longer span of the line, FirstEnergy seeded the area with a seed mix featuring native grasses and flowers that will help control soil erosion while also establishing habitat for small animals and insects that pollinate plants, such as birds, bats, bees, butterflies and beetles.""By integrating a native seed mix into transmission projects such as this one, we can enhance service reliability for our customers while also demonstrating our commitment to reduce our impact on the environment and support the creation of pollinator habitats across our service territory,"" said Michael Haines, a FirstEnergy supervisor of Transmission Construction Vegetation Management who is leading this effort.FirstEnergy is working to develop 225 acres of pollinator habitat across its service territory by 2025, including the creation of new habitat in transmission right of ways, at its electric substation properties and at parks and nature preserves. After beginning with a pilot program in 2020, the company expanded the initiative within its service territory and is now on pace to exceed 200 pollinator-friendly acres by the end of this year.Story continuesPollinators help to sustain ecosystems and play a vital role in helping plants reproduce. In return, the plants produce fruits and vegetables, prevent soil erosion and increase carbon sequestration.Many pollinator populations are in decline due to a loss in feeding and nesting habitats, according to Pollinator Partnership, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the protection and promotion of pollinators and their ecosystems. Each year, the organization manages Pollinator Week, an annual celebration in support of pollinator health that ran from June 19-25 this year.In early 2020, FirstEnergy's transmission vegetation management group established a pilot program to find opportunities to restore work areas following transmission construction projects with flowering vegetation to develop a pollinator-friendly habitat. The company worked with a horticulturist in Meadville, Pennsylvania, to develop two seed mixes with more than 20 flowering species that are native throughout the six states in which FirstEnergy operates. One of the mixes contains added grasses that will help it take root along steep slopes, and both mixes can be used across the company's service territory.Additionally, the company seeded 16 acres within a transmission right of way in Adams County, Pennsylvania, earlier this year and plans to seed an additional 10 acres at a transmission line right of way in Lebanon County later this year.FirstEnergy is dedicated to integrity, safety, reliability and operational excellence. Its 10 electric distribution companies form one of the nation's largest investor-owned electric systems, serving customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, West Virginia, Maryland and New York. The company's transmission subsidiaries operate approximately 24,000 miles of transmission lines that connect the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions.

If you want to skip our industry introduction, then take a look at the Top 5 Big Data Analytics Companies of 2023. Data analytics is all the buzz these days. Advances in computing, technology, and industrialization have expanded business operations by quite a bit and also allowed companies to collect copious amounts of data to generate new insights.This growth in data analytics over the years has also led major semiconductor firms such as Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) to offer two categories of central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs). One set of these are for consumers, primarily for everyday use in laptops and desktops, while the other is used in large scale data centers for enterprise computing. While all big data uses data centers, not all data centers are used for big data analytics since the data that must be stored on a site must exceed 1 Petabyte to be classified as big data.So how big is the big data market? Well, to answer this question we'll have to individually look at its hardware and software constituents. The hardware portion was worth $279 billion last year and is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.3% until 2032 to be worth $656 billion by the end of the forecast period. Within this segment, the information technology segment is the biggest, as it accounts for 35% of the market. Hinting at the importance of big data to the data center market, the hyperscale segment which consists of products that are capable of scaling up data centers to thousands of servers was the biggest product type, controlling 43% of the market.Comparing the data center market with the big data and data analytics market shows that this segment was worth $198 billion in 2020 and it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 13.5% between 2021 and 2030 to be worth $684 billion by then. Off site computing was one of the rare industries that actually boomed during the coronavirus pandemic as businesses were forced to deal with more computing and data due to work from home requirements. Software and services are the biggest portion of this market, and geographically, Asia Pacific is expected to be the fastest growing region, since it is expected to outpace the broader market through a growth rate of 17.5%.Story continuesShifting our focus from the broader industries to the firms that operate in, there are quite a bit of firms that have a presence in the industry. These include firms like Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) which operate on the software side of data analytics and allow companies to consolidate their business data into single platforms to enable data driven insights and decision making. Oracle's big data solutions allow for consolidating large scale data into databases under a variety of languages and parameters through systems such as SQL, Hadoop, Kafka, and Spark. While these are primarily data storage and access platforms, the Oracle big data analytics platform also lets data scientists build and deploy machine learning models that leverage programming languages such as Python.Another firm whose platform is crucial to big data analytics is the technology giant Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Microsoft's Azure is one of the biggest enterprise computing platforms in the industry, and it enables big data analytics under Microsoft's Intelligent Data Platform. Here's what the firm had to say about this platform's capabilities and market performance during its latest earnings call:Our Intelligent Data Platform brings together databases, analytics and governance, so organizations can spend more time creating value and less time integrating their data estate. Cosmos DB is the go-to database, powering the world’s most demanding workloads at any scale. OpenAI relies on Cosmos DB to dynamically scale their ChatGPT service, one of the fastest-growing consumer apps ever, enabling high reliability and low maintenance.The NBA uses Cosmos DB to ingest more than 10 million data points per game, helping teams optimize their gameplay. And we are taking share with our analytics solutions. Companies like BP, Canadian Tire, Marks &amp; Spencer and T-Mobile all rely on our end-to-end analytics to improve speed to insight.Now on to developers.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the top big data and data analytics companies in the world. Some big ticket names are Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc.

(NYSE:CRM) Stock Is Going Strong But Fundamentals Look Uncertain: What Lies Ahead ?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-inc-nyse-crm-stock-130029894.html,1689253229,STORY,['CRM'],"[Salesforce's (NYSE:CRM) stock is up by a considerable 17% over the past three months. However, we decided to pay attention to the company's fundamentals which don't appear to give a clear sign about the company's financial health. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Salesforce's  ROE today.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for Salesforce How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Salesforce is:0.7% = US$379m ÷ US$57b (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.01 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Salesforce's Earnings Growth And 0.7% ROEIt is hard to argue that Salesforce's ROE is much good in and of itself. Even when compared to the industry average of 10%, the ROE figure is pretty disappointing. As a result, Salesforce's flat earnings over the past five years doesn't come as a surprise given its lower ROE.We then compared Salesforce's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 20% in the same 5-year period, which is a bit concerning.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is CRM fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Salesforce Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Salesforce doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that the company is keeping all of its profits, which makes us wonder why it is retaining its earnings if it can't use them to grow its business. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that the performance shown by Salesforce can be open to many interpretations. While the company does have a high rate of reinvestment, the low ROE means that all that reinvestment is not reaping any benefit to its investors, and moreover, its having a negative impact on the earnings growth. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

Increased consumption of media, music and news over the web, triggered by the work-and-learn-at-home wave, has been a key catalyst for industry participants like News Corporation NWSA, World Wrestling Entertainment WWE, Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF.A) and IMAX Corporation IMAX. Companies have been focusing on a superior product strategy and prudent capital investments. Steady recovery in the advertising spending environment and resumption of production pipelines bode well for film and television production companies.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Film and Television Production and Distribution industry comprises companies involved in film and TV production, distribution and exhibition. The main activities of the industry participants include the production and distribution of entertainment content to theaters, TV networks, video-on-demand platforms, streaming services and other exhibitors. Imax offers entertainment technology and specializes in motion picture technologies and presentations. Industry participants produce and distribute motion pictures for theatrical and straight-to-video releases besides TV programming. These players are heavily dependent on the box-office performance of their films, both domestically and internationally, the number of film releases, and the ratings of TV shows.3 Film and Television Production Industry Trends in FocusOver-the-Top Services Gaining Prominence: Companies involved in content creation are looking to distribute content through over-the-top services to leverage the popularity of their franchises. With this, they are looking to provide exclusive content and a differentiated experience. However, streaming companies are increasingly producing original and award-winning feeds to reduce licensing costs and excessive dependence on third-party content providers. This is likely to hurt industry participants’ content distribution strategy.Story continuesBinge-Watching Driving Consumption: Factors such as binge-watching, deepening Internet penetration, and advancement in mobile, video, and wireless technologies have got viewers glued to small screens. In order to keep pace with new consumption patterns, industry participants are turning to digital content distribution. The emergence of digital capabilities is making consumer data easily available to companies. With the use of AI tools, production houses are gaining a better understanding of user preferences. This helps them produce content that strikes a chord with viewers. However, increasing spending on content and sales &amp; marketing is hurting profitability due to stiff competition from streaming players.Technological Advancement Aids Prospects: Exhibitors are turning to highly efficient and cost-effective technologies like laser-based projection systems to enhance image quality and the entire movie experience. Additionally, the use of technologies like motion seating, immersive audio systems and interactive movies among others is expected to enhance the viewing experience. The increasing adoption of AR and VR technologies bodes well for industry participants. However, the evolution of alternative motion picture distribution channels such as home video, pay-per-view, streaming services, video-on-demand, Internet and syndicated and broadcast television is hurting exhibitors.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Film and Television Production and Distribution industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector.

63,04c0c68e-d342-3ac8-b58a-a54437a7781e,MSFT,2023-07-14,"Lone Pine Capital: Portfolio, Team, AUM",Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lone-pine-capital-portfolio-team-114816745.html,1689335296,STORY,"['MSFT', 'UNH', 'KKR', 'DKS', 'TSM', 'TDG', 'WDAY', 'BKNG']","[In this piece, we will take a look at Lone Pine Capital's portfolio, AUM, and performance. If you want to skip the details about the hedge fund, then head on over to Lone Pine Capital's Top 5 Stock Picks. Lone Pine Capital is a hedge fund headquartered in Greenwich, Connecticut. The fund is among those that were set up by the former managers at Julian Robertson's Tiger Global. It was set up by the billionaire Stephen Mandel in 1997 after he left Tiger Global. According to Forbes Magazine, Mr. Mandel was worth $3.6 billion as of July 2023, making him one of the richest people in the world. He isn't the only one running the fund though. Lone Pine's team is run by executives with decades of experience in the finance industry, such as its chief operating officer Ms. Kerry Ann Tyler, its co-chief investment officer Ms. Kelly Granat, chief financial officer and managing director Ms. Mary E McDonnell, and head trader Mr. Brian Francis Doherty.Out of the myriad of approaches that hedge funds take when investing in the stock market, Lone Pine Capital calls itself a ""research-driven, fundamental equity investor."" In simple terms, this means that the firm takes a look at companies' balance sheets, and their strength, and conducts research into their operations and markets to gauge a sense of their financial situation and future prospects. Mathematically, this includes projecting the future cash flows of a firm and then determining its fair value to check whether it's traded above or below this value on the stock market. This analysis can involve both factors that are intrinsic to a company - such as its management, product portfolio, or research strength - and the broader macroeconomic environment such as the ease of doing business and consumer spending power.Through this approach, Lone Pine Capital invests in a variety of companies. Our research suggests that as of the first quarter of 2023, the firm had invested in 29 companies. Some of these investments belong to sectors that are expected to pick up as the coronavirus pandemic is over and the inflationary environment appears to be subsiding. Others are long term plays, particularly those in the technology industry which has been one of the fastest growing sectors in recent years owing to the proliferation of internet usage and consumer electronics such as the smartphone.Story continuesFor instance, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been a long term investment of Lone Pine Capital. The hedge fund first bought its shares in 2013's final quarter, in the form of 25 million shares that were worth $954 million back then. Based on today's share price, these would be worth a cool $8.4 billion - showcasing a massive gain in just a decade. Lone Pine's latest stake in Microsoft sees the firm own 2.6 million shares that were worth $772 million as of March 2023. In short, roughly one tenth of the hedge fund's 2013 stake in terms of shares is nearly worth the same right now. Based on Microsoft's share price in July, the same 2.6 million shares are worth $876 million.Moving forward to the hedge fund's latest investments, as 2023 kicked off, Lone Pine Capital initiated two new positions and grew its investments significantly in a handful of others. The new investments are in KKR &amp; Co. Inc. (NYSE:KKR) and BILL Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:BILL) - both of which are financial firms with different kinds of operations. KKR is purely an investment company which specializes in private equity - a sector that sees decreased activity when economic growth is slower and interest rates are high. However, as the conditions subside, the activity picks up as risk appetites expand and more firms look to grow their operations. BILL, on the other hand, is a software company that offers a cloud platform that enables businesses to automate their financial operations. KKR's shares are up 25% year to date, and since March, they have appreciated by 11.6%. BILL's shares are the opposite, as while they have gained 11.2% year to date, between March and July, the stock has appreciated by 49.7%.In terms of Assets Under Management (AUM), Lone Pine Capital faced quite a reckoning as of June 2022. By then, the hedge fund had an AUM of $5.4 billion - which marked a sharp 51% drop over the year and pushed it to be the 62nd largest hedge fund in the world. These losses were driven by the fund's bets on the growth and technology sector, with its hedge fund losing 47% between September 2021 and June 2022 and its long only fund tanking by 51.6%. The flagship fund would close the year by posting 36% in losses, and overall, Lone Pine was the fourth worst performing fund in the industry - topped only by C1 Capital, TCI Fund Management, and, of course, Tiger Global.The 2022 shocks continued to impact Lone Pine's portfolio. As of March 2023, it was worth $10.8 billion - marking an annual drop of $6 billion or 36%. And not only did the hedge fund add new positions in the first quarter, but it also removed three companies from its portfolio. These are the life sciences company Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), the regional bank First Citizens BancShares, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCNCA), and the data analytics firm Equifax Inc. (NYSE:EFX). These are part of a broad portfolio adjustment that had also taken place in Q4 2022 which saw Lone Pine divest even more companies including the star performer of 2023, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Meta has been one of the best performing stocks on the market this year, through its absolutely stunning 148% gains year to date.With these details in mind, let's take a look at Lone Pine Capital's top stock picks, with the notable ones being Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Workday, Inc. (NASDAQ:WDAY), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM).Lone Pine Capital: Portfolio, Team, AUM and PerformanceStephen Mandel of Lone Pine CapitalOur Methodology To compile our list of Lone Pine Capital's stocks, we used the fund's SEC filings for the first quarter of this year.

A private equity company might also be interested, said one person.Both companies still think it’s possible to close the deal, which would be the largest ever in the video-game industry, before next week’s deadline, the people said. Regulators in the US and UK have come out against the deal, which would combine one of the biggest video game publishers with one of the largest console makers into an industry behemoth.It’s currently unclear just how Microsoft will legally be able to close the deal by Tuesday without breaching UK laws and incurring large fines from the Competition and Markets Authority. While the CMA said Tuesday it’s prepared to evaluate proposals from Microsoft, the agency also said the companies would need to resubmit their transaction for the normally multi-month regulatory process to begin anew.But there are options available, according to Tom Smith, a competition lawyer at Geradin Partners and ex-CMA legal director.“It’s all quite debatable, but I believe the most likely route to allowing the deal to close by Tuesday is for the CMA to issue a derogation from its interim order,” said Smith, a competition lawyer at Geradin Partners and ex-CMA legal director, referring to the formal notice the deals watchdog issued in May ordering the companies to remain separate pending a final decision.Story continues“They could allow the deal to close but require the Activision Blizzard business to be held separate pending the final order,” he said. “The CMA would look reasonable while preserving their position.”Spokespeople for Microsoft and Activision declined to comment. The CMA didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the process.The US Federal Trade Commission on Thursday asked a California court to pause the deal while the agency’s challenge is pending. The FTC wants the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco to overturn a lower-court judge’s July 10 order that cleared the companies to proceed toward their July 18 closure deadline. The deal is seen as a major test of the FTC’s ability to block big-tech deals.Read More: FTC Asks Appeals Court to Pause Microsoft-Activision DealUS District Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley earlier rejected the FTC’s request to extend a pause on the deal while the agency appeals her ruling greenlighting the transaction. Barring action by the appeals court, Microsoft and Activision can complete the deal as of 11:59 p.m. in San Francisco on July 14.In its earlier findings, the UK regulator had expressed concerns that adding Activision content to Microsoft’s xCloud service would restrict competition in the nascent market for video games that are streamed over the internet rather than downloaded to consoles or devices. Microsoft offers xCloud as part of a monthly gaming subscription. The CMA has said it strongly prefers structural remedies like a divestiture to behavioral ones, under which the agency must monitor whether a company complies with its promises.Meanwhile, in a procedural move, separate from this week’s developments, the CMA said Friday it had extended its deadline for issuing a legally final order on the deal until Aug. 29.It said this was to consider a previous “detailed and complex submission from Microsoft claiming that there are material changes in circumstance and special reasons” meaning the CMA shouldn’t press ahead with its veto.CNBC reported earlier that Microsoft had offered a small divestiture to regulators, without specifying what might be sold.The Hurdles That Remain for Microsoft-Activision Deal: QuickTake--With assistance from Katharine Gemmell.(Updates with ex-CMA lawyer’s comments in the sixth paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekNo Testing, No Inspections: Contaminated Eyedrops Blinded and Killed AmericansWeightWatchers Is Gambling Everything on Obesity DrugsWhat If the Next Big Social Media App Is ...

And I think that says a lot about Amazon (AMZN) and the broader tech industry at the moment.Adobe Analytics said that across both days, $12.7 billion was spent online in the US — representing 6.1% growth year over year. Amazon put out a press release using the word ""ever"" two times in the headline (a pet peeve of this journalist) to hype up its performance.All in all, people spent money this week. Amazon probably gained some new Prime members, which will open the door for them to spend more money on Amazon this holiday season.Great.But who cares about Prime Day when it's stacked up against a game-changing year for tech? I mean, really.Nvidia (NVDA) is pushing the AI revolution forward with its powerful new chips. AMD (AMD) CEO Dr. Lisa Su blew me away when she described what's next with her company's own generative AI chips.Then we have Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) going head to head on AI product releases. Did I mention Microsoft is about to own Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard? Huge deal. Broadcom (AVGO) also moved closer this week to securing its deal for VMWare (VMW). Huge deal.ChatGPT continues to capture everyone's attention.And Meta Platforms (META) is powering ahead with AI while also stealing millions of users from Elon Musk's Twitter. I was impressed by what Meta is working on when chatting with top exec Nicola Mendelsohn at Cannes.Meanwhile, Apple's (AAPL) new $1,000 plus AR/VR goggles could usher in a new wave of human interaction. And the company is now worth over $3 trillion.Story continuesYet, we have Amazon Prime Day in the summer.""Yes, Amazon has become boring in the tech space because while their core business is good (obviously) they aren't innovating the way we’re used to,"" Sevens Report Research founder Tom Essaye quipped to me via email. Tom is right.Andrew Ross Sorkin speaks with Amazon CEO Andy Jassy during the New York Times DealBook Summit in the Appel Room at the Jazz At Lincoln Center on November 30, 2022 in New York City. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) (Michael M. Santiago via Getty Images)What was the last big innovation you have seen from Amazon? Alexa?It's certainly not the consumer-facing website, which increasingly looks like an overrun flea market.What's the deal with Whole Foods? I am an avid shopper and love the fish department. But I go in there and leave every single time thinking how Amazon has basically done nothing to reinvent this brand and the industry with a major innovation.Under CEO Andy Jassy, all investors have been rewarded with are headlines on layoffs and less-than-amazing top- and bottom-line growth.The stock price has lagged too — shares are down about 17% compared to a gain of around 9% for the Nasdaq since Jassy started in early July 2021. Over the last five years, Amazon stock is trailing the Nasdaq by over 30 percentage points.Now, none of this is to say that boring can't be wildly profitable for Amazon. The company's web services cloud business will get its fair share of business as workloads powered by AI tools demand more capacity.""We are likely on the precipice of an explosion in AI workload growth in the 2H as GPU capacity comes online, with incremental workload growth here more than offsetting the workloads that have been taken out of the system through the current rationalization cycle,"" Deutsche Bank's Lee Horowitz said in a recent note. ""Importantly, our checks here leave us confident that AWS will accrue more than its fair share of these workloads/dollars, supporting meaningful revenue growth reacceleration into 2024.""Point well taken.But to really get Amazon's stock and brand back in sizzling territory — where its peers reside — the company's culture of innovation has to resurface.""Bottom line, they haven't innovated recently the way we're used to,"" Essaye said.And this innovation needs to show up not just internally, but externally for consumers and investors to see.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Walgreens will combine its national footprint, patient insights, compliant recruitment technology and local infrastructure to engage diverse patient populations in Freenome's multi-cancer research program. ""At Walgreens, our aim is to help every community we serve see clinical research as a viable care option,"" said Ramita Tandon, chief clinical trials officer, Walgreens. ""Through our nationwide presence and trusted pharmacists, we can reach and engage previously underserved patient populations for clinical trials. Supporting the identification of cancers when they are most treatable is one more way we are helping to improve health outcomes of our communities and patients while advancing research in oncology."" Working together with technology provider Curebase, Walgreens will initially recruit patients across diverse populations for Freenome's Sanderson Study, which aims to evaluate blood-based early detection tests for multiple cancers. Using Curebase's platform, Walgreens will deliver targeted outreach to potentially eligible patients and caregivers of all backgrounds via text, email or in-person consultation at the pharmacy. After completing a pre-screen, eligible patients are invited to enroll in the study. Walgreens healthcare providers will then perform a single blood draw at one of the company's clinical trial locations and conduct a telehealth patient follow-up one year after their participation. ""Freenome's goal is to make early cancer screening more convenient for everyone, and our clinical research should reflect that availability and accessibility. With community reach, study conduct capabilities, national presence and real-world data generation resources, Walgreens is a natural partner to help deliver on that goal,"" said Lance Baldo, chief medical officer, Freenome. ""This collaboration is an important step in advancing early cancer detection."" The Sanderson Study will enroll approximately 8,000 participants through its clinical study partner network, which includes Walgreens. For more information, visit sanderson.freenome.com. Clinical trials inclusive of diverse communities are critical to improving health outcomes, especially in cancer research. The collaboration between Walgreens and Freenome aligns with the National Cancer Plan's goals of detecting cancer early and eliminating inequities. Cancer claims nearly 2,000 lives daily in the United States, but proactive screening tests can help find cancer at an early stage even before symptoms appear1. Additionally, Black individuals of all ages have higher mortality rates than any other racial or ethnic groups for many cancer types2. Walgreens and Freenome will also work together on building risk-prediction models and population health software. The aim is to help close existing care gaps and identify people who are eligible and stand to benefit from standard-of-care cancer detection testing. Real-world data collected by Walgreens as part of this collaboration will inform the development of new products and services in Freenome's multi-cancer detection research, including the company's blood-based colorectal cancer screening test. Since launching in June 2022, Walgreens clinical trials business has directly addressed industrywide access, experience and diversity challenges via its three service lines focused on patient recruitment, decentralized clinical trials and real-world evidence. Built on a fully compliant regulatory framework, the central focus of the Walgreens clinical trials experience remains patient choice. Walgreens recently achieved a milestone of conducting outreach to its 1 millionth patient for potential participation in the ongoing trials it supports.

78,1b4c0d88-dea6-3b3b-9623-80f7dc697a7a,PM,2023-07-14,Philip Morris (PM) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/philip-morris-pm-expected-beat-140052113.html,1689256852,STORY,['PM'],"[Philip Morris (PM) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 20, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis seller of Marlboro and other cigarette brands is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.47 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -0.7%.Revenues are expected to be $8.69 billion, up 10.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.3% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Philip Morris?For Philip Morris, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.69%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Philip Morris will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Philip Morris would post earnings of $1.33 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.38, delivering a surprise of +3.76%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Philip Morris appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company has an impressive earnings surprise history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters, the average beat being 3.8%.Let's see how things have shaped up for Roper this earnings season.Roper Technologies, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseRoper Technologies, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseRoper Technologies, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Roper Technologies, Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteStrong customer demand and a robust pipeline of orders are likely to have driven Roper’s second-quarter performance.Strength across enterprise-class customers, government contracting and private sector solutions within Deltek business, and record bookings and the adoption of SaaS models within Aderant are expected to have boosted the performance of the Application Software segment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Application Software revenues indicates a 20.5% jump from the year-ago reported figure. We expect Application Software revenues to increase 18% from the second quarter of 2022 reported figure.The Network Software segment is expected to reflect higher revenues due to the strong performance of freight-matching businesses, strength in the Foundry business, and robust bookings, retention and customer expansion within the iPipeline business. The consensus mark for Network Software revenues hints at a 5.5% increase from the year-ago reported figure. We expect Network Software revenues to increase 9% from the year-ago reported figure.Strength in the Neptune business due to increased demand for residential and commercial ultrasonic static meters and rising manufacturing productivity is expected to have aided the Tech-enabled Products unit’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter. We expect the segment’s revenues to augment 9% from the year-ago reported figure.The Frontline Education, which has expanded Roper’s presence in the K-12 education market, is expected to have boosted the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ROP’s second-quarter 2023 revenues suggests a 14.1% rise from the year-ago reported figure. We expect the company’s revenues to increase 13.6% from the second quarter of 2022 reported figure.However, supply chain constraints within the Technology Enabled Products segment are likely to have hurt Roper’s second-quarter performance. Escalating cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses are likely to have dented the company’s bottom line in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Given Roper’s considerable international exposure, foreign currency headwinds are expected to have affected its top line.Story continuesEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for ROP this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here, as elaborated below.Earnings ESP: ROP has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $4.00.

80,04c0c68e-d342-3ac8-b58a-a54437a7781e,TDG,2023-07-14,"Lone Pine Capital: Portfolio, Team, AUM",Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lone-pine-capital-portfolio-team-114816745.html,1689335296,STORY,"['MSFT', 'UNH', 'KKR', 'DKS', 'TSM', 'TDG', 'WDAY', 'BKNG']","[In this piece, we will take a look at Lone Pine Capital's portfolio, AUM, and performance. If you want to skip the details about the hedge fund, then head on over to Lone Pine Capital's Top 5 Stock Picks. Lone Pine Capital is a hedge fund headquartered in Greenwich, Connecticut. The fund is among those that were set up by the former managers at Julian Robertson's Tiger Global. It was set up by the billionaire Stephen Mandel in 1997 after he left Tiger Global. According to Forbes Magazine, Mr. Mandel was worth $3.6 billion as of July 2023, making him one of the richest people in the world. He isn't the only one running the fund though. Lone Pine's team is run by executives with decades of experience in the finance industry, such as its chief operating officer Ms. Kerry Ann Tyler, its co-chief investment officer Ms. Kelly Granat, chief financial officer and managing director Ms. Mary E McDonnell, and head trader Mr. Brian Francis Doherty.Out of the myriad of approaches that hedge funds take when investing in the stock market, Lone Pine Capital calls itself a ""research-driven, fundamental equity investor."" In simple terms, this means that the firm takes a look at companies' balance sheets, and their strength, and conducts research into their operations and markets to gauge a sense of their financial situation and future prospects. Mathematically, this includes projecting the future cash flows of a firm and then determining its fair value to check whether it's traded above or below this value on the stock market. This analysis can involve both factors that are intrinsic to a company - such as its management, product portfolio, or research strength - and the broader macroeconomic environment such as the ease of doing business and consumer spending power.Through this approach, Lone Pine Capital invests in a variety of companies. Our research suggests that as of the first quarter of 2023, the firm had invested in 29 companies. Some of these investments belong to sectors that are expected to pick up as the coronavirus pandemic is over and the inflationary environment appears to be subsiding. Others are long term plays, particularly those in the technology industry which has been one of the fastest growing sectors in recent years owing to the proliferation of internet usage and consumer electronics such as the smartphone.Story continuesFor instance, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been a long term investment of Lone Pine Capital. The hedge fund first bought its shares in 2013's final quarter, in the form of 25 million shares that were worth $954 million back then. Based on today's share price, these would be worth a cool $8.4 billion - showcasing a massive gain in just a decade. Lone Pine's latest stake in Microsoft sees the firm own 2.6 million shares that were worth $772 million as of March 2023. In short, roughly one tenth of the hedge fund's 2013 stake in terms of shares is nearly worth the same right now. Based on Microsoft's share price in July, the same 2.6 million shares are worth $876 million.Moving forward to the hedge fund's latest investments, as 2023 kicked off, Lone Pine Capital initiated two new positions and grew its investments significantly in a handful of others. The new investments are in KKR &amp; Co. Inc. (NYSE:KKR) and BILL Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:BILL) - both of which are financial firms with different kinds of operations. KKR is purely an investment company which specializes in private equity - a sector that sees decreased activity when economic growth is slower and interest rates are high. However, as the conditions subside, the activity picks up as risk appetites expand and more firms look to grow their operations. BILL, on the other hand, is a software company that offers a cloud platform that enables businesses to automate their financial operations. KKR's shares are up 25% year to date, and since March, they have appreciated by 11.6%. BILL's shares are the opposite, as while they have gained 11.2% year to date, between March and July, the stock has appreciated by 49.7%.In terms of Assets Under Management (AUM), Lone Pine Capital faced quite a reckoning as of June 2022. By then, the hedge fund had an AUM of $5.4 billion - which marked a sharp 51% drop over the year and pushed it to be the 62nd largest hedge fund in the world. These losses were driven by the fund's bets on the growth and technology sector, with its hedge fund losing 47% between September 2021 and June 2022 and its long only fund tanking by 51.6%. The flagship fund would close the year by posting 36% in losses, and overall, Lone Pine was the fourth worst performing fund in the industry - topped only by C1 Capital, TCI Fund Management, and, of course, Tiger Global.The 2022 shocks continued to impact Lone Pine's portfolio. As of March 2023, it was worth $10.8 billion - marking an annual drop of $6 billion or 36%. And not only did the hedge fund add new positions in the first quarter, but it also removed three companies from its portfolio. These are the life sciences company Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), the regional bank First Citizens BancShares, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCNCA), and the data analytics firm Equifax Inc. (NYSE:EFX). These are part of a broad portfolio adjustment that had also taken place in Q4 2022 which saw Lone Pine divest even more companies including the star performer of 2023, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Meta has been one of the best performing stocks on the market this year, through its absolutely stunning 148% gains year to date.With these details in mind, let's take a look at Lone Pine Capital's top stock picks, with the notable ones being Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Workday, Inc. (NASDAQ:WDAY), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM).Lone Pine Capital: Portfolio, Team, AUM and PerformanceStephen Mandel of Lone Pine CapitalOur Methodology To compile our list of Lone Pine Capital's stocks, we used the fund's SEC filings for the first quarter of this year.

If you want to skip the detailed analysis of Robbins’ net worth, performance and investment philosophy, go directly to Top 5 Stocks in Larry Robbins' Portfolio.Founded in 2000 by billionaire investor Larry Robbins, Glenview Capital Management has evolved to become one of the most successful hedge funds on Wall Street. The hedge fund has often outperformed the overall market with a long/short strategy focused on investments in equity and fixed incomes securities. From January 2001 to December 2010, Glenview Capital, run by Larry Robbins, delivered a 301% return net of fees and expenses. The hedge fund outperformed the average hedge funds and the S&amp;P 500 index in 2010, with a 15.7% return. However, Glenview Capital had a rough year in 2008, when it lost about half of its assets, which were worth $9 billion at the time, and trailed the market. Glenview Capital plunged about 50% in 2008, but it seems to have recovered since then. The fund soared 82.7% in 2009.Robbins has been a major force behind Glenview Capital management's stellar performance, given his vast experience in the hedge fund industry that spans over two decades. He stands out as a reputable money manager capable of holding positions in high-value sectors and companies. The solid performance stems from the hedge fund's investment strategy, commonly related to growth at a reasonable price (GARP). The strategy focuses on companies with strong growth prospects but highly undervalued. It also focuses on companies in predictable industries with steady and recurring revenue streams. Additionally, Glenview Capital Management stays clear of companies with high leverage, low margins, or those facing regulatory risks. Larry Robbins’ current net worth is $1.9 billion.Additionally, the hedge fund is not sector specific. It has diversified its holdings into various segments. Some of its biggest investments are in healthcare, with stakes in hospital chains Tenet Healthcare and HCA Healthcare. Glenview has also diversified its holdings into Industrials. Robbins made profitable bets on healthcare stocks in 2012, which he said were boosted by Obamacare. The hedge fund maintained its strong performance in the next years, with an 84% return in 2013. Robbins resumed his investments in health and travel stocks in mid-2020, because these sectors became more relevant due to the pandemic. His long-term healthcare bets paid off in 2021, when his hedge fund gained 10.3%, while his main fund that focused on healthcare rose 21.1% for the year.Story continuesLarry Robbins Net Worth, Performance and Portfolio.Larry Robbins of Glenview CapitalIn the race to unlock optimum value from its holdings in divergent sectors, Glenview Capital Management also engages in shareholder activism and influences corporate decisions.

87,7ac2b20f-2cf5-3f10-81f0-e57e29c26b98,PPG,2023-07-14,PPG Industries (PPG) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ppg-industries-ppg-earnings-expected-140056729.html,1689256856,STORY,['PPG'],"[PPG Industries (PPG) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 20. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis paint and coatings maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.14 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +18.2%.Revenues are expected to be $4.9 billion, up 4.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.08% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PPG Industries?For PPG Industries, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.57%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #1.So, this combination indicates that PPG Industries will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that PPG Industries would post earnings of $1.55 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.82, delivering a surprise of +17.42%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.PPG Industries appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company said that the new membranes enable cost-effective extraction even from lower-grade brine or claystone deposits.The FilmTec LiNE-XD nanofiltration membrane elements foster sustainability and allow cost-effective extraction from diverse sources. As the world moves toward a greener future, DuPont's nanofiltration membrane elements provide a vital tool in transforming lithium production, creating a sustainable path for powering the increasingly electrified world.DuPont provides solutions to several water and sustainability challenges faced by industrial water users and water treatment municipalities through a broad range of membranes, resins and systems. Its water technologies help purify more than 50 million gallons of water every minute globally, allowing water reuse and recycling, desalination and the safe access of both ground and surface water.DuPont shares have rallied 35.8% in the past year against the 18% rise of its industry.

It has amassed assets over $11.49 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap BlendLarge cap companies typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option, large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.Blend ETFs usually hold a mix of growth and value stocks as well as stocks that exhibit both value and growth characteristics.CostsExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts, other things remaining the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.09%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.42%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Looking at individual holdings, Nextera Energy Inc (NEE) accounts for about 5.21% of total assets, followed by Tesla Inc (TSLA) and Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd.The top 10 holdings account for about 34.3% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskGSLC seeks to match the performance of the Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Large Cap Equity Index before fees and expenses.

In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $71.02 and $88.41.The ETF has a beta of 0.98 and standard deviation of 17.98% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 205 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesGoldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Large Cap Equity ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors.

Gillian Tett, The Financial Times Editor-at-Large, U.S., tells Yahoo Finance Live about what investors will be looking for from big banks' quarterly reports.Video Transcript- Citi, JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, they're all kicking off earnings season for the big banks tomorrow. There is a fair bit of caution following the sector after the earlier turmoil this year, but some are feeling bullish. Jefferies analysts upped their rating on JPMorgan recently to buy from hold citing the bank's stable outlook.Joining us now is Gillian Tett, chair of the Financial Times editorial board and US editor-at-large. It's great to see you. It seems like a lot of the focus is going to be on expenses for these banks, right? Current expenses and future expenses as well, both from regulation and what's been happening with rates.GILLIAN TETT: Absolutely. Well, I mean, several reasons. Firstly, the banks are facing a very uncertain regulatory climate that obviously benefits the big banks over the small banks because they have more money to throw at the problem. But that will be another issue that people are looking at.At the same time, though, they're also looking at questions about, what is the future of financial services and banking? And how much real estate do they really need or those bank branches? Which leads to the other big themes that investors are going to be looking at when it comes to the bank earnings. Firstly, what do they reveal about corporate real estate exposures?We've had lots of warnings from people like Jay Powell from the Fed about the level of potential pain being felt in the commercial real estate sector. So what everyone is asking is, how bad will that get? Which banks will be hit or not? And then last but not least, the baffling question of consumers, what on Earth is happening to consumers in America? Given that on the one hand, their fundamentals are remaining surprisingly strong, and they're still spending, it seems, to a degree albeit slowing down. But they keep telling all the surveys and polls that they are incredibly gloomy. So a lot to look for in the bank earnings.Story continues- To what extent do you believe that deposits will be a lingering theme this bank earnings season?GILLIAN TETT: They certainly will be a lingering theme because of course, the shadow of Silicon Valley Bank and the shock of seeing how quickly those deposits flooded out is something that nobody is going to forget quickly. And the reality is that in spite of all the Fed's reports and people like Michael Barr who's been-- did that big report for the Fed, the reality is we still haven't really seen a particularly convincing fix to these problems in terms of preventing these dramatic outflows if investors start to lose confidence in any particular banks.Now, the good news is that there's no sign they're losing confidence in the big banks, and there hasn't really been a sort of panic attack in the regional banking system since we had the STB crisis. But, of course, if things do start to turn nasty, if we do start to get say see commercial real estate loans creating real problems for smaller and regional banks, the question about whether there is time to overhaul the Federal Deposit Insurance scheme or not is going to come up on the agenda and you're going to see more questions looking at deposits.And of course, the other question is as banks are under pressure to raise the rate of return they gave to investors or depositors leaving their money with them, we're going to see which of the banks can actually cope with that kind of squeeze or not.- Talking of another kind of bank, Goldman Sachs, there's been some reporting that the company is sort of quietly trying to downplay expectations, which is different for Goldman. I just wonder what you make of that and what that tells us not just about that bank, but about the bigger environment. Or maybe it's just about Goldman, I don't know.GILLIAN TETT: Well, it's very interesting. I mean, Goldman doesn't report until next week after JPMorgan and Wells Fargo and Citi and groups like that. And in the past, it's been vociferously opposed to the idea of trying to guide earnings. This time for the first time, it is trying to guide earnings down. That may be because it's simply trying a new tactic in terms of its investor relations, but it may also be that Goldman has got more bad news to share, whether that's on the commercial real estate side or whether that's on some of the potentially hung bridges that it's been involved in. Or maybe it's back to the issue about Marcus again, there's considerable concern about its adventures in the retail banking sphere and why those have gone badly.So we simply don't know yet why Goldman's has changed its tactic and its tune, but it's certainly something that's causing quite a buzz on the street right now.- Is it all possible or is there a pathway towards us getting past even the falling action of the banking turmoil without there being a commercial real estate crisis?GILLIAN TETT: Well, the commercial real estate issue is very, very interesting indeed because if you look at the macro aggregate data, it's pretty nasty. I mean, you've had interest rates now jump up 500 basis points in the last 18 months. You've got about 250 plus billion worth of commercial real estate loans that are due to mature this year. And if you look across the next three years, it's about $1.5 trillion. So that's going to really hurt.And you've also got office occupancy collapsing. I mean, McKinsey is out with a big report this morning, which suggests that between now and say 2030, you're going to see a permanent decline in office usage by about 20% in a benign scenario. If it's a bad scenario, it could be 38% economic scenario. So there's a lot of pain there.But the critical thing that I think investors need to understand is that those aggregate numbers conceal a huge variation, not just between cities-- I mean, Houston is pretty different from San Francisco right now. And not just between city districts. I mean, what's happening in the East Village in New York and what's happening on Wall Street is quite different. But also between different buildings.And you're seeing a real split between the good buildings that are green, digitally connected, and suited for hybrid working whose for the most part are seeing rents increase and the values increase. And the legacy buildings, what the industry calls class B and class C that are really, really suffering right now.So the question that hangs over the bank earnings is, what kind of commercial real estate loans exactly are they exposed to? We don't always know. And then the other really big question politically is, can the city leaders in places like Manhattan or San Francisco get their act together and change the zoning laws to ensure that these buildings can be rapidly reconverted away from office buildings that are losing their values into the kind of buildings that people actually want, like cheap apartments for young professionals who still actually want to live in cities?- Yeah, well-noted, Gillian. If you kept running through New York neighborhoods, I thought you were going to get to downtown Brooklyn in my neck of the woods at some point. Great to speak with you here this morning. Gillian Tett, chair of the Financial Times editorial board and US editor-at-large. Thanks so much, Gillian.GILLIAN TETT: Thank you.]"

I’m Alan Murray.Michal Lev-Ram: And I’m Michal Lev-Ram. Alan, summer is the season of the big cinematic blockbuster. And this summer is no exception or, actually, it kind of is an exception because we're back to summer blockbusters. Finally. And there's one blockbuster in particular that has been the topic of a whole lot of gossip and speculation and anticipation.Audio clip from Barbie movie:  [Energetic voices.] Hi, Barbie! Hi, Barbie! Hi, Barbie! Hi, Barbie! Hi, Barbie! Hi, Barbie! [Somber voices.] Hi, Ken. Hi, Ken.Murray:  That of course is the trailer for the new Barbie movie in theaters July 21 and, Michal, we're going to rush out to see it. It's highly anticipated for a whole bunch of reasons, some of them nostalgic interest in one of America's most beloved and sometimes controversial toys. But it's also the first live action feature produced by Mattel Films, the film production division of toy giant Mattel.Lev-Ram:  So I have no shame in saying that I'm actually very excited about this movie, Alan. As a little girl in Israel where I grew up I played with Barbies. I think they may have been knockoff Barbies. I'm not sure if they were made by Mattel. Sorry. But I'm really curious to see you know how this movie is going to portray Barbie in kind of the the modern era and obviously we've seen a lot of evolution with the product itself with the toy. I'm very curious about this.Story continuesMurray:  Michal, it's not just a reimagination of the Barbie image but it's also a reimagination of the company. Mattel Films is one of a few initiatives spearheaded by Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz, who is our guest in today's episode of Leadership Next. Ynon took over as CEO of Mattel in 2018, making him the fourth CEO in four years, and he came from the filmmaking business. So I think he had it in mind from the beginning that this is one of the ways he would resurrect the company.Lev-Ram:  Yeah, no, that's right, Alan. Ynon is another turnaround CEO we're featuring this season. We've had a few. And when he took over, Mattel's operating income was at $343 million loss. Its internal culture was described as rigid and top down. You know, being the fourth CEO in four years, normally not a great sign of a company's trajectory. And I, I think really interesting that they brought in someone with his background. He had actually become chairman of the board and then was asked to take over as CEO. I did a story on Mattel quite a few years back, a couple of CEOs ago, and was really struck by, you know, again, the culture and just kind of some of the rigidity of how they approach toy making and how they approach the distribution side.Murray:  Yeah, Ynon knew from the beginning that he had a turnaround on his hands. When he first arrived, he restructured the company, laid off a couple 1000 people. He has worked to win back an important partnership that was key to the company's financial health, and that was the license to the Disney Princess and Frozen doll lines, which they had last to Hasbro in 2016. But one of his primary focuses has been, as I mentioned before, the development of Mattel's IP into movies and other forms of media.Lev-Ram:  Yeah, and this totally makes sense as you said before, Ynon was formerly, you know, in the media entertainment world. That's his background. He helped launch Fox Kids Europe in 1996. He was also the CEO of Maker Studios, where he helped negotiate a sale of Maker to Disney and I'm sure he's very familiar with the success that you know, entities like Marvel, Hasbro have had in developing their IP and really extending their IP to other platforms. So we talked to Ynon about why this is a priority for him. We should mention there are a lot of movies in the pipeline. It's not just Barbie, but this obviously is kind of the pinnacle of Mattel products. And he also explained to us more about other turnaround efforts, which you just mentioned, Alan, as well as how those efforts are already paying off financially.Murray:  And by the way, when you see the movie, there is apparently an Ynon Kreiz character in the movie, the CEO of Mattel played by Will Ferrell. So that's got to be kind of fun for him. And Michal he is also from Israel.Lev-Ram:  He is, although we did not conduct the interview in Hebrew, just for you, Alan and for our listeners. So, you know, everybody will have to tell us what they think of the movie when they actually go and see it. But with that in mind, here is our conversation with Ynon Kreiz of Mattel.Ynon, thank you for joining us. I'm going to just start with a really kind of basic question. You joined Mattel in 2018, the fourth CEO in four years, I understand. Not usually the, you know, harbinger of things are going swell when there's that much turnover. So, tell us a little bit about just why you took the job. Clearly, Mattel had been going through some tough times. So I want to start there.Ynon Kreiz:  And actually, Michal, I saw one of your old write-ups on Mattel, when you came here in, I think 2017.Lev-Ram:  Margaret [Georgiadis] had just taken the job.Kreiz:  Yeah, I, I thought of you because I think you need to come back. And if you just came back and you walk around by yourself for five minutes, you'll get the whole story without talking to anybody. It's, you know, it's all the difference in the world. It's a different, it's a different company. I joined the board in 2017 and I was curious to be part of a company that is going through a, a transformation. And I was offered to be chairman. And before I was formally appointed the prior CEO resigned and they asked me to, to become CEO and chairman. And by that time, I could, you know, I was very excited about the opportunity to be part of a company that is so iconic. But among all the things that I saw as an opportunity, I took our portfolio of iconic franchises in children and family entertainment to be an incredible opportunity to extend the company outside of the toy aisle. And so the journey was going to be about how do you transform Mattel from being a toy manufacturing company that was making items to become an IP company that is managing franchises. And this is not to say that the idea was to move out of the toy side of the business, which because it's a great business to be in.Lev-Ram:  Clearly, in order to bring about that transformation, some painful decisions have to be made. Can you talk a little bit about just your assessment early on? And, you know, what did need to be restructured? Organizationally, layoffs that needed to happen? Just how did you go about setting that strategy?Kreiz:  You know, looking back, there were many things that we had to do at the time. We needed to restore profitability and regain top line growth. And we entered a very comprehensive restructuring program whereby my team and our own people were really in the lead in driving those changes. And in the course of those the first three years, in fact, a bit less than three years, we achieved cost savings that exceeded a billion dollars in the company. We reduced the organization by 35% in terms of the workforce, and became much leaner, much more agile in focus on, on, on on performance and productivity. Since then, we achieved another $200 million of savings. So in the last five years, we achieved over $1.2 billion of savings and on our way to achieve another about 100 million in 2023. In addition, we became more capitalized, we exited five factories, we reduced the number of items that we were making by more than a third so that we increase productivity and profitability of the items that we were making. We worked a lot on culture, on internal culture, to align the organization around what is that we are here to to achieve. Making sure that we share the same purpose and mission and the same leadership values and all the key attributes that define our narrative. And you know, another, you know, to kind of share with you some of you know, in the most simplistic way, how you know, what it meant at the time is that, you know, we took a strategy document that was three inch thick and turned it into a one page document that is very easy to understand. It's not necessarily easy to execute, but it's easy to understand, and this is half the battle in making sure that the organization shares the same goals and objectives and that we all try to achieve the same thing.Murray:  It's very impressive. You know, at the time you took over in 2018, a lot of people said, Hey, what the heck is this? A movie guy taking over a toy company? Why does that make sense? And of course, you've just argued part of it is just good operations. But part of it was also what you said at the outset, which is how do we use this great IP, the intellectual property that Mattel has built up over the years in other ways. We are on the cusp of seeing, I guess, the first big example of that with the Barbie movie. How important is that movie to Mattel's future?Kreiz:  Through our toy product is where we establish an emotional connection with our fans. Toys are unique because they're tactile. Kids and consumers touch them, hug them, go to bed with them. Toys are aspirational and inspirational. And having a healthy toy business allows us to develop and strengthen this emotional relationship we have with our fans. And going back to my point earlier in that these are fans, this is an audience. And once you realize that and it becomes part of your DNA, it opens up a world of opportunities. And so over that period, we also continued to evolve the entertainment side of the company, in bringing in experts. We're not in the business of funding movies or financing films or investing in areas that are not our core expertise. Our currency are the franchises that we own, that we bring to the relationship we develop with key players in those verticals. But what we do have inside Mattel are people that can have that dialogue. That people that have that organic experience and relationship within the industry. So we're not you know, as as the IP owner, we're not just, we're not handing over the franchises and walk off the field. We are actually in the game. We are on the field. We play a key role on the creative side, on the production side, on how these projects evolve.Murray:  Yeah, and so how is Barbie the movie going to change our perception, the world's perception, of Barbie the franchise, Barbie the character?Lev-Ram:  And I want to point out Alan is your target demographic here, right?Murray:  I'll get to the Hot Wheels movie. I want to talk about the Barbie movie first.Kreiz:  Alan, I promise you will enjoy the Barbie movie and you will thank me for recommending it. But but you know the Barbie movie is our first and obviously a very important project for us. The movie will recontextualize what people think of the Barbie brand. And it will be it will be something that is unexpected. The movie has many easter eggs and many surprises that you haven't seen yet in the trailer. It's multi dimensional, you know, the movie is fun and funny. It's smart and innovative, it's light-hearted and happy, as well as very emotional and inspirational. So you do have different levels of of engagement and experiences that will appeal to broad audiences and will be very special, very unique. And this is what Greta [Gerwig] really as a visionary, as a creative leader did such an amazing job in creating something, you know, there isn't another movie like it that you can point and say it's like this movie or it's like that movie. It's its own unique expression.Lev-Ram:  Alan and I are going to go see it and we'll let you know if it changes our perception of Barbie afterwards.Murray:  But now you're going to now you're going to ask about the Hot Wheels.Lev-Ram:  Well, I want first I want to ask one more question on the Barbie movie. We understand that Will Ferrell is playing the role of Mattel CEO. Did you have a say in that? How do you feel about him portraying you?Kreiz:  Well, I've been a Will Ferrell fan for many, many years, going back to Zoolander. He's hilarious. He can definitely get away with things I will never be able to. And I just thought when I saw it. I was on the floor laughing. He is hilarious.[Music starts]Murray:  Jason Girzadas, the CEO-elect of Deloitte US, is the sponsor of this podcast and joins me today. Welcome, Jason.Jason Girzadas:  Thank you, Alan. It’s great to be here.Murray:  Jason, we live in an era of disruption, technology disruption, geopolitical disruption, workplace disruption, and it makes accurate predictions about what’s going to happen in the future more difficult than it has ever been. Yet the polls that we do together with you show that most business leaders largely remain optimistic. Why do you think that is?Girzadas:  I think optimism is a result of the fact that we’ve been through an incredibly tumultuous three years. And so I think business leaders realize that they’ve built resiliency into their organizations. The prospect of even more disruption isn’t as foreign of a concept, and I think there’s more confidence in their ability to adapt and to be agile. Secondarily, there’s been tremendous investment in technology and new capabilities that client organizations and executives broadly are optimistic about those creating more value and more opportunities. So, it’s a function of what we’ve been through, as well as the investments that have been made that give a sense of optimism despite some of the headwinds.Murray:  And what’s your advice to companies that are struggling with the potential disruption in the future?Girzadas:  Well, disruption is the new normal. I don’t think there’s any placid water on the horizon or calmness that we can predict. So it’s a function of getting accustomed to the discontinuities that are ahead of us. Whether it’s around technology, or geopolitical change, or workplace changes associated with the future of work, or the demands of the talent workforce, change is the new normal, and as a result, it is requiring executive teams to actually look holistically at those challenges, be [inaudible] with doing scenario planning, and being on the lookout for where and how to capitalize on disruption—versus being concerned by it or seen as a barrier to their success.Murray:  Jason, thanks for your perspective. And thanks for sponsoring Leadership Next.[Music ends]Lev-Ram:  One thing I wanted to ask, and this seems pretty core to Mattel's financial health as as well, is you won back the license to the Disney Princess and Frozen doll line from Hasbro just pretty recently. So curious, why and how did Mattel lose it? How did you get it back? We should probably point out that speaking of Disney, you also have a history of Disney not just on the content side. But you sold a company in the past, a media entity to Disney. Bob Iger is back. Like there's there's a lot of different thread lines here. But tell us a little bit about what happened, you know, back aways when Mattel lost the license, and how did you get it back?Kreiz:  Yeah, we did lose the franchise in 2014. It was an important franchise back in the day, of course. So losing it had had a real impact on the company. But, you know, fast forward to today as it was a moment, another, an important win, and an important part of our journey to position Mattel as a partner of choice in collaborating with the major entertainment partners. We won it on merit. Needless to say, you know, trust played a key role here. And Mattel has evolved over those years to become an incredible, incredible platform, both in terms of design and development, with a very strong supply chain that is, we call now, a competitive advantage, and a very large scale commercial platform as we sell product in more than 500,000 stores globally, which represent about 70% of the business and another 30% as we work with all the leading omni channel players or the online retailers. So and when you add that together with what we did on the business side, in terms of strengthening our balance sheet and becoming investment grade, which happened a few short weeks ago, that was another key moment. When we started the transformation, our leverage ratio was 25 times that to adjusted EBITDA and it feels a long way away relative to where we are today with investment grade, a strong balance sheet and and you know as we continue to gain market share and position the company for long term growth.Lev-Ram:  Okay, another another question since I brought up Disney Princesses is I did a story, we talked about this earlier, I did a story on Mattel a few years back before you became CEO, and I was really struck by how kind of old school, a bit archaic, the the sort of gender delineation felt with the toy franchises. Obviously on the retail side as well and that's something that's evolved a bit at least with some retailers. So I'm just wondering you know as things evolve in our society, cultural norms evolve, how do you keep Mattel evolving with the times while holding on to these incredibly iconic franchises, whether it's Hot Wheels or Barbie? How do you look at that?Kreiz:  Our mission is to create innovative products and experiences that inspire, entertain and develop children through play. And our purpose is to empower the next generation to explore the wonder of childhood and reach the full potential. These are the overarching parts of the framework. We also position Mattel, you know, define our aim to contribute to a more equitable, sustainable, inclusive and sustainable future in terms of how we contribute in our way to a better tomorrow for future generations. And this has been a key part of what we do. It's in our, and this is not done for marketing purposes, it is in our product. It's in our internal communication. It's how we think about the role that we play with consumers. We take what we do very seriously. We understand that we have real impact on society. We aim to partner with parents and support them partner with families and and instill important values in the in future generations.Murray:  I salute you for that. I saw Mattel recently released a a Barbie with Down syndrome, so that young girls with Down syndrome could see themselves in the Barbie doll. And that's so important. But I also know, I mean, you talk about keeping up with cultural norms. Cultural norms are also political norms and have become a very hotly contested, as you know, probably better than I do, your your fellow colleagues at Disney are in the midst of a mess in Florida right now. How do you serve those different cultural norms without getting caught in the political crossfire? And are you concerned about that?Kreiz:  Look we're very conscious of cultural trends. What what we do is organic and authentic. We haven't changed posture. We haven't, you know, we're not being responsive. And in fact, one of our core strengths is making what we do very culturally relevant. And this is where you bring together the art and science of narrating our own story, where you work on, you know, we realize that our brands, our franchises, are timeless, but they also have to be timely. And this is this is now one of our core strength core capabilities. And in that regard, the Barbie movie will be a great representation of that. In taking a 64-year-old brand, and making it so relevant and current to today's consumers. You know, Barbie itself is today the flag carrier for diversity and inclusivity. And, and again, this is not for marketing purposes. It's it's in the product.Murray:  And it's evident, it's evident in the product, but you must have to struggle with how do we embrace cultural trends and cultural norms and avoid political crossfire. Because it's not always clear that you can do both.Kreiz:  We do what we do in a thoughtful way, we stay true to our purpose and mission and this is our North Star. This is how we narrate and navigate those situations. And our voice is important. We really express it, for the most part, through our own product. And this is really the best way to showcase what we think and how we feel about things. And being thoughtful and truthful to what is that we're trying to achieve.Lev-Ram:  Alan really wants to talk politics, but I'm going to save you a little bit here. Do you have another political question, Alan?Murray:  No, no, no, no, no, no. Ynon has managed to answer both my questions without even using the word politics. So I think I'll carry on.Lev-Ram:  I'm going to just assume that you and Bob Iger have some interesting conversations. But we'll leave it at that. I did want to ask just real quick, you know, on the kind of evolution side culturally but also going back getting back to growth as a business, are acquisitions part of the strategy? I know Mattel has made acquisitions in the past. Is that something that you're looking at? I don't think you've done any that I know of at least or any big ones. But what's your thinking on that front going forward?Kreiz:  No, our priority was to become investment grade, retain that, you know, that credit rating. And now that we are investment grade, as part of our capital allocation priorities, we will also look at M&amp;A situations. Our goal is to create long-term shareholder value and having a strong balance sheet and investment grade gives us that flexibility and optionality to look at different ways to to benefit from a strong balance, you know, balance sheets, creating long-term shareholder value.Murray:  Ynon, I'd like to ask you about what you do when you're not creating Barbie movies. How you relax. How you unwind. I understand you're a kite surfer.Lev-Ram:  He plays with Barbies. What are you talking about?Murray: Are you still, maybe you kite surf with Barbies, but you're still a kite surfer?Kreiz: Yeah, kite surfing is my main, my main sport. I still do it whenever I can. You know, I'm also a father of four children. And that that is a whole you know, whole...Murray: That's a sport.Kreiz: ...thing in itself. Fortunately, I can share some of that time with my kids who also kitesurf so it is a family sport. But you know, the work at Mattel is very fulfilling and always fun. Yes, it's challenging and of course, it never ends. But it's not a job where you need, it's not a sense where I need to come home and unwind. You know, I relish the challenge and the excitement that this company creates and this is ongoing. And we like it that way.Lev-Ram: Well, next time you agree to take a chairman of the board position, you should probably be careful because you may be asked to be CEO, I guess. Lesson learned. Thank you so much, Ynon. I really appreciate you being on with us today. And Alan and I will go watch the movie. We will give you our unsolicited feedback and looking forward to it.Kreiz: Great, thank you. I can't wait to hear.Murray: Thanks so much and congratulations on everything you've done at Mattel.Leadership Next is edited and produced by Alexis Haut. Our theme is by Jason Snell.

From fashion trends to viral social media campaigns, Mattel's landmark doll brand may even have consumers of all spending calibers covered. David Bellinger, Roth MKM Consumer Growth &amp; eCommerce Senior Analyst, explains how the success of Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"" movie could drive growth for discount retailer Five Below as branded items fill the shelves.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]""Barbie's"" big Box Office debut could give retailers a boost, at least, according to our next guest. Roth MKM says the buzz around the film could drive traffic to stores like Five Below in particular. Citing previous successes from blockbusters like ""Frozen.""The analyst behind the call is David Bellinger and he joins me now. David, good to see you here. So from an investor perspective here, how should people be approaching Five Below in relation to the success that we might see with the ""Barbie"" movie?DAVID BELLINGER: Yeah. thanks for having me on. So Five Below historically has been one of these companies that's drafted off new intellectual property very well. We saw some precedent with this, you mentioned ""Frozen."" We had ""The Super Mario Brothers"" released over the Easter weekend that was much better than expected from a domestic Box Office standpoint.And Five gets ahead of these trends. They fill their stores with a number of items. We're in the stores a lot. We've come across 30 plus licensed ""Barbie"" items, while that's not material, just given that Five Below sells thousands of products within their store.It could generate enough buzz via social media and other means to get people in the store. They really discover the Five Below brands. They shop other categories and they come back. So we've seen that historically too with things like fidget spinners and other crazes. And that's what really unleashes the power of the Five Below model and gets them a nice new customer base that continues to spend WellStory continuesRACHELLE AKUFFO: So, would this be the best time to get in then to Five Below versus, sort of, obviously, the movie is coming out shortly or isn't it best to sort of wait and see as we have like more blockbusters also coming out this summer?DAVID BELLINGER: Yeah, there's clearly a new slate of movies that's come out that we haven't had over the past few years. There's a ""Paw Patrol"" movie coming out as well. But look, I like Five Below. This is a long-term growth story. Some of these smaller catalysts, they're not a huge deal for their stock but they could help out in some type of way.And we'll be keeping a close eye on this ""Barbie"" release and the Box Office numbers as they come in. I think it could be a nice positive. But if you step back and just look at the growth potential of this model going from 1,200 to 3,500 plus stores, this company is on a real nice trajectory to get to somewhere of five billion plus in sales.And you could easily see earnings power go from between $5 and $6 per share this year, upwards of $10. And that's what I think gets investors really bullish on this name. And it's not just a single quarter or two. This is a nice long-term trajectory here.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And who would you say would be the main competition for Five Below when it comes to some of these licensed products from the ""Barbie"" movie and some of these other big franchises?DAVID BELLINGER: Yeah, it's an interesting question. So your big retailers, your Amazons, Walmarts, Targets, they sell a lot of this product. But there's no one out there that's really the last true comparable for Five.You have Toys R US go away. And they're really one of the last kid's retailers within the US. And they get ahead of these trends and that's what's really helped them. They've been able to garner much more product, much more inventory, they've got a great relationship with their suppliers, and they want to be part of this long-term growth algorithm, right?They know Fives coming out with big new store growth numbers. They want to invest behind that. Get their inventory in these stores. So Fives really leading the category up. It alone, really, in terms of themselves. But they do pry away from some share from these bigger players and their low-price points are a clear way of doing that.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And you raise a good point. I mean, I have a 9-year-old. I'll be lucky if I can leave Five Below just spending $5. Because as you mentioned, once you get them in the door-- where you used to have a Toys R US everywhere, now there's Five Below and you sort of have multiple things you can spend on there.Talk about five below expansion plans when it comes to, especially, sort of, children's retail or some of these more trendy-- some of these trends that they're able to capitalize on in a way that some of these other stores can't.DAVID BELLINGER: Yeah, I've got a four-and-a-half-year-old daughter and I'm in the stores a lot as well, spending a lot of money too. So I think what they really do well is-- these relationships with suppliers, they pick off trends early.And in my checks, I've seen hot items like collectibles, Pokemon cards, sports trading cards, I mentioned those fidget spinners a few years ago, and it really creates this halo effect around the business. And Five has sort of become the HomeSense for kids. It's this treasure hunt, got a nice discovery piece to it, and like you mentioned, you're not just buying one item.You might build your basket and spend anywhere from $15, $20 to $30. And then, just not knowing what you're going to find that treasure-hunt field, that's what keeps you coming back. And Five has garnered a lot of new customers.And I think they're driving a lot more of their organic traffic now. They're driving their traffic more organically as opposed to drafting off other adjacent retailers. So that's really what's in their DNA and I expect that to continue for years to come.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And as we've seen, though, as people have been tightening their purse strings. Not all value plays are created equal here. So are there any risks that you see for Five Below that people should be aware of?DAVID BELLINGER: Yeah, I mean, just a broader spending pullback, right? There's partially a lower-income consumer that could shop these stores. So that's a potential risk factor. You also have a little limited visibility on these movie releases, right?You don't know if ""Barbie's"" going to be a hit or not so that could create some volatility. But overall, in my sense, I feel as though consumers have been trading down somewhat, right? You might not buy that $30, $40, toy. You might buy a $5 to $10 item.And Five has this great value flavor to the business. They've expanded into these Five Beyond products, a new concept in their store. I've seen items upwards of $25. But even though, that might be a higher price point.Those have continued to sell well because-- just the value differential versus what you might find at a Amazon, Target or Walmart, there are a lot of also exclusive products that Five sells and they've really tapped into that core customer. And they've held on to them really-- exceptionally well.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, there you go. I'm sure consumers will be saying goodbye to their money, but at least some good news for investors here when it comes to Five Below. A big thank you there to David Bellinger, Roth MKM consumer growth and e-commerce senior analyst. Thank you for your time this morning.DAVID BELLINGER: Thank you.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, we've got another positive inflation--]"

Barbie. He-Man. Rock ’Em Sock ’Em. This place has it all, showcasing nearly 80 years of toy history that maps a fascinating journey of play and pop culture. On one end, there’s a giant Hot Wheels Track. On the other, there are rows and rows of old Barbie doll heads (and a few of Ken’s, too), where designers invent new hairstyles, sculpt new bodies and paint new faces with the most delicate of brushes.Most Read from BloombergA $500 Billion Corporate-Debt Storm Builds Over Global EconomyTesla Investor Rode a 14,800% Gain Thanks to 27-Year-Old AnalystRags-to-Riches Wealth Fund Veteran Plans to Run for Singapore PresidentSingapore Passport Is World’s Most Powerful, Replacing JapanMeet the Billionaire Who Convinced Messi to Pick MLS Over Saudi ArabiaAhead of Barbie’s big screen debut, produced by Mattel Inc. and Warner Bros Discovery Inc., I wanted to learn more about how her makers are inventing her next act. The movie marks a big bet by Mattel, which hopes to turn legacy brands into blockbuster franchises, and it was reportedly in development well before the company settled on director Greta Gerwig’s interpretation.Early reviews of the movie, which premieres July 21, are positive. Time calls it a “fun, yet self-aware romp,” while Variety’s social media editor praised it as “perfection.” Expectations are high. Barbie is the most popular doll of all time, after all. She’s an icon, a cultural lightning rod, and an 11.5 inch piece of plastic who has represented and projected our biggest aspirations and flaws since she was created in 1959.In this episode of “The Circuit,” I sat down with Mattel Inc. Chief Executive Officer Ynon Kreiz, the leader of the company’s new IP-to-content strategy, and Robbie Brenner, an Oscar-nominated producer whom Kreiz convinced to head Mattel’s burgeoning films division. Their goal is to re-ignite the conversation around a massive but controversial brand that has struggled in recent years, and potentially cement Mattel’s place as a future Hollywood hitmaker. (Think Marvel, if they’re lucky.)Story continues“That was a lot to live up to,” Brenner told me. Barbie “is an open-ended conversation. Like, what is that movie?...Greta had sort of this idea of a high heel and a Birkenstock. And that was sort of her leaping off point of what this movie should be. And I thought, God, that's kind of brilliant.”But will it be brilliant enough to reinvigorate sales? We spoke with Barbie’s product designers, a seamstress and a face painter, as well as veteran Mattel executive Lisa McKnight, who has helped evolve the brand to address popular opinion. “The biggest flag that we heard, and when we did some research, was moms in particular didn't feel good about giving Barbie as a birthday gift,” McKnight said. “They didn't see her as a role model. They saw her as too perfect.”My favorite part of the episode, by far, is meeting Richard Dickson, Mattel president and chief operating officer, who took me on a whimsical toy-filled tour starting with the founding of the toymaker itself. It sounds remarkably like a typical Silicon Valley tale. There’s a garage, a couple of men, and a woman — who gets written out of the story. But this modern-day imagination factory is trying mightily to correct the oversights of its past.This episode of The Circuit With Emily Chang premieres Thursday, July 13, at 8 p.m. in New York on the Bloomberg app and Bloomberg.com and on Bloomberg Television at 10 p.m. Check out The Circuit podcast for extended conversations.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekNo Testing, No Inspections: Contaminated Eyedrops Blinded and Killed AmericansWeightWatchers Is Gambling Everything on Obesity DrugsWhat If the Next Big Social Media App Is ...

Amazon announces this year's Prime Day was its biggest sales event on record. Pharmaceutical manufacturer Perrigo has received FDA approval on its over-the-counter birth control pill, Opill.Video Transcript- All right, let's take a look at some of the individual movers of the day. Let's start with Progressive. That stock sliding into the red after earnings lagged the Street's estimates. We're looking at a drop of just about 13%, and that is the biggest drop that we have seen since 2008. It's one of the worst performers in the S&amp;P.So obviously, these results, Ali, disappointing the Street. Wells Fargo out with a note saying that it shows that the auto insurers are continuing to be impacted by quote elevated severity, and we're seeing that caution reflected in some of the competitors as well.- Yeah. And insurance has gotten more and more expensive, but also fixing cars has gotten more expensive. So that obviously pressures margins. I'm very happy I don't have a car, so I don't have to worry about car insurance right now. But it is interesting, though, because there was a research report from JP Morgan earlier this month saying that Progressive is a leader in this space but that the stock is fully valued at this point, but clearly a lot of challenges in the insurance space as well.- No, definitely. I mean, look, you know, I have a family member who's there who gave me kind of a heads up that this was-- things were a little rough there. So I'm not as surprised to see these actual numbers play out today. I said maybe you should start looking for somewhere else. I'm sorry. That's a little bit of a sidebar.But we also know that we've talked about this before, cars becoming more expensive or maintenance because people are keeping their cars for longer. The length of time the duration people are keeping their cars around 12 years again, that putting pressure on the margins in terms of just the cost to insure the vehicle. I want to switch gears to another stock that we are watching. Shares of Amazon popping today up a little more than 2.5% on the back of its annual Prime Day event.Story continuesAdobe Analytics estimating online spending shot up 6% to $6.4 billion on the first day alone. The projection for both days is top $12 billion. I know going into this, they were expecting to see above $13 billion, and we'll see when it all shakes out. Now Amazon, of course, we know doesn't reveal its total sales for those two days, but consumers bought more than 375 million items during the event. That's what Amazon says. Did you guys buy anything?- I bought some things, yeah. I can never really stay away from Amazon Prime. They get me with all of their deals. They're too good to pass up. But a couple of things did jump out to me in these results and really what we heard from the report from Adobe, and that's the fact that average order size was up 3% on a year-over-year basis. Obviously, not a huge surprise given inflation, given the fact that these goods do cost more. But more shoppers were using buy now, pay later, and that certainly is just a sign of the times that we are in right now. Consumers more strapped for cash, and they're using that option so they don't have to pay the full amount, at least up front.- And it's hard to draw concrete conclusions about what this means on the state of consumer. You don't know if people are buying things down the line for the holidays, for Christmas, for birthdays, what have you. But $2.5 billion saved via some of these deals, and now I'm regretting not getting in on these Amazon--- Oh, I did.- --Prime Sales. I didn't--- You always have to have a list ready for a day like this.- I know.- You don't-- I mean, obviously, I am not advocating the buy now pay later kind of program, but I have my list for days like that, and I say, you know, like I have a few appliances, and I'm like what is-- so I got a blender. I'm finally there you go, proud owner of a Vitamix.- Oh, there we go.- That was a good investment.- That was a good buy.- That's worth it.- And especially because I price compared it to last year's Prime Day was the same price even though the normal price is higher this year with inflation. So even with where inflation is, they didn't cut the discount. I appreciate that.- No, but clearly, this is such a huge day days for Amazon, and they pour a lot of money marketing into this, whether it's online, TV, what have you. So good for Amazon. One stock I'm watching is Perrigo. Their Opill oral contraceptive has become the first over-the-counter birth control approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Shares closing roughly flat, but they were up more than 4% earlier today on that news.And guys, this is a big deal, especially in the United States. The company said it will likely be available in the US in early 2024. But what's interesting is that this pill was available with the prescription since 1973. So it took 50 years to get this to be over-the-counter. It is available without a prescription in over 100 countries outside of the US. So the US lagging there, but a big, big win for reproductive rights for sure.- It is, I mean, this is a huge milestone in general for women and just where we've come and the issues we've had to deal with recently. But one of the things that could be affecting the stock price is. We don't know the price of this. So how will that play into what it does revenue-wise for Perrigo and in terms of its bottom line in general. But it's a big win for women.- It certainly is a huge win. And going off of what you were saying just in terms of we don't know what the price is yet. We also don't know what insurance coverage is going to look like because insurers are not mandated to cover a pill that is over-the-counter. It does not hold up to the same standards as what is need a prescription for, so there are so many questions just in terms of what people are going to have to pay on a monthly basis if they do want to buy the pill. So it does remove the barrier given the fact that it is over the counter, but that cost is certainly a massive variable here just in terms of wider adoption.- And the company did say they want it to be affordable, but that's relative, right? Like what exactly does that mean we mean?- We'll see what that will be. But a huge day for women in terms of just the availability of it. All right, Ali, we appreciate you helping us with all of this.- Of course.]"

Ibis Reproductive Health President Kelly Blanchard tells Yahoo Finance Live what the approval means for contraceptive market.Video Transcript- Well, today the Food and Drug Administration approved the first-ever over-the-counter birth control pill that can be taken daily. Now consumers will be able to purchase Opill at pharmacies and drugstores without a prescription as a milestone in the fight for contraceptive access.The US joins over 100 other countries worldwide, where birth control pills can be bought without a prescription. Kelly Blanchard, Ibis Reproductive Health President joins us now for more on this. Good to have you on the show Kelly so talk about the significance of this approval.KELLY BLANCHARD: This-- it's just an amazing day. It's been a long journey to this moment. We know that in the United States, many people face barriers to accessing contraception under the current prescription requirement.And being able to access a safe and highly effective birth control pill directly off the shelf will be, we hope, just a transformative advance, and allow people to really make those decisions that they want to make about building their families. Being able to implement what they want-- what they dream for their families, and their own well-being, and their family's well-being.- And obviously, this is the first in this push, but what about other companies, do we get some sort of reaction from Big Pharma as to how they're feeling about this, and perhaps what this opens up for them as well?KELLY BLANCHARD: We really hope that this will be the beginning of additional products, additional hormonal methods of contraception becoming available over the counter. We know that there's at least one other birth control pill in the process.We've seen the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists proactively ask and support the idea that all hormonal methods could be available over the counter so we're excited to see-- this approval today is really historic, the first-ever approval of over-the-counter access to a daily highly safe and effective birth control pill. But we hope this will be just the first step as we see this transformative approach to access take place for other methods as well.Story continues- And how soon do we know about its availability and any sort of pricing?KELLY BLANCHARD: So according to Perrigo, the company that submitted this application, they hope to have Opill on the shelves early in 2024. And we are waiting-- I know they have plans to announce the pricing in the coming months.- And in terms of any sort of side effects, or people who shouldn't be taking this, what should people be aware of here?KELLY BLANCHARD: This pill, Opill, is a progestin-only pill, and it is appropriate for virtually everyone to use. People who have, or have a history of breast cancer, should not use this pill, but otherwise, it is safe and effective, and absolutely appropriate for people of all ages to be able to use.And I also want to add that, one of the exciting things that our coalition, the Free the Pill Coalition, has been working towards is making sure that this switch is a different kind of switch, and that it really centers the voices and leadership of people who really struggle to access contraception and healthcare in this country.And that means, due to systemic inequalities, Black folks, Indigenous peoples, Asian-American, and Pacific Islanders, Latinx folks, young people, people working to make financial ends meet, and so we really hope that this is going to transform access for those folks who really face more barriers to access to contraception and that this will help them have, again, a new way to access safe and highly effective methods.- Because, I think, sometimes people, when they see these decisions, come down, they don't realize the economic impact when you do have more control over your family planning. What could this mean then to have, especially some of these disadvantaged groups who haven't had access to this, or perhaps just through expensive insurance, or perhaps they couldn't afford, what does this mean in terms of economic movement forward for some of these groups?KELLY BLANCHARD: Well, I think first most directly, we know that even having to get a prescription can be a financial hardship. You have to have a doctor, you might need time off work, you need child care, you need to travel to get to your provider to pick up the medications so over-the-counter access for some folks, can help them overcome that very specific financial and time barrier to accessing contraception.And then we know, from decades of research, that people who have access to the tools to make decisions about when and how to build their families, that they are able to implement their decisions about increasing their own health, and their family's health and well being, and so access to contraception, and access to reproductive healthcare, more broadly, is so critical for all of our health and well-being.And this will be, we hope, just another way to transform access, that as you say, really is accessible and makes a difference for folks who are struggling to access contraception right now.- And do we in terms of any pushback that might affect the rollout of this pill, given that some religious groups, there was some pushback, obviously in the light of post reverses wait, a lot of people wondering, what does this mean now for the future of contraception in this country as well thinking that would also be next here. What message do you think this sends?KELLY BLANCHARD: Well, we know from our research, and Ibis from other research from KFF, and others, that there is really high levels of support among a whole range of folks for over-the-counter access to contraceptive methods.And we know that virtually everyone in this country, regardless of their religious affiliation, has experience with and supports access to contraception, and so I think there's just really strong support across the board here. And this has been a long process.Our coalition has been working for nearly two decades to make the case for this change. And it's just one piece of the broader effort needed to ensure that everybody has access to the full range of reproductive healthcare that they need. This certainly doesn't replace people's need for access to high-quality abortion care, but we hope that it's one piece that enables people at least to better access the contraception that they need and want.- And we'll certainly continue to track that story. A big thank you there to Kelly Blanchard, President of Ibis Reproductive Health. Thank you so much.KELLY BLANCHARD: Thank you for having me.]"

The company’s revenues and earnings are expected to have declined from the year-ago reported levels.In the last reported quarter, NTRS’ earnings met the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were adversely impacted by a rising expense base, worsening credit quality, lower fee income and weak capital ratios. Yet, a rise in net interest income (NII), driven by higher rates, acted as a tailwind.Northern Trust has a disappointing earnings surprise history. Its earnings missed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and met once, the negative surprise being 1.89%, on average.Northern Trust Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Northern Trust Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseNorthern Trust Corporation price-eps-surprise | Northern Trust Corporation Quote NTRS’ activities in the to-be-reported quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ optimism. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings of $1.64 per share has moved 1.2% downward in the past week. The figure indicates a decline of 11.83% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.76 billion, suggesting a decrease of 0.68% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.Key Factors &amp; Estimates for Q2Loans &amp; NII: The lending environment weakened during the quarter under review. Per Fed’s latest data, commercial real estate loans witnessed softer demand during the first two months of the quarter to be reported. Further, the challenging macroeconomic backdrop and high interest rates hurt consumer spending, affecting growth of personal loans during the quarter under review.Hence, a weaker lending environment is likely to have affected average interest-earning assets.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $132.01 billion for average earning assets indicates a 2.9% decline sequentially.While Fed kept rates unchanged during the June FOMC meeting, it increased rates by 25 basis points in May. The policy rate now stands at 5-5.25%.Story continuesDespite the high interest rate environment, softer loan demand and rising funding costs are anticipated to have negatively impacted NII during the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII is pegged at $504 million, implying a sequential decline of 5.1%.Fee Income: Northern Trust uses a lag effect to calculate its asset servicing fees and wealth management servicing fees, i.e., computations are based on the prior-quarter end valuations.The asset servicing fees comprise of custody and fund administration, investment management, securities lending as well as other fees.The favorable equity market’s performance in the first quarter is likely to have led to an improvement in custody and fund administration, and investment management fees for NTRS in the second quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for custody and fund administration, and investment management fees is pegged at $419 million and $127 million, suggesting sequential increases from $414 million and $126 million, respectively.The consensus estimate for asset servicing fees is pegged at $616 million, indicating 2.2% rise sequentially.The consensus mark for wealth management servicing fees is pegged at $488 million, projecting sequential growth of 5.9%.The consensus estimate for consolidated trust, investment and other servicing fees is pegged at $1.1 billion, remaining flat from first-quarter 2023.During the second quarter, lower volatility in foreign exchange (FX) markets and decreased client activity are likely to have adversely impacted NTRS’s FX trading income. Nonetheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at $57 million, indicating a 7.5% sequential rise.Treasury management fees are likely to have improved sequentially in the quarter to be reported. The consensus estimate for the same is pegged at $8.49 million, implying a rise of 1.1%.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for security commissions and trading income is pegged at $33.64 million, indicating a decline of 3.1% sequentially.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for other operating income is pegged at $46.55 million, suggesting a sequential decline from $46.80 million.The consensus estimate for total fee income is pegged at $1.25 billion, indicating a 2.7% rise from the prior quarter’s reported figure.Expenses: Northern Trust’s expenses are expected to have remained high in the second quarter on rising compensation, and equipment and software expenses. Moreover, general inflationary pressures are likely to have inflated costs whereas wage inflation is anticipated to have escalated personnel expenses.What Does the Zacks Model Say?Our proven Zacks model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Northern Trust this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increase the odds of an earnings beat.

109,537c9189-d297-3c75-8e3a-b9d8d3214b30,NTRS,2023-07-14,Analysts Estimate Truist Financial Corporation (TFC) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-truist-financial-corporation-140045424.html,1689256845,STORY,"['TFC', 'NTRS']","[Truist Financial Corporation (TFC) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 20, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.99 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -17.5%.Revenues are expected to be $5.94 billion, up 5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 10.32% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Truist Financial Corporation?For Truist Financial Corporation, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Truist Financial Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Truist Financial Corporation would post earnings of $1.13 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.09, delivering a surprise of -3.54%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Truist Financial Corporation doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.64 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -11.8%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $1.76 billion, down 0.7% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Northern Trust Corporation has been revised 1.3% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -0.40%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Northern Trust Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company could not beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

MMSI is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its strong product portfolio. The optimism led by solid first-quarter 2023 performance and international exposure are expected to contribute further. However, headwinds due to forex woes and stiff competition persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 62.7% compared with a 22.2% rise of the industry and a 17.8% growth of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned medical devices provider has a market capitalization of $4.88 billion. The company projects 11% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. It has delivered an earnings surprise of 20.2% for the past four quarters, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Strong Product Portfolio: Merit Medical has continued to gain significant momentum on the back of new products. The company is upbeat about the product pipeline, including radio and electrophysiology products, raising investors’ optimism. It has several electrophysiology products that are either on track for release or in several other stages of development.In March, Merit Medical announced the expansion of its SwiftNINJA Steerable Microcatheter product line, which belongs to its delivery systems portfolio.International Exposure: We are optimistic about Merit Medical’s worldwide product distribution network, which includes territories in Europe, the Middle East, Africa (EMEA) and Asia, among others. During the first quarter of 2023, Merit Medical’s management confirmed that the most upside versus expectations was registered in the EMEA region, where the year-over-year growth was primarily driven by demand in France, Germany, the Middle East and Spain.Excluding China, sales in APAC also increased, fueled by growth in Japan and strong contributions and growth from sales to customers in both Australia and Korea. In the Rest of World region, Merit Medical’s robust year-over-year growth was driven by solid growth in Latin America, Brazil and Mexico.Story continuesStrong Q1 Results: Merit Medical’s robust first-quarter 2023 results buoy optimism. The company witnessed a year-over-year uptick in the top and bottom lines. Solid revenue growth in both its segments and across all the product categories within its Cardiovascular unit was also recorded. Robust performances in the United States and outside were also seen.DownsidesForex Woes: Merit Medical has been expanding its operations outside the United States. This has led to the company becoming increasingly subject to market risk relating to foreign currency, which could have a negative impact on its margins and financial results. If the rate of exchange between foreign currencies declines against the U.S. dollar, Merit Medical may not be able to increase the prices charged from its customers for products whose prices are denominated in those respective foreign currencies.Stiff Competition: Merit Medical operates in highly competitive markets, where it faces competition from many companies with greater resources. The company competes globally in several market areas, including radiology and interventional cardiology. Such resources and market presence may enable the competitors to market competing products more efficiently or at reduced prices to gain market share.Estimate TrendMerit Medical is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 1.4% north to $2.89.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $310.2 million, suggesting a 5.2% rise from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

The streaming companies, also referred to as OTT platforms, objected and no decision was reached, according to government minutes of the talks and an industry source who attended.The ministry ""highlighted concerns regarding obscene and vulgar content on OTT platforms, as expressed by Members of Parliament, citizen groups, and the general public,"" said the minutes, which are not public but were seen by Reuters.Netflix and Amazon have become hugely popular in India, which is set to grow into a $7 billion market for the sector by 2027, according to Media Partners Asia.Top Bollywood stars feature in online material, some of which has faced criticism from lawmakers and the public for scenes deemed vulgar or offensive to religious sentiments.Though all films in Indian cinemas are reviewed and certified by a government-appointed board, streamed content is not.Officials in the meeting asked the industry to consider an independent panel to review content so that unsuitable material could be weeded out, two people who attended said.The industry objected but the officials asked them to consider the idea, they added.The government highlighted the need for a ""more proactive approach"" to ensure that streaming content, ""including international content"", aligns with a so-called code of ethics, the minutes showed.That code already mandates providers to exercise caution on content that could incite violence or be sensitive for religious reasons.The meeting was attended by Amazon, Disney, Netflix, Reliance's broadcast unit, Viacom18, and Apple TV.Story continuesThe companies and the ministry did not respond to requests for comments.'PROPAGATE VULGARITY'The discussions signal growing scrutiny of India's fast-growing streaming market.The proposal also comes as streaming giants protest a government order to add 50-second tobacco health warnings in each piece of content, and two years after India ordered the setting up self-regulatory bodies for complaints about streaming content.Industry executives say India's streaming regulations are among the world's most stringent.At an April event, when the government agreed to a partnership with Amazon to promote film and television, Information and Broadcasting Minister Anurag Thakur said streaming platforms should ""not propagate vulgarity and abuse camouflaged as creative expression"".Thakur has said complaints about obscene content were increasing and the government was willing to change regulations if need be to address the problem.Indian officials also proposed at the meeting the formation of an expert panel to set age ratings, instead of platforms doing that themselves, one of the attendees said.The platforms said they would ensure strong parental controls and ""special care would be taken in respect of suitability of the international content"", the minutes showed.Suhasini Maniratnam of the Digital Publisher Content Grievance Council, told the gathering pre-censorship could hurt the industry growth and cost jobs, and that given the high volume of content ""there is a need to specifically act"" against obscene and vulgar content.(Reporting by Aditya Kalra in New Delhi and Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; editing by Robert Birsel)]"

They'll be joining Hollywood writers, who went on strike in May. Oppenheimer Head of Internet Research Jason Helfstein tells Yahoo Finance Live why, despite the disruption, the strikes are ""probably a near-term tailwind"" for Netflix and other streamers.Video Transcript- So let's start with that breaking news. Hollywood is shutting down. The SAG-AFTRA Union will go on strike at midnight. This on top of the writers strike. Now it's the first time that both unions have been on strike at the same time in 63 years.Joining us now is Jason Helfstein, managing director and head of internet research at Oppenheimer. Jason, it's good to see you here. So obviously, the strike, a huge blow to Hollywood. But when it comes to your coverage list which includes Netflix and Amazon, the streaming impact of all this, how do you see that playing out?JASON HELFSTEIN: It's actually, probably, a near-term tailwind, actually, to Netflix and the streamers because they produce content, generally, further ahead. So not kind of shoot-- not several weeks before airing but many, many months before airing. Plus Netflix also produces a lot of content around the world, which wouldn't be impacted by this.So if you think about during COVID when production was shut down, Netflix was actually able to have a more consistent pipeline of newer shows on top of just the very deep library. So while we don't wish anyone to be out of work and we hope this gets resolved for everyone's interest, it probably will be a near-term benefit to the streamers if this strike-- both the writers and the actors don't get resolved reasonably quickly.- And Jason, for Netflix specifically, that platform has been very focused on international content. Committing a ton of money overseas, especially in South Korea. Is that going to be a tailwind for Netflix? And when you compare that to some of the other streaming companies and their content pipeline.Story continuesJASON HELFSTEIN: I mean, again, I feel like the idea-- and I think everyone we're talking with watches Netflix. I mean, we've all kind of-- I mean, before Netflix I didn't watch many shows that had subtitles. I think we've all-- Netflix has gotten us used to watching shows with either subtitles or dubbed. And so yeah, they've really trained consumers. Hey, you can watch-- there is good content that's not necessarily made in the US or Canada that that's appealing, and it's among some of their top shows. So yes.That in addition to the fact that they produce content much further in advance and kind of have it in the can ready to go, as they say, you also have that international content. So yeah, I think that that will be a near-term tailwind for Netflix.- So, Jason, outside of that international content, I know you're saying that's a tailwind here, at least for now. But is there a point as to which that conversation would change if this strike is not resolved for a certain amount of time? Should Netflix or will Netflix get a little bit worried just about the amount of backlog that they still have to rely on?JASON HELFSTEIN: Sure. I mean, again, eventually you start cutting into muscle. As far as our discussions with Netflix and our understanding is nobody thinks it'll go that far. I mean, if this went six months-- again, hopefully it doesn't, but if it did, I think Netflix would-- you'd see very minimal interruption. If this went for a year, yes, you probably would see interruption.But, I mean, if it went for a year, I think the pain that this will cause on the traditional media business is going to be far worse. So I just wouldn't expect it to go that far.- And Jason, besides the strike, another big headline we got is Disney CEO, Bob Iger, staying on for another two years. He gave an interview with CNBC this morning and he really doubled down on ESPN. Saying it's definitely happening that they're going to take ESPN as a fully over-the-top direct-to-consumer service. How much more pressure does that put on a company like Netflix to get into the live sports game?JASON HELFSTEIN: I mean, we know sports rights are expensive and only getting more expensive. You've got all the internet giants trying to figure out what their strategy is going to be with sports and those companies have the biggest checkbooks right now on the planet when it comes to sports. So I don't think Netflix wants to compete with them.What we've seen them do is effectively do these sports related shows, Formula One, The Golf Series, and they've gotten really good viewership. So, you know, I think you'll see more of a continuation, effectively, of them being able to kind of leverage the popularity of sports. But doing it in an alternative way and not bidding on live sports.- Jason, the challenging set up, though, that we have right now across the streamers, really across the media landscape, potentially covers streamers focusing on that aspect of it. Bob Iger commented in a CNBC interview this morning that it's even more challenging than he had anticipated. How do you see that unfolding here in the near-term? And the companies that are best positioned to navigate this tumultuous time, is it a name like Netflix?JASON HELFSTEIN: Yeah, look, I mean, I think, Mr. Iger was being purposely vague. I mean, the reality is I think that you're seeing kind of cord cutting and kind of the decline in traditional TV viewership. That is part of a challenge that-- again, I don't cover Disney. But that's what the companies are trying to face. Which is we want to build a successful streaming business but we also have this cash-- historical cash cow out of our legacy business.Can we do both? And how do you do both well and profitably? And if you're going to choose to not put a show on linear because ultimately it's going to drive people to your streaming service, that's then going to hurt your linear service.So look, Netflix doesn't have to make those decisions. I think that's ultimately the challenge. And then if you have legacy cable channels that you're still getting paid good cash from the cable operators but you know that whether it's going to be five or seven years from now, that cash will probably go away, factoring that into your strategic planning.So I think that's more what he's referring to. Not necessarily what is a standalone company like-- is the environment actually worse for Netflix right now? I actually think it's particularly better. But for the media conglomerates, it's trying to get the two parts of the businesses to ultimately work cohesively. That's the challenge.- And Jason, you said Netflix doesn't have to make those decisions. However, it is getting into the advertising game. With more people cutting the cord, that's more of an opportunity to get those ad buyers. How does a company like Netflix and all of these streaming services focus their advertising tiers right now?JASON HELFSTEIN: So, I mean, look, it's super early on Netflix. Their challenge is actually there's more advertiser demand than they have ads to fill. You know, this quarter they finally launched page sharing, right, which is effectively telling you that you can only pay for two, basically, viewers outside of your household. And then after that, those other people have to get additional accounts. Maybe they go to the ad tier or maybe they go to the basic tier.They're testing, in Canada, phasing out the basic plan. Which would effectively put more people in the advertising tier. Because the argument would be at that basic plan, you were giving away about $10 of advertising a month when you were letting somebody sign up for kind of the lowest subscription tier.So we think Netflix is in a very good place right now. Again, they have what is considered-- it's all premium content, right. There's no user-generated content where you're not sure about appropriateness for an advertiser. So this is all very premium content.Advertisers know they need to do more connected TV advertising because a lot of the linear dollars are wasted because they're not targeted ads, right. You're showing ads to people who-- either it just may not be an appropriate product for who that person is where on streaming you can target those ads. And so it's super early days. We do, ultimately, think there's a potential of 30 million additional users that come on Netflix. And half of those, easily, could go into the ad tier.- So Jason, with all that taken into account, we're going to hear from Netflix when they report results next week. What do you think we'll see? Do you think we're on track for a big beat?JASON HELFSTEIN: We do. And I think the street's already expecting. If you look at the stock, it continues to do quite well. I mean, we're looking for 2 and 1/2, 2.6 million subs, versus guidance of 1.8 to 1.9. But I'm sure the buy side is probably where we are ahead of us.For next quarter, we're looking for something like 5.2 million new subs, street's at 5.4. And then it's really what do people do with their estimates for next year when people start to give them credit for advertising. Because we're valuing the stock on a 2025 earnings estimate, right. So really, this isn't about what's the advertising tomorrow, but what's the potential over the next two years? And what do they say that will more positively inform people's view about the next two years?- A lot to look out for in that report. Oppenheimer's Jason Helfstein, thank you so much.]"

But why is it that reaching a dream salary can still seem to leave so much to be desired?A big reason is because six figures just doesn't go as far as it used to, thanks to inflation and rising interest rates, among other factors outside an individual's control. But another, according to Ramit Sethi, the author I Will Teach You to Be Rich and star of the Netflix series ""How to Get Rich,"" is very much within our control. The way we feel about money is ""highly uncorrelated to the amount in the bank"" because we're focused on the wrong things.""It’s counterintuitive to people. A lot of people believe, 'if I just had $10,000 more, or when I finally have $150,000 in my bank account, then I will feel good about money,'"" Sethi, who studied psychology at Stanford, tells Fortune. ""Wrong! You won’t.""In fact, many often feel worse after they reach those arbitrary milestones, he says, because they're not happy with where the money is going. Instead of focusing on the number you're earning, Sethi suggests working to actively improve your money psychology. Ask yourself the hard questions: What do you actually like to spend money on? Why? How can you be more intentional with where your money is going?It's shocking how many people have never considered those questions, he says. Instead, they often focus on checking off boxes prescribed by those around them.Sethi has worked in the personal finance space for more than decade. In ""How to Get Rich,"" which debuted on Netflix earlier this year, he helps people around the country learn about their finances and themselves in order to live their best rich life. To Sethi, a ""rich life"" isn't necessarily the one that earns the most money or is the most luxurious. It's about prioritizing what matters most to each individual.How To Get Rich. (L to R) Ramit Sethi, Millie and Christian in episode 6 of How To Get Rich. Cr. Courtesy of Netflix © 2023Most personal finance advice in the U.S. is restrictive, based on guilt, Sethi says. It's all about what you shouldn't do. Call it the Starbucks latte approach: You could save up for a down payment if only you made your coffee at home, or, better yet, forewent all little luxuries. Sethi takes the opposite tact, which he calls the money dial approach: You turn the dial way up on the things you love, and try to dial back significantly on those you don't.Story continues""Americans love to feel bad, to feel guilty, to feel anxious,"" he says. ""Money should be fun, we should have a healthy relationship with money.""That takes a big perspective shift from how we normally view our finances. When he asks most people what their ideal rich life looks like, ""90% say 'I want to do what I want when I want.'"" But pressed to describe what that actually looks like, they falter, he says. Or they say they want to travel, but not necessarily on a private jet. They want to eat out more, but it doesn't have to be at expensive restaurants.""We tend to minimize what we want,"" Sethi says. ""But I'm not asking what you don't need. I'm asking what you want. What do you love spending money on?""One of Sethi's most controversial opinions is that buying a home isn't right for everyone; home ownership isn't a component of every single person's rich life. On its face, it's unequivocally a true statement. Though owning a home can help many build wealth, it can also be disastrous for some others' financial well-being.But because the dream is so engrained in American culture, Sethi is often labeled a ""secret landlord"" for telling people to run the numbers before they buy (implying he profits off of people remaining renters). But it's just one way he encourages people to be more thoughtful and intentional about what they want out of life. If you're making six figures but you're barely able to pay your mortgage each month, of course you aren't going to be happy.""Americans are really good at making decisions they think will make them happy but make them deeply unhappy,"" like moving to the suburbs to ""take on insurmountable amounts of debt to own a home,"" he says. ""You know we don't have to do that? You can choose what your rich life looks like.""This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.That's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.Our proprietary system currently recommends TJX (TJX) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this parent of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and other stores is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for TJX is 7.9%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 14.7% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 11%.Cash Flow GrowthCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for TJX is 8.2%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 3.3%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 7.3% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 5.4%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for TJX have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.1% over the past month.Bottom LineWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made TJX a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination positions TJX well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

122,51cc102b-08c7-3fff-9a5d-f5675cc8f697,TJX,2023-07-14,5 Low-Leverage Stocks to Buy as Inflation Cools Down Slightly,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-low-leverage-stocks-buy-124200604.html,1689252120,STORY,"['TJX', 'SHO', 'ATO']","[U.S. stocks ended slightly higher on Jul 12, buoyed by investors’ optimism after consumer prices registered their smallest annual increase in more than two years, indicating some relief from the raging inflation hike observed in the recent past.This should encourage investors to spend in the stock market. However, considering the volatile state that the Wall Street has been through lately, one should progress with caution. Hence, we recommend stocks like Humana HUM, The TJX Companies TJX, Sunstone Hotel Investors SHO, Atmos Energy ATO and MINISO Group Holding Limited MNSO, which bear low leverage. These picks can shield investors from incurring losses in times of crisis.Now, before selecting low-leverage stocks, let’s explore what leverage is and how choosing a low-leverage stock helps investors.In finance, leverage is a term used to denote the practice of borrowing capital by companies to run their operations smoothly and expand the same. Such borrowings are done through debt financing. But there remains an option for equity finance. This is probably due to the cheap and easy availability of debt over equity financing.However, debt financing has its share of drawbacks. Particularly, it is desirable only as long as it successfully generates a higher rate of return compared to the interest rate. So, to avoid considerable losses in your portfolio, one should always avoid companies that resort to exorbitant debt financing.The crux of safe investment lies in choosing a company that is not burdened with debt, as a debt-free stock is almost impossible to find.The equity market can be volatile at times and as an investor, if you don’t want to lose big time, we suggest you invest in stocks, which bear low leverage and are hence less risky.To identify such stocks, historically, several leverage ratios have been developed to measure the amount of debt a company bears and the debt-to-equity ratio is one of the most common ratios.Story continuesAnalyzing Debt/EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders’ EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A lower debt-to-equity ratio reflects improved solvency for a company.With the second-quarter earnings cycle knocking on our doors, investors must be eyeing stocks that have exhibited solid earnings growth in the recent past. But if a stock bears a high debt-to-equity ratio in times of economic downturn, its so-called booming earnings picture might turn into a nightmare.The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors, it is prudent to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure steady returns.Yet, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.Here are the other parameters:Debt/Equity less than X-Industry Median: Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.Current Price greater than or equal to 10: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median: Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stock’s price appreciation.VGM Score of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than 5: This shows earnings growth expectation.Zacks Rank #1 or 2: Irrespective of market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here we present our five picks out of the 15 stocks that made it through the screen.Humana: It is one of the largest health care plan providers in the United States, which offers health insurance benefits under Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), Private Fee-For-Service (PFFS) and Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) plans.

This factor can impact your investment portfolio as well as help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.FOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in TJX (TJX) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to TJX for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?TJX's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at TJX's main business drivers.Based in Framingham, MA, The TJX Companies, Inc. is a leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide. The company’s broad range of assortments at varying prices helps it to reach out to a broad range of consumers. In addition to these, The TJX Companies tries to attract consumers through rapid turn of inventories. As of Apr 30, 2023, the company operated a total of 4,865 stores in nine countries, the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, Poland, Austria, the Netherlands, and Australia, and five e-commerce sites.The company has been able to distinguish itself from traditional retailers on the grounds of opportunistic buying strategies and flexible business model. In fact, The TJX Companies’ low-cost structure sets it apart from other traditional retailers. In order to maintain control on costs, the company engages in the promotion of retail banners, rather than specific brands. The company’s distribution network is also designed in a manner such that helps curtailing costs. Moreover, the company emphasizes on creating strong relations with vendors across different countries, in order leverage buying power.  The TJX Companies operates through four business segments:In the U.S., it operates through two segments, namely, Marmaxx (through stores under the names of T.J. Maxx and Marshalls) and HomeGoods.Story continuesMarmaxx divisions (62.5% of Q1 fiscal 24 Sales) sell family apparel (including footwear and accessories), home fashions (including home basics, accent furniture, lamps, rugs, wall décor, decorative accessories and giftware) and other merchandise.HomeGoods (16.7% of Q1 fiscal 24 Sales) chain offers home basics, giftware, accent furniture, lamps, rugs, wall décor and decorative accessories from around the world, seasonal and other merchandise.In Canada, it operates through TJX Canada (8.8% of Q1 fiscal 24 Sales) through stores under the names of Winners, Marshalls and HomeSense and in Europe, it operates through TJX International (12% of Q1 fiscal 24 Sales) through stores under the names of T.K. Maxx and HomeSense.Bottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of a few things: research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in TJX a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in July 2013 would be worth $3,259.42, or a gain of 225.94%, as of July 13, 2023, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 166.17% and the price of gold went up 46.52% over the same time frame.Analysts are anticipating more upside for TJX.The TJX Companies has outpaced the industry in the past six months. The company’s off-price business model, strategic store locations, impressive brands and fashion products and supply-chain management have been working well. The TJX Companies is benefiting from its solid store and e-commerce growth efforts. The company’s Marmaxx segment is doing particularly well, wherein comp store sales increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, backed by improved customer traffic. However, the HomeGoods (U.S.) division has been seeing soft sales. Also, TJX has been grappling with increased wage and supply-chain costs. Management expects these costs to be deterrents in fiscal 2024. Nonetheless, the company expects the pretax profit margin to increase in fiscal 2024 and also anticipates overall comp store sales growth.The stock is up 6.70% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 10 higher, for fiscal 2023. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

The stock outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.85%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.14%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 5.61%.Coming into today, shares of the world's largest biotech drugmaker had gained 1.53% in the past month. In that same time, the Medical sector lost 1.55%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 3.18%.Amgen will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be August 3, 2023. On that day, Amgen is projected to report earnings of $4.46 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 4.09%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $6.67 billion, up 1.18% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $18 per share and revenue of $27.46 billion, which would represent changes of +1.75% and +4.33%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Amgen. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

Amgen is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.In terms of valuation, Amgen is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 12.53. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 19.21, which means Amgen is trading at a discount to the group.Story continuesMeanwhile, AMGN's PEG ratio is currently 1.79. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Medical - Biomedical and Genetics was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.89 at yesterday's closing price.The Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry is part of the Medical sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 101, putting it in the top 41% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

CEO, Richard NanulaBy Daniella ParraPsychotropic industry innovator Lucy Scientific Discovery Inc. (Nasdaq: LSDI), has appointed Richard Nanula, former CFO at Amgen Inc.

(Nasdaq: MAR) and Colony Capital, Nanula brings decades of leadership experience. His roles have overseen more than $50 billion worth of M&amp;A and financing transactions.Lucy Scientific’s mission revolves around pioneering innovative therapies, enhancing mental health outcomes and promoting well-being on a global scale.“I’ve known some of the founders for a decade, and as I learned more about the opportunity in wellness and Psychotropics, I recalled my time at Amgen where our entire mission was to develop patients, and thought there would be no better way to affect so many people,” Mr. Nanula told Exec Edge in an exclusive interview.Nanula will retain his Chairman role while succeeding Christopher McElvany, the founder and former CEO of Lucy Scientific Discovery, who will continue to support the company as a consultant.“Psychedelics appear to be the next frontier for the pharmaceutical industry and are generally thought to be safe and highly effective in a myriad of ways.

128,8e7f1efc-7771-3e06-b6cc-21eb9e93c6be,NEM,2023-07-14,Newmont Corporation (NEM) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/newmont-corporation-nem-earnings-expected-140056044.html,1689256856,STORY,['NEM'],"[Newmont Corporation (NEM) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 20. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis gold and copper miner is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.47 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +2.2%.Revenues are expected to be $2.87 billion, down 6.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Newmont?For Newmont, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -12.30%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Newmont will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Newmont would post earnings of $0.33 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.40, delivering a surprise of +21.21%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Newmont doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

129,e7a8e113-173d-396c-a1ef-283ef0c38342,M,2023-07-14,Billionaire David Tepper’s Investment Strategy and 10 Favorite Stocks,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-david-tepper-investment-strategy-180653426.html,1689271613,STORY,"['FDX', 'UBER', 'AMZN', 'ET', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL', 'M', 'EQT']","[In this piece, we will take a look at billionaire David Tepper's investment strategy and ten favorite stocks. If you want to skip our introduction of the billionaire investor and a background of what's happening in the stock market, take a look at Billionaire David Tepper's Investment Strategy and 5 Favorite Stocks. After the corporate world, the stock market is one of the most lucrative sectors to become a billionaire. Investors and hedge funds who time their bets right and formulate the right strategies often end up becoming some of the richest people in the world.One such individual is the billionaire David Tepper of Appaloosa Management. According to Forbes Magazine, he is worth a cool $18.5 billion as of July 2023. Mr.Tepper, like all of his peers, has decades of experience in the finance industry. He started his career in 1984 and would go on to work at the investment bank Goldman Sachs for a couple of years before taking a dive into the hedge fund world and setting up his own fund.The billionaire set up Appaloosa Management in 1993 along with a business partner and spent most of his early days as a hedge fund manager by investing in junk bonds. Since then, Appaloosa has diversified its approach, and it had a portfolio worth $1.8 billion as of the first quarter of this year. The fund's total assets under management, on the other hand, stood at $14 billion by 2022 end. While the hedge fund still invests in distressed securities and bonds, it now also has money in options, futures, and warrants alongside other financial instruments. Appaloosa is also a star of the financial industry, with our research covering 15 Best Hedge Funds to Work For placing the fund at number 9 due to the $1.6 billion in gains that it made in 2022 at a time when the industry as a whole was dealing with stock market shocks. It also ranks at number 10 in our list of 15 Most Profitable Hedge Funds in the World due to having made a whopping $32.3 billion in net gains since inception.Story continuesSo what is it investing in these days? Well, some of the hedge fund's largest investments are in mega cap technology stocks. These include Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). If you've been following us regularly, you'd know that mega cap stocks are the star of the show in 2023 so far, and their outlandish share price gains in the first half of the year have propelled major stock indexes such as the NASDAQ 100 to new highs that have been unmatched for decades.Safe to say, it's more likely than not that Mr. Tepper has had a great year on the stock market so far. And 2023 saw quite a bit of shakeup in his portfolio as well. Discounting puts, calls, bonds, notes, and ETFs, the billionaire investor's Q1 2023 investment portfolio had held shares of 25 companies. Out of these, four were new additions to the portfolio over the fourth quarter of 2022. The biggest inclusion was a $59 million investment in FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), and the remaining three were all in notable technology companies, namely NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA),  Match Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:MTCH), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). Additionally, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) also received a lot of attention, as Appaloosa Investment increased its investment in the company by a strong 390%.Shifting our focus on the broader market and the latest bit of news on this front, these days investors seem to be taking bated sighs of relief as the Labor Department's latest jobs report for June was the first in more than a year that had actually undershot expectations. On Monday, as the second week of July kicked off, officials of the Federal Reserve mostly repeated previous sentiments that they will have to raise interest rates more to ensure that inflation comes below 2%. The markets as a whole were muted as they waited for the inflation data to hit the wire later in the week, a sentiment that Societe Generale's economist Kokou Agbo-Bloua aptly summarized in an interview with CNBC as:I think we can potentially quote Winston Churchill when he said around the war against Germany in 1942 at the El Alamein battle that this is 'Now not the end. It's not even the beginning of the end, it is perhaps the end of the beginning,' when it comes to the war against inflation.On the topic of a recession, Agbo-Bloua believes that it will take place in the first quarter of next year as a tighter monetary policy finally makes its mark felt in the economy.Coming back to mega caps, since they are quite favored by our investor today, the big question on everyone's mind right now is whether they will sustain their H1 2023 rally into H2 2023. Well, Joe Terranova of Virtus Investment Partners believes that long term positions are being closed out, causing a recent drop in their price price. Adding to this, Steve Weiss of Short Hills Capital believes:You know, look, I think the biggest vulnerability is in the large cap tech Because that's where on one hand, price vulnerability because that's where the action has been and that's where the major incidences of multiple expansion have occurred. Less so, there's less, and it sounds kinda strange, but, it's, sounds kinda strange because they have the best balance sheets, they have the best growth outlook. If you take a look at for example for what earnings forecasts are. Earnings forecasts for this quarter are looking to be down 7%! But, there are two sectors where it's looking to be up, and that is in technology. So, the strange thing is though, they are vulnerable because of price but not vulnerable through the fundamentals. So those are the concerns. So yeah, if the market rolls over, that's going to be painful for a lot of people.Short Hills Capital has a close relationship with Mr. Tepper, since it was set up to manage his personal capital.So what are David Tepper's top stock picks and how well they're doing?

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Right now, both Avista and NextEra Energy are sporting a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that these stocks have improving earnings outlooks. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.AVA currently has a forward P/E ratio of 16.71, while NEE has a forward P/E of 23.64. We also note that AVA has a PEG ratio of 2.63. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. NEE currently has a PEG ratio of 2.82.Another notable valuation metric for AVA is its P/B ratio of 1.16. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, NEE has a P/B of 2.85.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to AVA's Value grade of B and NEE's Value grade of D.Story continuesBoth AVA and NEE are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that AVA is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

132,de325b36-734f-3eab-acaa-2d1575c6d2d6,NEE,2023-07-14,Can NextEra (NEE) Climb 25.33% to Reach the Level Wall Street Analysts Expect?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nextera-nee-climb-25-33-135505073.html,1689256505,STORY,"['NEE', 'TGT']","[Shares of NextEra Energy (NEE) have gained 0.1% over the past four weeks to close the last trading session at $73.47, but there could still be a solid upside left in the stock if short-term price targets of Wall Street analysts are any indication. Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $92.08 indicates a potential upside of 25.3%.The average comprises 12 short-term price targets ranging from a low of $84 to a high of $108, with a standard deviation of $7.10. While the lowest estimate indicates an increase of 14.3% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 47% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.But, for NEE, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view. While a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't gauge how much a stock could gain, it has proven to be powerful in predicting an upside.Here's What You Should Know About Analysts' Price TargetsAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?Story continuesThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Why NEE Could Witness a Solid UpsideAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. That's because empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current year, one estimate has moved higher over the last 30 days compared to no negative revision. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased 0.1%.Moreover, NEE currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much NEE could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Quality Dividend Stocks to Buy. During periods of uncertainty, such as recessions or inflationary environments, dividend stocks often become a preferred choice for investors. This is because dividend stocks can provide a certain level of stability and income even in turbulent times. When it comes to dividend stocks, investing in high-quality companies offers several advantages. Quality dividend stocks are those that have a track record of consistent and reliable dividend payments. These companies are well-established and have histories of generating steady cash flows, strong earnings growth, and solid balance sheets.Dividend growth rate plays a significant role in dividend investing by showcasing a company's capacity to raise its dividend payments over time. When companies can consistently increase their dividends at a healthy rate, it signals their strength and stability as investments. This growth reflects a strong and expanding cash flow, demonstrating their commitment to delivering value to shareholders. Moreover, dividend growers also showed robust performance in the past, compared to their counterparts. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we mentioned data from Ned Davis Research and Hartford Funds, which revealed that dividend growers achieved a return of 9.62% from 1972 to December 31, 2018. In contrast, dividend cutters experienced a negative return of 0.79%. During the same period, the S&amp;P 500 had an average annual return of 7.30%, indicating that dividend growers outperformed the broader market.Also read: 12 Best Long-Term Dividend Stocks To Buy NowInvestors showed great interest in stocks with substantial dividends last year, considering them popular trades in the stock market. However, this preference for dividend-heavy stocks has lost momentum since then due to growing investments in artificial intelligence (AI). According to data by Ned Davis Research, non-dividend-paying stocks in the S&amp;P 500 have experienced a collective gain of approximately 18% in 2023, as of July 1. In contrast, income-generating companies have only seen a modest 4% advance. This marks the weakest first-half performance for dividend-paying stocks compared to non-dividend-paying stocks since 2009.Story continuesHowever, it is important to note that the situation could change in the future, especially since dividend-paying stocks have historically demonstrated a tendency to outperform during periods of economic slowdown. According to a report by Wall Street Journal, there are concerns that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes could potentially lead the economy into a recession. If such a scenario unfolds, defensive companies with substantial dividends could once again outperform. This is because, during an economic downturn, consumers tend to prioritize essential expenses.Analysts also continue to support the stance on dividend stocks, as they see potential and favorable prospects for these stocks throughout the year. Paul Baiocchi, chief ETF strategist at SS&amp;C ALPS Advisors, spoke with WSJ and said that a significant part of the market’s total return has been generated by compounded dividends over time, rather than the price appreciation of the stock market itself. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) are some of the best dividend stocks with decades-long dividend growth track records. In this article, we will further discuss quality dividend stocks to consider.11 Best Quality Dividend Stocks to BuyImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur Methodology:For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 943 hedge funds as of Q1 2023 and selected blue-chip dividend companies with robust balance sheets.

With over 5.4 million shares, First Eagle Investment Management was the company's leading stakeholder in Q1.Appleseed Fund mentioned Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“During the most recent quarter, Appleseed Fund added three new equity holdings: Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK), and Synovus Financial (SNV). Medtronic is the world’s largest device manufacturer, and it holds the number one or number two market share in most of its product segments. Medtronic’s business is heavily weighted towards complicated in-patient procedures, which are typically quite profitable. Industry dynamics are quite attractive with an aging global population and the growth of improved healthcare in emerging markets; furthermore, most of its segments are highly concentrated with just 2-3 players that split each segment’s market share, affording the key participants with significant economies of scale and pricing power. The Company has been recently addressing several temporary headwinds including a strong dollar, inflation, a delayed recovery in surgical volumes from the coronavirus pandemic, and supply chain issues.

Today's figure highlights the complete reversal in global supply chain frictions compared to a year ago, when GEP's index stood at 3.53.In June, a key finding was the worsening of global demand for raw materials, commodities and components, specifically in Europe and North America, signalling a deteriorated outlook for manufacturing as borrowing costs rise, with risks of spillover effects to the wider economy intensifying. This in turn led excess capacity at suppliers operating in these regions to rise rapidly and by a larger degree than seen in May.In contrast, input demand in Asia is showing greater resilience. Purchasing activity across the region is broadly tracking in line with its historical average, with pockets of strength in some Eastern markets led by India, one of the fastest-growing major economies so far in 2023.Commenting on the June data, Joel Johnson, vice president, supply chain consulting, GEP, said: ""Weakening demand for components and raw materials in the Western economies, low levels of inventory and excess global supplier capacity suggest that storm clouds are gathering. The softening of demand in the manufacturing sector in the last few months is a leading indicator that the broader economy in the Western hemisphere will slow in the second half of 2023. It's a perfect time for companies' procurement to re-negotiate terms for 2024 and 2025 with suppliers.Story continuesJune 2023 Key Findings: DEMAND: Global demand for raw materials, commodities and components weakened to the greatest degree since January, driven by sharper deteriorations in Europe and North America.INVENTORIES: Reports from businesses of safety stockpiling were only just above their long-run average in June, indicating little desire among companies to hold excess inventory.MATERIALS SHORTAGES: Reports of item shortages fell once again in June and are now at their lowest level since January 2020.LABOR SHORTAGES: Reports of backlogs directly due to a lack of employees are historically low.TRANSPORTATION: Global transportation costs fell further below their historical average, significantly easing inflationary pressures on companies.REGIONAL SUPPLY CHAIN VOLATILITY Supplier capacity in Asia also remains underutilized, but to a much lesser extent than in Western economies.NORTH AMERICA: Declined to -0.85 in June from -0.70 in May as input demand weakened notably.EUROPE: Declined to -0.67 in June from -0.58 in May, as input demand declined in lockstep with North America.U.K.: Remained subdued at -0.60 in June but relatively unchanged from -0.66 in May.ASIA: Bucked the global downward trend at -0.17 in June versus -0.18 in May as region shows more resilience.For more information, visit www.gep.com/volatilityNote: Full historic data dating back to January 2005 is available for subscription.

135,98c11c99-4558-38a4-9279-5a98e9c12185,SPGI,2023-07-14,S&P Global Mobility: The semiconductor shortage is - mostly - over for the auto industry,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/p-global-mobility-semiconductor-shortage-132900898.html,1689254940,STORY,['SPGI'],"[The industry has regained its manufacturing pace, but potential disruptions in chip supply remain, and production momentum disruption has pushed a 100-million-unit year into the next decade.SOUTHFIELD, Mich., July 13, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the availability of semiconductor chips took a drastic toll on all facets of the automotive industry, and in turn the global economy. But in mid-2023, the worst of the fallout seems to have settled, and the auto industry has found a new normal. In short, the dearth of supply of semiconductor chips that hobbled vehicle production for most of 2021 and 2022 has faded into the background — with some exceptions — according to recent analysis by S&amp;P Global Mobility.S&amp;P Global Mobility estimates that in 2021 more than 9.5 million units of global light-vehicle production was lost as a direct result of a lack of necessary semiconductors, with the third quarter of 2021 experiencing the largest impact with an estimated volume loss of 3.5 million units. Another 3 million units were impacted in 2022. (These losses are estimated from analyzing original equipment manufacturer announcements, compared to S&amp;P Global Mobility's estimate of production planning volumes during the same timeframes.)During the first half of 2023, however, losses identifiable as specifically related to the semiconductor shortage fell to about 524,000 units globally. Although the supply of semiconductors remains constrained, more predictable availability has allowed automakers to adapt their production schedules.As a result, we see semiconductors as a specific cause of production disruptions happening with less frequency.Production in 2023 has improved as automakers and suppliers have adapted to the current environment, and 2023 sales are improving with more inventory. That said, the pre-pandemic momentum toward a 100-million global vehicle production year has been set back by a decade, according to S&amp;P Global Mobility analysis.Story continuesSo, where are we in mid-2023?To level-set expectations, prior to the pandemic there always were semiconductor supply chain challenges — but they tended to be episodic, impacting a single component type or individual supplier. The semiconductor suppliers have customer service and production readiness teams working behind the scenes, and these resources have always managed these types of shortages with only rare interruptions in service.What was unique about the pandemic period was the wholesale shortages among virtually all suppliers, impacting multiple component types (including microcontroller units — or MCUs — and analog based on mature process node capacity).""We've moved from obvious disruption, clearly visible at the automaker and plant level, to a stage where we know constraint remains, but it is impossible to identify,"" said Mark Fulthorpe, S&amp;P Global Mobility executive director of global light-vehicle production.""We are now in a position where the auto industry has adapted to a constrained supply, and as a result is much less likely to be hit by significant disruption,"" Fulthorpe added. ""With the current semiconductor supply levels, we estimate that 22 million units of global light-vehicle production per quarter could be supported.""However, industry demand for increasingly complex infotainment, advanced safety and vehicle autonomy systems will continue to escalate usage of semiconductors in vehicles. Phil Amsrud, senior principal analyst in the S&amp;P Global Mobility supplier and components team, estimates that the value of semiconductors installed in vehicles averaged US$500 per car in 2020, but is forecast to reach US$1,400 per car by 2028.""Before the pandemic, the lead time from order to shipment of chips was three to four months. During the pandemic in 2021 and 2022, that wait grew to a year or longer,"" Amsrud said. ""But while other industries — such as mobile phones and PCs — have experienced cooling demand of late, automotive semiconductor demand is increasing, and some chip manufacturers have pivoted capacity to address that need.""That said, the types of chips for automotive-grade use versus communications equipment often are not the same; or there are different qualification levels in automotive that complicate using consumer grade components in automotive applications, Amsrud noted.Chip shortage: it's starting to get betterPotential for future disruptionAlthough the semiconductor crisis is largely resolved, the chip supply situation still carries a degree of uncertainty. Demand still exceeds supply of several chip types. There is a shortage, even as the auto industry can better manage it today than two years ago. Pressure on the supply chain remains with risk of further disruption.While demand for chips from the consumer electronics industry has softened recently, it is likely to rebound while the use of semiconductors in autos continues to increase, which are factors indicating continued pressure. Meanwhile, the structural lack of capacity for mature node capacity has not been addressed. Geopolitical trade risks remain as well, as evidenced by mainland China's decision in early July to restrict exports of some key semiconductor materials. Trade tensions between the US and mainland China remain high, and the semiconductor supply can still be affected by future moves from either side.Consolidation of electronics in cars is also driving the automotive semiconductor demand, with domain controllers and central computers replacing electronics control units (ECUs). This does not lessen the need for chips, but rather means more — and more powerful — chips are needed.The good news is this consolidation enables the use of more advanced system-on-chip (SoC) and discrete memory, which are processed at more advanced process nodes. This is where most capacity investment is going. The bad news is some analog, discrete and power components will always be on mature process nodes, which receive much less investment. The movement to domain controllers and central computers may reduce the number of modules per vehicle and will change the mix of semiconductors but it will not reduce the overall number of semiconductors. Analog, discrete and power devices will get little if any benefit from moving to advanced process nodes.There also is the question of how OEMs approach the manufacturing capacity equation, following two years of lower volumes but — in some cases — stronger profits. Faced with lower capacity, largely due to the chip crisis, automakers were able to command higher pricing, heavily reduce reliance on incentives, and allocate chips to higher-margin products and trim levels within product lines.For those automakers, there may be a rethink on how to manage the inventory versus demand, and incentive to support the pricing power with managed production and to continue allocating chips to high-margin, high-feature set vehicles that inherently also require more chips. Looking forward, the question may not simply be how many chips are available to the automotive industry, but how different automakers allocate their supply.Industry trajectory set back by a decadeWhile production and sales are improving, and semiconductor supply is no longer expected to be a source of disruption for vehicle production, there is little chance to ""make up"" the lost production or sales from 2020 through 2022. The early-2019 S&amp;P Global Mobility forecast — issued prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent shutdowns — expected both global sales and production to exceed 100 million units annually as soon as 2022.That milestone is now not expected until past 2030, according to our analysis, demonstrating that the auto industry's growth trajectory has been thrown off by roughly a decade compared with pre-pandemic expectations. The semiconductor crisis was among the most disruptive of several external impacts that combined to drive down the opportunities expected in 2019, but certainly not the only one.Global sales and production, 2018 to 2030Global light-vehicle sales reached 93.8 million units in 2018. Several factors caused sales to drop in 2019, and then COVID-19 and associated impacts led to a 14% year-over-year decline in global auto sales in 2020. The recovery in 2021 was held down by production constraints rather than by a lack of consumer demand or willingness to buy, and in 2022, those constraints caused yet another decline.The June 2023 S&amp;P Global Mobility forecast sees sales reaching 83.6 million units globally this year — another 93-million-unit year is not forecast until 2027, thus pushing the potential for sales above 100 million units past 2030.As for global light-vehicle production, that number reached 94.1 million units in 2018, also falling in 2019 to about 88 million. The pandemic and related supply chain woes pulled production down by 16% year over year in 2020. With supply chain issues approaching a more normalized situation in 2023, output is forecast to reach 85.6 million units this year. Although we will see another 88-million-unit production year in 2024, output above 94 million units is not expected to occur until 2028.Mid-2023 marks an inflection point when the semiconductor supply is no longer limiting vehicle production. There will continue to be parts of the supply chain that pose threats but those seem more episodic than systemic. Geopolitical threats persist in terms of wafer and packaging capacity in the Asia-Pacific region, but the industry is also moving forward with adding capacity in Japan, Europe, and North America.The effectiveness of and responses to the US-led semiconductor technology embargo are still to be determined. Rebounds in non-automotive semiconductor market growth are an unknown factor. From the automotive industry perspective, lessons learned from the pandemic shortages — especially the long-term balance of mature versus advanced process nodes — is critical. The trends of electrification and autonomous driving will impact vehicle architectures, which in turn will impact the mix and number of semiconductors used. The industry may have survived the COVID semiconductor crisis, but that does not mean it is out of the woods.About S&amp;P Global Mobility At S&amp;P Global Mobility, we provide invaluable insights derived from unmatched automotive data, enabling our customers to anticipate change and make decisions with conviction.

The consensus mark remained stable over the past week. The consensus estimate for second-quarter revenues of $4.1 billion indicates a 7.7% increase from the year-ago reported figure.Synchrony beat the consensus estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, with the average surprise being 6.6%. This is depicted in the graph below:Synchrony Financial Price and EPS SurpriseSynchrony Financial Price and EPS SurpriseSynchrony Financial price-eps-surprise | Synchrony Financial QuoteBefore we get into what to expect for the to-be-reported quarter in detail, it’s worth taking a look at SYF’s previous-quarter performance first.Q1 Earnings RewindThe consumer financial services company reported adjusted earnings of $1.35 per share for the previous quarter, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.5%. The quarterly results suffered from elevated benchmark rates, increased funding liabilities, higher expenses and lower average active accounts.However, its performance received a boost from robust purchase volume stemming from the solid contributions of its five sales platforms. An expanding loan receivables portfolio also benefited the company.Now let’s see how things have shaped up before the second-quarter earnings announcement.Q2 Factors to NoteDespite economic volatilities, consumer spending remained resilient in the early days of the second quarter.

The new orders are likely to boost Northrop’s revenue generation prospects in the military aircraft business arena.Growth ProspectsCountries globally have been reinforcing their military resources due to intense geopolitical tensions and amplified terrorist threats.

Such growth prospects may benefit Northrop as its military aviation system offers a wide range of manned and unmanned aircraft that already enjoys an established position in the military aircraft market.Story continuesThe abounding growth prospects of the aforementioned market should also benefit other defense majors that manufacture combat jets, such as Lockheed Martin LMT, Boeing BA and Textron TXT.Lockheed Martin’s Aeronautics segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies.

However, a strengthening dollar amid rising jet fuel prices remains a threat to the industry players.Nevertheless, the outlook remains bright for the defense side of the aerospace-defense industry, buoyed by a solid budget proposal. This should keep investors interested in the industry. The frontrunners in the aerospace-defense industry are Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Leidos Holdings.About the IndustryThe Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry comprises companies that primarily design and manufacture heavy-built products like commercial as well as military jets and helicopters, tankers and other combat vehicles, missiles, combatant ships as well as auxiliary ships, submarines, bombs, guns, space transportation vehicles, military satellites and a few more. The industry also includes cyber security players who offer information technology services and C4ISR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) solutions. A portion of its revenues comes from defense contractors offering spare parts, aircraft modification, ship repair and overhaul services and supply chain management services.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Aerospace-Defense IndustryImproved Air Traffic Outlook Boosts Prospects: Recovering global air traffic data in recent times has boosted the near-term growth prospects of the industry. As stated in the latest report published by the IATA, industry-wide global RPK increased 39.1% year over year in May 2023. IATA projects industry-wide RPKs to reach 87.8% of the 2019 level in 2023, with air traffic rising as the year progresses. Such impressive projections bode well for commercial aerospace manufacturers that have long borne the brunt of poor air travel in the form of delayed jet deliveries and, in some cases, cancellation of their orders by airlines.Story continuesExpanding Defense Budget Remains a Growth Catalyst: While the commercial aerospace market has been recovering steadily over the past couple of quarters, the defense side of the industry stood its ground amid the COVID-19 crisis, cushioned by steady government support. To this end, it is imperative to mention that the U.S. fiscal 2024 defense budget request of $842 billion for the Pentagon indicates a 3.2% improvement from the previous year's enacted amount. Such improved budgetary provisions set the stage for industry players focused on the defense business to win more contracts, which is likely to boost their top line.Supply-Chain Issues May Hurt: Significant supply-chain disruption impacted the Aerospace and Defense industry, thanks to pandemic-induced lower aircraft demand and restrictions on the movement of people and goods. This primarily affected small suppliers like aircraft part manufacturers, especially those with heavy exposure to commercial aerospace and the aftermarket business.Although the global economy has started to improve, lingering market disequilibria will likely continue to keep prices high, including that of labor, as estimated by IATA. This, in turn, might constrict the growth trajectory of the U.S. Aerospace and Defense industry, to some extent, in the near term.Strengthening Dollar Adds to Industry Woes: The recently appreciating U.S. dollar is adding another layer of cost to airlines, which are already burdened with high inflation and rising jet fuel prices. The Federal Reserve's policy rate now stands at 5.25% as of May 2023, having started 2022 at 0.25%. All U.S. dollar-denominated costs are rising for airlines, which earn revenues in non-U.S. currency.Similarly, the debt burden has increased for all non-dollar-based entities that have borrowed in dollars. Such a burden on airlines might lead to lower aircraft delivery, thereby hurting aerospace-defense industry players that particularly operate in commercial aerospace.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry is housed within the broaderZacks Aerospace sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #182, which places it in the bottom 27% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates weak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is due to a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts have lost confidence in this group's earnings growth potential over the past few months. The industry's earnings estimate for the current fiscal year has gone down 6.3% to $3.70 per share since Mar 31.Before we present a few aerospace-defense stocks that you may want to add to your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Aerospace-Defense industry has underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite as well as its own sector over the past year. The stocks in this industry have collectively lost 0.4% against the Aerospace sector's growth of 3.8%. The Zacks S&amp;P 500 Composite has gone up 15.1% in the said time frame.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the trailing 12-month EV/Sales ratio, which is used for evaluating capital-intensive stocks like aerospace-defense, the industry is currently trading at 1.78 compared with the S&amp;P 500's 3.56 and the sector's 2.17.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 1.99X, as low as 1.64X, and at the median of 1.88X.3 Aerospace-Defense Stocks to Keep in Your WatchlistLockheed Martin: Based in Bethesda, MD, Lockheed Martin is the largest defense contractor in the world, with its main areas of focus being defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information technology, including cyber security. On Jul 10, 2023, the company revealed that its Patriot Advanced Capability – 3 (PAC-3) Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) interceptor has successfully communicated with the AN/SPY-1 Radar, a key component in the Aegis Weapon System. This takes LMT closer to the integration of PAC-3 MSE with Aegis weapon system, thereby strengthening demand potential for its missile defense system. Lockheed Martin currently boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.2%. The company delivered an average earnings surprise of 7.46% in the last four quarters.  LMT currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Northrop Grumman: Based in Falls Church, VA, Northrop Grumman supplies a broad range of products and services to the U.S. Department of Defense, including electronic systems, information technology, aircraft, space technology and systems integration services. In June 2023, NOC announced that it has conducted a successful flight test of its advanced airborne navigation solution, Embedded Global Positioning System (GPS)/Inertial Navigation System (INS) Modernization, known as EGI-M. This should boost demand for NOC's products in the advanced airborne navigation system space.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company's 2023 sales implies an improvement of 4.7% from the 2022 reported figure. NOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.8%. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Leidos Holdings: Based in Reston, VA, Leidos Holdings is a leading global science and technology company that serves the defense, intelligence, civil and health markets.

This is understandable, as investors such as retirees need current income. But for long-term growth of dividend income, investors should not exclude lower-yielding stocks with high dividend growth rates.In this article, we will discuss the prospects of three top dividend growth stocks. These stocks have low payout ratios and promising growth prospects. Plus, they can continue raising their dividends at a fast pace for many more years.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsStarbucks Corporation (SBUX)the Starbucks (SBUX) logo on a sign outside of a coffee shopSource: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.comStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) is a retail coffee giant with more than 36,000 stores worldwide. Nearly half of the stores are in the U.S. and about 20% of the stores are in China. The company operates under the namesake Starbucks brand but also holds the Teavana, Evolution Fresh and Ethos Water brands in its portfolio. The company generated $32 billion in annual revenue in fiscal 2022.2023 has been another year of impressive growth for Starbucks. In the most recent fiscal quarter, Starbucks grew its comparable store sales 11% thanks to 12% growth in the U.S. and 7% growth in international markets. Same-store sales in China grew 3%, after having remained depressed for four consecutive quarters due to lockdowns.Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) grew 25%, from 59 cents in the prior year’s quarter to 74 cents, and exceeded the analysts’ consensus by 9 cents. The headwinds from the lockdowns in China and high inflation have subsided. Starbucks reiterated its positive guidance for 2023, expecting EPS growth of 15%-20% at the low end of its long-term guidance.Starbucks has put together an excellent operating record, growing EPS by 18% per year from 2010-2019. During that period, its net profit margin expanded from 5% to 13%, while the company-owned store count nearly doubled. The Covid-19 pandemic was a major setback, but Starbucks recovered strongly in 2021 with record earnings.Story continuesLooking further out, Starbucks has a strong growth trajectory available over the long term thanks to a growing U.S. and international store count, where the company is still in the early innings of expansion, coupled with pricing power. We are forecasting 13% annual EPS growth over the next five years.Starbucks has increased its dividend for 12 consecutive years. Starbucks is currently offering a dividend yield of 2.1%. Thanks to its healthy payout ratio of 62%, its solid balance sheet and its promising growth prospects, the company is likely to keep raising its dividend for many more years.Yum Brands (YUM)YUM stock: the yum logo on the side of a buildingSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comYum Brands (NYSE:YUM) owns the KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and The Habit restaurant chains. It is present in more than 155 countries and has more than 54,000 restaurants, 60% of which are located abroad. KFC generates about half of the total revenue and operating profit of the company.In early May, Yum Brands reported financial results for the first quarter of 2023. The company grew its currency-neutral sales 11% over the prior year’s quarter thanks to 8% same-store sales growth and 3% growth of store count. KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut grew their sales 11%, 12% and 10%, respectively. Digital sales rose to a new all-time high and exceeded 45% of total sales.The strength of Yum’s company brands and their appeal to consumers constitute a significant competitive advantage. Thanks to its established brands, the company enjoys reliable free cash flows. As a result, the company is not likely to have issues servicing its debt. It is also worth noting that Yum Brands has proved markedly resilient during recessions, mostly thanks to its low-priced fast-food offerings.Yum Brands has returned to strong growth thanks to its increasing store count and its same-store sales. The company expects to grow its store count by 4%-5% per year in the upcoming years. During the last five years, Yum Brands has grown EPS at an 8.8% average annual rate. We expect 10% annual EPS growth over the next five years, which will allow the company to increase dividends as well. With a 47% dividend payout ratio for this fiscal year, the dividend is highly safe. YUM stock yields 1.7%.Baxter International (BAX)Source: ShutterstockBaxter International (NYSE:BAX) develops and sells a variety of healthcare products, including biological products, medical devices and connected care services devices used to monitor patients. Its products are used in hospitals, kidney dialysis centers, nursing homes, doctors’ offices and patients at home under physician supervision.In the first quarter, revenue fell 1.6% to $3.65 billion, but this was $50 million more than expected. Adjusted EPS of 59 cents compared unfavorably to 93 cents in the prior year but was 6 cents ahead of estimates. Results were mostly positive for the quarter. Renal Care, the largest segment within the company, grew 4% despite lower in-center sales following the exit of a distribution agreement last year. Advanced Surgery improved 11% due to a higher number of global procedures. Pharmaceuticals was up 5%, driven by double-digit growth in injectables in the U.S. and higher demand for drug compounding services in international markets.Baxter provided updated guidance for 2023 as well. The company now expects adjusted EPS in a range of $2.85 to $3 for the year, up from $2.75 to $2.95 previously.Baxter has a solid dividend growth history. Over the past five years, dividends have grown at 10.6% annually. Baxter has increased dividend payments to shareholders for six consecutive years and paid dividends to shareholders for 32 consecutive years. Baxter has seen growth across its product lines and across its geographic segments over the past five years.We maintain our five-year projected EPS growth rate of 10% due to the quality of the company as well as the low base of earnings that 2023 is expected to see. Over the next five years, we forecast that dividends will grow at about 10% annually, in line with EPS growth. The stock has a 2.6% current yield.On the date of publication, Bob Ciura did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

149,8bb500ed-ae42-30f7-8d51-85dffcd9812b,JNJ,2023-07-14,Johnson & Johnson sues researchers who linked talc to cancer,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/johnson-johnson-sues-researchers-linked-161742344.html,1689265062,STORY,['JNJ'],"[*J&amp;J alleges researchers used ""junk science"" to disparage company's products*Defendants say the lawsuits are meant to ""silence"" scientistsBy Dietrich KnauthJuly 12 (Reuters) - Johnson &amp; Johnson has sued four doctors who published studies citing links between talc-based personal care products and cancer, escalating an attack on scientific studies that the company alleges are inaccurate.J&amp;J's subsidiary LTL Management, which absorbed the company's talc liability in a controversial 2021 spinoff, last week filed a lawsuit in New Jersey federal court asking it to force three researchers to ""retract and/or issue a correction"" of a study that said asbestos-contaminated consumer talc products sometimes caused patients to develop mesothelioma.One of the researchers, Richard Kradin, declined to comment. The other two, Theresa Emory and John Maddox, did not respond to requests for comment. Lawyers who have represented the three researchers in similar litigation in the past declined to comment.J&amp;J is facing more than 38,000 lawsuits alleging that the company's talc products, including its Baby Powder, were contaminated by asbestos and caused cancers including ovarian cancer and mesothelioma. J&amp;J is attempting to resolve those lawsuits, as well as any future talc lawsuits, through an $8.9 billion settlement in bankruptcy court.J&amp;J says that its talc products are safe and do not contain asbestos.J&amp;J has stopped selling talc-based Baby Powder in favor of cornstarch-based products, citing an increase in lawsuits and ""misinformation"" about the talc product's safety.The company in 2021 began exploring bankruptcy as a potential solution to the lawsuits, which saw a mixed record at trial, including several defense wins but also a $2.1 billion verdict awarded to 22 women who blamed their ovarian cancer on asbestos in the company's talc products. J&amp;J said in bankruptcy court filings in April that the costs of its talc-related verdicts, settlements and legal fees have reached about $4.5 billion.Story continuesLast week's lawsuit against Emory and Maddox, pathologists affiliated with Peninsula Pathology Associates in Newport News, Virginia, and Kradin, a pulmonologist who worked at Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center before his retirement, comes on the heels of another complaint LTL filed in late May against another doctor, Jacqueline Moline, who works at Northwell Health in Great Neck, New York, on similar grounds.Moline published an article in 2019 studying 33 patients who said their only exposure to asbestos came from talc products, and Emory, Kradin and Maddox followed up with a 2020 study of 75 similar patients.All four doctors have provided expert testimony in lawsuits against J&amp;J, and their research has been cited in lawsuits where they have not testified, according to the complaints.LTL said the researchers concealed the fact that some or all of the patients involved in their studies had been exposed to asbestos from other sources.The company is also asking the court to force the researchers to disclose the patients' identities.The lawsuits allege product disparagement and fraud, among other claims.Adam Zimmerman, a professor at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law, said companies rarely file lawsuits over research they disagree with. It will be very difficult for LTL to prove that the researchers intentionally harmed J&amp;J's reputation, which is required for product disparagement cases in New Jersey, but the company may view the lawsuits as a way to discourage other researchers or reclaim the narrative about talc safety, Zimmerman said.""When a litigant starts suing opposing experts, that's very aggressive,"" Zimmerman said. ""It sends a message that the gloves are off.""Moline has argued in court papers that LTL's litigation would have a profoundly chilling effect on future medical research if the company were allowed to unmask patients ""in the hopes of publicly smearing them."" Her court filings say that LTL's lawsuit was meant to ""attack and silence"" scientists, and that she has an ethical obligation to protect the identities of her research subjects.LTL's lawsuits allege that the doctors' research allowed them to collect millions of dollars from plaintiffs' lawyers to push a ""false narrative"" about J&amp;J. The complaint against Moline, for example, said she had made a ""small fortune"" testifying as a paid expert in lawsuits, receiving over $3 million from her work on asbestos lawsuits. LTL alleged that Kradin also made more than $3 million testifying as a plaintiffs' expert.The researchers could not immediately be reached for comment.LTL had filed similar lawsuits against the researchers in December 2022, but those complaints were linked to LTL’s first bankruptcy filing and were dismissed along with the rest of the bankruptcy in April.The cases are LTL Management v. Moline and LTL Management v. Emory, U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, Nos. 23-cv-02990 and 23-cv-03649.For LTL: Peter Harvey of Patterson Belknap Webb &amp; Tyler; Allison Brown of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom; and Kristen Fournier of King &amp; SpaldingFor Moline: Kevin Marino and John Tortorella of Marino Tortorella &amp; BoyleFor Emory, Kradin and Maddox: Not yet available Read more:J&amp;J unit files for second bankruptcy to pursue $8.9 billion talc settlementCancer plaintiffs drill down on J&amp;J's support for $8.9 billion talc dealU.S. court rejects J&amp;J bankruptcy strategy for thousands of talc lawsuits (Reporting by Dietrich Knauth; additional reporting by Brendan Pierson)]"
150,f655234e-d310-335b-9465-e5f3aab669c9,JNJ,2023-07-14,Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/johnson-johnson-jnj-reports-next-140100233.html,1689256860,STORY,['JNJ'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 20. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis world's biggest maker of health care products is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.61 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +0.8%.Revenues are expected to be $24.66 billion, up 2.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.36% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Johnson &amp; Johnson?For Johnson &amp; Johnson, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.84%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Johnson &amp; Johnson will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Johnson &amp; Johnson would post earnings of $2.51 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.68, delivering a surprise of +6.77%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Johnson &amp; Johnson doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Quality Dividend Stocks to Buy. During periods of uncertainty, such as recessions or inflationary environments, dividend stocks often become a preferred choice for investors. This is because dividend stocks can provide a certain level of stability and income even in turbulent times. When it comes to dividend stocks, investing in high-quality companies offers several advantages. Quality dividend stocks are those that have a track record of consistent and reliable dividend payments. These companies are well-established and have histories of generating steady cash flows, strong earnings growth, and solid balance sheets.Dividend growth rate plays a significant role in dividend investing by showcasing a company's capacity to raise its dividend payments over time. When companies can consistently increase their dividends at a healthy rate, it signals their strength and stability as investments. This growth reflects a strong and expanding cash flow, demonstrating their commitment to delivering value to shareholders. Moreover, dividend growers also showed robust performance in the past, compared to their counterparts. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we mentioned data from Ned Davis Research and Hartford Funds, which revealed that dividend growers achieved a return of 9.62% from 1972 to December 31, 2018. In contrast, dividend cutters experienced a negative return of 0.79%. During the same period, the S&amp;P 500 had an average annual return of 7.30%, indicating that dividend growers outperformed the broader market.Also read: 12 Best Long-Term Dividend Stocks To Buy NowInvestors showed great interest in stocks with substantial dividends last year, considering them popular trades in the stock market. However, this preference for dividend-heavy stocks has lost momentum since then due to growing investments in artificial intelligence (AI). According to data by Ned Davis Research, non-dividend-paying stocks in the S&amp;P 500 have experienced a collective gain of approximately 18% in 2023, as of July 1. In contrast, income-generating companies have only seen a modest 4% advance. This marks the weakest first-half performance for dividend-paying stocks compared to non-dividend-paying stocks since 2009.Story continuesHowever, it is important to note that the situation could change in the future, especially since dividend-paying stocks have historically demonstrated a tendency to outperform during periods of economic slowdown. According to a report by Wall Street Journal, there are concerns that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes could potentially lead the economy into a recession. If such a scenario unfolds, defensive companies with substantial dividends could once again outperform. This is because, during an economic downturn, consumers tend to prioritize essential expenses.Analysts also continue to support the stance on dividend stocks, as they see potential and favorable prospects for these stocks throughout the year. Paul Baiocchi, chief ETF strategist at SS&amp;C ALPS Advisors, spoke with WSJ and said that a significant part of the market’s total return has been generated by compounded dividends over time, rather than the price appreciation of the stock market itself. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) are some of the best dividend stocks with decades-long dividend growth track records. In this article, we will further discuss quality dividend stocks to consider.11 Best Quality Dividend Stocks to BuyImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur Methodology:For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 943 hedge funds as of Q1 2023 and selected blue-chip dividend companies with robust balance sheets. From this pool, we further narrowed down the companies that have consistently increased their dividend payments for 40 years or more. By highlighting these companies, we aim to showcase their quality and long-standing commitment to rewarding shareholders. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of hedge funds having stakes in them.11. Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) is an American medical device company with legal headquarters in Ireland. The company operates in various healthcare sectors and offers a broad range of products and services to improve patient outcomes and quality of life.In fiscal Q4 2023, Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) reported revenue of $8.5 billion, up 5.6% from the same period last year. In FY23, the company generated $6.03 billion in operating cash flow and its free cash flow for the period came in at $4.5 billion. It also returned $4 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases in FY23.Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), one of the best dividend stocks, has raised its dividends by 38% in the past five years. The company overall holds a 46-year streak of consistent dividend growth and currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.69 per share. The stock's dividend yield on July 12 came in at 3.15%.

With over 5.4 million shares, First Eagle Investment Management was the company's leading stakeholder in Q1.Appleseed Fund mentioned Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“During the most recent quarter, Appleseed Fund added three new equity holdings: Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK), and Synovus Financial (SNV). Medtronic is the world’s largest device manufacturer, and it holds the number one or number two market share in most of its product segments. Medtronic’s business is heavily weighted towards complicated in-patient procedures, which are typically quite profitable. Industry dynamics are quite attractive with an aging global population and the growth of improved healthcare in emerging markets; furthermore, most of its segments are highly concentrated with just 2-3 players that split each segment’s market share, affording the key participants with significant economies of scale and pricing power. The Company has been recently addressing several temporary headwinds including a strong dollar, inflation, a delayed recovery in surgical volumes from the coronavirus pandemic, and supply chain issues. Once these issues reach the rearview mirror, the Company’s growth and margin expansion plans should transform into reality.”10. Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 53Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) is next on our list of the best dividend stocks. The management services company reported revenue of $5 billion in fiscal Q3 2023, which showed a 9% growth from the same period last year.

(NASDAQ:ADP) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We eliminated Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) from the portfolio due to concerns that the economy is close to a peak job market and interest income on the company’s float has also peaked along with interest rates. The company’s valuation does not reflect the potential downside in the job market from a weakening economy.”9. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is a New York-based manufacturing company that specializes in the production and distribution of personal care, home care, and pet nutrition products.

CCI owns an unmatched portfolio of towers in the United States and has a significant presence in the top 100 basic trading areas of the country.The increase in mobile data usage, spectrum availability and high network investments by wireless carriers to deploy 5G networks have led to a rise in demand for the company’s wireless communication assets, positioning this Houston, TX-based real estate investment trust (REIT) well for growth.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have gained 1.8% in the past month compared with the industry’s growth of 3.3%. However, given the rise in wireless connectivity usage and the secular trends of the industry, there is immense scope for growth, and the company is expected to perform well in the quarters ahead. Hence, this marks a good entry point in the stock now.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFactors That Make Crown Castle a Solid PickHealthy Industry Fundamentals: The advancement in mobile technology, such as 4G and 5G networks, and the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive applications have driven the growth in mobile data usage globally. Also, rampant usage of network-intensive applications for video conferencing and cloud services, and remote-working scenarios have fueled the rise.This has led to greater capital spending by wireless carriers on the back of incremental demand from global 4G and 5G deployment efforts, growing wireless penetration and spectrum auctions, aiding demand for CCI’s wireless communication infrastructure. We expect the company’s net revenues to improve 2.8% year over year for 2023.Solid Tenant Base: The company enjoys a strong creditworthy tenant base which includes names like T-Mobile, AT&amp;T and Verizon. This adds resiliency to its business. Moreover, its long-term lease agreements (typically five to 15 years) with the top U.S. carriers assure steady site rental cash flows. We project CCI’s total site rental revenues to increase 3.5% year over year.Strategic Investments: With increased innovation and adoption of data-driven mobile devices and applications, such as machine-to-machine connections, social networking and streaming of video, wireless data consumption is expected to escalate considerably in the future.To capitalize on this upbeat trend, Crown Castle has been increasingly investing in new small cell and fiber assets to enhance the capacity and network density required for wireless networks. It expects to double the rate of small cell deployments this year compared with the 5,000 nodes it put on air in 2022, which is encouraging.Balance Sheet &amp; Cash Flow Strength: Crown Castle is focused on maintaining a healthy balance sheet position with ample liquidity. As of the end of the first quarter of 2023, its cash and cash equivalents totaled $187 million while liquidity under its revolving credit facility amounted to more than $5.5 billion. With investment-grade credit ratings of BBB, BBB+ and Baa3 from Standard &amp; Poor’s, Fitch, and Moody’s, respectively, and limited near-term maturities, CCI is well-poised to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.The company’s current cash flow growth is projected at 20.75% compared with the industry’s 10.63%. In addition, its trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) is 22.12% compared with the industry’s average of 3.64%, highlighting the efficient utilization of its shareholders’ funds than its peers.Dividend: Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT shareholders, and Crown Castle is committed to that. It has increased its dividend five times in the last five years. Its five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 8.99%. Such efforts boost investors’ confidence in the stock.

Cancer, also referred to as malignant tumors or neoplasms, encompasses a diverse range of diseases that can manifest in any region of the body. A key characteristic of the disease is the accelerated formation of abnormal cells that grow beyond their usual boundaries, subsequently infiltrating nearby tissues and potentially spreading to other organs. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for nearly 10 million deaths in 2020, or nearly one in six deaths. According to data presented by the American Cancer Society (ACS), approximately 1.9 million new cancer cases are projected to be diagnosed in the United States in 2023. This estimate does not include basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers, as they are not mandated to be reported to cancer registries, nor does it encompass carcinoma in situ (noninvasive cancer), with the exception of urinary bladder cancer. Additionally, an estimated 609,820 people in the United States will die from cancer in 2023, corresponding to 1670 deaths per day. The most significant causes of death in men are lung, prostate, and colorectal cancers, while in women, the leading causes are lung, breast, and colorectal cancers.There's also a massive financial cost associated with cancer that's growing rapidly. In 2018, researchers at Penn State College of Medicine reported that the top 15 types of cancer accounted for over $156 billion in costs in the United States. Alarming projections by the National Cancer Institute indicate that the national cancer-attributable cost for medical services and prescription drugs is expected to increase from $183 billion in 2015 to $246 billion by 2030—an increase of 34%.Story continuesSee also: 25 Best Hospitals for Cancer Treatment in the WorldThe field of oncology stands as one of the largest and rapidly expanding sectors in biopharmaceutical research and development (R&amp;D). According to Precedence Research, the global oncology market exceeded a value of $203 billion in 2022 and is projected to exhibit a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.8% by 2032, reaching a substantial $470.61 billion. Within this growth trajectory, the hospital segment is anticipated to experience a CAGR of 10.9% during the forecasted period. Notably, in 2021, the diagnostic segment accounted for approximately 47% of the oncology market share. Undoubtedly, the proactive efforts of governmental bodies and non-profit organizations in raising awareness about cancer prevention are anticipated to propel market growth. Notably, the World Health Organization's Global Action Plan for Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases strives to reduce premature deaths caused by cancer, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes by approximately 25% by the year 2025.On the other hand, the field of cancer vaccines has also gained significant global attention. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) and Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) have collaborated on a promising vaccine that combines an mRNA cancer vaccine with Moderna's Keytruda®. Phase 2 trials have shown a remarkable 44% reduction in the risk of cancer recurrence or death compared to Keytruda alone. Furthermore, BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), a German biotechnology company, and the UK government have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to provide up to 10,000 patients with personalized mRNA-based cancer immunotherapies by 2030. These developments highlight the growing potential and commitment towards advancing cancer treatment through innovative vaccine approaches.

We then identified the deadliest cancers based on their expected mortality rates for the current year. The diseases on our list are ranked in ascending order based on the estimated amount of deaths they will cause.15. MyelomaEstimated Deaths: 12,590Myeloma, a form of blood cancer, originates from the plasma cells found in the bone marrow. It is commonly referred to as multiple myeloma since the majority of individuals (90%) present with multiple bone lesions at the time of diagnosis. Despite being a relatively uncommon cancer in the United States, with a lifetime risk of developing it only 1 in 132, the American Cancer Society estimates that 35,730 new cases will be diagnosed in 2023.14. Uterine CancerEstimated Deaths: 13,030Uterine cancer refers to the abnormal growth of cells within the uterus, resulting in uncontrolled proliferation. There are two primary types of uterine cancer: endometrial cancers and uterine sarcomas. Endometrial cancers originate in the lining of the uterus (endometrium) and comprise approximately 95% of all uterine cancer cases. On the other hand, uterine sarcomas develop in the muscle tissue (myometrium) and represent a less common form of uterine cancer. The fourth most common cancer for women in the United States, it is estimated that around 66,200 people in the United States will be diagnosed with uterine, or endometrial, cancer in 2023.13. Ovarian CancerEstimated Deaths: 13,270Ovarian cancer refers to the development of a malignant tumor in either one or both ovaries. Although various types of ovarian cancer exist, the three most prevalent are as follows: the common epithelial type, accounting for approximately 90% of cases, which originates from the outer cells of the ovary; the germ cell type, representing around 4% of cases, which emerges from the cells responsible for egg production; and the rare stromal type, arising from the supportive tissues within the ovary. Ovarian cancer ranks fifth in cancer deaths among women, accounting for more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system. For context, a woman's risk of getting ovarian cancer during her lifetime is about 1 in 78.12. Kidney CancerEstimated Deaths: 14,890Kidney cancer is the abnormal growth of cells in a person's kidney tissue. In time, these cells form a mass called a tumor. Kidney cancer is one of the most common cancers in the United States, with more than 76,000 new cases diagnosed each year. The average age of people when they are diagnosed is 64 with most people being diagnosed between ages 65 and 74. Additionally, such cancer is about twice as common in men than in women and it is more common in African Americans, American Indians, and Alaska Natives.11. Esophageal CancerEstimated Deaths: 16,120Esophageal cancer, despite being one of the deadliest cancers in the U.S., is also one of the most common. It starts in the tissues of the esophagus, the long muscular tube that moves food from the throat to the stomach. Tumors caused by esophageal cancer may not cause noticeable symptoms until the cancer has spread. More common among men than women, the lifetime risk of esophageal cancer in the United States is about 1 in 125 for males compared to about 1 in 417 in females.10. Bladder CancerEstimated Deaths: 16,710Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that begins in the cells of the bladder. Urothelial carcinoma, also known as transitional cell carcinoma (TCC), is by far the most common type of bladder cancer. In fact, if a patient suffers from bladder cancer, it is almost always expected to be urothelial carcinoma. Among men in the United States, bladder cancer is the eighth most common cause of cancer death. However, the death rate for bladder cancer decreased by over 2% annually from 2016 to 2020. Despite this, it is estimated that around 16,710 deaths from this disease will occur in the United States in 2023.9. Brain and Spine CancerEstimated Deaths: 16,710A primary brain or spinal cord tumor is a tumor that starts in the brain or spinal cord. In 2023, an estimated 24,810 adults (14,280 men and 10,530 women) in the United States will be diagnosed with primary cancerous tumors of the brain and spinal cord.8. Non-Hodgkin LymphomaEstimated Deaths: 20,180Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a type of cancer that originates in the lymphatic system, which is a part of the body's immune system. Unlike Hodgkin lymphoma, which is characterized by the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells, Non-Hodgkin lymphoma involves the abnormal growth and accumulation of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. Although the exact cause of NHL is often unknown, numerous risk factors associated with the disease have been identified, including advanced age, weakened immune system, and infection like HIV. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is one of the most common cancers in the United States, accounting for about 4% of all cancers cases.7. LeukemiaEstimated Deaths: 23,710Leukemia encompasses a wide range of cancers affecting the blood cells. The specific type of leukemia is determined by the particular blood cell type that undergoes malignant transformation and the rate at which it proliferates. While leukemia predominantly occurs in adults aged 55 and older, it is also the most prevalent form of cancer among children under the age of 15. leukemia is the 10th most common cancer in the U.S., accounting for 3.2% of all new cancer cases.6. Bile Duct CancerEstimated Deaths: 29,380Bile duct cancer, also known as cholangiocarcinoma, is a rare and aggressive type of cancer that affects the bile ducts. It can occur in different areas of the bile duct system, including the intrahepatic ducts (inside the liver), the perihilar ducts (at the junction where the right and left hepatic ducts merge), or the distal ducts (outside the liver near the small intestine). One of the deadliest cancers in the U.S., about 8,000 people in the country are diagnosed with it each year. This includes both intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct cancers.Click to see and continue reading the 5 Deadliest Cancers in the U.S.. Suggested Articles: 20 Most Commonly Used Recreational Drugs in America. 20 Cities with the Highest Opioid Deaths in the U.S.20 Most Used Prescription Drugs In The US.Disclosure.

Variables depend on your retirement account’s tax structure, age, risk tolerance, and personal investment preferences. Still, a solid retirement plan is diversified across multiple industries and offers exposure to various investments. Investors optimizing their retirement stock picks should look for companies with solid historical performance, future potential, and investor-friendly financials. Dividends are critical for late-stage retirement investors to generate income for their accounts. For younger investors, they’re also helpful in growing their allocation for “free” through dividend reinvestment. Many investors tweak and modify their retirement portfolios over time, reducing risk as they age. Still, these three stocks are perfect for a buy-and-hold strategy today.

This drop in stock price and its undeniable longevity make the stock perfect for investing $1,000 today. Home Depot has a wide moat, meaning it faces little threat from new entrants or current competitors. While Home Depot remains the go-to option for home improvement hobbyists and weekend warriors, its recent initiatives target other groups. Higher sales to the larger-scale renovation teams, contractors, and builders improve its outlook for the homebuilding industry once the sector begins rebounding. Reinforcing this outlook, Home Depot plans to build 80 new stores over the next five years. The move indicates that management sees demand rising throughout the 2020s. Home Depot’s expansion also positions the company to capture an imminent surge in renovations and new builds as home prices level.Story continuesHome Depot remains committed to dividend distribution and growth, having reliably increased its annual dividend over the past ten years and doubled the quarterly payout since 2018. Its 0.465 payout ratio indicates that, while management sees benefit in returning value to shareholders, they aren’t overextending. Instead, they also retain sufficient cash to grow the enterprise.  Slightly undervalued today, Home Depot is a perfect pick among retirement stocks if you want to invest $1,000 today.  Occidental Petroleum (OXY)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Occidental Petroleum website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comWarren Buffett is still pumping cash into Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), which should make any retirement-focused investor pause and consider the stock for their portfolio.

Both these corporate actions return value to shareholders. This ratio makes OXY ideal for investors seeking returns beyond the risk-free rate while capturing upside as energy markets recover.

If you want to skip out on the details about the fund's manager, its history, and performance, then head on over to Medallion Fund Strategy, Returns, and Holdings: Top 5 Stock Picks.  Out of the different investment strategies that hedge funds and institutional managers use to invest in the stock market, one approach is quantitative investment. This strategy, as the name suggests, relies heavily on mathematics to make investment decisions. Simply put, the strategy involves determining the probabilities of stock performance and balancing the portfolio accordingly. This includes calculating variables such as the standard deviation of a stock's returns and then comparing this data with a broader set to make decisions.The 'guru' of quantitative investing in the hedge fund industry is none other than Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies. His journey on the stock market has made him one of the richest people in the world. According to Forbes Magazine, Jim Simons was worth a stunning $28 billion as of July 2023, which comfortably places him as the 49th richest person in the world.The source of Jim Simons' unimaginable wealth is his hedge fund Renaissance Technologies. The hedge fund offers its customers a pick of several different funds to invest in. These include its flagship Medallion Fund, the Institutional Diversified Alpha Fund, the Institutional Diversified Global Equity Fund, and the Institutional Equities Fund. Out of these, the Medallion Fund is Renaissance's flagship product and also one of its most successful to date.We've been covering Mr. Simons and his different funds for quite some time now. For instance, the Equities Fund gained a whopping 25.6% in the first eight months of 2011 and 5.4% in August alone. Our detailed analysis of Renaissance Technologies' performance in August 2011 revealed that the biggest stocks in his portfolio actually performed better than the full portfolio when compared to the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY). While the S&amp;P ETF had lost 5.1% during the month, the complete portfolio of Renaissance Technologies made of more than 1,500 stocks actually lost 4.9%. This performance improved when the focus was narrowed down to the top 50 stocks, which ended up losing less than half of the S&amp;P 500 ETF with -1.6% returns. This analysis also showed what a magician Mr. Simons is when it comes to quantitative trading, as he beat the market when it was going up, and then beat it again when it was going down since the RIEF itself had returned 5.4% in August 2011. To find out more on that you can read our detailed analysis here: The Mystery Behind Jim Simons’ Amazing August Returns.Story continuesThis wizardry has been the focus of a lot of attention, whether it's from investors, journalists, or even academics. Estimates suggest that the Medallion Fund has made tens of billions of dollars since being set up. For instance, until March 2020, the fund had generated annualized average returns of a whopping 66%, with Renaissance Technologies itself having generated more than $100 billion in profits between 1988 and 2020. However, the performance divergence between different funds managed by Renaissance has also created a bit of controversy for Mr. Simons and his hedge fund in the past. These became pronounced in 2009 in the aftermath of the financial crisis as the investing environment became fraught in general. In a conference call with fund managers, investors asked them why the Equities Fund had lost 17% between January and April 2009 while an internal fund exclusive to the billionaire and other Renaissance managers had actually diverged and returned 12%. The equities fund was flush with capital from new investors as it was the first to accept money in over a decade after the Medallion Fund was closed to outside investors.So, what's going on in the Renaissance world right now? Well, Mr. Simons retired from managing the daily affairs of the fund in 2010 and stepped down as an executive chairman in 2021. And the fund seems to be doing quite well even without its legendary investor. Insider Monkey's research shows that as of March 2023, the cumulative value of all investments made by the fund in its portfolio to the Securities and Exchange Commission stood at a cool $75.3 billion. However, the tech heavy side of the portfolio did see some shakeup since Q1 2022, as the portfolio had stood at $85 billion back then.During the first quarter of 2023, Renaissance Technologies had actually added positions in more than 400 companies. The biggest new position was in the industrial conglomerate Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON), with Renaissance Technologies, adding a $349 million stake in the company. Crucially though, it seems like the quantitative hedge fund has had enough of investing in the world's biggest technology firm Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Renaissance Technologies had held a massive $922 million stake in Apple by the end of December 2022, and Q1 saw the fund cut this stake down to just $1.5 million. Does this mean that the world's premier quantitative trader believes that Apple's shares have no magic left in them? You be the judge.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some top stock picks of Renaissance Technologies, out of which the notable names are Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD).Medallion Fund Strategy, Returns, and HoldingsJim Simons of Renaissance TechnologiesOur Methodology To compile our list of the Medallion Funds' top stock picks, we used data from Renaissance Technologies' top stock picks for the first quarter of this year. This is because Medallion is a private fund whose investments are not categorically listed on a public platform. However, the Q1 2023 data does show where the $75 billion portfolio is headed.Medallion Fund Strategy, Returns, and Holdings10.

The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)Renaissance Technologies Investment In Q1 2023: $550 millionThe Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is one of the biggest aerospace companies in the world. Jim Simons' investment firm grew its stake in the firm by a massive 1,076% in Q1 2023.

(NASDAQ:VRSN)Renaissance Technologies Investment In Q1 2023: $672 millionVeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN) is a technology company that provides backend internet services to websites.

""Maybe by the end of this year we will be in a position to outline our wide-body strategy a bit more,"" he told Reuters.A company spokesperson later said Bastian's comments don't necessarily mean the company will place an order.Reopening of borders after COVID-19 lockdowns has led to a surge in demand for long-haul flights. Delta reported a 61% jump in international passenger revenue in the second quarter from a year ago, led by the demand for transatlantic flights.To capitalize on demand, the airline is flying its largest schedule this summer on transatlantic routes.Industry executives say as many as 2,000 jet orders are up for grabs worldwide in a resurgent commercial jet market, on top of those provisionally announced already, as airlines return to growth after the COVID crisis.At the end of March quarter, Delta had 28 Airbus A350s, with an average age of over 4 years. Its long-haul fleet also included 63 A330s, but two-thirds of them are older-generation jets with an average age of about 16 years.In addition, it operates 45 Boeing 767-300ERs, with an average age of 27 years, and 21 767-400ERs, with an average age of over 22 years.The older jets have higher operating costs and worse fuel economy. Delta is looking to upgrade its fleet with new and more fuel-efficient aircraft with increased premium seating and higher cargo capacity.There has been a lot of speculation that the Atlanta-based carrier is looking to place a large wide-body aircraft order. Last month at an investor conference, Bastian said the company has the capital to invest in new jets.Separately on Thursday, Delta said it exercised options to buy 12 new Airbus 220-300 aircraft, scheduled to be delivered in 2027 and 2028. With their addition, Delta's fleet of A220s will grow to 131 planes, the company said.(Reporting by Rajesh Kumar Singh Editing by Nick Zieminski)]"

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $76 million, the contract is projected to be completed by August 2027. Per the terms of the deal, Northrop will supply spare parts for E-2D Advanced Hawkeye aircraft to support flight test and an initial two-year sustainment, following the delivery for three unique configurations of these jets. The contract will serve the government of France. A major portion of the work related to this deal will be executed in Liverpool, NY; Melbourne, FL; and Indianapolis, IN.Importance of E-2D Hawkeye JetNorthrop’s E-2D Hawkeye aircraft boasts battle management, theater air, missile defense and multiple sensor fusion capabilities in an airborne system. These provide the warfighter with expanded battlespace awareness, especially in the area of information operations.Through its effective radar sensor and robust network-enabled capability, the Advanced Hawkeye aircraft provides critical, actionable data to joint forces and first responders.Such features of the aircraft make it attractive for the military, resulting in NOC winning multiple orders for the same, like the latest one. The new orders are likely to boost Northrop’s revenue generation prospects in the military aircraft business arena.Growth ProspectsCountries globally have been reinforcing their military resources due to intense geopolitical tensions and amplified terrorist threats. To this end, a military aircraft that forms an integral part of any air defense system is likely to witness pent-up demand.Per a report from the Mordor Intelligence firm, the military aircraft market is projected to witness a CAGR of 4% over the 2022-2031 period. Such growth prospects may benefit Northrop as its military aviation system offers a wide range of manned and unmanned aircraft that already enjoys an established position in the military aircraft market.Story continuesThe abounding growth prospects of the aforementioned market should also benefit other defense majors that manufacture combat jets, such as Lockheed Martin LMT, Boeing BA and Textron TXT.Lockheed Martin’s Aeronautics segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Its major programs include the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter jet, the C-130 Hercules airlifter, the F-16 Fighting Falcon jet and the F-22 Raptor jet.LMT’s long-term earnings growth rate is 6.2%.

The segment also manufactures rotorcraft and rotary-wing programs, such as CH-47 Chinook, AH-64 Apache and V-22 Osprey.Boeing’s long-term earnings growth rate is 4%.

The stock hit a new 52-week high of $16.09 in the previous session. MGIC Investment has gained 23.7% since the start of the year compared to the 6.5% move for the Zacks Finance sector and the -8.8% return for the Zacks Insurance - Multi line industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 3, 2023, MGIC reported EPS of $0.54 versus consensus estimate of $0.51 while it missed the consensus revenue estimate by 2.19%.For the current fiscal year, MGIC is expected to post earnings of $2.19 per share on $1.18 billion in revenues. This represents a -24.74% change in EPS on a 0.13% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $2.33 per share on $1.26 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 6.39% and 6.43%, respectively.Valuation MetricsMGIC may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.MGIC has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are D and D, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 7.3X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 8.9X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 5X versus its peer group's average of 8.5X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.47. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Story continuesZacks RankWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, MGIC currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if MGIC meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though MGIC shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.How Does MTG Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of MTG have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Cigna Group (CI). CI has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of A, a Growth Score of A, and a Momentum Score of F.Earnings were strong last quarter. Cigna Group beat our consensus estimate by 3.44%, and for the current fiscal year, CI is expected to post earnings of $24.81 per share on revenue of $188.84 billion.Shares of Cigna Group have gained 1.9% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 10.83X and a P/CF of 8.04X.The Insurance - Multi line industry is in the top 34% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for MTG and CI, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $76 million, the contract is projected to be completed by August 2027. Per the terms of the deal, Northrop will supply spare parts for E-2D Advanced Hawkeye aircraft to support flight test and an initial two-year sustainment, following the delivery for three unique configurations of these jets. The contract will serve the government of France. A major portion of the work related to this deal will be executed in Liverpool, NY; Melbourne, FL; and Indianapolis, IN.Importance of E-2D Hawkeye JetNorthrop’s E-2D Hawkeye aircraft boasts battle management, theater air, missile defense and multiple sensor fusion capabilities in an airborne system. These provide the warfighter with expanded battlespace awareness, especially in the area of information operations.Through its effective radar sensor and robust network-enabled capability, the Advanced Hawkeye aircraft provides critical, actionable data to joint forces and first responders.Such features of the aircraft make it attractive for the military, resulting in NOC winning multiple orders for the same, like the latest one. The new orders are likely to boost Northrop’s revenue generation prospects in the military aircraft business arena.Growth ProspectsCountries globally have been reinforcing their military resources due to intense geopolitical tensions and amplified terrorist threats. To this end, a military aircraft that forms an integral part of any air defense system is likely to witness pent-up demand.Per a report from the Mordor Intelligence firm, the military aircraft market is projected to witness a CAGR of 4% over the 2022-2031 period. Such growth prospects may benefit Northrop as its military aviation system offers a wide range of manned and unmanned aircraft that already enjoys an established position in the military aircraft market.Story continuesThe abounding growth prospects of the aforementioned market should also benefit other defense majors that manufacture combat jets, such as Lockheed Martin LMT, Boeing BA and Textron TXT.Lockheed Martin’s Aeronautics segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Its major programs include the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter jet, the C-130 Hercules airlifter, the F-16 Fighting Falcon jet and the F-22 Raptor jet.LMT’s long-term earnings growth rate is 6.2%. Shares of LMT have returned 13.3% value to its investors in the past year.Boeing’s Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s primary products include fixed-wing military aircraft, F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk. The segment also manufactures rotorcraft and rotary-wing programs, such as CH-47 Chinook, AH-64 Apache and V-22 Osprey.Boeing’s long-term earnings growth rate is 4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 sales indicates growth of 17.9% from the 2022 reported figure.Textron’s business unit, Textron Aviation Defense, designs, builds and supports versatile and globally known military aircraft preferred for training and attack missions. Some of Textron’s renowned products include the Beechcraft T-6C trainer and the AT-6 Wolverine.The company boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 11.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 sales indicates growth of 7.2% from the previous year’s reported number.Price MovementIn the past six months, shares of Northrop have lost 1.7% compared with the industry’s decline of 4%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankNorthrop currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

However, a strengthening dollar amid rising jet fuel prices remains a threat to the industry players.Nevertheless, the outlook remains bright for the defense side of the aerospace-defense industry, buoyed by a solid budget proposal. This should keep investors interested in the industry. The frontrunners in the aerospace-defense industry are Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Leidos Holdings.About the IndustryThe Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry comprises companies that primarily design and manufacture heavy-built products like commercial as well as military jets and helicopters, tankers and other combat vehicles, missiles, combatant ships as well as auxiliary ships, submarines, bombs, guns, space transportation vehicles, military satellites and a few more. The industry also includes cyber security players who offer information technology services and C4ISR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) solutions. A portion of its revenues comes from defense contractors offering spare parts, aircraft modification, ship repair and overhaul services and supply chain management services.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Aerospace-Defense IndustryImproved Air Traffic Outlook Boosts Prospects: Recovering global air traffic data in recent times has boosted the near-term growth prospects of the industry. As stated in the latest report published by the IATA, industry-wide global RPK increased 39.1% year over year in May 2023. IATA projects industry-wide RPKs to reach 87.8% of the 2019 level in 2023, with air traffic rising as the year progresses. Such impressive projections bode well for commercial aerospace manufacturers that have long borne the brunt of poor air travel in the form of delayed jet deliveries and, in some cases, cancellation of their orders by airlines.Story continuesExpanding Defense Budget Remains a Growth Catalyst: While the commercial aerospace market has been recovering steadily over the past couple of quarters, the defense side of the industry stood its ground amid the COVID-19 crisis, cushioned by steady government support. To this end, it is imperative to mention that the U.S. fiscal 2024 defense budget request of $842 billion for the Pentagon indicates a 3.2% improvement from the previous year's enacted amount. Such improved budgetary provisions set the stage for industry players focused on the defense business to win more contracts, which is likely to boost their top line.Supply-Chain Issues May Hurt: Significant supply-chain disruption impacted the Aerospace and Defense industry, thanks to pandemic-induced lower aircraft demand and restrictions on the movement of people and goods. This primarily affected small suppliers like aircraft part manufacturers, especially those with heavy exposure to commercial aerospace and the aftermarket business.Although the global economy has started to improve, lingering market disequilibria will likely continue to keep prices high, including that of labor, as estimated by IATA. This, in turn, might constrict the growth trajectory of the U.S. Aerospace and Defense industry, to some extent, in the near term.Strengthening Dollar Adds to Industry Woes: The recently appreciating U.S. dollar is adding another layer of cost to airlines, which are already burdened with high inflation and rising jet fuel prices. The Federal Reserve's policy rate now stands at 5.25% as of May 2023, having started 2022 at 0.25%. All U.S. dollar-denominated costs are rising for airlines, which earn revenues in non-U.S. currency.Similarly, the debt burden has increased for all non-dollar-based entities that have borrowed in dollars. Such a burden on airlines might lead to lower aircraft delivery, thereby hurting aerospace-defense industry players that particularly operate in commercial aerospace.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry is housed within the broaderZacks Aerospace sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #182, which places it in the bottom 27% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates weak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is due to a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts have lost confidence in this group's earnings growth potential over the past few months. The industry's earnings estimate for the current fiscal year has gone down 6.3% to $3.70 per share since Mar 31.Before we present a few aerospace-defense stocks that you may want to add to your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Aerospace-Defense industry has underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite as well as its own sector over the past year. The stocks in this industry have collectively lost 0.4% against the Aerospace sector's growth of 3.8%. The Zacks S&amp;P 500 Composite has gone up 15.1% in the said time frame.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the trailing 12-month EV/Sales ratio, which is used for evaluating capital-intensive stocks like aerospace-defense, the industry is currently trading at 1.78 compared with the S&amp;P 500's 3.56 and the sector's 2.17.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 1.99X, as low as 1.64X, and at the median of 1.88X.3 Aerospace-Defense Stocks to Keep in Your WatchlistLockheed Martin: Based in Bethesda, MD, Lockheed Martin is the largest defense contractor in the world, with its main areas of focus being defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information technology, including cyber security. On Jul 10, 2023, the company revealed that its Patriot Advanced Capability – 3 (PAC-3) Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) interceptor has successfully communicated with the AN/SPY-1 Radar, a key component in the Aegis Weapon System. This takes LMT closer to the integration of PAC-3 MSE with Aegis weapon system, thereby strengthening demand potential for its missile defense system. Lockheed Martin currently boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.2%. The company delivered an average earnings surprise of 7.46% in the last four quarters.  LMT currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Northrop Grumman: Based in Falls Church, VA, Northrop Grumman supplies a broad range of products and services to the U.S. Department of Defense, including electronic systems, information technology, aircraft, space technology and systems integration services. In June 2023, NOC announced that it has conducted a successful flight test of its advanced airborne navigation solution, Embedded Global Positioning System (GPS)/Inertial Navigation System (INS) Modernization, known as EGI-M. This should boost demand for NOC's products in the advanced airborne navigation system space.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company's 2023 sales implies an improvement of 4.7% from the 2022 reported figure. NOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.8%. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Leidos Holdings: Based in Reston, VA, Leidos Holdings is a leading global science and technology company that serves the defense, intelligence, civil and health markets.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Currently, Progress Software has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Ansys has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell). This means that PRGS's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.PRGS currently has a forward P/E ratio of 13.73, while ANSS has a forward P/E of 39.16. We also note that PRGS has a PEG ratio of 6.86. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. ANSS currently has a PEG ratio of 7.83.Another notable valuation metric for PRGS is its P/B ratio of 5.94. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, ANSS has a P/B of 6.10.Story continuesThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to PRGS's Value grade of B and ANSS's Value grade of F.PRGS stands above ANSS thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that PRGS is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

175,8e47a36e-0da6-379f-9a44-c635f5d4eafe,ZION,2023-07-14,Higher Interest Rates to Support Zions (ZION) in Q2 Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/higher-interest-rates-support-zions-145400826.html,1689260040,STORY,['ZION'],"[Zions Bancorporation ZION is slated to report second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 19, after market close. Lending activities gradually waned in the quarter on higher interest rates and a challenging macroeconomic backdrop. Specifically, the demand for commercial and industrial loans (constituting a major portion of Zions’ loan portfolio) was soft in April and May.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s average interest-earning assets for the second quarter is pegged at $84 billion, which indicates a marginal decline from the prior-year quarter’s reported number.Nevertheless, the Federal Reserve continued to tighten its monetary policy, raising interest rates by another 25 basis points during the quarter, while pausing rate hikes in the June FOMC meeting. The policy rate now stands at 5-5.25%.Thus, while the inversion of the yield curve and rising funding costs are expected to have negatively impacted Zions’ net interest margin (NIM) in the second quarter, the company’s net interest income (NII), which is its main revenue component, is expected to have improved on higher rates. The consensus estimate for NII for the second quarter is pegged at $609 million, indicating a year-over-year rise of 2.7%. Our estimate for the metric is $630.1 million, reflecting an increase of 6.3%.The company expects second-quarter NII to decline 7% sequentially, given the hastening of deposit repricing beta and balance sheet changes.Other Key Factors &amp; Estimates for Q2Fee Revenues: The consensus estimate for commercial account fees of $41.88 million implies a year-over-year rise of 13.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for wealth management fees of $14.90 million indicates a rise of 14.6%.The consensus estimate for dividends and other income of $9.06 million indicates a rise of 29.4% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number. We project the metric to rise 57.1% to $11 million.However, the consensus estimate for card fees of $24.57 million suggests a decline of 1.7% from the previous year’s reported figure. Our estimate for card fees is $18.5 million, which implies a year-over-year decline of 26%.The consensus estimate for retail and business banking fees is pegged at $15.96 million, suggesting a 20.2% year-over-year decline. We project the metric to fall 39% to $12.2 million.Subdued volatility across markets and products is likely to have hurt Zions’ capital markets and foreign exchange fees. The consensus estimate for the same is $18.21 million, which reflects a year-over-year decline of 13.3%. Our estimate for the metric is $15 million, indicating a 28.5% fall.The consensus mark for loan-related fees and income is $20.50 million, implying a year-over-year decline of 2.4%. Our estimate for the metric is $14 million, indicating a decline of 33.4%.Thus, due to an expected decline in most of the fee income components, total non-interest income is expected to have fallen in the to-be-reported quarter.

Its revenue of $41 billion was up 34%.Its stock rose more than 3% in pre-market trading.""The US economy continues to be resilient,"" said JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon. ""Consumer balance sheets remain healthy, and consumers are spending, albeit a little more slowly.""Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase. REUTERS/Marco Bello (Marco Bello / reuters)The result kicked off a closely watched earnings season where banks of all sizes will be trying to show that they recovered from one of the most challenging periods for the industry since the 2008 financial crisis.JPMorgan demonstrated its hold over the rest of the industry during the chaos of the spring by winning a government-run auction to purchase the bulk of operations of First Republic after regulators seized the San Francisco lender.First Republic was one of three sizable regional banks to fail, along with Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Their seizures triggered a panic in the banking system and outflows of depositors from a number of smaller banks.First Republic added a net of $2.4 billion in income to JPMorgan in the quarter, the bank said Friday.JPMorgan’s results demonstrated that it is still able to make lots of money from its loans while leaning on its sprawling franchises to generate additional revenue.Its net interest income, which measures the difference between what it charges to make loans and pays for deposits, rose 44% from a year ago to $21.9 billion.Many of its smaller rivals are revising down their expectations of how much net interest income they can earn due to rising deposit costs and high interest rates from the Federal Reserve.JPMorgan’s results, however, do point to some challenges that the entire industry is facing at the moment.It set aside $2.9 billion to cover future loan losses, which were up 163% from a year ago, a sign the bank expects the economy to slow in the coming quarters. Many banks are expected to add more such provisions to their second quarter results.Story continuesThe bank also struggled with trading and a recent drought of deal making that is making day-to-day life more difficult for Wall Street. Its investment banking fees fell by 6% from a year ago to $1.5 billion. Its trading revenues from equities and fixed income also fell.Some of its rivals that depend even more heavily on this revenue, such as Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS), are expected to be particularly challenged by this recent slowdown. They both report results next week.Across the industry, global investment banking revenues for the second quarter fell by 52% from a year ago, according to Dealogic.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Among these, key news was Biogen BIIB and Eisai’s drug Leqembi’s receipt of full FDA approval and Novavax’s NVAX stock price rally on deal amendment with Canada’s government.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories:BIIB’s/ Eisai’s Drug Approval:  Biogen and partner Eisai announced that the FDA has approved the supplemental biologics license application (sBLA), supporting the traditional approval of their Alzheimer’s disease (AD) drug Leqembi. The drug was initially granted accelerated approval for a similar indication in January. The traditional approval is based on data from Eisai’s late-stage global Clarity AD clinical study, wherein Leqembi met its primary endpoint and all key secondary endpoints with statistically significant results and confirmed the clinical benefit of Leqembi.Following the grant of full approval, Leqembi is the first and only approved anti-amyloid antibody treatment shown to reduce the rate of disease progression and slow cognitive impairment in the early and mild dementia stages of AD indication. Since Leqembi has received full/standard approval from the FDA, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will make the medication available for broader coverage under the United States government’s Medicare plan.  However, Biogen’s stock was down despite the approval.NVAX Surges on Canada Agreement: Shares of Novavax, Inc. NVAX surged after it announced that the company has amended its advanced purchase agreement with Canada’s government. Per the terms of the amendment, Canada renounced certain doses of Novavax’s Covid-19 vaccines that were previously scheduled for delivery and reduced the number of vaccine doses due for delivery. Canada’s government also revised the delivery schedule for the remaining vaccine doses that are yet to be delivered. Another clause was added to the agreement, which required Novavax to make use of the Biologics Manufacturing Centre (BMC) Inc. to produce bulk antigen for vaccine doses, which is scheduled for delivery in 2024 and 2025.Story continuesAs compensation for the forfeited vaccine doses, NVAX reported that Canada’s government has agreed to pay it a total sum of $349.6 million. This amount is payable in two equal installments in 2023, the total value of which is equal to the remaining balance owed by the customer concerning such forfeited vaccine doses.The first installment will be made upon execution of the amendment, but the second installment payment has a contingency. It states that the second installment payment will be made only after Novavax delivers the remaining vaccine doses in the second half of 2024. The agreement also grants the government the right to terminate the advanced purchase agreement if NVAX fails to gain regulatory approval for using BMC to produce vaccines on or before Dec 31, 2024.Caribou Up on Pfizer Investment: Shares of leading CRISPR genome-editing biopharmaceutical company, Caribou Biosciences, Inc., CRBU, surged after it received an equity investment from pharma giant Pfizer. Per the terms, Pfizer has purchased 4,690,431 common shares of Caribou for $5.33 per share, resulting in a $25 million equity investment. The transaction, executed on Jun 30, 2023, is part of a Securities Purchase Agreement between the two companies on Jun 29, 2023. Alongside the investment, Pfizer's Sriram Krishnaswami has joined Caribou's Scientific Advisory Board.Caribou is focused on advancing its allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy pipeline, and the infusion of funds from Pfizer's will accelerate these efforts. The company will use the funds to advance CB-011, an immune-cloaked allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy currently under evaluation in the phase 1 study, CaMMouflage, for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (r/r MM).This investment enables Caribou to maintain full ownership and control over its pipeline of allogeneic CAR-T and CAR-NK cell therapies, positioning the company to capitalize on future revenue opportunities. Through this partnership, Pfizer aims to contribute to the progress of Caribou's three programs - ANTLER phase I study for CB-010, the clinical program for CB-011 and submission of an investigational new drug application for CB-012.Caribou currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The candidate is Prothena's groundbreaking anti-tau antibody designed for the potential treatment of Alzheimer's disease. In addition to the exclusive U.S. license optioned in June 2021, Bristol Myers Squibb will now be responsible for the development, manufacturing and commercialization of PRX005.Under the terms of the deal, Bristol Myers Squibb will pay $55 million to Prothena for the worldwide license to PRX005. This payment will further strengthen Prothena's financial position and provide additional resources to advance its robust portfolio of product candidates for AD.

Prothena remains eligible for substantial additional payments, up to $160 million for U.S. rights, up to $110 million for global rights, and up to $1.7 billion for regulatory and commercial milestone payments for a total of up to $2.2 billion, which also includes amounts received to date.Prothena's AD pipeline also includes PRX012, a next-generation antibody targeting amyloid beta, and PRX123, an amyloid beta/tau dual-targeting vaccine.PerformanceThe Nasdaq Biotechnology Index has gained 0.57% in the past five trading sessions.

Carlson had played a starring role in the lawsuit.In a video posted on Twitter in May, Carlson had said he would relaunch his show on the social media platform ""soon"". He released the first episode of his new show, ""Tucker on Twitter"", in June.Fox News retaliated by notifying his legal team, saying that the former prime-time host violated his contract with the network when he launched his own Twitter show, according to an Axios report in June.(Reporting by Samrhitha Arunasalam and Gursimran Kaur in Bengaluru; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar and Varun H K)]"

Supply chain disruptions and other issues caused by these major events in the global arena led to inflationary pressures across the world which demanded strong monetary policy measures from governments. Rising interest rates put a dampener on the stock markets which led to one of the worst years in 2022 for the equity markets since 2008.Of the three major U.S. stock indices, NASDAQ 100 fared the worst, declining more than 30% in 2022 as shareholders withdrew from growth firms due to escalating fears of a recession.

Founded before World War I, IBM became the industry leader in pretty much every market it entered, from early punch-card tabulating systems to electric typewriters to mainframe and personal computers.Investing in Gold Is DumbIBM stock was a fantastic buy-and-hold bet over those many, many decades. Between 1926 and December 2019, IBM created $525.9 billion in shareholder wealth, according to research by Hendrik Bessembinder, a finance professor at the W.P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University. Only seven U.S. stocks generated better returns for shareholders over that span.Alas, times change. IBM ceded ground to any number of peers, some of which now sport trillion-dollar market values. The result? Shares in this long-time Dow stock have been a major disappointment for decades.True, as a member of the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, IBM is a top-notch name for dependable dividend growth. Not only has the company paid consecutive quarterly dividends since 1916, it has increased its payout annually for 28 years and counting.But even after factoring in those reliable and rising dividends, IBM stock has been a massive market laggard for ages.The bottom line on IBM stock?IBM stock chartIBM's 20th century glory days are so much a thing of the past that the stock's performance now lags that of the broader market over pretty much any standardized period you care to measure.Here's the breakdown: IBM stock's all-time annualized total return (price change plus dividends) comes to 5.9%. The S&amp;P 500 generated an annualized total return of 10.1% over the same period.But it doesn't end there. Shares in the tech giant lag the broader market on an annualized total return basis over the past one-, three-, five-, 10-, 15- and 20-year periods too, and usually by wide margins.Story continuesSo it should come as no surprise that if you invested a grand in IBM stock a couple decades ago, you would be seriously unsatisfied with the results today.Have a look at the above chart, and you'll see that if you put $1,000 into IBM stock 20 years ago, it would today be worth just $2,918. Meanwhile, the same sum socked away into the S&amp;P 500 over the past two decades would theoretically be worth $6,653 today.The bottom line? Big Blue has been a big bummer as a buy-and-hold bet in the 21st century.More Stocks of the Past 20 YearsIf You'd Put $1,000 Into Amazon Stock 20 Years Ago, Here's What You'd Have TodayIf You'd Put $1,000 Into Nvidia Stock 20 Years Ago, Here's What You'd Have TodayIf You'd Put $1,000 Into Netflix Stock 20 Years Ago, Here's What You'd Have TodayIf You'd Put $1,000 Into Apple Stock 20 Years Ago, Here's What You'd Have TodayIf You'd Put $1,000 Into Microsoft Stock 20 Years Ago, Here's What You'd Have TodayIf You'd Put $1,000 Into Adobe Stock 20 Years Ago, Here's What You'd Have Today ]"

If you want to skip our industry introduction, then take a look at the Top 5 Big Data Analytics Companies of 2023. Data analytics is all the buzz these days. Advances in computing, technology, and industrialization have expanded business operations by quite a bit and also allowed companies to collect copious amounts of data to generate new insights.This growth in data analytics over the years has also led major semiconductor firms such as Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) to offer two categories of central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs). One set of these are for consumers, primarily for everyday use in laptops and desktops, while the other is used in large scale data centers for enterprise computing. While all big data uses data centers, not all data centers are used for big data analytics since the data that must be stored on a site must exceed 1 Petabyte to be classified as big data.So how big is the big data market? Well, to answer this question we'll have to individually look at its hardware and software constituents. The hardware portion was worth $279 billion last year and is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.3% until 2032 to be worth $656 billion by the end of the forecast period. Within this segment, the information technology segment is the biggest, as it accounts for 35% of the market. Hinting at the importance of big data to the data center market, the hyperscale segment which consists of products that are capable of scaling up data centers to thousands of servers was the biggest product type, controlling 43% of the market.Comparing the data center market with the big data and data analytics market shows that this segment was worth $198 billion in 2020 and it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 13.5% between 2021 and 2030 to be worth $684 billion by then. Off site computing was one of the rare industries that actually boomed during the coronavirus pandemic as businesses were forced to deal with more computing and data due to work from home requirements. Software and services are the biggest portion of this market, and geographically, Asia Pacific is expected to be the fastest growing region, since it is expected to outpace the broader market through a growth rate of 17.5%.Story continuesShifting our focus from the broader industries to the firms that operate in, there are quite a bit of firms that have a presence in the industry. These include firms like Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) which operate on the software side of data analytics and allow companies to consolidate their business data into single platforms to enable data driven insights and decision making. Oracle's big data solutions allow for consolidating large scale data into databases under a variety of languages and parameters through systems such as SQL, Hadoop, Kafka, and Spark. While these are primarily data storage and access platforms, the Oracle big data analytics platform also lets data scientists build and deploy machine learning models that leverage programming languages such as Python.Another firm whose platform is crucial to big data analytics is the technology giant Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Microsoft's Azure is one of the biggest enterprise computing platforms in the industry, and it enables big data analytics under Microsoft's Intelligent Data Platform. Here's what the firm had to say about this platform's capabilities and market performance during its latest earnings call:Our Intelligent Data Platform brings together databases, analytics and governance, so organizations can spend more time creating value and less time integrating their data estate. Cosmos DB is the go-to database, powering the world’s most demanding workloads at any scale. OpenAI relies on Cosmos DB to dynamically scale their ChatGPT service, one of the fastest-growing consumer apps ever, enabling high reliability and low maintenance.The NBA uses Cosmos DB to ingest more than 10 million data points per game, helping teams optimize their gameplay. And we are taking share with our analytics solutions. Companies like BP, Canadian Tire, Marks &amp; Spencer and T-Mobile all rely on our end-to-end analytics to improve speed to insight.Now on to developers.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the top big data and data analytics companies in the world. Some big ticket names are Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc.

PEP has reported robust second-quarter 2023 results, wherein revenues and earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The top and bottom lines also improved year over year. The strong results reflect gains from strength and resilience in its diversified portfolio, modernized supply chain, improved digital capabilities, flexible go-to-market distribution systems, and robust consumer demand trends.The company also gained from the resilience and strength in the global beverage and convenient food businesses.

Adverse currency rates impacted EPS by 2% in the quarter.Net revenues of $22,322 million improved 10.4% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21,609 million.

This marked the seventh straight quarter of double-digit organic revenue growth for the company. The consolidated organic volume was down 2.5%, while effective net pricing improved 15% in the second quarter. Pricing gains were driven by strong realized prices across all segments.Our model had predicted organic revenue growth of 8.9% for the second quarter, with an 11.8% gain from price/mix and a 2.9% decline in volume.Improvements across categories resulted from accelerated growth in the global beverage and convenient food businesses, reflecting strength in its diversified portfolio.

TD Cowen Senior Research Analyst Helane Becker joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the company’s results and what they tell us about both business and leisure travel.Video Transcript- Pent up demand for travel driving Delta earnings to a record high, the airline also boosting its full year guidance. Joining us now is TD Cowen senior research analyst Helane Becker. Now, Helane, you had predicted that they would post record numbers previously. You predicted that for this quarter and even the coming quarter. What's your first takeaway from today's numbers?HELANE BECKER: Thanks for the question. The numbers are very good. Demand is very strong and you see that at airports around not only the United States, but around the world. People really want to make up for lost time and are getting out and traveling. And the fact that they have the ability to do so, not only from a financial perspective but from the time perspective, the fact that they can travel, make almost any weekend a long weekend because of work from anywhere opportunities.- Helane, is this a case across the board, not just Delta? And also, more specifically, the comments that we heard from Ed Bastian when it comes to corporate travel, he is very optimistic that that is going to continue to move to the upside here. What does that growth look like? Are we ever going to get back to those 2019 levels?HELANE BECKER: Yeah, no, I think that's a really fair question, because he mentioned-- and he mentioned on the call this morning, and we've said this before, the US economy is, what, 15 20% bigger now than it was four years ago? So just in terms of the size of the economy, it should drive higher business traffic. It's just there's this hybrid work environment, and when you plan a business trip to go see your clients, it's increasingly difficult because some companies are in the office Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, others are in Tuesday to Thursday. It seems like Friday is a work from anywhere day.Story continuesSo I think it makes travel from a business perspective more difficult. We certainly have seen growth in attendance at conferences. We're pretty much back to 2019 and prior year levels from that perspective. And our view has really been evolving that into this more, yes, we're going to see more business travel. It's just where you're going to see it I think is changing.Small and medium sized companies have never really stopped traveling. It's just the large corporates. Tech, financial services as an example, that have curtailed travel. And I think as your competitors travel, because your travel salespeople travel, as your competitors travel and they win business, I think you'll see people start to get back on the road.- Helane, I want to ask you about just the pricing power. We know fares are much higher. Inflation in general has been sticky, although it's started to cool. Let's talk about the level of fares, where they are, what the risk is. Does Delta still have pricing power heading through the balance of the year? Even, yes, their guidance is strong, but what is the headwind that you see?- Yeah, I think that, again, you guys are really on top of it today with your questions. So I think from a pricing perspective, jet fuel prices have come down off their peaks. They're significantly below where they were a year ago, and that gives the airline some opportunity to cut fares to continue to see strong demand.We're seeing domestic fares come down a little bit on a year on year basis, and although May was up sequentially from April, that kind of makes sense because the summer months start. I guess May through July, especially if you're in the South, schools go back in early to mid August. In the North, schools don't go back until after Labor Day, so you have this elongated season where you can have strong demand that would drive higher prices.Plus, capacity in the New York area. As you guys are probably aware, the Department of Transportation asked the four big airlines serving the market, United, American, Delta, and JetBlue, to cut capacity by 10%, and capacity is already down by 10%. We are not back to 2019 capacity levels, but as I mentioned, the economy has grown and demand is fully back to 2019 levels, or in some days it's above.And so when you think about that and when you think about the ability of airlines to price, intuitively they should be buying more aircraft, but they can't do that because of OEM delivery delays, supply chain issues, and then all the other limitations on growth. There's no place to put planes at the busiest airports.So we've been for the past four or five years talking about more seats per departure and fewer departures per day as the only way you're going to be able to get growth, and now the airlines are starting to talk about that as well. But it generally-- it definitely drives higher revenue in an environment that, if you see a slower economy, you would normally see slower revenue growth or declining revenue.- And Helane, to that point, because Delta did say on the call that they believe that they've reached an inflection point when it comes to costs, but you brought up some of the issues, some of the headwinds that are facing Delta and many of its competitors today. To what degree should investors be worried about those lingering cost issues, given the fact that we are seeing pretty significant delays for some of those aircrafts?HELANE BECKER: Yeah. I think that from that perspective, we're concerned, but not as concerned as we would be if the revenue environment was slightly different. Some of the costs that you see pressure, labor costs obviously have been-- we've been talking about that for a long time, as have you, and we're seeing that percent change should start to abate in 2024. Maintenance, as airlines get new aircraft, you should see a maintenance holiday just because the newer aircraft need less maintenance than older aircraft.So that type of thing should start to-- should start to abate, but the other issues that are out there just in terms of supply chain, labor, it's not so much attracting, it's retaining. Air traffic control has been an issue. We should. There seems to be bipartisan support for an FAA reauthorization bill, which needs to be done before the end of the government's fiscal year. So I think I think there's a lot of good happening that should make '24 a better year, but at least we're hopeful. Maybe hope isn't a strategy, but we're hoping that things improve on the cost side.- All right, Helane Becker, we have to leave it there. TD Cowen, thanks so much for joining us.]"

But a welcome sign for consumers' wallets isn't as straightforward a benefit for US retailers.With retailers largely achieving growth by raising prices for customers as input costs go up, concerns loom over what happens to companies' revenue as inflation cools.The answer to that conundrum depends on the retailer and the mix of products it carries, a Goldman Sachs team of analysts covering retail and consumer brands said during a media roundtable on Wednesday.Wednesday's inflation report showed June prices for food at home grew at their slowest pace since August 2021. In some categories, there was even a decline. Prices for staple food items like eggs and milk are now cheaper than they were a year ago. This will challenge sales at grocery stores that have relied on price increases to drive sales, Goldman analysts said.""We are in somewhat uncharted territory with how much inflation we've actually seen,"" Goldman Sachs managing director Kate McShane said. ""In fact, if you take a look at the sales growth composition of most of our retailers over the last 18 months, it's been driven by ticket inflation. In fact, units for most retailers have been down.""""What it generally means is you see top lines [sales] start to slow,"" McShane said.McShane doesn't expect all companies in the grocery space to take a hit to revenue growth, though. Despite 60% of its business being grocery, Walmart (WMT) is still a top pick from Goldman.""Walmart has been much more focused on price, so they won't be as impacted as some other retailers when it comes to a less inflationary environment,"" McShane said. ""They also have been getting solid traffic to their stores as they have taken market share.""Target (TGT), which sells some groceries, offers 40% consumable goods and 60% discretionary, per Goldman's analysis. Last quarter, the retailer warned of ""softness"" in its discretionary business. But the slowdown in price increases could help solve that problem, per McShane.Story continues""I can't help but think that Target is a little excited that this inflation is dissipating because the whole hope is that some of those dollars that get freed up from food go back to discretionary,"" McShane said. ""And for Target, that's huge because the margin in discretionary, especially in apparel and home, [is higher] than it is for food and beverage.""June prices for food at home grew at their slowest pace since August 2021. REUTERS/Sarah Silbiger (Sarah Silbiger / reuters)Elsewhere in retail, inflation might be stickier. McShane noted that home improvement goods and auto parts aren't likely to see prices ""take a step back.""And suppliers to retailers may continue to raise their prices even as inflation slows. Goldman Sachs managing director Jason English covers companies like Campbell Soup (CPB), General Mills (GIS), and Kraft Heinz (KHC). He noted historical analysis indicates packaged foods prices rarely decline after periods of high inflation.Josh is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.Click here for the latest economic news and economic indicators to help you in your investing decisionsRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

The da Vinci System is powered by robotic technology that has provided the company with solid exposure to medical mechatronics, robotics and AI for the healthcare space.On ISRG’s first-quarter 2023 earnings call in April, the installed base of the da Vinci system grew approximately 12% year over year. The utilization of clinical systems in the field, measured by procedures per system, was up 13% from the prior-year quarter’s level.Progress on the AI Front: We are also positive about the growing adoption of minimally-invasive robot-assisted surgeries, self-automated home-based care, the use of information technology for quick and improved patient care, and the shift of the payment system to a value-based model. These indicate the high prevalence of AI in the MedTech space.Story continuesPer management, the rise of medical mechatronics, powerful computing, improved sensing, microfabrication and molecular imaging has enabled new solutions to old problems. AI has been enhancing Intuitive Surgical’s product portfolio with clinical applications, diagnostic support, operational efficiency, electronic health record systems, practice workflows and supply chain management.Strong Q1 Results: The company’s solid first-quarter 2023 results also buoy our optimism. The company witnessed continued growth in da Vinci procedure volume during the quarter.DownsidesRisk of Procedure Adoption: Intuitive Surgical faces the risk of adoption of its procedures. This is because adoption growth takes time, as each procedure needs to gain credibility. Furthermore, the wide use of the company’s products requires training of surgical teams. Market acceptance could be delayed by the time required to complete such trainings.Stiff Competition: Since the launch of its flagship device, the da Vinci System, in 2000, Intuitive Surgical used to enjoy a monopoly in the market for robots used in abdominal surgery. However, the competition for ISRG intensified following the regulatory approval of Transenterix's surgical robot for abdominal surgery in 2017.Estimate TrendIntuitive Surgical is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 3.8% north to $5.47 per share.The consensus mark for the company’s second-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $1.73 billion, indicating a 13.8% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

202,d447beb3-3dfe-36ec-8bca-7c1b1a08063c,WRK,2023-07-14,3 Stocks to Snag for Less Than Book Value,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-snag-less-book-141001036.html,1688739001,STORY,"['L', 'VTRS', 'WRK']","[The move to share repurchases over the last few years has made the price-to-book ratio less reliable for finding hidden opportunities in stocks.How’s that, you ask?If a company repurchases shares at a price higher than its current book value per share, it lowers the book value per share. For example, if Company A trades at $20 and its book value per share is $10, and its management buys back its shares, the book value falls below $10. Let’s say $9.50 for simplicity’s sake.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNow, if its earnings per share were $2, and the share repurchase boosts the EPS to $2.10 due to fewer shares outstanding, the return on equity jumps from 20.0% ($2/$10) to 22.1% ($2.10/$9.50).So, if you’re screening for stocks with return on equity ratios above 21%, the share repurchase makes the stock eligible, whereas, before the repurchases, it wouldn’t have met the criteria. It’s something to remember when you’re looking to snag undervalued stocks. However, to avoid being fooled by share repurchases, I’ll screen for S&amp;P 500 stocks below a price-to-book ratio of 1, but I’ll also consider the stock’s free cash flow yield. If it’s above 4% — free cash flow for trailing 12 months divided by enterprise value (you can use market capitalization) — it’s worthy of consideration.    Loews (L)Stacks of coins with trading graph, quantitative finance investment conceptSource: Tendo / ShutterstockMy first selection is Loews (NYSE:L), a holding company controlled by the Tisch family. Its stock hasn’t fared very well in recent years. However, from Dec. 31, 1999, through July 5, 2023, it’s got a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.7%, 195 basis points higher than the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) over the same 23.5 years.Loews is a smaller version of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) with an enterprise value of $22.1 billion, less than 4% of Warren Buffett’s behemoth. Loews currently has a P/B of 0.94x, about two-thirds of Berkshire’s ratio. It has four large investments, three of which are private companies: Boardwalk Pipelines (energy), Loews Hotels (consumer discretionary), Altium Packaging (industrials), while the fourth is a 90.1% interest in CNA Financial (NYSE:CNA) (financial), a property and casualty insurance company based in Chicago. Story continuesIn addition to the four investment vehicles, it has $3.1 billion in cash and equity investments on its balance sheet, offset by $2.3 billion in debt. So, Loews currently has a $13.6 billion market cap. Subtract the net cash of $800 million, and we’re down to $12.8 billion. CNA’s market cap is $10.5 billion, which values the holding company’s 90% stake at $9.5 billion, which suggests the three private businesses are collectively worth $3.3 billion. Its trailing 12-month free cash flow is $2.9 billion [cash flow]. Based on an enterprise value of $22.1 billion, Loews has a free cash flow yield of 13.1%. I consider anything above 8% to be value territory.In this case, the sum of the parts is worth far more than its current market cap.    Viatris (VTRS)pharmaceutical industry. Production line machine conveyor with glass bottles ampoules at factorySource: Dmitry Kalinovsky / Shutterstock.comI recently included Viatris (NASDAQ:VTRS) in an article about stocks ready to rally under new CEOs. The pharmaceutical company was created through the  November 2020 merger of Pfizer’s (NYSE:PFE) Upjohn business, and Mylan N.V. Scott Smith was hired as its CEO on April 1. Smith’s 10 years at Celgene include leading the development of Otezla, a blockbuster drug to treat psoriasis.   As I said in my article, VTRS stock has lost 37% since the merger. As a result, its P/B is 0.57x, about one-seventh the average S&amp;P 500 stock. This makes it one of those hidden opportunities in stocks.Its legacy drugs include Lipitor, Norvasc, Celebrex, Zoloft, and Viagra. They generated $2.42 billion in Q1 2023 revenue. That’s approximately 65% of its overall revenue for the quarter. Generic drugs accounted for another 31%, with biosimilars accounting for 4%.That’s the good news. The bad news is that revenues were 6% lower in the first quarter than last year, leading to a 17% decline in adjusted net earnings year-over-year to $933 million. However, it’s got three billion-dollar-a-year franchises that it’s building, so the future remains very bright. With a trailing 12-month free cash flow of $2.3 billion and an enterprise value of $30.2 billion, its free cash flow yield of 7.6% is on the cusp of value territory. At the very least, you’re unlikely to get hosed on a long-term bet on Viatris stock.WestRock (WRK)Image of computer servers lined up in a dark roomSource: Gorodenkoff/Shutterstock.comWestRock (NYSE:WRK) provides fiber-based packaging solutions to many end-users from over 300 production facilities worldwide. In October 2021, WestRock reorganized into four reportable segments: Corrugated Packaging (49% of revenue), Consumer Packaging (24%), Global Paper (22%), and Distribution (5%). This is an example of one of those hidden opportunities in stocks.The company is in the middle of executing its portfolio optimization strategy. As part of this rightsizing, it announced on May 2 that it would close its paper mill in North Charleston, South Carolina. Its last production day is Aug. 31. Approximately 500 people worked at the mill. Upon shutdown, Westrock will no longer produce unbleached saturating kraft paper. As a result of its strategy, WestRock lost $2.0 billion in Q2 2023, most of the loss from a $1.9 billion pre-tax non-cash goodwill impairment. Excluding these one-time items, it made $198 million on $5.28 billion in sales, down from an adjusted net income of $309.4 million a year earlier on $5.38 billion in sales.“Closing our North Charleston mill is another step in our ongoing portfolio optimization strategy. We are accelerating our efforts to streamline our operations and drive growth in the most attractive markets,” stated CEO David B. Sewell. WRK trades at 0.75x book, its lowest multiple in the past decade. Based on its trailing 12-month free cash flow of $855.5 million and an enterprise value of $16.4 billion, it has a free cash flow yield of 5.2%. I consider anything between 4% and 8% in fair value territory. This makes it one of those hidden opportunities in stocks.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

203,834a4292-f6ac-3fcd-92fc-830b2f26ccae,CSX,2023-07-14,Do CSX's (NASDAQ:CSX) Earnings Warrant Your Attention?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/csxs-nasdaq-csx-earnings-warrant-110034947.html,1689332434,STORY,['CSX'],"[The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like CSX (NASDAQ:CSX), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide CSX with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. See our latest analysis for CSX How Quickly Is CSX Increasing Earnings Per Share?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. CSX managed to grow EPS by 15% per year, over three years. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. While we note CSX achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 15% to US$15b. That's a real positive.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of CSX's forecast profits?Are CSX Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$69b company like CSX. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$189m. This comes in at 0.3% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Story continuesIt's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? Well, based on the CEO pay, you'd argue that they are indeed. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like CSX, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$12m.CSX's CEO took home a total compensation package worth US$9.4m in the year leading up to December 2022. That comes in below the average for similar sized companies and seems pretty reasonable. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making.Is CSX Worth Keeping An Eye On?One positive for CSX is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. The growth of EPS may be the eye-catching headline for CSX, but there's more to bring joy for shareholders. With company insiders aligning themselves considerably with the company's success and modest CEO compensation, there's no arguments that this is a stock worth looking into. We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 1 warning sign for CSX that you need to be mindful of.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features.

Company's numerous buyouts and alliances paved the way for long-term growth and consistently drove its revenues.Constant investments in technology are solidifying its position in the payments market. Higher cross-border volumes are boosting the company's results. A shift in payments to the digital mode is a boon for Visa. Steady domestic volumes and transactions rise will aid the firm to boost its top line in the future. A strong cash position enables it to boost shareholder value.However, high operating expenses stress its margins. Ramped-up client incentives will dent the top line.

Mounjaro sales are already benefiting from strong demand trends. However, the CRL for donanemab will probably delay the potential launch of the candidate.Generic competition for several drugs, rising pricing pressure in the United States and some international markets are some top-line headwinds.

Increased consumption of media, music and news over the web, triggered by the work-and-learn-at-home wave, has been a key catalyst for industry participants like News Corporation NWSA, World Wrestling Entertainment WWE, Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF.A) and IMAX Corporation IMAX. Companies have been focusing on a superior product strategy and prudent capital investments. Steady recovery in the advertising spending environment and resumption of production pipelines bode well for film and television production companies.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Film and Television Production and Distribution industry comprises companies involved in film and TV production, distribution and exhibition. The main activities of the industry participants include the production and distribution of entertainment content to theaters, TV networks, video-on-demand platforms, streaming services and other exhibitors. Imax offers entertainment technology and specializes in motion picture technologies and presentations. Industry participants produce and distribute motion pictures for theatrical and straight-to-video releases besides TV programming. These players are heavily dependent on the box-office performance of their films, both domestically and internationally, the number of film releases, and the ratings of TV shows.3 Film and Television Production Industry Trends in FocusOver-the-Top Services Gaining Prominence: Companies involved in content creation are looking to distribute content through over-the-top services to leverage the popularity of their franchises. With this, they are looking to provide exclusive content and a differentiated experience. However, streaming companies are increasingly producing original and award-winning feeds to reduce licensing costs and excessive dependence on third-party content providers. This is likely to hurt industry participants’ content distribution strategy.Story continuesBinge-Watching Driving Consumption: Factors such as binge-watching, deepening Internet penetration, and advancement in mobile, video, and wireless technologies have got viewers glued to small screens. In order to keep pace with new consumption patterns, industry participants are turning to digital content distribution. The emergence of digital capabilities is making consumer data easily available to companies. With the use of AI tools, production houses are gaining a better understanding of user preferences. This helps them produce content that strikes a chord with viewers. However, increasing spending on content and sales &amp; marketing is hurting profitability due to stiff competition from streaming players.Technological Advancement Aids Prospects: Exhibitors are turning to highly efficient and cost-effective technologies like laser-based projection systems to enhance image quality and the entire movie experience. Additionally, the use of technologies like motion seating, immersive audio systems and interactive movies among others is expected to enhance the viewing experience. The increasing adoption of AR and VR technologies bodes well for industry participants. However, the evolution of alternative motion picture distribution channels such as home video, pay-per-view, streaming services, video-on-demand, Internet and syndicated and broadcast television is hurting exhibitors.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Film and Television Production and Distribution industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector.

216,c63b984b-5f7a-3cbe-945e-8c6966f43d11,SNA,2023-07-14,Snap-On (SNA) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/snap-sna-earnings-expected-grow-140056751.html,1689256856,STORY,['SNA'],"[The market expects Snap-On (SNA) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 20. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis tool and diagnostic equipment maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $4.53 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +6.1%.Revenues are expected to be $1.18 billion, up 4.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.42% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Snap-On?For Snap-On, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.59%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Snap-On will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Snap-On would post earnings of $4.14 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.60, delivering a surprise of +11.11%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Snap-On appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

221,3013787c-2468-3543-8e05-dd3046370319,VZ,2023-07-14,Thousands of lead-covered cables found across U.S.: Report,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/thousands-lead-covered-cables-found-173229490.html,1689269549,VIDEO,"['VZ', 'T', 'T-PA']","[Across the United States, there are more than 2,000 lead-covered cables that could potentially pose a health risk to people who live nearby, according to The Wall Street Journal. Thomas Gryta, one of The Wall Street Journal's reporters who worked on the story, tells Yahoo Finance Live what his team uncovered in its investigation.Video Transcript- A new report is raising concerns about the safety of forgotten telecom wires. A new study from the Wall Street Journal, found over 2000 lead-covered cables in the five most densely populated states across the US, some underwater and some aerial. One of the reporters behind the study, Thomas Greider, joins us now. Thomas, great reporting on this. Just help us break this down further, what did you guys uncover?THOMAS GREIDER: Thanks for having me on. Yeah, that's right, we uncovered-- sad that companies have left thousands of these cables around. They're coated in a thick sheath of lead as a protectant for them, and they are crossed often-- many that we found were in waterways so left there-- they won't get better over time, they deteriorate, and our testing showed that they're actually leaching lead, which can be a problem for workers or just people who are recreating anywhere these things are located.- Thomas, I'm curious as a fellow journalist, I'm always curious in the procedural of all of this. Obviously, lead has been a problem in the US for decades, that we have made enormous strides to cleaning up. What led you guys to look into this in the first place?THOMAS GREIDER: It was-- I covered telecommunications for years on the corporate side, and understood how the networks worked pretty well, and frankly when I heard about lead, I was like, what-- how is this-- this is not lead and phones, but sure enough, our research showed that this was something that was once the standard technology.And as we searched, it was really a piece by piece, we would get one thing and we would go on to the next. We do some testing, and really not expect to see anything, and actually find things. And so we kept going, and we worked with lot of experts that really guided what they were doing, what we were doing, and we were with them at all times. And it really was-- we were really surprised as this was going along, what we found.Story continues- Are you finding that any of the companies that have left these cables behind are having any efforts to try and course correct, or just go get them back, or I don't know what you do, and how you go about reacquiring these things.THOMAS GREIDER: So-- that's a good question. So you-- there are ways to remove, especially aerial cable, where it's a little easier to take it down because you can secure the area and wind it back onto trucks. There are very complicated procedures that companies can follow, but of course they-- this is not something that people have really looked at.And so I think the companies are very much saying they don't believe that it's a public health threat and that they believe they're following the practices that they're supposed to be following in the industry overall, a signal that they want to find a solution, or they want to work together to solve this problem, if it is, in fact, a problem in their eyes. According to what we found, there does seem to be a problem here. And the scope of it is not entirely clear.- Well, Thomas, I guess then the next step would be to figure out what the scope of the problem is. Not just to figure out where these cables are, but to figure out if indeed they have had an effect, right, I mean, you did-- the research that you had conducted did detect lead in soil samples, in water samples, et cetera. Is there then a move to test people who are around these sites, for example, to figure out if they have had lead exposure?THOMAS GREIDER: So we actually did work with some people who had tests done. And we did in some areas find that there did appear to be higher exposure to lead. And that is obviously-- the concern is unleashing. Lead is relatively stable. It's when you disturb it that it can become a problem. And so if it is readily available and people are around it, that's obviously a concern.- Thomas, thank you so much for being here. Really great series, great work by the Wall Street Journal. Thomas Greider and his team over there, encourage everyone to check it out. Thank you.THOMAS GREIDER: Thank you. Stay tuned.]"

(VZ) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-communications-inc-vz-trending-130013963.html,1689253213,STORY,['VZ'],"[Verizon Communications (VZ) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this largest U.S. cellphone carrier have returned -2.4%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Wireless National industry, which Verizon falls in, has gained 1.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Verizon is expected to post earnings of $1.17 per share, indicating a change of -10.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.69 points to a change of -9.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.69 indicates a change of -0.1% from what Verizon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Verizon is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Verizon, the consensus sales estimate of $33.53 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -0.8%. The $135.08 billion and $136.75 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -1.3% and +1.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVerizon reported revenues of $32.91 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.9%. EPS of $1.20 for the same period compares with $1.35 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $33.71 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.36%. The EPS surprise was +0.84%.Over the last four quarters, Verizon surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Verizon is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Verizon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And I think that says a lot about Amazon (AMZN) and the broader tech industry at the moment.Adobe Analytics said that across both days, $12.7 billion was spent online in the US — representing 6.1% growth year over year. Amazon put out a press release using the word ""ever"" two times in the headline (a pet peeve of this journalist) to hype up its performance.All in all, people spent money this week. Amazon probably gained some new Prime members, which will open the door for them to spend more money on Amazon this holiday season.Great.But who cares about Prime Day when it's stacked up against a game-changing year for tech? I mean, really.Nvidia (NVDA) is pushing the AI revolution forward with its powerful new chips. AMD (AMD) CEO Dr. Lisa Su blew me away when she described what's next with her company's own generative AI chips.Then we have Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) going head to head on AI product releases. Did I mention Microsoft is about to own Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard? Huge deal. Broadcom (AVGO) also moved closer this week to securing its deal for VMWare (VMW). Huge deal.ChatGPT continues to capture everyone's attention.And Meta Platforms (META) is powering ahead with AI while also stealing millions of users from Elon Musk's Twitter. I was impressed by what Meta is working on when chatting with top exec Nicola Mendelsohn at Cannes.Meanwhile, Apple's (AAPL) new $1,000 plus AR/VR goggles could usher in a new wave of human interaction. And the company is now worth over $3 trillion.Story continuesYet, we have Amazon Prime Day in the summer.""Yes, Amazon has become boring in the tech space because while their core business is good (obviously) they aren't innovating the way we’re used to,"" Sevens Report Research founder Tom Essaye quipped to me via email. Tom is right.Andrew Ross Sorkin speaks with Amazon CEO Andy Jassy during the New York Times DealBook Summit in the Appel Room at the Jazz At Lincoln Center on November 30, 2022 in New York City. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) (Michael M. Santiago via Getty Images)What was the last big innovation you have seen from Amazon? Alexa?It's certainly not the consumer-facing website, which increasingly looks like an overrun flea market.What's the deal with Whole Foods? I am an avid shopper and love the fish department. But I go in there and leave every single time thinking how Amazon has basically done nothing to reinvent this brand and the industry with a major innovation.Under CEO Andy Jassy, all investors have been rewarded with are headlines on layoffs and less-than-amazing top- and bottom-line growth.The stock price has lagged too — shares are down about 17% compared to a gain of around 9% for the Nasdaq since Jassy started in early July 2021. Over the last five years, Amazon stock is trailing the Nasdaq by over 30 percentage points.Now, none of this is to say that boring can't be wildly profitable for Amazon. The company's web services cloud business will get its fair share of business as workloads powered by AI tools demand more capacity.""We are likely on the precipice of an explosion in AI workload growth in the 2H as GPU capacity comes online, with incremental workload growth here more than offsetting the workloads that have been taken out of the system through the current rationalization cycle,"" Deutsche Bank's Lee Horowitz said in a recent note. ""Importantly, our checks here leave us confident that AWS will accrue more than its fair share of these workloads/dollars, supporting meaningful revenue growth reacceleration into 2024.""Point well taken.But to really get Amazon's stock and brand back in sizzling territory — where its peers reside — the company's culture of innovation has to resurface.""Bottom line, they haven't innovated recently the way we're used to,"" Essaye said.And this innovation needs to show up not just internally, but externally for consumers and investors to see.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Supply chain disruptions and other issues caused by these major events in the global arena led to inflationary pressures across the world which demanded strong monetary policy measures from governments. Rising interest rates put a dampener on the stock markets which led to one of the worst years in 2022 for the equity markets since 2008.Of the three major U.S. stock indices, NASDAQ 100 fared the worst, declining more than 30% in 2022 as shareholders withdrew from growth firms due to escalating fears of a recession. You can read more about this in our last episode of the 12 best most active stocks to buy now, published in late December.The indices have since recovered most of their losses in 2023 as interest rate increases have slowed down and fears of a hard landing have tapered off. The NASDAQ 100 index is at the forefront of the stock market recovery as the index is already 39% up year-to-date with multiple constituents of the index benefiting from the AI boom. The chipmaker NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI revolution and has seen a massive 195% surge in its share prices year-to-date, surpassing the trillion dollar mark for market capitalization.The sentiment in the stock markets also turned bullish on July 12 following the release of latest CPI figures which proved to be better than expectations. In June, the CPI rose 3% y-o-y as compared to an expectation of a 3.1% increase.

If you want to skip the detailed analysis of Robbins’ net worth, performance and investment philosophy, go directly to Top 5 Stocks in Larry Robbins' Portfolio.Founded in 2000 by billionaire investor Larry Robbins, Glenview Capital Management has evolved to become one of the most successful hedge funds on Wall Street.

The hedge fund outperformed the average hedge funds and the S&amp;P 500 index in 2010, with a 15.7% return. However, Glenview Capital had a rough year in 2008, when it lost about half of its assets, which were worth $9 billion at the time, and trailed the market. Glenview Capital plunged about 50% in 2008, but it seems to have recovered since then. The fund soared 82.7% in 2009.Robbins has been a major force behind Glenview Capital management's stellar performance, given his vast experience in the hedge fund industry that spans over two decades. He stands out as a reputable money manager capable of holding positions in high-value sectors and companies. The solid performance stems from the hedge fund's investment strategy, commonly related to growth at a reasonable price (GARP). The strategy focuses on companies with strong growth prospects but highly undervalued. It also focuses on companies in predictable industries with steady and recurring revenue streams. Additionally, Glenview Capital Management stays clear of companies with high leverage, low margins, or those facing regulatory risks. Larry Robbins’ current net worth is $1.9 billion.Additionally, the hedge fund is not sector specific. It has diversified its holdings into various segments. Some of its biggest investments are in healthcare, with stakes in hospital chains Tenet Healthcare and HCA Healthcare. Glenview has also diversified its holdings into Industrials. Robbins made profitable bets on healthcare stocks in 2012, which he said were boosted by Obamacare. The hedge fund maintained its strong performance in the next years, with an 84% return in 2013. Robbins resumed his investments in health and travel stocks in mid-2020, because these sectors became more relevant due to the pandemic. His long-term healthcare bets paid off in 2021, when his hedge fund gained 10.3%, while his main fund that focused on healthcare rose 21.1% for the year.Story continuesLarry Robbins Net Worth, Performance and Portfolio.Larry Robbins of Glenview CapitalIn the race to unlock optimum value from its holdings in divergent sectors, Glenview Capital Management also engages in shareholder activism and influences corporate decisions.

236,7ac72fd8-f6e9-3ff1-9fb0-9d9bf1f51162,TRV,2023-07-14,Analysts Estimate Travelers (TRV) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-travelers-trv-report-140045361.html,1689256845,STORY,['TRV'],"[The market expects Travelers (TRV) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 20, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.27 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -11.7%.Revenues are expected to be $10.11 billion, up 9.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.82% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Travelers?For Travelers, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +3.74%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Travelers will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Travelers would post earnings of $3.64 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.11, delivering a surprise of +12.91%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Travelers doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:APD) and were rewarded last week after stock increased 4.2%",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-investors-control-85-air-110056117.html,1689332456,STORY,['APD'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Air Products and Chemicals' stock price is sensitive to their trading actions51% of the business is held by the top 22 shareholders Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a businessA look at the shareholders of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 85% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).And things are looking up for institutional investors after the company gained US$2.7b in market cap last week. One-year return to shareholders is currently 36% and last week’s gain was the icing on the cake.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Air Products and Chemicals. See our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Air Products and Chemicals?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Air Products and Chemicals already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Air Products and Chemicals, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Air Products and Chemicals. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.4%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 6.6% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.8% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 22 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Air Products and ChemicalsThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$221m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 14% stake in Air Products and Chemicals. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company.

Fueling of the vehicles will begin next week.Myron Keehn, President and CEO of Edmonton Airports, including Edmonton International Airport, made the announcement today during a luncheon with Toyota Canada, where they unveiled plans to partner to create the Province's first hydrogen fuel cell passenger vehicle fleet.""Air Products is proud to support Edmonton International Airport in this first-mover project to establish the first passenger hydrogen fuel cell vehicle fleet in Alberta,"" said Eric Guter, Air Products' Global Vice President, Hydrogen for Mobility. ""Access to clean hydrogen fueling infrastructure is key to the energy transition and efforts to decarbonize transportation. Air Products' innovative and efficient mobile fuelers will accelerate the use of hydrogen as an emissions-free transportation fuel as permanent hydrogen infrastructure is built in Western Canada.""Earlier this year, Air Products announced plans to build the first commercial-scale hydrogen refueling station in Edmonton. The multi-modal station, which will serve heavy-duty and light duty vehicles will be located near Air Products' net-zero hydrogen energy complex under construction in Edmonton.Story continuesThe new Edmonton station, scheduled to open in 2025, will include two hydrogen refueling lanes with dispensers for heavy-duty vehicles such as commercial and municipal trucks, and Air Products' own truck fleet. In addition, the station also will have two fueling positions for light-duty hydrogen fuel cell cars. The hydrogen refueling station is supported in part by $1 million (CAD) in funding from Natural Resources Canada's Zero Emission Vehicle Infrastructure Program.Air Products works across all facets of the hydrogen value chain, including production, distribution, storage and dispensing and has been a pioneer in hydrogen fueling for decades.The company operates the world's largest hydrogen pipeline system, located in the U.S. Gulf Coast, and is a world-class liquid hydrogen supplier. Air Products has hands-on operating experience with over 250 hydrogen fueling station projects in 20 countries and the company's technologies are used in over 1.5 million fueling operations annually.""With abundant natural resources and a collaborative approach between government and business, Canada is well-positioned to be a global leader in the clean energy future,"" said Rachel Smith, Air Products Vice President and General Manager, Canada. ""We are proud to build on Air Products' investment in the Edmonton region that will help accelerate the use of hydrogen as an emissions-free transportation fuel across western Canada.""Air Products has invested heavily in the Edmonton region and is currently building a transformative new $1.6 billion (CAD) net-zero hydrogen energy complex. The hydrogen production complex will use an advanced process technology that enables the cost-effective capture of more than 90 percent of carbon emissions for permanent sequestration safely underground. The facility will also include a world-scale hydrogen liquefaction facility which will help to accelerate the use of hydrogen as emission-free transportation fuel across western Canada. In addition, to avoid the indirect emissions associated with using grid electrical power, the project includes a 100 percent hydrogen-fueled power generation unit that has the capability to export clean power to Alberta's grid.The complex also will be integrated with neighboring Imperial Oil Limited's new renewable diesel facility, using innovative engineering. Imperial will produce renewable diesel from locally sourced non-petroleum feedstocks, using a process that produces a biogenic renewable off-gas (ROG) by-product. This ROG will be used as a feedstock within the Air Products hydrogen complex, displacing natural gas and further enhancing the overall carbon emissions profile. The combination of utilizing a renewable feedstock and power export more than offset any emissions not directly captured to produce hydrogen on a net-zero basis.This new production facility adds to Air Products' presence in Edmonton. Air Products already operates three hydrogen production facilities, as well as a 55-kilometer hydrogen pipeline supplying customers in industries including refining, petrochemical and others.About Air ProductsAir Products (NYSE: APD) is a world-leading industrial gases company in operation for over 80 years focused on serving energy, environmental, and emerging markets.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 20, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis auto and industrial parts distributor is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.31 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +5%.Revenues are expected to be $5.95 billion, up 6.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.35% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Genuine Parts?For Genuine Parts, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.79%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Genuine Parts will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Genuine Parts would post earnings of $2.02 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.14, delivering a surprise of +5.94%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Genuine Parts appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It’s typically a positive sign to see these increases that suggest that the company is performing well and has a solid foundation to sustain growth.Stocks that have a strong dividend track belong to mature companies, are less susceptible to large swings in the market and act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. These stocks possess superior fundamentals such as a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics that make them promising investments for the long term.Yesterday, two auto players, trucking giant PACCAR PCAR and leading truck engine maker Cummins CMI announced payout hikes. Not only do these stocks have an impressive dividend track record, their payout also appears affordable and safe based on the stocks’ prospects.A Look at PCAR &amp; CMI’s Dividend HistoryPACCAR boasts an uninterrupted streak of paying dividends since 1941. For numerous years, the company has consistently provided annual dividends, encompassing both regular quarterly dividends and additional cash dividends, amounting to approximately 50% of its net income. Over the past two decades, PACCAR's shareholder returns have surpassed the performance of the S&amp;P 500 index.Yesterday, PCAR boosted its quarterly cash dividend by 8% to 27 cents a share. The dividend will be paid out on Sep 7 to shareholders as of Aug 17, 2023. The company has increased its dividend eight times in the past five years, and its payout has grown 4.8% over the same time period. PCAR's payout ratio is currently 15% of earnings. The current dividend yield of the company is 1.16%.(Check PACCAR’s dividend history here).PACCAR Inc. Dividend Yield (TTM)PACCAR Inc. Dividend Yield (TTM)PACCAR Inc. dividend-yield-ttm | PACCAR Inc.

The dividend will be paid out on Sep 7 to shareholders as of Aug 25, 2023. The current dividend yield of the company is 2.44%. CMI increased its dividend six times in the past five years, and its payout has grown 7.42% over the same time period.

Dividend Yield (TTM)Cummins Inc. dividend-yield-ttm | Cummins Inc. QuoteFor those interested in reaping income from their investments, let’s take a closer look at both the stocks.PACCARPACCAR is one of the leading names in the trucking business, with reputed brands like Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF. The DAF lineup, comprising XF and XG models (launched in 2021) and the XD model (launched in 2022), augurs well. The company’s new launches have improved the product mix.PACCAR derives the bulk of its revenues from truck sales. Continued growth in the aftermarket parts — which is a high margin and a less cyclic business — thanks to the rampant adoption of its proprietary MX engine also bodes well. High truck utilization and increased average fleet age are positively impacting PACCAR Parts’ results. An expanding network of parts distribution centers, dealer locations and independent TRP stores, along with managed dealer inventory and innovative e-commerce systems, is aiding the PACCAR Parts segment’s prospects.Investment in advanced technologies offers growth visibility. At the CES 2023, Transportation Hall, PACCAR displayed a battery-powered Peterbilt 579EV, a hydrogen fuel-cell Kenworth T680E and a Peterbilt autonomous Model 579. PACCAR’s Peterbilt Model 579 equipped with the Aurora self-driving system strengthens its portfolio of next-gen offerings. The Kenworth T680E battery-electric truck and Peterbilt 579EV showcase PACCAR’s commitment to providing emissions-free commercial vehicles. Accelerated efforts toward electrification, connected vehicle services and advanced driver-assistance system options are set to bolster PACCAR’s prospects.PACCAR’s strong balance sheet is complemented by A+ and A1 credit ratings assigned by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's, respectively. The company's total debt-to-capital ratio stands at 0.46, lower than its industry's 0.62. The low leverage increases its financial flexibility to tap into growth opportunities.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 sales and EPS implies year-over-year growth of 15.6% and 36.5%, respectively. PCAR surpassed earnings in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 16.6%. The company has a VGM Score of A.CumminsCummins is the largest engine producer in the world and maintains a diverse global footprint. Its commitment to moving toward a carbon-neutral future is commendable. Impressive product portfolio, strong geographic diversification and broad global distribution network boost its long-term prospects. The company's leadership in key technologies for zero tailpipe emissions in commercial and industrial applications, and additional efforts to strengthen its foothold in the domain augur well.Cummins is making significant strides in inorganic growth through the acquisitions of Jacobs Vehicle Systems, Meritor and the Siemens Commercial Vehicles business. The buyout of Meritor has positioned Cummins as a leading provider of integrated powertrain solutions across internal combustion and electric power applications. The Hydrogenic Corp. buyout, investment in Loop Energy and partnership with NPROXX have expanded Cummins’ fuel cell and hydrogen-processing technology capabilities. The introduction of a 15-liter natural gas engine for heavy-duty trucks is a key part in Cummins’ path to a green energy future and offers growth visibility.Cummins’ total debt-to-capital ratio stands at a manageable 0.42. As part of its commitment to increasing shareholder value, Cummins sticks to its plan of returning nearly 50% of its operating cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, which is commendable.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 sales and EPS implies year-over-year growth of 17% and 31%, respectively. The consensus mark for CMI’s 2024 EPS is pegged at $20.27, implying growth of 2.4% year over year. The company has a VGM Score of A.Bottom LineDividends provide a solid level of reassurance to investors. Typically, companies boost payouts when the business is fruitful and they’re confident in their prospects. PCAR and CMI are sound investments in the auto space to rev up your portfolio returns.

(AP) — Disney asked a Florida judge on Friday to toss out a lawsuit against the company’s efforts to neutralize a takeover of Disney World’s governing district by Gov. Ron DeSantis and his appointees.The case in state court in Orlando is one of two stemming from the takeover, which was retaliation for the company’s public opposition to the so-called Don’t Say Gay legislation championed by DeSantis and Republican lawmakers. Disney is fighting DeSantis in one lawsuit and his Disney World board appointees in another.The governor has touted his yearlong feud with Disney in his run for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, often accusing the entertainment giant of being too “woke.” Disney has accused the governor of violating its free speech rights.Attorneys for Disney argued before Circuit Judge Margaret Schreiber that any decision in state court would be moot since the Republican-controlled Legislature already has passed a law voiding agreements that the company made with a prior governing board of Disney supporters that gave design and construction powers to the company.If the judge decides not to dismiss the state case, the entertainment giant asked that the state court case be put on hold until a federal lawsuit in Tallahassee is resolved since they cover the same ground and that lawsuit was filed first.In that case, Disney sued DeSantis and his appointees to the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District in an effort to stop the takeover, claiming the governor was violating the company's free speech and “weaponizing the power of government to punish private business.”“We are dealing with the same issue in both cases,” Daniel Petrocelli, an attorney for Disney, told the judge during an hourlong hearing watched remotely by several Disney executives.Attorneys for the district's board asked that their case not be dismissed, telling the circuit judge that it wasn't moot and putting it on hold would be improper. They also argued that the board's lawsuit in state court was filed first since Disney's federal lawsuit wasn't properly served to the defendants.Story continuesDeSantis isn't a party in the state court lawsuit.The judge didn't say when she would make a decision, but asked attorneys for both sides to prepare orders for her as if she had rendered a ruling in each of their favor by next Wednesday.The fight between DeSantis and Disney began last year after the company, facing significant pressure internally and externally, publicly opposed a state law banning classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades, a policy critics call “Don’t Say Gay.”As punishment, DeSantis took over the district through legislation passed by Florida lawmakers and appointed a new board of supervisors to oversee municipal services for the sprawling theme parks and hotels. But before the new board came in, the company made agreements with previous oversight board members who were Disney supporters that stripped the new supervisors of their authority over design and construction.In response, DeSantis and Florida lawmakers passed the legislation that repealed those agreements.Disney announced in May that it was scrapping plans to build a new campus in central Florida and relocate 2,000 employees from Southern California to work in digital technology, finance and product development. Disney had planned to build the campus about 20 miles (30 kilometers) from the giant Walt Disney World theme park resort.In an interview this week on CNBC, Disney CEO Bob Iger said the company didn't want to be involved in any culture wars.“Our goal is to continue to tell wonderful stories and have a positive, positive impact on the world,” Iger said.___Follow Mike Schneider on Twitter at @MikeSchneiderAP]"

DeSantis, who is running for the Republican presidential nomination, has repeatedly attacked ""woke Disney"" in public remarks.DeSantis rallied lawmakers to pass bills that reconstituted the district, formerly known as Reedy Creek Improvement District, and transfer power over the board to the governor from Disney. Lawmakers also retroactively invalidated agreements that Disney reached with the prior board on the eve of it being brought under DeSantis's control.Disney's attorney argued in court that the district's lawsuit should be dismissed because it was no longer needed since the company's agreements with the prior board were nullified by the state.Dismissing the district lawsuit would allow the company to focus on its federal case, which claims DeSantis violated the company's constitutional right to free speech. Disney wants a federal court order preventing the state from enforcing the laws directed at the company. DeSantis has been dismissive of Disney's lawsuit and said the company has no right to operate without proper district government oversight or have special privileges.Story continuesAn attorney for oversight district argued that the district's case should proceed because it differed from the broad-ranging federal case and was narrowly focused on the validity of several agreements struck this year.""If Disney's contracts are void, nearly all of Disney's claims in the federal case disappear,"" the district said in a court filing.(Reporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Delaware, editing by Deepa Babington and David Gregorio)]"

(Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times)A California appellate court ruled that Disneyland has illegally evaded a living-wage law passed by Anaheim voters in 2018 that could boost pay for Disneyland Resort workers to nearly $20 an hour.The ordinance, known as Measure L, applies a minimum wage to Anaheim resort companies that have tax rebate agreements with the city.In response to a class-action lawsuit representing 25,000 workers, attorneys for Walt Disney Co. argued that it received no such city subsidies in Anaheim and that the law therefore didn’t apply.But a three-judge panel from California's 4th District Court of Appeal disagreed, citing a provision in a 1996 Disney expansion deal passed by Anaheim in which the city agreed to repay the company if it had to cover bond payments.""We are pleased the court focused on the economic reality of Disney's agreements with Anaheim and concluded that Disney is obligated to comply with the living wage law,"" said Sarah Grossman-Swenson, an attorney representing the workers. ""The court's decision will have a real impact on thousands of Disney employees who work so hard but struggle to provide for their families.""Under the minimum-wage law, Disney theme park employees could be paid nearly $20 an hour.""It's a huge legal victory for not just workers at the resort and at the park but the voters of the city as well because they're the ones who passed this measure,"" Workers' United Local 50 Vice President Chris Duarte said. Local 50 represents about 8,500 Disneyland food and beverage staff.The ruling was a ""good surprise"" for Duarte, who said that the union is still trying to grasp the full effect amid bargaining with Disney as their contract expires Sept. 1.

Claster wrote in a tentative ruling in 2021.Read more: Worker strikes hit more hotels, this time near DisneylandThe appellate court overturned Claster's ruling, which hinged on the 1996 expansion deal that paved the way for Disney to build California Adventure, Downtown Disney and the Grand Californian Hotel while Anaheim modernized its resort area with $510 million in bond proceeds.Disney has never had to cover any bond payments, even when the COVID-19 pandemic closed Disneyland for 13 months and tourism in the city plummeted.Disney could appeal the appellate ruling to the California Supreme Court, but attorneys representing its workers hope that the legal fight is over.""We know from talking to several of the named plaintiffs in the litigation, that they had at least a shortfall of several dollars per hour for some time,"" Grossman-Swenson said. ""We urge Disney to do the right thing and start complying with the law.""In a February 2018 survey by Occidental College and the Los Angeles-based Economic Roundtable, Disneyland employees cited high instances of homelessness, low wages and food insecurity. Disneyland representatives called the survey, which was paid for by labor unions, ""inaccurate and unscientific.""Virginia Aguirre, who has worked at the Starbucks on Disneyland's Main Street for 10 years, once lived only three miles from the theme park but now commutes 90 miles to work from her daughter's San Bernardino County home. Aguirre, 59, cried as she described how she faced eviction because she couldn't pay the one-bedroom apartment's rent, which had slowly doubled to $1,600 a month.""You put on that smile, and you will make magic for these thousands of people and carry on the responsibilities that our managers expect us to carry on, but it's rough,"" Aguirre said.Roberto Villaseñor, who also works in food and beverage service at Disneyland, said he often must choose between gas to commute to work and his monthly asthma medication as expenses for both became more challenging.Disney constantly boosts its customer-service standards, Villaseñor said. ""But for the expectations that they increase, they're not increasing the wages,"" he said.Aguirre said she hopes Thursday's appellate court ruling means that Disney will fulfill its responsibilities under the 2018 voter-approved initiative.""When we get our back pay, God willing, that lump sum will help me relocate and come back, take my stuff out of storage and live modestly,"" she said. ""Pay us a livable wage so that our smile isn't fake.""This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

The bank’s earnings and revenues are expected to have witnessed a year-over-year improvement.In the last reported quarter, M&amp;T Bank surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on a rise in net interest income (NII) supported by decent loan demand and higher rates. Other income improved in the quarter. However, an increase in credit costs and higher expenses acted as headwinds.The stock has surpassed the consensus estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, missed once and matched in the other. It has a four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 1.01%, on average.M&amp;T Bank Price and EPS SurpriseM&amp;T Bank Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseM&amp;T Bank Corporation price-eps-surprise | M&amp;T Bank Corporation QuoteKey Factors &amp; Q2 Estimates Loans &amp; NII: The overall lending environment weakened sequentially in the second quarter. Specifically, the demand for commercial real estate loans, and commercial and industrial loans was softer in April and May, per the Fed’s latest data. Given M&amp;T Bank’s substantial exposure to commercial loans, its loan growth in the quarter under review is likely to have been affected.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average earning assets of $182.93 billion indicates a sequential decline of 1%.Nonetheless, per the company’s release, as of May end, its average loan balances increased to $133.5 billion from $132 billion as of Mar 31, 2023.We estimate average interest earning assets to rise 2.6% sequentially to $188.76 billion.While Fed kept rates unchanged during the June FOMC meeting, it increased rates by 25 basis points in May. The policy rate now stands at 5-5.25%.Despite the high interest rate environment, softer loan demand and rising funding costs are anticipated to have negatively impacted NII during the quarter to be reported.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII of $1.77 billion suggests a 2.4% decrease from the prior-quarter’s reported number. We estimate the metric to be $1.76 billion.Story continuesFee Income: Trust income is likely to have declined in the to-be reported quarter due to the sale of its collective investment trust (CIT) business. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric of $189 million indicates a 2.6% sequential decline.The consensus estimate for trading account and other non-hedging derivative gains is pegged at $9.23 million, reflecting a decline of 21% sequentially.The consensus mark for other revenues from operations is pegged at $151 million, implying a fall of 5.6% sequentially.As of May end, MTB’s average deposit balances decreased to $158.1 billion from $161.5 billion as of Mar 31, 2023. Further, the company removed non-sufficient fund fees and overdraft protection transfer charges from linked-deposit accounts. This is likely to have negatively impacted revenues from service charges on deposits in the to-be-reported quarter.Nonetheless, the consensus estimate for the metric is pegged at $117 million, indicating a 2.6% rise sequentially.However, in the quarter under review, mortgage rates continued to increase, with the rate on 30-year fixed mortgage reaching 6.81% in June, up from 4.6% reported in the prior-year quarter. The climb in mortgage rates, which kept home buyers on the sidelines, led to a smaller origination market for both purchase and refinancing.The bulk purchase of mortgage servicing rights (MSR) at the end of March is expected to have supported mortgage servicing revenues to some extent. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for mortgage banking revenues of $94 million indicates a sequential increase of 10.6%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for brokerage services income of $24.8 million suggests a marginal rise from the first-quarter reported figure.The consensus estimate for a loss on bank investment securities of $0.18 million implies an improvement from a loss of $0.42 million recorded in first-quarter 2023.The consensus mark for total other income of $621 million suggests sequential growth of 5.8%. We estimate the metric to be $597.7 million.Expenses: The company’s expense base is expected to have declined sequentially in the to-be-reported quarter. This is because first quarter recorded seasonally higher compensation expense. Also, the sale of CIT business is likely to reduce expenses. These reductions are likely to be partially offset by the bulk MSR purchase.What Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for M&amp;T Bank this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Quality Dividend Stocks to Buy. During periods of uncertainty, such as recessions or inflationary environments, dividend stocks often become a preferred choice for investors. This is because dividend stocks can provide a certain level of stability and income even in turbulent times. When it comes to dividend stocks, investing in high-quality companies offers several advantages. Quality dividend stocks are those that have a track record of consistent and reliable dividend payments. These companies are well-established and have histories of generating steady cash flows, strong earnings growth, and solid balance sheets.Dividend growth rate plays a significant role in dividend investing by showcasing a company's capacity to raise its dividend payments over time. When companies can consistently increase their dividends at a healthy rate, it signals their strength and stability as investments. This growth reflects a strong and expanding cash flow, demonstrating their commitment to delivering value to shareholders. Moreover, dividend growers also showed robust performance in the past, compared to their counterparts. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we mentioned data from Ned Davis Research and Hartford Funds, which revealed that dividend growers achieved a return of 9.62% from 1972 to December 31, 2018. In contrast, dividend cutters experienced a negative return of 0.79%. During the same period, the S&amp;P 500 had an average annual return of 7.30%, indicating that dividend growers outperformed the broader market.Also read: 12 Best Long-Term Dividend Stocks To Buy NowInvestors showed great interest in stocks with substantial dividends last year, considering them popular trades in the stock market. However, this preference for dividend-heavy stocks has lost momentum since then due to growing investments in artificial intelligence (AI). According to data by Ned Davis Research, non-dividend-paying stocks in the S&amp;P 500 have experienced a collective gain of approximately 18% in 2023, as of July 1. In contrast, income-generating companies have only seen a modest 4% advance. This marks the weakest first-half performance for dividend-paying stocks compared to non-dividend-paying stocks since 2009.Story continuesHowever, it is important to note that the situation could change in the future, especially since dividend-paying stocks have historically demonstrated a tendency to outperform during periods of economic slowdown. According to a report by Wall Street Journal, there are concerns that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes could potentially lead the economy into a recession. If such a scenario unfolds, defensive companies with substantial dividends could once again outperform. This is because, during an economic downturn, consumers tend to prioritize essential expenses.Analysts also continue to support the stance on dividend stocks, as they see potential and favorable prospects for these stocks throughout the year. Paul Baiocchi, chief ETF strategist at SS&amp;C ALPS Advisors, spoke with WSJ and said that a significant part of the market’s total return has been generated by compounded dividends over time, rather than the price appreciation of the stock market itself. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) are some of the best dividend stocks with decades-long dividend growth track records. In this article, we will further discuss quality dividend stocks to consider.11 Best Quality Dividend Stocks to BuyImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur Methodology:For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 943 hedge funds as of Q1 2023 and selected blue-chip dividend companies with robust balance sheets.

The stocks are ranked in ascending order of hedge funds having stakes in them.11.

Medtronic is the world’s largest device manufacturer, and it holds the number one or number two market share in most of its product segments. Medtronic’s business is heavily weighted towards complicated in-patient procedures, which are typically quite profitable. Industry dynamics are quite attractive with an aging global population and the growth of improved healthcare in emerging markets; furthermore, most of its segments are highly concentrated with just 2-3 players that split each segment’s market share, affording the key participants with significant economies of scale and pricing power. The Company has been recently addressing several temporary headwinds including a strong dollar, inflation, a delayed recovery in surgical volumes from the coronavirus pandemic, and supply chain issues. Once these issues reach the rearview mirror, the Company’s growth and margin expansion plans should transform into reality.”10. Automatic Data Processing, Inc.

The company’s valuation does not reflect the potential downside in the job market from a weakening economy.”9.

VSAT, a leading player in the satellite communications industry, has encountered an unexpected setback with its ViaSat-3 Americas satellite. The company revealed that an event during the reflector deployment likely had a material impact on the satellite's performance. Viasat is currently working closely with the reflector's manufacturer to determine the extent of the issue and explore potential remedial measures.To mitigate the economic effects of this anomaly, Viasat is refining its contingency plans. These plans aim to minimize the impact on the company's operations. One potential option is to redeploy satellites from Viasat's extensive fleet to optimize global coverage. Another option under consideration is reallocating a subsequent ViaSat-3 class satellite to provide additional bandwidth for the Americas region. It is important to note that the initial service priority for ViaSat-3 Americas was to support the growth of Viasat's North American fixed broadband business.Despite the sudden setback, customers have not experienced any disruption in service as the coverage and capacity of the existing Viasat and Inmarsat constellations remain unaffected. Viasat, following its acquisition of Inmarsat, operates 12 Ka-band satellites in space, excluding ViaSat-3. Additionally, the company has eight more Ka-band satellites under construction.As Viasat navigates this unexpected challenge, investors should monitor its progress in resolving the satellite anomaly. The successful implementation of the contingency plans will be key in minimizing the impact on its performance and ensuring continued growth in core business areas.Nevertheless, the growing adoption of in-flight Wi-Fi services in commercial aircraft is proving conducive to its business growth. Viasat’s impressive bandwidth productivity sets it apart from conventional and lower-yield satellite providers that run on incumbent business models. The company has a competitive advantage in bandwidth economics, global coverage, flexibility and bandwidth allocation, which makes it believe that mobile broadband will act as a profit churner with a significant improvement in in-flight connectivity revenues.The stock has gained 63.8% over the past year against the industry's decline of 7.6%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchViasat currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

They'll be joining Hollywood writers, who went on strike in May. Oppenheimer Head of Internet Research Jason Helfstein tells Yahoo Finance Live why, despite the disruption, the strikes are ""probably a near-term tailwind"" for Netflix and other streamers.Video Transcript- So let's start with that breaking news. Hollywood is shutting down. The SAG-AFTRA Union will go on strike at midnight. This on top of the writers strike. Now it's the first time that both unions have been on strike at the same time in 63 years.Joining us now is Jason Helfstein, managing director and head of internet research at Oppenheimer. Jason, it's good to see you here. So obviously, the strike, a huge blow to Hollywood. But when it comes to your coverage list which includes Netflix and Amazon, the streaming impact of all this, how do you see that playing out?JASON HELFSTEIN: It's actually, probably, a near-term tailwind, actually, to Netflix and the streamers because they produce content, generally, further ahead. So not kind of shoot-- not several weeks before airing but many, many months before airing. Plus Netflix also produces a lot of content around the world, which wouldn't be impacted by this.So if you think about during COVID when production was shut down, Netflix was actually able to have a more consistent pipeline of newer shows on top of just the very deep library. So while we don't wish anyone to be out of work and we hope this gets resolved for everyone's interest, it probably will be a near-term benefit to the streamers if this strike-- both the writers and the actors don't get resolved reasonably quickly.- And Jason, for Netflix specifically, that platform has been very focused on international content. Committing a ton of money overseas, especially in South Korea. Is that going to be a tailwind for Netflix? And when you compare that to some of the other streaming companies and their content pipeline.Story continuesJASON HELFSTEIN: I mean, again, I feel like the idea-- and I think everyone we're talking with watches Netflix. I mean, we've all kind of-- I mean, before Netflix I didn't watch many shows that had subtitles. I think we've all-- Netflix has gotten us used to watching shows with either subtitles or dubbed. And so yeah, they've really trained consumers. Hey, you can watch-- there is good content that's not necessarily made in the US or Canada that that's appealing, and it's among some of their top shows. So yes.That in addition to the fact that they produce content much further in advance and kind of have it in the can ready to go, as they say, you also have that international content. So yeah, I think that that will be a near-term tailwind for Netflix.- So, Jason, outside of that international content, I know you're saying that's a tailwind here, at least for now. But is there a point as to which that conversation would change if this strike is not resolved for a certain amount of time? Should Netflix or will Netflix get a little bit worried just about the amount of backlog that they still have to rely on?JASON HELFSTEIN: Sure. I mean, again, eventually you start cutting into muscle. As far as our discussions with Netflix and our understanding is nobody thinks it'll go that far. I mean, if this went six months-- again, hopefully it doesn't, but if it did, I think Netflix would-- you'd see very minimal interruption. If this went for a year, yes, you probably would see interruption.But, I mean, if it went for a year, I think the pain that this will cause on the traditional media business is going to be far worse. So I just wouldn't expect it to go that far.- And Jason, besides the strike, another big headline we got is Disney CEO, Bob Iger, staying on for another two years. He gave an interview with CNBC this morning and he really doubled down on ESPN. Saying it's definitely happening that they're going to take ESPN as a fully over-the-top direct-to-consumer service. How much more pressure does that put on a company like Netflix to get into the live sports game?JASON HELFSTEIN: I mean, we know sports rights are expensive and only getting more expensive. You've got all the internet giants trying to figure out what their strategy is going to be with sports and those companies have the biggest checkbooks right now on the planet when it comes to sports. So I don't think Netflix wants to compete with them.What we've seen them do is effectively do these sports related shows, Formula One, The Golf Series, and they've gotten really good viewership. So, you know, I think you'll see more of a continuation, effectively, of them being able to kind of leverage the popularity of sports. But doing it in an alternative way and not bidding on live sports.- Jason, the challenging set up, though, that we have right now across the streamers, really across the media landscape, potentially covers streamers focusing on that aspect of it. Bob Iger commented in a CNBC interview this morning that it's even more challenging than he had anticipated. How do you see that unfolding here in the near-term? And the companies that are best positioned to navigate this tumultuous time, is it a name like Netflix?JASON HELFSTEIN: Yeah, look, I mean, I think, Mr. Iger was being purposely vague. I mean, the reality is I think that you're seeing kind of cord cutting and kind of the decline in traditional TV viewership. That is part of a challenge that-- again, I don't cover Disney. But that's what the companies are trying to face. Which is we want to build a successful streaming business but we also have this cash-- historical cash cow out of our legacy business.Can we do both? And how do you do both well and profitably? And if you're going to choose to not put a show on linear because ultimately it's going to drive people to your streaming service, that's then going to hurt your linear service.So look, Netflix doesn't have to make those decisions. I think that's ultimately the challenge. And then if you have legacy cable channels that you're still getting paid good cash from the cable operators but you know that whether it's going to be five or seven years from now, that cash will probably go away, factoring that into your strategic planning.So I think that's more what he's referring to. Not necessarily what is a standalone company like-- is the environment actually worse for Netflix right now? I actually think it's particularly better. But for the media conglomerates, it's trying to get the two parts of the businesses to ultimately work cohesively. That's the challenge.- And Jason, you said Netflix doesn't have to make those decisions. However, it is getting into the advertising game. With more people cutting the cord, that's more of an opportunity to get those ad buyers. How does a company like Netflix and all of these streaming services focus their advertising tiers right now?JASON HELFSTEIN: So, I mean, look, it's super early on Netflix. Their challenge is actually there's more advertiser demand than they have ads to fill. You know, this quarter they finally launched page sharing, right, which is effectively telling you that you can only pay for two, basically, viewers outside of your household. And then after that, those other people have to get additional accounts. Maybe they go to the ad tier or maybe they go to the basic tier.They're testing, in Canada, phasing out the basic plan. Which would effectively put more people in the advertising tier. Because the argument would be at that basic plan, you were giving away about $10 of advertising a month when you were letting somebody sign up for kind of the lowest subscription tier.So we think Netflix is in a very good place right now. Again, they have what is considered-- it's all premium content, right. There's no user-generated content where you're not sure about appropriateness for an advertiser. So this is all very premium content.Advertisers know they need to do more connected TV advertising because a lot of the linear dollars are wasted because they're not targeted ads, right. You're showing ads to people who-- either it just may not be an appropriate product for who that person is where on streaming you can target those ads. And so it's super early days. We do, ultimately, think there's a potential of 30 million additional users that come on Netflix. And half of those, easily, could go into the ad tier.- So Jason, with all that taken into account, we're going to hear from Netflix when they report results next week. What do you think we'll see? Do you think we're on track for a big beat?JASON HELFSTEIN: We do. And I think the street's already expecting. If you look at the stock, it continues to do quite well. I mean, we're looking for 2 and 1/2, 2.6 million subs, versus guidance of 1.8 to 1.9. But I'm sure the buy side is probably where we are ahead of us.For next quarter, we're looking for something like 5.2 million new subs, street's at 5.4. And then it's really what do people do with their estimates for next year when people start to give them credit for advertising. Because we're valuing the stock on a 2025 earnings estimate, right. So really, this isn't about what's the advertising tomorrow, but what's the potential over the next two years? And what do they say that will more positively inform people's view about the next two years?- A lot to look out for in that report. Oppenheimer's Jason Helfstein, thank you so much.]"

They are widely recognized as the world's most prestigious product design awards. This is the third year in a row our teams across Xfinity and Sky have won - the fourth time overall - and it's always a moment of pride for our designers and engineers to receive this recognition.This year's honor is special for a few reasons. For the first time, our teams won for designs spanning both consumer and business products, with our new Comcast Business Gateway earning one of the four awards. Secondly, these products all came to fruition - in part - during COVID. Throughout the pandemic, teammates from around the world collaborated remotely across the company's Global Technology Platform, the engine that powers Comcast's connectivity and entertainment products and unifies Xfinity and Sky products under a common design system.Here's a look at this year's class of Red Dot Award winners spanning our connectivity and platforms businesses.Comcast Business GatewayAs today's businesses grow, their connectivity solutions must also transform, with more speed and capacity to handle higher volumes of data.To meet these demands, in 2023, Comcast Business unveiled its latest and most powerful WiFi device. The Comcast Business Gateway is the first WiFi-6 certified product offered by Comcast Business, designed to provide faster speeds, enhanced security protection, and state of the art WiFi coverage. With its ability to communicate more effectively across multiple devices that require data simultaneously, the advanced gateway can prioritize traffic more efficiently, resulting in reduced lag during video conferencing and file uploads.Design-wise, its simple, compact form defies the conventional wisdom that business networks require racks and racks of servers.Story continues""We wanted to make a solution that provides each business with placement flexibility: on a counter or desk, as well as on a wall or in a standard server rack,"" said Mike Jou, Senior Creative Director at Comcast, whose team is tasked with reimagining the product experience through industrial design. ""We wanted to align Comcast Business's flagship device with our design system but also customize it for a specific business use case. It's built with a solid, heavily textured surface that elegantly transitions between two common shapes on the top and bottom of the form. Between those transitions, a band wraps around the entire form, allowing room for key elements such as status LEDs, ventilation, I/O ports, and mounting provisions.""Xfinity Large Button Voice RemoteXfinity's Large Button Voice Remote represents the culmination of decades of TV remote learnings and know-how.This newest iteration is designed to be user-friendly, particularly for those with dexterity or visual challenges that make it difficult to use standard remotes. Its soft tapered form is easy to hold and operate with one or two hands while the elevated IR window, speaker relief, and flat bottom ensure stability and performance when used while resting on a surface. The remote also features large backlit buttons, high contrast colors, enlarged text, a removable wrist strap, a ""press to slide"" back cover, and rubber lift tabs for battery removal to enhance its ease of use.With a prominent accessibility shortcut key, users can quickly access settings like Comcast's Talking Guide, closed captions, large text options, audio description, and more to suit individual needs.""Our product designers believe in creating experiences that solve the needs of as many people as possible,"" said Tom Wlodkowski, Vice President, Accessibility. ""By designing our products with accessibility uppermost in their minds, not only do they create better products for everyone, but they also help unlock greater independence for millions of people living with disabilities.""Xfinity Home CameraThe Xfinity Home Camera is a sleek home monitoring and surveillance device, offered as an integral part of the Xfinity Home suite of products and services. It captures high-definition video footage and sends it to our secure cloud where the content can be viewed from afar on a smartphone or tablet, enabling customers to keep an eye on their homes when they are across town, across the country, or even travelling abroad.Aesthetically, it was important to engineer a discreet and elegant product, inviting enough to place or install in any space.""We wanted to create a friendly form in a soft white color that can easily fit in any room, from the garage to the nursery,"" said Jou. ""We engineered it with an integrated ball and socket to provide flexibility to get just the right angle with ease, whether placed on a surface or mounted directly to the wall.""Sky Stream BoxThe Sky Stream Box is the new, easy way for subscribers to get Sky in the U.K. and Europe. It gives customers the best entertainment streamed straight to any TV over WiFi, with no satellite dish or additional installation required. Sky Stream brings the Sky Glass UI and experience to even more people following the launch of the world's first streaming TV last year.The Sky Stream box is easy to set up and has a user-friendly interface that makes navigating through different apps and content simple. It also comes with a voice-activated remote control, which allows users to browse and select content quickly. The device supports high-definition video and provides a smooth streaming experience, making it a popular choice for those who want to enjoy their favorite shows and movies on the big screen without the hassle of cable or satellite TV.The Sky Stream Puck's small, discreet form factor blends in with the home without detracting from the TV-viewing experience. It comes with the Glass Remote that was designed with excellent ergonomics, premium finish, and a low center of gravity that nestles comfortably in the palm of the user's hand.Thoughtful design and engineering helped reduce cost without compromising quality, allowing Sky to provide Sky TV over WiFi for less than a pound a day.A History of Award-Winning InnovationThese awards join a growing list of honors recognizing our global innovation, a list that started in 2014 with the X1 Entertainment Operating System earning its first Emmy. The feat has been repeated several times, including a win for the Voice Remote platform in 2018, and recently, a 2022 Technology and Engineering Emmy for VideoAI used featured across Xfinity, Sky, and Peacock for advanced sports viewing.The Red Dot Award is issued by an international jury to products that demonstrate outstanding design each year. We are excited to be among the leading companies providing our customers with state-of-the-art products that makes their lives easier.Eco Capsule Wins Fourth International Award for Sustainable DesignComcast also gained its fourth international recognition - the 2023 iF Design Award - for the Xfinity Eco Capsule, which launched in 2020.The Eco Capsule, a sustainable packaging solution with the world's first resealable molded fiber lid, is crafted from bamboo, sugarcane, and paper with responsible manufacturing methods powered by solar, wind, and recycled water.Comcast's package design and accessibility teams also partnered to include its first-ever use of braille on packaging along with ergonomic features.Past Eco Capsule wins include the Red Dot Award (2021-22); IDEA Gold Award (2022) and Good Design Award (2022).Later this year, the Eco Capsule will be further incorporated into additional products sold in Xfinity retail stores, including the upcoming Storm-Ready Xfinity WiFi device.

Jeremy Bryan, Gradient Investments Senior Portfolio Manager, shares his forecast on stocks in the health and pharmaceuticals space, while highlighting performances from Oracle and W.W. Grainger.Video TranscriptDIANE KING HALL: Stocks are on the rise in today's trading session after producer price index provided further evidence of inflation cooling. This coming as companies start earnings season stronger than analysts' expectations. So what stocks should investors get in? And which should you wait on the sidelines for?Here to discuss, we have Gradient Investments Senior Portfolio Manager Jeremy Bryan. Jeremy, thanks so much for joining us. Let's start with your picks. You're starting with the health care space with Abbott Laboratories. Tell us the thesis on this one.JEREMY BRYAN: Yeah. Health care in general has kind of been left to the sidelines a little bit after admittedly a very strong 2022. But especially with Abbott, what we're starting to see here is a re-acceleration of growth is, you know, Abbott had a huge influx because of COVID conditions, where elective procedures went away but you had testing and all the other stuff that they were involved in. And so it made the earnings trajectory pretty noisy, because you've had a pretty significant correction of earnings here. They're expected to be down.But what we're starting to see is a re-acceleration of that profile. As the COVID thing start to end off, they're getting those elective procedures back in. And then secondarily, the diabetes franchise is actually had some technology improvements here recently that could actually increase their penetration rate there, too.So we really think that this is a re-acceleration story. It's not cheap, but it's cheaper than it has been in the past. And that's why we own it now. And we'd be buying here.Story continuesALEXANDRA CANAL: Now why do you think Abbott Labs is more of a pick than, let's say, a Johnson &amp; Johnson, for example? Because we have seen Abbott Labs kind of relative to their peers lag a bit.JEREMY BRYAN: Yeah. I mean, well, Johnson &amp; Johnson especially, you know, they had the KVUE spinoff, and they have other components of their business, right? It's a pharma business. And then the device is business as well. So I mean, Johnson &amp; Johnson, to a certain extent, is a little different from what people look for and invest in there, because they're probably honestly talk about pharma more than they talk about the devices component of Johnson &amp; Johnson.But really, from that perspective, too, is that some things in health care have worked OK. I mean, if you look at Boston Scientific, that stock has been phenomenal. But then other areas have really just been left behind. And to a certain extent, I think it's, again, a source of funds for what has worked well this year, which is, you know, the AI stocks and those kinds of things. And industrial reopening, I think people are pivoting out of that.But again, from our perspective, it-- that is actually providing the opportunity to say now is an interesting time, because you're getting a little discounted valuation. It's been kind of left to the sidelines. And we do think that earnings growth is going to accelerate in the next couple of quarters.DIANE KING HALL: All right. You called Abbott at around-- I mean, today, it's around 107 that I guess it might be pricey. But your next pick is UnitedHealth Group. That's certainly pricier. What's the case for that?JEREMY BRYAN: Yeah. And we'll find out a little bit more real soon here. But from the perspective of UnitedHealth, you know, I just think insurance stocks are-- you know, UnitedHealth is probably the one that's trading the most expensive, but it's also the best executer in that group. But I just think health insurance is actually one that's been materially left behind here recently. And Cigna is another one I would call out in that regard.And both of these companies are going to grow and probably the high-single digit to low double-digit EPS range for the next three to five years. And we're paying a pretty significant discount to their long-term valuations here, especially with UnitedHealthcare again. That one's a little bit more expensive. But I'm willing to pay up a little bit for the growth. But if you're looking for like a true value play, that would be more of your Cigna.But I just think UNH and Cigna have been left behind because of these elevated concerns about their cost environment. We think that's a little bit overblown. UNH has already called it out. We'll see what the earnings reports show. But because they already kind of put in there, we think that's already somewhat priced in unless the numbers are significantly worse than anticipated, which we don't see right now.DIANE KING HALL: OK. I'll try to do this quick, because I kind of have a two-pronged question now. So we know United lost some steam this year because of them coming out and talking about the rise of elective-- elective surgeries and how that can pressure their margins. What are you looking for from the earnings tomorrow in terms of that, what their margins look like?JEREMY BRYAN: Yeah. You know, I mean, honestly, it's more important to me the commentary. I want to say that, you know, if they come out cautious and say things are getting-- you know, we've seen progression that it's getting materially worse, that would obviously be a little bit more of a red flag for us. But if they're saying the exact same thing that they already said in mid-June-- and by the way, they don't bring guidance down significantly as a result of that-- that would give us an indication that they are at least comfortable with their level of increased cost, and that the pricing environment will be positive enough for them to continue to grow that earnings in that double-digit clip.But that's really what we're looking at is, what's the commentary with regard to the cost environment? Is it getting worse than when they talked about it before? Is it starting to alleviate? Where are we at in that cycle, if you will?ALEXANDRA CANAL: And Jeremy, you also have some stocks that you're saying to stay on the sideline. One of them being Oracle, why do you think that?JEREMY BRYAN: Yeah. Oracle's one we just sold this week. And it's really-- this is more of a profit-taking move. And if you're a new entrant into it, I wouldn't be buying it now. So we sold it this week. I mean, we bought it in October and get 85% out of it. I mean, that's, you know, phenomenal in any stretch., in anything that we'd be looking for.But you've gone from when we bought it, it was 13 times earnings. Now, it's over 20 times earnings, which is near a 10-year high for that stock. So we're just saying from our perspective, now is probably not the time to be entertaining a buy-in in Oracle with this significantly higher multiple. And we still don't know what the extended benefit of AI. We actually think they will be an beneficiary to a certain extent. But we don't know how far and how fast that goes. And they've been rewarded for a lot of that already.So that's why we're saying that, hey, fundamentally, there's really not much wrong with the company. But if I'm buying a position today or if I'm holding it today, I'm saying that maybe it's a little bit expensive. And I'd maybe want to look to other avenues for future growth.DIANE KING HALL: So that's interesting. You do have a bunch who agree with your thesis on Oracle and a bunch who don't. It's kind of like almost split down the middle. So we'll see where that one ends up. What else are you staying away from, Jeremy, or getting out of?JEREMY BRYAN: Yeah. You know, I mean, honestly, we're again looking a little bit at these industrial plays. And we're just, you know, Fastenal is an interesting example of that today. So I'm going to pivot a little bit here and saying, we've been talking about this before and saying the industrial renaissance in US manufacturing is real. There's no question about it. But we were a little bit nervous about how far and how fast some of these industrial names have come.And so Fastenal was an interesting thing today and the effect that numbers weren't that bad, and the stock has had a rerating downward. And its peer competitor Grainger was another one in that regard that actually had a downgrade this week as well. And so from that perspective, we're just saying be careful with these types of names that have run really far really fast recently here on the thought of US manufacturing renaissance and those kinds of things occurring, because while we do think that is occurring, we just thought this was too far too fast.And so both of those names were on our list and saying we just need to be careful here. It's not a name we'd be entering in right now. We'd want to see it settle down and kind of come back to an area where the valuation makes a little bit more sense for the opportunity going forward.DIANE KING HALL: All right. Jeremy Bryan, we got to leave it there. Thank you so much.]"

If you want to skip our industry introduction, then take a look at the Top 5 Big Data Analytics Companies of 2023. Data analytics is all the buzz these days. Advances in computing, technology, and industrialization have expanded business operations by quite a bit and also allowed companies to collect copious amounts of data to generate new insights.This growth in data analytics over the years has also led major semiconductor firms such as Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) to offer two categories of central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs). One set of these are for consumers, primarily for everyday use in laptops and desktops, while the other is used in large scale data centers for enterprise computing. While all big data uses data centers, not all data centers are used for big data analytics since the data that must be stored on a site must exceed 1 Petabyte to be classified as big data.So how big is the big data market? Well, to answer this question we'll have to individually look at its hardware and software constituents. The hardware portion was worth $279 billion last year and is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.3% until 2032 to be worth $656 billion by the end of the forecast period. Within this segment, the information technology segment is the biggest, as it accounts for 35% of the market. Hinting at the importance of big data to the data center market, the hyperscale segment which consists of products that are capable of scaling up data centers to thousands of servers was the biggest product type, controlling 43% of the market.Comparing the data center market with the big data and data analytics market shows that this segment was worth $198 billion in 2020 and it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 13.5% between 2021 and 2030 to be worth $684 billion by then. Off site computing was one of the rare industries that actually boomed during the coronavirus pandemic as businesses were forced to deal with more computing and data due to work from home requirements. Software and services are the biggest portion of this market, and geographically, Asia Pacific is expected to be the fastest growing region, since it is expected to outpace the broader market through a growth rate of 17.5%.Story continuesShifting our focus from the broader industries to the firms that operate in, there are quite a bit of firms that have a presence in the industry. These include firms like Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) which operate on the software side of data analytics and allow companies to consolidate their business data into single platforms to enable data driven insights and decision making. Oracle's big data solutions allow for consolidating large scale data into databases under a variety of languages and parameters through systems such as SQL, Hadoop, Kafka, and Spark. While these are primarily data storage and access platforms, the Oracle big data analytics platform also lets data scientists build and deploy machine learning models that leverage programming languages such as Python.Another firm whose platform is crucial to big data analytics is the technology giant Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Microsoft's Azure is one of the biggest enterprise computing platforms in the industry, and it enables big data analytics under Microsoft's Intelligent Data Platform. Here's what the firm had to say about this platform's capabilities and market performance during its latest earnings call:Our Intelligent Data Platform brings together databases, analytics and governance, so organizations can spend more time creating value and less time integrating their data estate. Cosmos DB is the go-to database, powering the world’s most demanding workloads at any scale. OpenAI relies on Cosmos DB to dynamically scale their ChatGPT service, one of the fastest-growing consumer apps ever, enabling high reliability and low maintenance.The NBA uses Cosmos DB to ingest more than 10 million data points per game, helping teams optimize their gameplay. And we are taking share with our analytics solutions. Companies like BP, Canadian Tire, Marks &amp; Spencer and T-Mobile all rely on our end-to-end analytics to improve speed to insight.Now on to developers.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the top big data and data analytics companies in the world.

It is worth considering Fidelity National Information Services (FIS), which belongs to the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry.This banking and payment technologies company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 4.04%.For the last reported quarter, Fidelity National came out with earnings of $1.29 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.20 per share, representing a surprise of 7.50%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.70 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.71 per share, delivering a surprise of 0.59%.For Fidelity National, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Fidelity National currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.05%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Fidelity National Information Services has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while MasterCard has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that FIS likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than MA has recently. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.FIS currently has a forward P/E ratio of 9.95, while MA has a forward P/E of 32.79. We also note that FIS has a PEG ratio of 0.94. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. MA currently has a PEG ratio of 1.87.Another notable valuation metric for FIS is its P/B ratio of 1.29. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, MA has a P/B of 70.51.Story continuesBased on these metrics and many more, FIS holds a Value grade of B, while MA has a Value grade of D.FIS sticks out from MA in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that FIS is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This is understandable, as investors such as retirees need current income. But for long-term growth of dividend income, investors should not exclude lower-yielding stocks with high dividend growth rates.In this article, we will discuss the prospects of three top dividend growth stocks. These stocks have low payout ratios and promising growth prospects. Plus, they can continue raising their dividends at a fast pace for many more years.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsStarbucks Corporation (SBUX)the Starbucks (SBUX) logo on a sign outside of a coffee shopSource: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.comStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) is a retail coffee giant with more than 36,000 stores worldwide. Nearly half of the stores are in the U.S. and about 20% of the stores are in China. The company operates under the namesake Starbucks brand but also holds the Teavana, Evolution Fresh and Ethos Water brands in its portfolio. The company generated $32 billion in annual revenue in fiscal 2022.2023 has been another year of impressive growth for Starbucks. In the most recent fiscal quarter, Starbucks grew its comparable store sales 11% thanks to 12% growth in the U.S. and 7% growth in international markets. Same-store sales in China grew 3%, after having remained depressed for four consecutive quarters due to lockdowns.Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) grew 25%, from 59 cents in the prior year’s quarter to 74 cents, and exceeded the analysts’ consensus by 9 cents. The headwinds from the lockdowns in China and high inflation have subsided. Starbucks reiterated its positive guidance for 2023, expecting EPS growth of 15%-20% at the low end of its long-term guidance.Starbucks has put together an excellent operating record, growing EPS by 18% per year from 2010-2019. During that period, its net profit margin expanded from 5% to 13%, while the company-owned store count nearly doubled. The Covid-19 pandemic was a major setback, but Starbucks recovered strongly in 2021 with record earnings.Story continuesLooking further out, Starbucks has a strong growth trajectory available over the long term thanks to a growing U.S. and international store count, where the company is still in the early innings of expansion, coupled with pricing power. We are forecasting 13% annual EPS growth over the next five years.Starbucks has increased its dividend for 12 consecutive years. Starbucks is currently offering a dividend yield of 2.1%. Thanks to its healthy payout ratio of 62%, its solid balance sheet and its promising growth prospects, the company is likely to keep raising its dividend for many more years.Yum Brands (YUM)YUM stock: the yum logo on the side of a buildingSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comYum Brands (NYSE:YUM) owns the KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and The Habit restaurant chains. It is present in more than 155 countries and has more than 54,000 restaurants, 60% of which are located abroad. KFC generates about half of the total revenue and operating profit of the company.In early May, Yum Brands reported financial results for the first quarter of 2023. The company grew its currency-neutral sales 11% over the prior year’s quarter thanks to 8% same-store sales growth and 3% growth of store count. KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut grew their sales 11%, 12% and 10%, respectively. Digital sales rose to a new all-time high and exceeded 45% of total sales.The strength of Yum’s company brands and their appeal to consumers constitute a significant competitive advantage. Thanks to its established brands, the company enjoys reliable free cash flows. As a result, the company is not likely to have issues servicing its debt. It is also worth noting that Yum Brands has proved markedly resilient during recessions, mostly thanks to its low-priced fast-food offerings.Yum Brands has returned to strong growth thanks to its increasing store count and its same-store sales. The company expects to grow its store count by 4%-5% per year in the upcoming years. During the last five years, Yum Brands has grown EPS at an 8.8% average annual rate. We expect 10% annual EPS growth over the next five years, which will allow the company to increase dividends as well. With a 47% dividend payout ratio for this fiscal year, the dividend is highly safe. YUM stock yields 1.7%.Baxter International (BAX)Source: ShutterstockBaxter International (NYSE:BAX) develops and sells a variety of healthcare products, including biological products, medical devices and connected care services devices used to monitor patients. Its products are used in hospitals, kidney dialysis centers, nursing homes, doctors’ offices and patients at home under physician supervision.In the first quarter, revenue fell 1.6% to $3.65 billion, but this was $50 million more than expected. Adjusted EPS of 59 cents compared unfavorably to 93 cents in the prior year but was 6 cents ahead of estimates. Results were mostly positive for the quarter. Renal Care, the largest segment within the company, grew 4% despite lower in-center sales following the exit of a distribution agreement last year. Advanced Surgery improved 11% due to a higher number of global procedures. Pharmaceuticals was up 5%, driven by double-digit growth in injectables in the U.S. and higher demand for drug compounding services in international markets.Baxter provided updated guidance for 2023 as well. The company now expects adjusted EPS in a range of $2.85 to $3 for the year, up from $2.75 to $2.95 previously.Baxter has a solid dividend growth history. Over the past five years, dividends have grown at 10.6% annually. Baxter has increased dividend payments to shareholders for six consecutive years and paid dividends to shareholders for 32 consecutive years. Baxter has seen growth across its product lines and across its geographic segments over the past five years.We maintain our five-year projected EPS growth rate of 10% due to the quality of the company as well as the low base of earnings that 2023 is expected to see. Over the next five years, we forecast that dividends will grow at about 10% annually, in line with EPS growth. The stock has a 2.6% current yield.On the date of publication, Bob Ciura did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Nearly half of respondents - 46 percent - expect the number of deals globally to increase somewhat or significantly over the next 12 months compared to 2022. A further 20 percent expect figures for the year ahead to remain in line with current volumes.""We are excited to share these important market insights that can help shape better decisions as the deal environment continues to evolve and poses new challenges,"" said Gary Blitz, global co-CEO of Aon's M&amp;A and Transaction Solutions. ""By taking this broad view of the M&amp;A landscape, dealmakers are better able to understand and respond to critical risks that can have an impact on a deal's success.""This does not necessarily mean that sailing will be smooth – from climate, tax and cyber risk to market dislocation and geopolitical uncertainty, rarely before have M&amp;A strategies had their mettle tested by such varied forms of volatility simultaneously. Dealmakers must be proactive in controlling whatever risks they can, install mitigation plans for those outside their direct influence and use risk transfer solutions when available.""Dealmaking is about balancing risk and return,"" said Alistair Lester, global co-CEO in Aon's M&amp;A and Transaction Solutions. ""With strong risk mitigation processes in place, including a multi-disciplined approach to due diligence and the strategic use of insurance capital, dealmakers are able to transform their risk into opportunity to improve their deal outcomes.""Story continuesThe M&amp;A Risk in Review series explores these dynamics in detail, reporting on investors' expectations for global M&amp;A over the next 12 months, standout sectors and the key risks they see – and how best to mitigate them.Additional highlights of the report include:68 percent of respondents identify Technology, Media and Telecom (TMT) as likely to be the most prolific generator of M&amp;A activity over the next 12 months. Conversely, the financial services sector is forecast by 32 percent of respondents to be the least prolific sector for dealmaking.72 percent of respondents expect financing conditions to worsen compared to 2022, including 38 percent who expect them to become much more challenging. In response, dealmakers are turning toward alternative financing sources, including private equity (64 percent) and non-bank lending (38 percent).96 percent of respondents expect Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) scrutiny in deals to increase over the next three years, including 48 percent who expect it to increase significantly. In addition, 24 percent say environmental litigation creates the most concern in respect of potential disputes in a deal.For more information, access the M&amp;A Risk in Review here.About AonAon plc (NYSE: AON) exists to shape decisions for the better — to protect and enrich the lives of people around the world.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Quality Dividend Stocks to Buy. During periods of uncertainty, such as recessions or inflationary environments, dividend stocks often become a preferred choice for investors. This is because dividend stocks can provide a certain level of stability and income even in turbulent times. When it comes to dividend stocks, investing in high-quality companies offers several advantages. Quality dividend stocks are those that have a track record of consistent and reliable dividend payments. These companies are well-established and have histories of generating steady cash flows, strong earnings growth, and solid balance sheets.Dividend growth rate plays a significant role in dividend investing by showcasing a company's capacity to raise its dividend payments over time. When companies can consistently increase their dividends at a healthy rate, it signals their strength and stability as investments. This growth reflects a strong and expanding cash flow, demonstrating their commitment to delivering value to shareholders. Moreover, dividend growers also showed robust performance in the past, compared to their counterparts. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we mentioned data from Ned Davis Research and Hartford Funds, which revealed that dividend growers achieved a return of 9.62% from 1972 to December 31, 2018. In contrast, dividend cutters experienced a negative return of 0.79%. During the same period, the S&amp;P 500 had an average annual return of 7.30%, indicating that dividend growers outperformed the broader market.Also read: 12 Best Long-Term Dividend Stocks To Buy NowInvestors showed great interest in stocks with substantial dividends last year, considering them popular trades in the stock market. However, this preference for dividend-heavy stocks has lost momentum since then due to growing investments in artificial intelligence (AI). According to data by Ned Davis Research, non-dividend-paying stocks in the S&amp;P 500 have experienced a collective gain of approximately 18% in 2023, as of July 1. In contrast, income-generating companies have only seen a modest 4% advance. This marks the weakest first-half performance for dividend-paying stocks compared to non-dividend-paying stocks since 2009.Story continuesHowever, it is important to note that the situation could change in the future, especially since dividend-paying stocks have historically demonstrated a tendency to outperform during periods of economic slowdown. According to a report by Wall Street Journal, there are concerns that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes could potentially lead the economy into a recession. If such a scenario unfolds, defensive companies with substantial dividends could once again outperform. This is because, during an economic downturn, consumers tend to prioritize essential expenses.Analysts also continue to support the stance on dividend stocks, as they see potential and favorable prospects for these stocks throughout the year. Paul Baiocchi, chief ETF strategist at SS&amp;C ALPS Advisors, spoke with WSJ and said that a significant part of the market’s total return has been generated by compounded dividends over time, rather than the price appreciation of the stock market itself. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) are some of the best dividend stocks with decades-long dividend growth track records. In this article, we will further discuss quality dividend stocks to consider.11 Best Quality Dividend Stocks to BuyImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur Methodology:For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 943 hedge funds as of Q1 2023 and selected blue-chip dividend companies with robust balance sheets.

Medtronic is the world’s largest device manufacturer, and it holds the number one or number two market share in most of its product segments. Medtronic’s business is heavily weighted towards complicated in-patient procedures, which are typically quite profitable. Industry dynamics are quite attractive with an aging global population and the growth of improved healthcare in emerging markets; furthermore, most of its segments are highly concentrated with just 2-3 players that split each segment’s market share, affording the key participants with significant economies of scale and pricing power. The Company has been recently addressing several temporary headwinds including a strong dollar, inflation, a delayed recovery in surgical volumes from the coronavirus pandemic, and supply chain issues.

PLD to ride the growth curve so far.The company, which has emerged as a market leader in this asset category, is witnessing solid demand for its facilities, as evident from the leasing, rent and occupancy levels of its properties.Carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), this industrial real estate investment trust (REIT) behemoth has gained 11.1% in the year-to-date period compared with the industry’s growth of 1.9%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet us discuss the factors that supported the uptick.The demand for industrial real estate space is escalating, given the growth in industries and an e-commerce boom. Also, companies’ endeavors to improve supply-chain efficiencies amid the rising demand for logistics infrastructure and efficient distribution networks have aided the need for industrial real estate space.Given this backdrop, Prologis’ portfolio of modern and high-quality logistics facilities continues to benefit from these favorable industrial real estate market fundamentals, driving healthy operating performance.In the first quarter of 2023, the company witnessed robust leasing activity, with 49.7 million square feet (msf) of leases having commenced in its owned and managed portfolio. Of this, 41.6 msf was for the operating portfolio and 8.1 msf was for the development portfolio.Moreover, Prologis' average occupancy level in the owned and managed portfolio was 98% in the quarter and the retention level was 77.2%. The cash rent change represented an all-time high of 41.9%.Prologis has been focusing on acquisitions and developments in strategic markets to enhance its overall portfolio quality and foster external growth. In the first quarter of 2023, the company’s share of building acquisitions amounted to $6 million. Development stabilization aggregated $770 million, while development starts totaled $57 million, with 100% being built to suit. For 2023, it anticipates acquisitions at Prologis share between $300 million and $600 million, whereas development starts are expected to be $2.5-$3 billion.This June, the company entered into a definitive agreement with Blackstone BX to acquire close to 14 million square feet of industrial properties from opportunistic real estate funds affiliated with Blackstone in a cash-funded transaction valued at $3.1 billion.The deal with Blackstone, expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2023, offers a promising 4% cap rate in the initial year and a 5.75% cap rate when adjusted to current market rents. The same is likely to provide Prologis significant opportunity to enhance its growth.This industrial REIT maintains a robust balance-sheet position, which has enabled it to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities. Its liquidity amounted to $5.7 billion as of Mar 31, 2023. Also, Prologis enjoys credit ratings of A3 (Outlook Stable) from Moody’s and A (Outlook Stable) from Standard &amp; Poor’s, rendering it favorable access to the debt market.Solid dividends are a huge attraction for REIT investors, and PLD has remained committed to that. In February 2023, the company’s board hiked its quarterly dividend by 10% to 87 cents per share from 79 cents paid earlier, resulting in an annualized dividend of $3.48 per share. Moreover, PLD has increased its dividend five times in the last five years, and its five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 13.43%. Such efforts boost investors’ confidence in the stock. Check Prologis’ dividend history here.Scheduled to release second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 18 before the opening bell, Prologis is expected to have witnessed year-over-year growth in revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PLD’s quarterly FFO per share is currently pegged at $1.67, suggesting year-over-year growth of 50.5%.Nonetheless, the rising supply in several markets is likely to intensify competition and curb pricing power. The stabilization of e-commerce sales growth and a high interest rate environment raise concerns for Prologis.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Crown Castle Inc. CCI and Ventas VTR, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

281,65c014d3-d0a6-3277-83b1-dec168ce808b,STX,2023-07-14,Analysts Estimate Seagate (STX) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-seagate-stx-report-140102229.html,1689256862,STORY,['STX'],"[The market expects Seagate (STX) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis electronic storage maker is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.21 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -113.2%.Revenues are expected to be $1.68 billion, down 36% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 762.5% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Seagate?For Seagate, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -15.75%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Seagate will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Seagate would post earnings of $0.19 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.28, delivering a surprise of -247.37%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Seagate doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Capital allocation at RHI has been focused on reinvestment, share repurchases, and dividend increases. These factors should result in less overall cyclicality in EPS going forward. The shares are off 40% from its 2022 highs. We feel that the discounted valuation is reflective of current recession worries, which could lower demand for labor.

It’s typically a positive sign to see these increases that suggest that the company is performing well and has a solid foundation to sustain growth.Stocks that have a strong dividend track belong to mature companies, are less susceptible to large swings in the market and act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. These stocks possess superior fundamentals such as a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics that make them promising investments for the long term.Yesterday, two auto players, trucking giant PACCAR PCAR and leading truck engine maker Cummins CMI announced payout hikes. Not only do these stocks have an impressive dividend track record, their payout also appears affordable and safe based on the stocks’ prospects.A Look at PCAR &amp; CMI’s Dividend HistoryPACCAR boasts an uninterrupted streak of paying dividends since 1941. For numerous years, the company has consistently provided annual dividends, encompassing both regular quarterly dividends and additional cash dividends, amounting to approximately 50% of its net income. Over the past two decades, PACCAR's shareholder returns have surpassed the performance of the S&amp;P 500 index.Yesterday, PCAR boosted its quarterly cash dividend by 8% to 27 cents a share. The dividend will be paid out on Sep 7 to shareholders as of Aug 17, 2023. The company has increased its dividend eight times in the past five years, and its payout has grown 4.8% over the same time period. PCAR's payout ratio is currently 15% of earnings. The current dividend yield of the company is 1.16%.(Check PACCAR’s dividend history here).PACCAR Inc. Dividend Yield (TTM)PACCAR Inc. Dividend Yield (TTM)PACCAR Inc. dividend-yield-ttm | PACCAR Inc.

The dividend will be paid out on Sep 7 to shareholders as of Aug 25, 2023. The current dividend yield of the company is 2.44%. CMI increased its dividend six times in the past five years, and its payout has grown 7.42% over the same time period. Its payout ratio of 35 also looks quite sustainable on the back of solid prospects. (Check Cummins’ dividend history here).Cummins Inc. Dividend Yield (TTM)Cummins Inc. Dividend Yield (TTM)Cummins Inc. dividend-yield-ttm | Cummins Inc. QuoteFor those interested in reaping income from their investments, let’s take a closer look at both the stocks.PACCARPACCAR is one of the leading names in the trucking business, with reputed brands like Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF. The DAF lineup, comprising XF and XG models (launched in 2021) and the XD model (launched in 2022), augurs well. The company’s new launches have improved the product mix.PACCAR derives the bulk of its revenues from truck sales. Continued growth in the aftermarket parts — which is a high margin and a less cyclic business — thanks to the rampant adoption of its proprietary MX engine also bodes well. High truck utilization and increased average fleet age are positively impacting PACCAR Parts’ results. An expanding network of parts distribution centers, dealer locations and independent TRP stores, along with managed dealer inventory and innovative e-commerce systems, is aiding the PACCAR Parts segment’s prospects.Investment in advanced technologies offers growth visibility. At the CES 2023, Transportation Hall, PACCAR displayed a battery-powered Peterbilt 579EV, a hydrogen fuel-cell Kenworth T680E and a Peterbilt autonomous Model 579. PACCAR’s Peterbilt Model 579 equipped with the Aurora self-driving system strengthens its portfolio of next-gen offerings. The Kenworth T680E battery-electric truck and Peterbilt 579EV showcase PACCAR’s commitment to providing emissions-free commercial vehicles. Accelerated efforts toward electrification, connected vehicle services and advanced driver-assistance system options are set to bolster PACCAR’s prospects.PACCAR’s strong balance sheet is complemented by A+ and A1 credit ratings assigned by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's, respectively. The company's total debt-to-capital ratio stands at 0.46, lower than its industry's 0.62. The low leverage increases its financial flexibility to tap into growth opportunities.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 sales and EPS implies year-over-year growth of 15.6% and 36.5%, respectively. PCAR surpassed earnings in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 16.6%. The company has a VGM Score of A.CumminsCummins is the largest engine producer in the world and maintains a diverse global footprint. Its commitment to moving toward a carbon-neutral future is commendable. Impressive product portfolio, strong geographic diversification and broad global distribution network boost its long-term prospects. The company's leadership in key technologies for zero tailpipe emissions in commercial and industrial applications, and additional efforts to strengthen its foothold in the domain augur well.Cummins is making significant strides in inorganic growth through the acquisitions of Jacobs Vehicle Systems, Meritor and the Siemens Commercial Vehicles business. The buyout of Meritor has positioned Cummins as a leading provider of integrated powertrain solutions across internal combustion and electric power applications. The Hydrogenic Corp. buyout, investment in Loop Energy and partnership with NPROXX have expanded Cummins’ fuel cell and hydrogen-processing technology capabilities. The introduction of a 15-liter natural gas engine for heavy-duty trucks is a key part in Cummins’ path to a green energy future and offers growth visibility.Cummins’ total debt-to-capital ratio stands at a manageable 0.42. As part of its commitment to increasing shareholder value, Cummins sticks to its plan of returning nearly 50% of its operating cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, which is commendable.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 sales and EPS implies year-over-year growth of 17% and 31%, respectively. The consensus mark for CMI’s 2024 EPS is pegged at $20.27, implying growth of 2.4% year over year. The company has a VGM Score of A.Bottom LineDividends provide a solid level of reassurance to investors. Typically, companies boost payouts when the business is fruitful and they’re confident in their prospects. PCAR and CMI are sound investments in the auto space to rev up your portfolio returns.

Between his long-term track record of success and his homespun wisdom, Buffett is extremely popular in the investment community, and his words are closely followed by analysts and individual investors alike.Check Out: Bank of America Says Stocks Are Headed for ‘Big Collapse’  Discover: 3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000But, as actions speak louder than words, the actual investments that Berkshire Hathaway owns are perhaps the best indicator of which areas of the market Buffett favors. Not surprisingly, as Buffett is a believer in cash flow, many of his top holdings pay significant dividends.If you’re looking for an income-generating investment yourself, here’s a list of some of Berkshire Hathaway’s biggest dividend-paying holdings that you might want to consider.Apple (AAPL)Stock price as of July 13, 2023: $190.54If you’re a believer in Buffett, you absolutely must own Apple. At the 2023 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, Buffet said Apple is better than any other company he owns and that he’s happy with every additional share he acquires.According to Buffett, people are more willing to give up their second car than their iPhone, and that type of company loyalty is valuable. While Apple may not pay a huge dividend — just $0.96 per share, for a yield of 0.51% — that’s a lot of cash for Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway.But beyond its dividend, Apple is the largest company in the world, and it makes up roughly 7.5% of the entire S&amp;P 500. This is why many analysts say, “As goes Apple, so goes the market.”Find: 10 Stocks That Could Be the Next Apple or AmazonChevron (CVX)Stock price as of July 13, 2023: $157.51Even with the rise of electric vehicles and growing environmental sentiment, oil will remain an essential part of the world’s economy for the foreseeable future. Chevron, one of Berkshire Hathaway’s largest holdings, pays a fat dividend of $6.04 per share, for a yield of 3.78%.Story continuesThose factors alone make Chevron an interesting play for dividend investors. Analysts have a buy rating on the stock, with a 12-month average price target of $187.89, good enough for a 17% pop over current levels, on top of the generous dividend.Bank of America (BAC)Stock price as of July 13, 2023: $29.67Bank of America occupies the second-largest position in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, at 8.1%. That equates to ownership of 13.1% of all of the outstanding shares of Bank of America, making it a serious bet.The bank’s 3% dividend yield is more than investors can earn on Bank of America’s own savings accounts, making the equity ownership just a kicker. As a long-term value investor who prefers what he calls “simple businesses” like banks, Buffett is dedicated to Bank of America and its modest price-earnings ratio of just 8.83.With such a generous dividend yield, long-term investors like Buffett can afford to wait for equity appreciation while banking all of that income. If that’s the type of investment personality you have, Bank of America may be worth a look.Coca-Cola (KO)Stock price as of July 13, 2023: $60.35Analysts like Coca-Cola almost as much as Buffett does, with a consensus strong buy rating and an average 12-month price target of $70.25, about 17% above current levels. But the company also sports a healthy 3.07% dividend yield, paying out $1.84 per share annually.Companies like Coca-Cola are right in the wheelhouse of Buffett, who prefers “simple” businesses that continually generate free cash flow and have huge barriers to entry. Although Coke is in a continual battle with archrival Pepsi, it would be hard if not impossible for some new soda maker to suddenly appear on the scene and take out Coca-Cola’s dominant global position.Even if the company’s stock price were to stall, its dividend — which it has paid and raised without fail for an incredible 61 straight years — seems unlikely to go away.American Express (AXP)Stock price as of July 13, 2023: $174.24American Express fits in with the Buffett philosophy of “simple” quality companies that are well run and have loyal followers. In fact, the Oracle of Omaha is so enamored of American Express that Berkshire Hathaway owns a whopping 20.4% of the company.Buffett once told American Express CEO Stephen Squeri, “The most important thing about American Express is the brand and the customers that aspire to be associated with the brand.”American Express doesn’t pay quite as high a dividend as some of the other companies in Berkshire’s portfolio — $2.40 per share annually, for a yield of 1.38% — but it has been a consistent, long-term winner.More From GOBankingRatesI'm a Financial Advisor Who Knows What Retirees Actually Do With Their Savings (It Might Surprise You)Costco's 7 Best Premade Meals To Save You Money3 Ways to Recession Proof Your RetirementTake our poll: How will you achieve your financial goals?This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Warren Buffett’s Favorite Dividend Stocks — Should You Invest?]"

The oldest holding is Coca-Cola, which Warren Buffett bought in 1988. He famously loves Coke and supposedly used to drink 5 to 6 cans a day.35 Years in Coca-ColaThe Coca-Cola Company (KO) is now Berkshire’s 5th largest position, as the company keeps adding to its Occidental Petroleum position and that is now the third largest.Thirty-five years in one stock is impressive. From June 1, 1988 to July 11, 2023, Coca-Cola is up 2,420% without dividends. That beats the S&amp;P 500 which is up 1,605%.But Coca-Cola remains the only stock still in the Berkshire portfolio from the 1980s. Stocks from the 1990s are rare too.Long-Term Stocks are Rare in the Berkshire Portfolio1.       American Express Co. (AXP)American Express was first bought by Berkshire Hathaway in 1994. It is another successful long-term position for the portfolio. Shares of American Express are up 2066% from the end of Q1 1994 to July 11, 2023 while the S&amp;P 500 was up 889% during that time (note, in the podcast, Tracey mistakenly says that it was up just 175%).American Express is currently a cheap stock. It trades at 15.6x forward earnings. Shares of American Express are up 18.1% year-to-date.But it remains the only stock bought in the 1990s red-hot bull market which is still in the portfolio. Why?2.       Moody’s Corp. (MCO)Moody’s is the 9th largest position in the Berkshire portfolio now. It was first added to the portfolio in the first quarter of 2001 so that means it has been in the portfolio for 22 years. That makes it the third oldest position.Story continuesMoody’s has also outperformed the S&amp;P 500, gaining 2122% since 2001 versus the S&amp;P 500 up 258%. Shares are also up in 2023, adding 26.2%. Moody’s is no longer a value stock by P/E as it trades at 35x.Should it matter that Moody’s is no longer an actual value?3.       The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. (PG)Stocks from the early 2000s are now rare in the Berkshire portfolio as Buffett has sold many of his banks that he bought in that time period. But Procter &amp; Gamble was added in the first quarter of 2005, so that means Berkshire has owned it for 18 years.Procter &amp; Gamble has underperformed however. It’s up just 148% in those 18 years compared to 278% for the S&amp;P 500, without dividends. Procter &amp; Gamble is not cheap, with a forward P/E of 23.4.Will Procter &amp; Gamble make it to the 20-year mark?4.       Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)Do you know that Berkshire Hathaway owns shares of Amazon? It bought them in the first quarter of 2019. It hasn’t added to the position, nor has it sold any of Amazon, in that four-year period.Amazon hasn’t been a great investment for the portfolio, so far. It’s up 33.5% since the last day of the first quarter of 2019 and July 11, 2023. The S&amp;P 500 is up 51.8% during that period.Will Amazon be a forever stock for Berkshire Hathaway?Should You Really Hold a Stock for Forever?  Tune into this week’s podcast to find out.[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of AMZN in her personal portfolio.]Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

AYI has been benefitting from product vitality and service in its lighting and space businesses. Also, its focus on product innovation and strategic acquisitions &amp; divestitures bodes well. However, high R&amp;D costs and volatile business environment is a concern.Shares of AYI have gained 5.1% in the past three months compared with the Zacks industry’s rise of 1.9%.Let’s discuss the factors substantiating its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGrowth DriversAcuity Brands’ diversified portfolio of innovative lighting control solutions and energy-efficient luminaries bode well for the company. AYI is making significant strides in its Lighting and Spaces businesses with a solid strategy. Its focus on innovation through product vitality and increasing service levels for the benefit of customers has delivered strong results.During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the company launched Design Select to elevate its services for the specification community. The addition of Design Select is a significant enhancement to the company's service strategy, offering clear categorization of ABL Lighting and Lighting Control products.The company is focused on its Intelligent Spaces Group (ISG), specializes in providing products and services that enhance the intelligence, safety and sustainability of spaces. ISG products and solutions are marketed under multiple brand names, including but not limited to Atrius and Distech Controls. The company achieved significant milestones in the third quarter fiscal 2023, particularly within Distech and Atrius. Distech's strategic focus on expanding addressable market progressed successfully through geographic expansion. The company's strategy for Atrius centers around establishing a data layer that bridges the gap between edge and cloud, enabling the development of impactful applications for build spaces.The company is committed to expand its geographic borders and product portfolio through acquisitions and joint ventures. During the third-quarter fiscal 2023, the company’s acquired KE2 Therm, enabling the company to enter the commercial refrigeration control space, expanding Distech's market reach. This development is in line with the current refrigeration industry’s rising demand for CO2 solutions, where digital controls ensure safety, efficiency, reliability and cost savings for customers.Story continuesHeadwindsThe company operates in a highly competitive industry that is affected by volatility owing to a number of general business and economic factors, such as gross domestic product growth, employment levels, credit availability, energy costs and commodity costs. During third-quarter fiscal 2023, the company reported net sales of $1.0 billion, falling 5.7% from $1.1 billion reported in the prior-year period. The downside was due to declines in sales within ABL segment, consistent with lead-time normalization trends and the impact of the wider macro-environment. The company is going through supply chain challenges and rising cost of some components. Although the incremental cost of the technology is relatively low, real cost of installation of that technology is still growing.Key PicksSome top-ranked stocks from the Zacks Construction sector are: Dycom Industries, Inc.

VMC, Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. MLM, Eagle Materials Inc. EXP and Summit Materials, Inc. SUM.Industry: Concrete &amp; AggregatesLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2119887/4-stocks-to-buy-from-promising-concrete-aggregates-industryA boost in infrastructural and public construction spending should continue to favor the Zacks Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates industry. An improving residential construction market and favorable pricing dynamics have also been aiding companies in navigating hard times. Indeed, macroeconomic uncertainties, supply-chain disruptions, weather-related woes and higher labor costs are causes of concern. Nonetheless, prominent companies in the industry, likeVulcan Materials Co., Martin Marietta Materials, Inc., Eagle Materials Inc. and Summit Materials, Inc., have been gaining from the positives.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates industry consists of manufacturers, distributors and sellers of construction materials, like aggregates and concrete, along with other related items for public infrastructure, residential and non-residential, as well as other end markets. The materials also include gypsum wallboard, recycled paperboard, concrete blocks, ready-mix concrete, and oil and gas proppants. The industry players are also involved in designing, engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and installation of external building products for commercial, residential, and repair and remodel markets in domestic as well as international markets.3 Trends Shaping the Future of Concrete &amp; Aggregates IndustryFocus on Reviving Infrastructure: On Nov 15, 2021, President Joe Biden signed a bipartisan infrastructure bill of $550 billion, in addition to the approved funds of $450 billion for five years in August 2021. Total spending may go up to $1.2 trillion if the plan is extended to eight years. This bill comprises new investments in almost every infrastructure sector over the next five-year period, including transportation, energy, broadband and water.Story continuesOut of the total allotted spending, the infrastructure development law will provide $100 billion toward roads, bridges and other major projects. It will invest $66 billion in freight and passenger rail, including potential upgrades to Amtrak.The project will allocate $11 billion to reduce car crashes and fatalities through a ""Safe Streets for All"" program. The Biden administration's endeavor to pump money for rebuilding the nation's roads, bridges and other infrastructure would give construction companies like Vulcan, Martin Marietta and others a solid foundation for growth.Acquisitions &amp; Focus on Operating Efficiency: The industry participants follow a well-chalked-out acquisition plan to enhance domestic and international portfolios. Moreover, companies are increasingly focusing on reducing controllable costs and maximizing operating efficiency across business lines to generate higher earnings and cash flows. The industry players have also been experiencing a solid pricing environment across their product portfolios, thereby helping to boost margins.Fluctuation in Input Prices, Weather Woes &amp; Shortage of Skilled Labors: The industry players are struggling with escalating material expenses, the shortage of skilled laborers and rising wage costs. The companies use electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources. Hence, supply-related woes and significant fluctuations in the prices of these resources affect operating results.Also, businesses are exposed to weather-related risks affecting production schedules and profitability. Excessive rainfall, flooding or severe droughts jeopardize shipments and production. The first and fourth quarters are mostly affected by winter. Again, hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf Coast are most active during these quarters. These impediments may bump up costs and mar the industry participants' profits.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates industry is an eight-stock group within the broader Zacks Construction sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #12, which places it in the top 5% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates impressive near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

If you want to skip our industry introduction, then take a look at the Top 5 Big Data Analytics Companies of 2023. Data analytics is all the buzz these days. Advances in computing, technology, and industrialization have expanded business operations by quite a bit and also allowed companies to collect copious amounts of data to generate new insights.This growth in data analytics over the years has also led major semiconductor firms such as Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) to offer two categories of central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs). One set of these are for consumers, primarily for everyday use in laptops and desktops, while the other is used in large scale data centers for enterprise computing. While all big data uses data centers, not all data centers are used for big data analytics since the data that must be stored on a site must exceed 1 Petabyte to be classified as big data.So how big is the big data market? Well, to answer this question we'll have to individually look at its hardware and software constituents. The hardware portion was worth $279 billion last year and is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.3% until 2032 to be worth $656 billion by the end of the forecast period. Within this segment, the information technology segment is the biggest, as it accounts for 35% of the market. Hinting at the importance of big data to the data center market, the hyperscale segment which consists of products that are capable of scaling up data centers to thousands of servers was the biggest product type, controlling 43% of the market.Comparing the data center market with the big data and data analytics market shows that this segment was worth $198 billion in 2020 and it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 13.5% between 2021 and 2030 to be worth $684 billion by then. Off site computing was one of the rare industries that actually boomed during the coronavirus pandemic as businesses were forced to deal with more computing and data due to work from home requirements. Software and services are the biggest portion of this market, and geographically, Asia Pacific is expected to be the fastest growing region, since it is expected to outpace the broader market through a growth rate of 17.5%.Story continuesShifting our focus from the broader industries to the firms that operate in, there are quite a bit of firms that have a presence in the industry. These include firms like Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) which operate on the software side of data analytics and allow companies to consolidate their business data into single platforms to enable data driven insights and decision making. Oracle's big data solutions allow for consolidating large scale data into databases under a variety of languages and parameters through systems such as SQL, Hadoop, Kafka, and Spark. While these are primarily data storage and access platforms, the Oracle big data analytics platform also lets data scientists build and deploy machine learning models that leverage programming languages such as Python.Another firm whose platform is crucial to big data analytics is the technology giant Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Microsoft's Azure is one of the biggest enterprise computing platforms in the industry, and it enables big data analytics under Microsoft's Intelligent Data Platform. Here's what the firm had to say about this platform's capabilities and market performance during its latest earnings call:Our Intelligent Data Platform brings together databases, analytics and governance, so organizations can spend more time creating value and less time integrating their data estate. Cosmos DB is the go-to database, powering the world’s most demanding workloads at any scale. OpenAI relies on Cosmos DB to dynamically scale their ChatGPT service, one of the fastest-growing consumer apps ever, enabling high reliability and low maintenance.The NBA uses Cosmos DB to ingest more than 10 million data points per game, helping teams optimize their gameplay. And we are taking share with our analytics solutions. Companies like BP, Canadian Tire, Marks &amp; Spencer and T-Mobile all rely on our end-to-end analytics to improve speed to insight.Now on to developers.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the top big data and data analytics companies in the world.

The proposal concerning this IRP is currently being evaluated by the Michigan Public Service Commission for approval.Benefits of the AgreementThe CleanVision IRP includes an investment strategy worth $11 billion in DTE’s clean energy transition over the next decade, which, in turn, is projected to reduce the future cost of clean energy transformation for its customers by $2.5 billion.This IRP will also enable the development of more than 15,000 megawatts (MW) of renewable energy in Michigan by 2042. DTE Energy also aims to build 780 MW of energy storage through 2030, with a further goal of developing more than 1,800 MW of storage by 2042 as part of this IRP.Apart from expanding its renewable energy portfolio, the CleanVision IRP  entails the termination of the company’s coal usage by 2032, thereby surpassing its prior goal to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.In 2022, 22% of the total electricity generated by utility-scale electricity generation facilities in the United States came from renewable energy sources, as stated by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. With the entire nation rapidly shifting toward more clean energy sources, this percentage will increase.Considering this, we may conclude that the latest agreement settled by DTE Energy will strengthen its position in the expanding U.S. renewable energy market.Utilities’ Growing Focus on Clean EnergyTo reap the benefits of America’s expanding renewable energy market, utilities such as Xcel Energy Inc. XEL, PPL Corp. PPL and Ameren Corp. AEE are also transitioning faster toward clean energy.Xcel Energy boasts an investment plan of $1.03 billion during 2023-2027, in addition to potential incremental investment opportunities of $1.5-$3 billion during the same time frame. The approval of its Minnesota and Colorado resource plans in 2022 will add about 10,000 MW of utility-scale renewables to its portfolio and is expected to reduce carbon emissions by at least 80% by 2030.XEL’s long-term (three- to five-year) earnings growth rate is pegged at 6.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 sales indicates an increase of 0.6% over 2022’s reported figure.In December 2022, PPL Corp.’s subsidiary Louisville Gas and Electric Company and Kentucky Utilities Company filed with the Kentucky Public Service Commission to approve adding nearly 1,000 MW of solar generation, 125 MW of battery storage, more than 1,200 MW of combined-cycle natural gas and retiring 1,500 MW of aging coal generation to its portfolio.PPL’s long-term earnings growth rate is 7.4%.

303,31725670-68bc-37cf-a7b3-e20075d7a37b,MDLZ,2023-07-14,Millennial and Gen Z ‘treat culture’ is boosting PepsiCo in a world of inflation: ‘I’m going to treat myself to a Mountain Dew’,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/treat-culture-helping-pepsico-world-083719249.html,1689323839,STORY,"['PEP', 'MDLZ']","[Rising prices may have pushed American consumers to delay buying a new washing machine, a smartphone or a house.But it’s not stopping them from picking up a pack of chips on the way home.PepsiCo, the owner of brands like Pepsi, Mountain Dew and Lay's, reported expectations-beating revenue and profit on Thursday, with executives citing a continued interest in the company’s products despite price hikes.Consumers “want that affordable luxury because they still have some money in their pockets,” PepsiCo CFO Hugh Johnston told the Wall Street Journal. “I’m going to fill my car up with gas, and I’m going to treat myself to a Mountain Dew and a bag of Lay's.”PepsiCo increased prices of its products by around 15% on average throughout the quarter, and Johnston said the hikes were needed to keep up with rising commodity prices. Yet most consumers were willing to pay those higher prices, even though sales volumes fell across several parts of the company, including its packaged-food business in North America.PepsiCo generated $22.3 billion in revenue in the quarter ending June 17, a 10.4% year-on-year jump. The company earned $2.7 billion in net income, almost double what it earned this time last year.Inflation in the U.S. has cooled significantly. The consumer price index rose by 3% in June, significantly lower than the 9.1% increase reported the year before.PepsiCo also raised its full-year guidance for both revenue and profit. Shares rose by 2.4% on Thursday.'Treat culture'The earnings of PepsiCo and other snack companies could be lifted by new tastes among the younger U.S. consumers, who increasingly adhere to “treat culture,” or the idea of buying a small luxury to get through the day.In the face of tough macroeconomic conditions, more tiring working conditions and increasing cost-of-living, millennial and Gen-Z consumers are turning to smaller purchases, like snacks, escapist entertainment and clothes.Story continuesYounger consumers are also just snacking more in general. Half of U.S. consumers, and primarily millennials and Gen-Z, now have three or more snacks a day, according to the Circana Group, a market research firm.

With 55% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).And things are looking up for institutional investors after the company gained US$3.3b in market cap last week.

View our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Occidental Petroleum?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Occidental Petroleum. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Occidental Petroleum's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Occidental Petroleum. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 25% of shares outstanding. With 10% and 6.7% of the shares outstanding respectively, Dodge &amp; Cox and The Vanguard Group, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.To make our study more interesting, we found that the top 5 shareholders control more than half of the company which implies that this group has considerable sway over the company's decision-making.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Occidental PetroleumWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Occidental Petroleum Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$149m worth of shares.

(BRK.B) further boosted its stake in Occidental Petroleum Corporation OXY amid its falling share prices. This is thereby widening Berkshire Hathaway’s lead as the largest shareholder in Occidental.The bet on the oil and gas major signals a bullish outlook for the energy sector as a whole. Thus, energy players like Oceaneering International, Inc. OII, Ecopetrol S.A. EC and Battalion Oil Corporation BATL are well-poised to gain.Berkshire Hathaway Lifts OXY StakeBerkshire Hathaway recently announced in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it has increased its stake in Occidental to more than 25%. Berkshire Hathaway bought 2.14 million more Occidental shares for $122.1 million. This makes the Omaha, NE-headquartered holding company’s total ownership of the oil and gas player 224.13 million shares.The recent investment signals the willingness of the holding company to explore new investment opportunities and pour money into a company that is highly exposed to volatility in oil and gas prices. This reflects that Warren Buffett is probably bullish on oil prices since the fate of the energy player is mostly dependent on crude prices.Oil Price to Remain FavorableThe U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) has also expressed bullishness on oil prices in its short-term energy outlook. Currently, West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) oil and Brent crude are trading at more than $75 per barrel and $80 per barrel marks, respectively. The pricing environment will remain favorable, as echoed in EIA’s healthy projection of $74.43 per barrel and $79.34 per barrel for WTI and Brent oil for this year.The expectation is handsome, despite lower year-over-year prices since the projected commodity prices will still be promising for exploration and production activities. EIA, in its short-term energy outlook, added that anticipation of declining oil inventories, across the globe, over the next five quarters will create upward pressure on oil prices.Story continues3 Stocks to BuyGiven the backdrop, it can be concluded that investors should allocate money to stocks of the companies whose operations are directly correlated with oil prices and are capable of capitalizing on the favorable business landscape. Employing our proprietary stock screener, we have zeroed in on three stocks sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Oceaneering International is well placed on improving oil prices since it is a leading provider of engineered services and products and robotic solutions to the energy companies working offshore. Higher oil price is supporting increased upstream activities, which, in turn, will improve demand for Oceaneering’s drilling and completions support services.Ecopetrol is a well-known integrated energy player in the American continent, with Permian – the most prolific basin in the United States – being a prominent growth driver. Ecopetrol is responsible for as high as 60% of hydrocarbon production in Colombia and thus is well-positioned to derive more cashflows from improving oil prices.Battalion Oil is also a highly prospective stock to gain on healthy oil prices since it is engaged in exploring, producing and developing liquid-rich resources in the prolific Delaware Basin. Battalion Oil is a pure-play Delaware operator with a deep inventory of high-return locations, securing a solid production outlook.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Variables depend on your retirement account’s tax structure, age, risk tolerance, and personal investment preferences. Still, a solid retirement plan is diversified across multiple industries and offers exposure to various investments. Investors optimizing their retirement stock picks should look for companies with solid historical performance, future potential, and investor-friendly financials. Dividends are critical for late-stage retirement investors to generate income for their accounts. For younger investors, they’re also helpful in growing their allocation for “free” through dividend reinvestment. Many investors tweak and modify their retirement portfolios over time, reducing risk as they age. Still, these three stocks are perfect for a buy-and-hold strategy today. If you invest $1,000 in any of these stocks, you may not need to touch them until you retire.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe Home Depot (HD)a Home Depot store is seen from the outsideSource: Cassiohabib / Shutterstock.comHome Depot (NYSE:HD) felt a rough patch this year caused by overall market shakiness and a particularly hard hit to housing caused by rate hikes. This drop in stock price and its undeniable longevity make the stock perfect for investing $1,000 today. Home Depot has a wide moat, meaning it faces little threat from new entrants or current competitors. While Home Depot remains the go-to option for home improvement hobbyists and weekend warriors, its recent initiatives target other groups. Higher sales to the larger-scale renovation teams, contractors, and builders improve its outlook for the homebuilding industry once the sector begins rebounding. Reinforcing this outlook, Home Depot plans to build 80 new stores over the next five years. The move indicates that management sees demand rising throughout the 2020s. Home Depot’s expansion also positions the company to capture an imminent surge in renovations and new builds as home prices level.Story continuesHome Depot remains committed to dividend distribution and growth, having reliably increased its annual dividend over the past ten years and doubled the quarterly payout since 2018. Its 0.465 payout ratio indicates that, while management sees benefit in returning value to shareholders, they aren’t overextending. Instead, they also retain sufficient cash to grow the enterprise.  Slightly undervalued today, Home Depot is a perfect pick among retirement stocks if you want to invest $1,000 today.  Occidental Petroleum (OXY)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Occidental Petroleum website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comWarren Buffett is still pumping cash into Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), which should make any retirement-focused investor pause and consider the stock for their portfolio. Owning more than 25%, Buffett’s long-term strategy indicates that OXY may be the perfect buy-and-hold stock for investors interested in company longevity and reliability. In fact, Buffett praised the current company management’s executive prowess and foresight this Spring. He assured shareholders the firm was on the correct track when he said OXY had “the right management running it” in a May shareholder meeting.Oil and gas investors often push for dividend stability and sustainable growth over breakneck advancements. Occidental Petroleum easily jumps that hurdle. The company offers a 7.89% total yield, calculated by combining dividend distributions and share buybacks. Both these corporate actions return value to shareholders. This ratio makes OXY ideal for investors seeking returns beyond the risk-free rate while capturing upside as energy markets recover. Although fossil fuels may have a limited outlook over a long period, OXY recognizes the need to adapt. The company’s long affirmed its commitment to net-zero initiatives and remains an industry leader in developing innovative sustainable solutions. The firm plans to operationalize the world’s largest direct air capture plant in 2024. These facilities reduce and remove carbon emissions, setting them apart from lagging peers.Between Buffett’s endorsement, commitment to shareholder value, and forward-thinking initiatives, OXY is an ideal investment for retirement-focused portfolios. Merck &amp; Co., Inc.Merck (MRK) logo outside of corporate buildingSource: Atmosphere1 / Shutterstock.comMerck &amp; Co., INC. (NYSE:MRK), a global pharmaceutical stock, is well-positioned to capture an aging population and take advantage of a worldwide healthcare market expected to grow 22% by 2030. Merck has a long drug pipeline, nearly half near regulatory approval and market sale. The company’s approach to patent management also means that it faces reduced competition from generic providers over time and may be able to retain its wide moat. Merck’s financials are also beyond reproach, as the company boasts a growing free cash flow ratio to fund pricy drug discovery and market existing options. Merck also offers investors a 53% payout ratio, demonstrating it can manage top-line growth and value return to shareholders in a challenging environment. Merck offers industry diversification, healthy financial management, and a global resilience factor for retirement portfolios.

But the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) share price is up 56% in the last five years, slightly above the market return. We're also happy to report the stock is up a healthy 41% in the last year.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. View our latest analysis for Boston Scientific There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, Boston Scientific managed to grow its earnings per share at 48% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 9% over the same period. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company. Having said that, the market is still optimistic, given the P/E ratio of 89.71.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Boston Scientific has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Boston Scientific has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 41% in the last twelve months. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 9%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for Boston Scientific   (of which 1 is significant!) you should know about.Story continuesBut note: Boston Scientific may not be the best stock to buy.

ANGO reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 2 cents for fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 compared with the year-ago EPS of a penny. However, the adjusted EPS lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 33.3%.GAAP loss per share was 54 cents, wider than the year-over-year loss of 16 cents per share.Full-year adjusted loss per share was 6 cents against the break-even EPS at the end of the comparable fiscal 2022 period. The figure was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Revenue DetailsRevenues in the fiscal fourth quarter totaled $91.1 million, up 4.7% year over year on a reported basis (up 4.9% at constant exchange rate or CER). The top line topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.4%.The company continued to see strong contributions from its Med Tech (which include the Auryon peripheral atherectomy platform, the thrombus management platform and the NanoKnife irreversible electroporation platform) and Med Device businesses during the quarter.Full-year revenues were $338.8 million, reflecting a 7.1% uptick on a reported basis from the comparable fiscal 2022 period. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate marginally by 0.1%.At CER, full-year revenues were up 7.5%.Geographical AnalysisIn the quarter under review, U.S. net revenues totaled $74.4 million, up 0.9% year over year.This figure compares to our U.S. net revenues’ fiscal fourth-quarter projection of $76.2 million.International revenues came in at $16.6 million, up 25.1% from the year-ago quarter on a reported basis and up 26.2% at CER.This figure compares to our fiscal fourth-quarter International revenues’ projection of $14.3 million.Segmental AnalysisAngioDynamics derives revenues from two businesses — Med Tech and Med Device.The Med Tech business’ net sales in the fiscal fourth quarter were $26.5 million, reflecting an uptick of 17.2% year over year. This was primarily on the back of increased net sales of Auryon amounting to $11.8 million (up 22%) and NanoKnife disposable sales of $4.6 million (up 28%) compared with the prior-year quarter. AlphaVac sales in the reported quarter were $1.8 million, up 86.9% year over year. However, the improvement in the Med Tech segment was partially offset by a decline of 8.3% in AngioVac sales which amounted to $6.1 million in the quarter.Story continuesThis figure compares to our fiscal fourth quarter’s Med Tech business’ net sales projection of $26.9 million.Med Device revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter grossed $64.6 million, up 0.3% from the year-ago period. This was primarily driven by strength in AngioDynamics’ angiographic products and the dialysis business.This figure compares to our fiscal fourth quarter’s Med Device business’ net sales projection of $63.6 million.AngioDynamics, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseAngioDynamics, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseAngioDynamics, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | AngioDynamics, Inc. QuoteMargin AnalysisIn the quarter under review, AngioDynamics’ gross profit fell 0.2% to $46.4 million. The gross margin contracted 250 basis points (bps) to 50.9%.We had projected 52.1% of gross margin for fourth-quarter fiscal 2023.Sales and marketing expenses fell 2% to $26.3 million year over year. Research and development expenses decreased 0.1% year over year to $7.9 million, whereas general and administrative expenses declined 7.9% year over year to $10.2 million.

The adjusted operating margin in the fiscal fourth quarter expanded 142 bps to 2.2%.Cash PositionAngioDynamics exited fiscal 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $44.6 million compared with $28.8 million at the end of fiscal 2022. The long-term debt (net of current portion) at the end of fiscal 2023 was $49.8 million compared with $25 million at the end of fiscal 2022.Cumulative net cash provided by operating activities was $78 million against net cash used in operating activities of $7.2 million a year ago.FY24 GuidanceAngioDynamics has initiated its guidance for fiscal 2024.The company expects its net sales in the range of $328 million-$333 million.The adjusted loss per share is projected to be between 28 cents and 34 cents.Our TakeAngioDynamics exited the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 with better-than-expected revenues. The quarter’s adjusted EPS performance and a solid uptick in the overall top line were impressive. Robust domestic and international revenues were also encouraging. The company continued gaining from its Med Tech and Med Device businesses, which was promising. Robust sales of Auryon and NanoKnife looked encouraging. Continued positive physician feedback for both the F22 and F18 versions of AlphaVac also bodes well. The expansion of the adjusted operating margin augurs well.On the fiscal fourth-quarter earnings call, AngioDynamics’ management confirmed that it is currently preparing to launch a new version of the Auryon product for use in the lower extremities segment of the venous thrombectomy market. Management also confirmed that the APEX study, evaluating AlphaVac F18 as a treatment for pulmonary embolism, is more than 50% enrolled and expects to complete enrollment this winter and submit the results to the FDA in the first half of the calendar year 2024. These raise optimism about the stock.However, AngioDynamics’ lower-than-expected EPS and lower revenues from AngioVac sales in the fiscal fourth quarter were disappointing. The gross margin contraction does not bode well. Continued supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures also raise apprehension.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksAngioDynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks from the broader medical space that are supposed to report earnings soon are DexCom, Inc.

MMSI is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its strong product portfolio. The optimism led by solid first-quarter 2023 performance and international exposure are expected to contribute further. However, headwinds due to forex woes and stiff competition persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 62.7% compared with a 22.2% rise of the industry and a 17.8% growth of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned medical devices provider has a market capitalization of $4.88 billion. The company projects 11% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. It has delivered an earnings surprise of 20.2% for the past four quarters, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Strong Product Portfolio: Merit Medical has continued to gain significant momentum on the back of new products. The company is upbeat about the product pipeline, including radio and electrophysiology products, raising investors’ optimism. It has several electrophysiology products that are either on track for release or in several other stages of development.In March, Merit Medical announced the expansion of its SwiftNINJA Steerable Microcatheter product line, which belongs to its delivery systems portfolio.International Exposure: We are optimistic about Merit Medical’s worldwide product distribution network, which includes territories in Europe, the Middle East, Africa (EMEA) and Asia, among others. During the first quarter of 2023, Merit Medical’s management confirmed that the most upside versus expectations was registered in the EMEA region, where the year-over-year growth was primarily driven by demand in France, Germany, the Middle East and Spain.Excluding China, sales in APAC also increased, fueled by growth in Japan and strong contributions and growth from sales to customers in both Australia and Korea. In the Rest of World region, Merit Medical’s robust year-over-year growth was driven by solid growth in Latin America, Brazil and Mexico.Story continuesStrong Q1 Results: Merit Medical’s robust first-quarter 2023 results buoy optimism. The company witnessed a year-over-year uptick in the top and bottom lines. Solid revenue growth in both its segments and across all the product categories within its Cardiovascular unit was also recorded. Robust performances in the United States and outside were also seen.DownsidesForex Woes: Merit Medical has been expanding its operations outside the United States. This has led to the company becoming increasingly subject to market risk relating to foreign currency, which could have a negative impact on its margins and financial results. If the rate of exchange between foreign currencies declines against the U.S. dollar, Merit Medical may not be able to increase the prices charged from its customers for products whose prices are denominated in those respective foreign currencies.Stiff Competition: Merit Medical operates in highly competitive markets, where it faces competition from many companies with greater resources.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Currently, both VAREX IMAGING and Boston Scientific are holding a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.VREX currently has a forward P/E ratio of 19.80, while BSX has a forward P/E of 26.92. We also note that VREX has a PEG ratio of 0.66. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. BSX currently has a PEG ratio of 2.35.Another notable valuation metric for VREX is its P/B ratio of 1.76. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities.

As part of the Business Coalition for the Equality Act, we also support the reintroduction of the Equality Act in Congress.""As a corporate ally to the LGBTQ+ community, we are dedicated to making Boston Scientific a place where people feel safe and valued,"" says Meghan Scanlon, president, Urology, and executive sponsor of the PRIDE (Promoting Respect, Inclusion, Diversity and Equality) employee resource group (ERG). ""And when people feel free to bring their authentic selves to work every day, we know that they can be more innovative and engaged, making us a stronger and higher-performing company as a result.""Take a look at the numerous ways we support the LGBTQ+ community at Boston Scientific and beyond, both during Pride Month and all year round.Advancing LGBTQ+ talent in the workplaceBoston Scientific makes it a point to identify, participate in and sponsor recruitment events for underrepresented groups with an eye toward hiring and developing a more diverse workforce.That focus on diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&amp;I) applies to the suppliers we hire as well. In the U.S., we work with businesses that are small or disadvantaged, and those owned by ethnic minorities, women, veterans, service-disabled individuals, individuals with disabilities and LGBTQ+ individuals. To that end, we're a member and supporter of groups such as the HRC, the National LGBT Chamber of Commerce and the Diversity Alliance for Science.DE&amp;I efforts at Boston Scientific are designed and strengthened with input from our employee resource groups. Around the world, Boston Scientific is proud to have 20 chapters of our PRIDE ERG, with the newest chapter recently launched in Mississauga, Canada. Through seminars, educational events and networking opportunities, the PRIDE ERG plays a critical role in promoting LGBTQ+ education and awareness inside and outside the company's doors.Story continues""In 15 years at Boston Scientific, I feel it's only been a benefit to be who I am: out and proud,"" says Anna London, a regional sales manager based in Sydney who launched the Asia Pacific PRIDE ERG in 2020. ""As soon as you step inside a Boston Scientific office or warehouse or manufacturing site, you're included, valued. Even seeing little Pride flags around, or people's pronouns on Microsoft - these may seem like small things, but they mean a lot to people who are LGBTQ+.""Educating physicians about caring for LGBTQ+ patientsIn early 2020, Boston Scientific launched EDUCARE: a free online platform offering personalized, on-demand education and training content in 18 different specialties, including procedural videos, case studies, access to Continuing Education and webinar opportunities. Since then, more than 38,000 people have used EDUCARE around the world.This year, Boston Scientific engaged Equitas Health, a recognized expert in serving the needs of the LGBTQ+ community, to create a new course: Clinical and Professional Considerations for the LGBTQ+ Population. Through taking the course, physicians will learn about LGBTQ+ health disparities and inequities and how to improve the care experience for LGBTQ+ patients.""Often, the care LGBTQ+ people receive is not culturally competent, which may keep them from getting the screenings and treatment they need,"" says Scanlon. ""This short, simple training could help empower physicians to better care for this community and help ensure LGBTQ+ patients get the medical attention they need.""Providing a range of inclusive benefitsOur inclusive benefits cover family planning assistance - including adoption, fertility and surrogacy assistance programs - and eight weeks paid leave for all new parents, no matter their sexual orientation or gender identity. In the U.S., transgender-inclusive services and treatments that follow standards set by the World Professional Association of Transgender Health (WPATH) are covered as well.Boston Scientific also offers resources to help employees find in-network LGBTQ+ health care providers, travel safety resources and support groups for themselves and their families.And we continue to expand our benefit programs and services globally. Recently, for instance, we increased domestic partner health care coverage for employees in Ireland and extended parental leave in Japan.Ensuring employees know they belong at Boston ScientificOur efforts to stand up for greater inclusion and the LGBTQ+ community have not gone unnoticed: Boston Scientific has been recognized as a Best Workplaces for LGBTQ+ Equality for eight consecutive years based on the HRC Foundation's Corporate Equality Index.We've also been named to the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index five times and added to the Forbes World's Best Employers list-which is compiled based on employee ratings of their workplaces based on gender equality, corporate social responsibility, culture and other factors-for three years in a row.But we know that there is much more work to do.""Boston Scientific is making meaningful progress when it comes to diversity, equity and inclusion, and we are committed to listening and learning,"" says Scanlon. ""We will continue to stand with our LGBTQ+ colleagues and push for progress, because we know that will help create a better, safer world for all of us.""Boston Scientific is committed to fostering a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace where all of our employees can bring their authentic selves to work and thrive personally and professionally.

While quarterly earnings are expected to have witnessed a fall on a year-over-year basis, revenues are likely to have risen.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were affected by higher provisions for credit losses and an increase in operating expenses. Yet, a decent loan balance and higher interest rates aided net interest income (NII).Capital One does not have an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters.Key Factors &amp; Estimates for Q2Net interest income: In the second quarter, lending activities gradually waned on higher rates and a challenging macroeconomic backdrop. Nevertheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for COF’s second-quarter total average earning assets of $437 billion indicates a 9.5% rise from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.Also, Capital One’s efforts to strengthen its card operations are expected to have provided some support. This, along with higher interest rates, is expected to have positively impacted NII. The consensus estimate for NII of $7.31 billion indicates a 12.1% year-over-year improvement. Our estimate for NII is pinned at $7 billion, suggesting an increase of 7.3%.Fee income: Capital One’s interchange fees (constituting more than 60% of fee income) are likely to have improved in the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $1.24 billion, indicating a 3% rise from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The consensus estimate for service charges and other customer-related fees of $417 million implies a marginal increase. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for other non-interest income is pegged at $202 million, indicating a significant year-over-year rise. Our estimates for service charges and other customer-related fees, and other non-interest income are $423.3 million and $207.9 million, respectively.The consensus estimate for total non-interest income of $1.84 billion suggests a rise of 7.3% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. We expect the metric to grow 2.1% to $1.75 billion.Expenses: Capital One has been witnessing a persistent rise in expenses over the past several years because of higher marketing costs. The company’s investment in technology upgrades leads to higher costs. These, along with inflation issues, are expected to have led to an increase in operating expenses in the second quarter.Our estimate for total non-interest expenses is pinned at $4.84 billion, implying a year-over-year increase of 5.6%.Asset Quality: Given the global recession risk due to geopolitical and macroeconomic concerns, and tighter financial conditions, Capital One is likely to have built reserves in the second quarter.Our estimate for provision for credit losses is pegged at $2.31 billion, indicating a significant rise from the year-ago quarter figure.Story continuesKey Development in the QuarterIn June, Capital One acquired Velocity Black, the leading digital concierge company.Velocity’s platform uses artificial intelligence and human experts to recommend and fulfill travel, entertainment, shopping and dining offerings to consumers around the globe.Now, the companies will focus on finding new approaches to solve consumer problems. Velocity Black's advanced technology will strengthen Capital One's delivery of exceptional experiences for consumers.Earnings WhispersAccording to our quantitative model, the chances of Capital One beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for Capital One is +1.32%.Zacks Rank: The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Capital One’s second-quarter earnings of $3.37 has been revised marginally higher over the past seven days. The figure indicates a plunge of 32.1% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for earnings is $3.22 per share.Capital One Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Capital One Financial Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseCapital One Financial Corporation price-eps-surprise | Capital One Financial Corporation QuoteThe consensus estimate for sales is pegged at $9.14 billion, suggesting a year-over-year increase of 11%. We project the metric to be 8.75 billion, indicating growth of 6.2%.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookA couple of other finance stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these, too, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around, are Wells Fargo WFC and Moody's Corporation MCO.The Earnings ESP for Wells Fargo is +0.16% and it carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present.

317,227cd343-c323-3290-b93e-eefebadd6bfe,COF,2023-07-14,Analysts Estimate Capital One (COF) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-capital-one-cof-140057025.html,1689256857,STORY,"['COF', 'ALLY']","[The market expects Capital One (COF) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 20, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis credit card issuer and bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.33 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -32.9%.Revenues are expected to be $9.13 billion, up 11% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.42% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Capital One?For Capital One, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.55%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Capital One will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Capital One would post earnings of $3.80 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.31, delivering a surprise of -39.21%.The company has not been able to beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Capital One doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Financial - Consumer Loans industry, Ally Financial (ALLY) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.95 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -46%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $2.09 billion, up 0.9% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Ally Financial has been revised 0.5% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 6.53%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that Ally Financial will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This move outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.85%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.14%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 5.61%.Heading into today, shares of the drugmaker had gained 1.5% over the past month, outpacing the Medical sector's loss of 1.55% and lagging the S&amp;P 500's gain of 3.18% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Vertex Pharmaceuticals as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be August 1, 2023. The company is expected to report EPS of $3.82, up 6.11% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $2.41 billion, up 9.72% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $14.51 per share and revenue of $9.74 billion, which would represent changes of -2.49% and +9.08%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Vertex Pharmaceuticals. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.1% higher.

The contract will serve the government of France. A major portion of the work related to this deal will be executed in Liverpool, NY; Melbourne, FL; and Indianapolis, IN.Importance of E-2D Hawkeye JetNorthrop’s E-2D Hawkeye aircraft boasts battle management, theater air, missile defense and multiple sensor fusion capabilities in an airborne system. These provide the warfighter with expanded battlespace awareness, especially in the area of information operations.Through its effective radar sensor and robust network-enabled capability, the Advanced Hawkeye aircraft provides critical, actionable data to joint forces and first responders.Such features of the aircraft make it attractive for the military, resulting in NOC winning multiple orders for the same, like the latest one. The new orders are likely to boost Northrop’s revenue generation prospects in the military aircraft business arena.Growth ProspectsCountries globally have been reinforcing their military resources due to intense geopolitical tensions and amplified terrorist threats.

Such growth prospects may benefit Northrop as its military aviation system offers a wide range of manned and unmanned aircraft that already enjoys an established position in the military aircraft market.Story continuesThe abounding growth prospects of the aforementioned market should also benefit other defense majors that manufacture combat jets, such as Lockheed Martin LMT, Boeing BA and Textron TXT.Lockheed Martin’s Aeronautics segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies.

The oldest holding is Coca-Cola, which Warren Buffett bought in 1988. He famously loves Coke and supposedly used to drink 5 to 6 cans a day.35 Years in Coca-ColaThe Coca-Cola Company (KO) is now Berkshire’s 5th largest position, as the company keeps adding to its Occidental Petroleum position and that is now the third largest.Thirty-five years in one stock is impressive. From June 1, 1988 to July 11, 2023, Coca-Cola is up 2,420% without dividends. That beats the S&amp;P 500 which is up 1,605%.But Coca-Cola remains the only stock still in the Berkshire portfolio from the 1980s. Stocks from the 1990s are rare too.Long-Term Stocks are Rare in the Berkshire Portfolio1.       American Express Co. (AXP)American Express was first bought by Berkshire Hathaway in 1994. It is another successful long-term position for the portfolio. Shares of American Express are up 2066% from the end of Q1 1994 to July 11, 2023 while the S&amp;P 500 was up 889% during that time (note, in the podcast, Tracey mistakenly says that it was up just 175%).American Express is currently a cheap stock. It trades at 15.6x forward earnings. Shares of American Express are up 18.1% year-to-date.But it remains the only stock bought in the 1990s red-hot bull market which is still in the portfolio. Why?2.       Moody’s Corp. (MCO)Moody’s is the 9th largest position in the Berkshire portfolio now. It was first added to the portfolio in the first quarter of 2001 so that means it has been in the portfolio for 22 years. That makes it the third oldest position.Story continuesMoody’s has also outperformed the S&amp;P 500, gaining 2122% since 2001 versus the S&amp;P 500 up 258%. Shares are also up in 2023, adding 26.2%. Moody’s is no longer a value stock by P/E as it trades at 35x.Should it matter that Moody’s is no longer an actual value?3.       The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. (PG)Stocks from the early 2000s are now rare in the Berkshire portfolio as Buffett has sold many of his banks that he bought in that time period. But Procter &amp; Gamble was added in the first quarter of 2005, so that means Berkshire has owned it for 18 years.Procter &amp; Gamble has underperformed however. It’s up just 148% in those 18 years compared to 278% for the S&amp;P 500, without dividends. Procter &amp; Gamble is not cheap, with a forward P/E of 23.4.Will Procter &amp; Gamble make it to the 20-year mark?4.       Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)Do you know that Berkshire Hathaway owns shares of Amazon? It bought them in the first quarter of 2019. It hasn’t added to the position, nor has it sold any of Amazon, in that four-year period.Amazon hasn’t been a great investment for the portfolio, so far. It’s up 33.5% since the last day of the first quarter of 2019 and July 11, 2023. The S&amp;P 500 is up 51.8% during that period.Will Amazon be a forever stock for Berkshire Hathaway?Should You Really Hold a Stock for Forever?  Tune into this week’s podcast to find out.[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of AMZN in her personal portfolio.]Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To skip our detailed analysis of the Arab world and poor Arab countries, you can go directly to 5 Poorest Arab Countries.In a previous article, we covered the 10 richest Arab countries in 2023. In this article, our focus will be on struggling economies in the Arab world. Before digging into the list, we will take a look at different aspects affecting poor Arab countries.Inequality Within the Arab WorldWhen we talk about the Arab League, we have a mix of economies. There are booming economies like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. On the contrary, economies like Syria, Yemen, and Somalia are suffering badly. Are the poorest Arab countries any different from the richest Arab countries? Let’s discuss the dynamics of poverty in Arab countries. The Arab world is home to some of the world's largest oil reserves, but not all countries have been able to capitalize on their oil wealth. The main reason for the downfall of many Arab countries is geo-political instability. Iraq and Syria have been at war against terrorism for over two decades. Likewise, Yemen has also suffered from war against Saudi Arabia. The global challenges have affected poor Arab economies severely, making them vulnerable to many risks. The Arab countries including Jordan, Lebanon, Sudan, and Tunisia are at the forefront of challenges arising from a pallid global economy. In that premise, the Arab world and Africa are two of the most unequal regions in the world. The inequality among Arab countries has left the region in a see-saw scenario. If you want to read about the poorest African countries, you can read our article 30 poorest countries in Africa.The SolutionIn a UN meeting on June 8, United Nations' Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, Rosemary DiCarlo, shared her views on the strategic significance between the United Arab Emirates and other Arab League countries for the development of the region. The conflicts in Arab countries have dramitcally affected the economy and human development in countries like Sudan, Palestine, and Syria. DiCarlo highlighted the point that notable regional organizations including the League of Arab States, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, the African Union, and other important players will be the key to ending the conflict in Sudan. As for her views on rising tensions in Palestine, DiCarlo believes that the only way forward is the ""two-State solution"" for long-term peace. The conflict in Palestine has created a huge financial crisis. The Arab League and United Nations are on the same page to achieve this common goal in conflict zones in Arab. “Together, we can achieve what neither organization could achieve on its own,” said Rosemary DiCarlo.Story continuesCOVID-19 Impact and Natural DisastersCOVID-19 was devastating for the entire world, but it wiped away the economies of poor countries. The Arab region is still young and needs a lot of development. Even the biggest economies in Arab are working on new sectors due to limitations and vanishing oil reserves.On May 30, the United Nations Development Programme published its second Arab multidimensional poverty report. The report highlights that Arab countries were going through severe challenges such as instability, conflict, displacement, and other economic issues before the COVID-19 pandemic. The global pandemic and the Ukraine war have inflamed money metric poverty in the region. Most of the poor Arab countries do not have enough resources to cope with any more challenges. Lockdowns during the pandemic caused a plunge in aggregate demand for labor in the private sector which had a severe effect on households. Small and medium-scale companies were affected the most. Moreover, the drop in oil prices during the COVID period weakened the remaining economy of poor Arab countries. In 2020, it resulted in the Arab world’s total gross domestic product contracting by 6.3%, compared to the global contraction of 3.2%. Moreover, natural disasters are worsening the situation in the region. The Youth Envoy for the President of the 27th UN Climate Change Conference, Omnia El Omrani, pointed out that nearly 60% of the Arab population comprises youth under 30 years of age and they are facing mental health issues.U.S. Companies' Influence in Poor Arab CountriesU.S. companies are operating in different capacities in Arab countries. Despite the struggle in poor Arab countries, there are a few nations that are trying to revive their economies, and one of them is Morocco. Some of the top U.S. companies with operations in the region include PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), and General Electric Co. (NYSE:GE), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) operates through various subsidiaries and partners in different regions of the world. One of the company's bottling partners is Equatorial Coca-Cola Bottling Company (ECCBC) based in Morocco. The Equatorial Coca-Cola Bottling Company operates in 13 countries across North and West Africa. Whereas, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)'s subsidiary Pepsi-Cola Maghreb SARL in Morocco oversees operations in the region. Over the years, U.S. companies have played a vital role in the Arab economy. The rich Arab countries already have big U.S. firms operating in the region. Whereas, poor Arab countries due to economic constraints limit their capability to attract big firms. In March, Francois Xavier Batalingaya, the UN Resident Coordinator in Comoros during an interview talked about the business opportunities in the country. Batalingaya said:""Comoros has significant untapped potential or business opportunities. For example, the tourism industry could be further developed. Looking at the tourism industry in the region, Comoros is the only country whose tourism industry is still not well developed. Neighbouring Seychelles and Madagascar receive between 400,000 and 500,000 tourists per year.""PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ: PEP) is one of the largest multinational corporations in the world. On April 25, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) posted strong earnings for the first quarter of 2023. The company reported a revenue of $17.85 billion, beating revenue estimates by $572.95 million. The company reported earnings per share of $1.40 and surpassed EPS consensus by $0.05. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is seeking new opportunities around the world. In the Q1 2023 earnings call, the company made comments on there new plans:“We are investing in our innovation, investing in our brands, investing obviously in value in different ways, pricing, sizing in mostly. So we’re seeing a good positive competitive environment in the U.S., in Europe, and also in our developing markets consistently across the world. When it comes to pricing, as we said earlier in February, we have mostly taken the pricing already this year that we needed to cover for our cost increases. And that is where we stand at this point.We’re seeing a deceleration of inflation, not a reduction of cost, but a deceleration of inflation. And we think that with the pricing that we’ve taken already most of our business around the world, that should be sufficient. Obviously, there are some markets, highly inflationary markets around the world where we might have to take additional pricing. If you think about Argentina, Turkey, Egypt though those kind of markets where the currencies are suffering, but the majority of our pricing is already done.”10 Poorest Arab CountriesOur MethodologyFor our list of the poorest Arab countries, we sourced each country's GDP per capita data from The World Bank's database. We narrowed down our selection to ten Arab countries with the lowest GDP per capita and ranked them in descending order of this metric. Syria was ranked the second poorest Arab country, however, its data was from 2020. Here are the 10 poorest Arab countries.10 Poorest Arab Countries10. PalestineTotal GDP per capita of the country (2022): $3,789.3The longtime conflict in Palestine has made the country’s economic situation worsen over the years. The trade and other restrictions by Israel in Palestine create serious economic troubles. Palestine is ranked 10th on our list of the poorest Arab countries and has a GDP per capita of $3,789.3, as of 2022.Some of the leading U.S. companies operating in the Arab world include PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), General Electric Co. (NYSE:GE), and CoCa-Cola Co. (NYSE:KO).9. TunisiaTotal GDP per capita of the country (2022): $3,776.7Tunisia is suffering from unstable political and economic circumstances. The country entered a new political phase in July 2022 with the introduction of a presidential system and a new constitution. However, growth and job outcomes have worsened as the rising import bills have put pressure on the currency. Undergoing a transition period, Tunisia is ranked ninth on our list of poorest Arab countries. 8. MoroccoTotal GDP per capita of the country (2022): $3,527.9Morocco’s economy has suffered immensely following domestic and international shocks. The real GDP plunged from 7.9% to 1.2% between 2021 and 2022. However, the Moroccan government's ongoing economic developments will help to give a cost-effective and equitable response to future shocks. Morocco Now is a large-scale initiative by the government to pave way for foreign direct investments. The country is ranked eighth on our list of the poorest Arab countries.7. DjiboutiTotal GDP per capita of the country (2022): $3,136.1Djibouti seems to have a favorable medium-term economic outlook, with GDP expected to grow by 5.4% in 2023 and 6.5% in 2024. However, the country is exposed to systemic weaknesses, and the justice system is vulnerable to political influence. Djibouti ranks among the poorest Arab countries. 6. MauritaniaTotal GDP per capita of the country (2022): $2,190.7Mauritania is essentially a desert country and the country’s economy heavily depends on capital investment and technical assistance from abroad, which leaves Mauritania vulnerable to global market fluctuations. The country is ranked sixth on our list of the poorest Arab countries.Prominent U.S. companies that have operations in the Arab world include PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Citigroup Inc.

This was the second surprise this year for the ‘business as usual’ beverage giant and the Coca Cola Company (NYSE: KO) rival, both being valuable members of the S&amp;P 500 and holdings of its trailing ETF index, SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY).Second Quarter HighlightsFor the second quarter, net sales rose 10.4% to $22.32 billion, topping the expected $21.73 billion, according to Refinitiv. When the impact of acquisitions and divestitures is excluded, organic revenue expanded 13%.Net income attributable to the company rose from $1.43 billion made during last year’s comparable quarter to $2.75 billion, or $1.99 per share with adjusted earnings per share amounting to $2.09, topping the expected $1.96.Volume Was Hurt By Higher PricesHigher prices for Pepsi snacks and drinks resulted in a volume drop of 3%, with beverages falling 1%, when pricing and currency fluctuations are excluded. As for North America, Quaker Foods volume dropped 5%, and beverage volume contracted 4.5% but Frito-Lay told a different story by experiencing 1% growth owed to new innovations in the division.Improved 2023 GuidanceCoca Cola rival materially hiked its full-year outlook, as to suggest the momentum in the business will be sustained. Pepsi rose its revenue forecast from prior 8% organic growth to 10%. Constant currency earnings outlook was also hiked to 12% growth from its previous expectation of 9%.PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta underlined that these results are proof to the beverage company’s successfully executing its Pepsi+ strategic-end-to-end initiative to become faster, stronger and better organized.Coca Cola Also Sees A Strong Long-term PerspectiveEven the world’s largest beverage is company is squeezed by the sluggish macroeconomic environment. But Coca Cola did a great job at rebounding from the pandemic, improving its profitability and returning to growth. According to data provided by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, Coca Cola shares dipped 5% in the first half of the year. But Coca Cola owes its success to quickly taking adequate action in times of crisis. During the pandemic, it quickly adapted its operational structure and slashed its brand collection to focus on top performers, resulting in stabilized profits and rising sales. In simple words, Coca-Cola keeps on demonstrating why it's a top blue chip stock but both Pepsi and Coca Cola are not having it easy with persistently high inflation that is hurting their consumers and a gloomy market dynamic.Story continuesDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Quality Dividend Stocks to Buy. During periods of uncertainty, such as recessions or inflationary environments, dividend stocks often become a preferred choice for investors. This is because dividend stocks can provide a certain level of stability and income even in turbulent times. When it comes to dividend stocks, investing in high-quality companies offers several advantages. Quality dividend stocks are those that have a track record of consistent and reliable dividend payments. These companies are well-established and have histories of generating steady cash flows, strong earnings growth, and solid balance sheets.Dividend growth rate plays a significant role in dividend investing by showcasing a company's capacity to raise its dividend payments over time. When companies can consistently increase their dividends at a healthy rate, it signals their strength and stability as investments. This growth reflects a strong and expanding cash flow, demonstrating their commitment to delivering value to shareholders. Moreover, dividend growers also showed robust performance in the past, compared to their counterparts. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we mentioned data from Ned Davis Research and Hartford Funds, which revealed that dividend growers achieved a return of 9.62% from 1972 to December 31, 2018. In contrast, dividend cutters experienced a negative return of 0.79%. During the same period, the S&amp;P 500 had an average annual return of 7.30%, indicating that dividend growers outperformed the broader market.Also read: 12 Best Long-Term Dividend Stocks To Buy NowInvestors showed great interest in stocks with substantial dividends last year, considering them popular trades in the stock market. However, this preference for dividend-heavy stocks has lost momentum since then due to growing investments in artificial intelligence (AI). According to data by Ned Davis Research, non-dividend-paying stocks in the S&amp;P 500 have experienced a collective gain of approximately 18% in 2023, as of July 1. In contrast, income-generating companies have only seen a modest 4% advance. This marks the weakest first-half performance for dividend-paying stocks compared to non-dividend-paying stocks since 2009.Story continuesHowever, it is important to note that the situation could change in the future, especially since dividend-paying stocks have historically demonstrated a tendency to outperform during periods of economic slowdown. According to a report by Wall Street Journal, there are concerns that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes could potentially lead the economy into a recession. If such a scenario unfolds, defensive companies with substantial dividends could once again outperform. This is because, during an economic downturn, consumers tend to prioritize essential expenses.Analysts also continue to support the stance on dividend stocks, as they see potential and favorable prospects for these stocks throughout the year. Paul Baiocchi, chief ETF strategist at SS&amp;C ALPS Advisors, spoke with WSJ and said that a significant part of the market’s total return has been generated by compounded dividends over time, rather than the price appreciation of the stock market itself. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) are some of the best dividend stocks with decades-long dividend growth track records. In this article, we will further discuss quality dividend stocks to consider.11 Best Quality Dividend Stocks to BuyImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur Methodology:For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 943 hedge funds as of Q1 2023 and selected blue-chip dividend companies with robust balance sheets.

Medtronic is the world’s largest device manufacturer, and it holds the number one or number two market share in most of its product segments. Medtronic’s business is heavily weighted towards complicated in-patient procedures, which are typically quite profitable. Industry dynamics are quite attractive with an aging global population and the growth of improved healthcare in emerging markets; furthermore, most of its segments are highly concentrated with just 2-3 players that split each segment’s market share, affording the key participants with significant economies of scale and pricing power. The Company has been recently addressing several temporary headwinds including a strong dollar, inflation, a delayed recovery in surgical volumes from the coronavirus pandemic, and supply chain issues.

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Coca-Cola Europacific Partners Is Coca-Cola Europacific Partners Fairly Valued?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF (€, Millions) €1.75b€1.90b€1.80b€1.74b€1.70b€1.68b€1.66b€1.65b€1.65b€1.65bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Est @ -4.99%Est @ -3.37%Est @ -2.23%Est @ -1.44%Est @ -0.89%Est @ -0.50%Est @ -0.22%Est @ -0.03% Present Value (€, Millions) Discounted @ 6.3% €1.7k€1.7k€1.5k€1.4k€1.3k€1.2k€1.1k€1.0k€950€893(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = €13bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 0.4%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = €1.6b× (1 + 0.4%) ÷ (6.3%– 0.4%) = €28bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= €28b÷ ( 1 + 6.3%)10= €15bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is €28b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of €58.4, the company appears about fair value at a 3.3% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Coca-Cola Europacific Partners as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.849. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Coca-Cola Europacific PartnersStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Beverage market.OpportunityAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the Dutch market.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the Dutch market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

336,e63955f3-2826-326b-b03d-8f3ac25408d1,VRSN,2023-07-14,"Medallion Fund Strategy, Returns, and Holdings",Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medallion-fund-strategy-returns-holdings-101129960.html,1689329489,STORY,"['UNH', 'CVX', 'BA', 'AMZN', 'HSY', 'NVO', 'VRSN']","[In this piece, we will take a look at Medallion's Fund's strategy, returns, and holdings. If you want to skip out on the details about the fund's manager, its history, and performance, then head on over to Medallion Fund Strategy, Returns, and Holdings: Top 5 Stock Picks.  Out of the different investment strategies that hedge funds and institutional managers use to invest in the stock market, one approach is quantitative investment. This strategy, as the name suggests, relies heavily on mathematics to make investment decisions. Simply put, the strategy involves determining the probabilities of stock performance and balancing the portfolio accordingly. This includes calculating variables such as the standard deviation of a stock's returns and then comparing this data with a broader set to make decisions.The 'guru' of quantitative investing in the hedge fund industry is none other than Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies. His journey on the stock market has made him one of the richest people in the world. According to Forbes Magazine, Jim Simons was worth a stunning $28 billion as of July 2023, which comfortably places him as the 49th richest person in the world.The source of Jim Simons' unimaginable wealth is his hedge fund Renaissance Technologies. The hedge fund offers its customers a pick of several different funds to invest in. These include its flagship Medallion Fund, the Institutional Diversified Alpha Fund, the Institutional Diversified Global Equity Fund, and the Institutional Equities Fund. Out of these, the Medallion Fund is Renaissance's flagship product and also one of its most successful to date.We've been covering Mr. Simons and his different funds for quite some time now. For instance, the Equities Fund gained a whopping 25.6% in the first eight months of 2011 and 5.4% in August alone. Our detailed analysis of Renaissance Technologies' performance in August 2011 revealed that the biggest stocks in his portfolio actually performed better than the full portfolio when compared to the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY). While the S&amp;P ETF had lost 5.1% during the month, the complete portfolio of Renaissance Technologies made of more than 1,500 stocks actually lost 4.9%. This performance improved when the focus was narrowed down to the top 50 stocks, which ended up losing less than half of the S&amp;P 500 ETF with -1.6% returns. This analysis also showed what a magician Mr. Simons is when it comes to quantitative trading, as he beat the market when it was going up, and then beat it again when it was going down since the RIEF itself had returned 5.4% in August 2011. To find out more on that you can read our detailed analysis here: The Mystery Behind Jim Simons’ Amazing August Returns.Story continuesThis wizardry has been the focus of a lot of attention, whether it's from investors, journalists, or even academics. Estimates suggest that the Medallion Fund has made tens of billions of dollars since being set up. For instance, until March 2020, the fund had generated annualized average returns of a whopping 66%, with Renaissance Technologies itself having generated more than $100 billion in profits between 1988 and 2020. However, the performance divergence between different funds managed by Renaissance has also created a bit of controversy for Mr. Simons and his hedge fund in the past. These became pronounced in 2009 in the aftermath of the financial crisis as the investing environment became fraught in general. In a conference call with fund managers, investors asked them why the Equities Fund had lost 17% between January and April 2009 while an internal fund exclusive to the billionaire and other Renaissance managers had actually diverged and returned 12%. The equities fund was flush with capital from new investors as it was the first to accept money in over a decade after the Medallion Fund was closed to outside investors.So, what's going on in the Renaissance world right now? Well, Mr. Simons retired from managing the daily affairs of the fund in 2010 and stepped down as an executive chairman in 2021. And the fund seems to be doing quite well even without its legendary investor. Insider Monkey's research shows that as of March 2023, the cumulative value of all investments made by the fund in its portfolio to the Securities and Exchange Commission stood at a cool $75.3 billion. However, the tech heavy side of the portfolio did see some shakeup since Q1 2022, as the portfolio had stood at $85 billion back then.During the first quarter of 2023, Renaissance Technologies had actually added positions in more than 400 companies. The biggest new position was in the industrial conglomerate Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON), with Renaissance Technologies, adding a $349 million stake in the company. Crucially though, it seems like the quantitative hedge fund has had enough of investing in the world's biggest technology firm Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Renaissance Technologies had held a massive $922 million stake in Apple by the end of December 2022, and Q1 saw the fund cut this stake down to just $1.5 million. Does this mean that the world's premier quantitative trader believes that Apple's shares have no magic left in them? You be the judge.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some top stock picks of Renaissance Technologies, out of which the notable names are Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD).Medallion Fund Strategy, Returns, and HoldingsJim Simons of Renaissance TechnologiesOur Methodology To compile our list of the Medallion Funds' top stock picks, we used data from Renaissance Technologies' top stock picks for the first quarter of this year. This is because Medallion is a private fund whose investments are not categorically listed on a public platform. However, the Q1 2023 data does show where the $75 billion portfolio is headed.Medallion Fund Strategy, Returns, and Holdings10. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)Renaissance Technologies Investment In Q1 2023: $526 million Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is one of the largest oil companies in the world. Renaissance Technologies increased its stake in the company by 156% in Q1 2023, and it owned 3.2 million shares that were worth $526 million during the time period. The firm's shares are rated Buy on average, and its EPS and analyst EPS estimates have been dropping over the past few quarters as the energy boom subsides.As of March 2023, 64 of the 943 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey's database had bought and owned Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)'s shares. While Renaissance Technologies owned a $526 million stake in the company, its largest investor was Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway with a $21 million investment.Just like Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is a top Renaissance Technology stock pick.9. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)Renaissance Technologies Investment In Q1 2023: $550 millionThe Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is one of the biggest aerospace companies in the world. Jim Simons' investment firm grew its stake in the firm by a massive 1,076% in Q1 2023. Perhaps this was the right time, as The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) has started to reap the dividends from a recovery in global travel, with its commercial shipments growing by 12.4% in April.By the end of this year's first quarter, 52 of the 943 hedge funds polled by Insider Monkey had bought and invested in The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA).

Along with him, 44 of the 943 hedge funds surveyed by Insider Monkey had also invested in the firm, out of which Renaissance was the largest investor.7. VeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN)Renaissance Technologies Investment In Q1 2023: $672 millionVeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN) is a technology company that provides backend internet services to websites. It's seen mixed reactions from analysts recently, with two downgrades to Neutral, two upgrades to Outperform, and two Buy ratings.Out of the 943 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey's database, 37 had owned VeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN)'s shares during this year's first quarter.

UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)Renaissance Technologies Investment In Q1 2023: $685 millionUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is one of the largest healthcare plans and associated services providers in America. It is a rare stock on our list whose shares are rated a Strong Buy on average; perhaps influenced by the fact that the firm has been beating analyst EPS estimates heftily as of late.Jim Simons' investment firm owned a $685 million stake in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) during 2023's March quarter. During the same time period, 116 of the 943 hedge funds surveyed by Insider Monkey had also invested in the company with the largest investor being Rajiv Jain's GQG Partners through its $2.2 billion investment.Amazon.com, Inc.

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, you can directly visit Analysts Are Downgrading These 5 Stocks.Global markets experienced a risk-on sentiment on July 13, leading to the US dollar falling to its lowest level in 15 months. Stocks worldwide received a boost from softer US inflation data. The positive market sentiment continued for another day, as U.S. futures rose and the value of the dollar dropped to its lowest point in 15 months, reported Bloomberg. European stocks maintained their gains from the previous day's rally, with the Stoxx 600 Index surging by 1.5%. Swatch Group AG, known for producing Omega and Longines watches, experienced a nearly 6% increase in its stock value, benefiting from China's reopening and resulting in higher profits. Watches of Switzerland Group Plc, the leading retailer of Rolex watches in the UK, saw a remarkable surge of 10% in its stock price. According to economist Steve Hanke, the United States no longer faces an inflation problem. Hanke, a seasoned economist, and professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University, explained that the contraction of the money supply by minus 4% on a year-over-year basis in the United States is a significant factor contributing to this viewpoint. Speaking on CNBC's ""Street Signs Asia,"" Hanke emphasized that such a decline in the money supply has not been witnessed since 1938. He further highlighted the relationship between changes in money supply and their impact on the price index and inflation. Based on these observations, Hanke asserts that the era of inflation concerns has concluded for the United States.China's National Council for Social Security Fund, a prominent state-run investor, has raised concerns about the increasing debt risks faced by cash-strapped developers and local government financing vehicles (LGFVs) in China. The fund overseeing assets worth around $417 billion has reportedly instructed its asset managers to divest certain bonds from their portfolios. These bonds include those issued by riskier LGFVs and private developers, as identified during a thorough review conducted by the fund, reported Bloomberg. Although the individuals providing this information requested to remain anonymous due to the sensitive nature of the topic, they revealed that bonds specifically linked to LGFVs in Tianjin, a heavily indebted northern port city, were highlighted as particularly problematic. This move by the National Council for Social Security Fund adds to the growing chorus of warnings regarding the potential risks associated with China's real estate sector and local government financing.Story continuesAccording to Reuters, Gold prices reached a nearly one-month high on July 13, driven by a weaker U.S. dollar, following the release of U.S. inflation data that sparked hopes of a potential halt to the Federal Reserve's tightening of monetary policy. At 06:58 GMT on July 13, spot gold increased by 0.3% to $1,962.11 per ounce, reaching its highest since June 16. U.S. gold futures also saw a gain of 0.2% to $1,965.80. U.S. consumer prices experienced modest growth in June, marking the smallest annual increase over two years. However, this continued trend of subsiding inflation might not be sufficient to dissuade the Federal Reserve from resuming interest rate hikes later in the month.On the stocks market front, notable stocks such as The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) and Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) were downgraded by analysts, among many others. Check out the complete article to see some other stocks recently downgraded by analysts.Stock Trading, Performance, Stock AnalysisCopyright: rawpixel / 123RF Stock Photo10. Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 7Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) is a Japan-based automotive manufacturer which was founded in 1937. Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) owns notable brands such as Lexus, Ranz, Hino, and Daihatsu. On July 10, Morgan Stanley downgraded Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) rating from Overweight to Equal-weight while increasing the stock's 12-month price target to ¥2,400 from ¥2,200. This adjustment reflects weaker currency assumptions and the impact of a depreciating yen against the U.S. dollar. The revision is part of a profit prediction adjustment for Japanese automakers, considering the yen depreciation and revised price targets. The sector is recovering with improved chip supplies, strong sales in the U.S. market, and increasing incentives per vehicle. However, challenges arise in China due to the growing popularity of locally produced Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), impacting sales volumes of Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles and Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs). Morgan Stanley expects robust sales and operating profit in the first quarter but downgrades the rating due to diminished upside potential for next-generation BEVs.09. XPO, Inc. (NYSE:XPO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30XPO, Inc. (NYSE:XPO) is an American transportation and logistics company. On July 11, Jeffrey Kauffman, an analyst at Vertical Research, downgraded XPO, Inc. (NYSE:XPO) from a Buy to a Hold rating.Alger Mid Cap Focus Fund made the following comment about XPO, Inc. (NYSE:XPO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“XPO, Inc. (NYSE:XPO) is the fourth largest less-than-truckload (LTL) service provider in North America. Following its late October spin-off of RXO, Inc., which provides freight brokerage services and last mile logistics, XPO has become a solid pureplay LTL company. During the period, shares of XPO outperformed after the RXO spin-off transaction was consummated in late October and helped unlock the sum of parts value as the market was undervaluing both assets. Moreover, shares of most LTL companies rallied from October to mid-November as part of a broader rally in cyclical stocks.”08. Alcoa Corporation (NYSE:AA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35Pennsylvania-based Alcoa Corporation (NYSE:AA) is the world’s eighth biggest producer of aluminum. On July 11, Wolfe Research analyst Timna Tanners revised her evaluation of Alcoa Corporation (NYSE:AA) from a Peer Perform rating to an Underperform rating and has set a price target of $25. This development deals a significant setback to the company as it reflects apprehensions regarding its financial performance. Alcoa Corporation (NYSE:AA) recently released its fiscal results for the previous quarter, and they were disappointing, failing to meet analyst forecasts. The company's earnings report for Q1 2023, published on April 19th, revealed concerning figures that fell below market expectations. Alcoa Corporation (NYSE:AA) reported earnings per share of $0.23, which was notably worse than analysts' consensus estimate of $0.05, representing a deviation of $0.18. This discrepancy underscores a considerable disparity between actual performance and market predictions.ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about Alcoa Corporation (NYSE:AA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We bought Alcoa Corporation (NYSE:AA), a leading aluminum producer, after the stock sold off over lower commodity prices. The current price of aluminum is unsustainably low, below its cost of production, despite inventories being at historic lows. We believe these depressed prices are due to the evaporation of Chinese demand resulting from its zero COVID-19 policy, but that it will likely recover over the next few quarters.Additionally, Alcoa is leading the industry in reducing carbon emissions from its smelting process which is helping to improve its cost position relative to global competitors. Given its compelling valuation and strong free cash flow yield, we are confident in the company as it is increasingly relied upon to meet the growing structural demand from electrification and the global energy transition.”07. VeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37VeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN) is a U.S. based company located in Reston, Virginia. It specializes in managing a wide range of network infrastructure services, enabling businesses to maintain their servers, access domain names, and implement security applications. As of the first quarter of 2023, VeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN) recorded a total of 174.8 million domains in the .com/.net base. This figure represents an increase of 1 million domains compared to the same quarter of the previous year.On July 11, Baird analysts lowered the company's shares to Neutral and reduced the price target from $265 to $245. The downgrade was attributed to weaker domain growth trends, which have fallen below the guided range and may further reduce domain guidance for the year. Despite this, Baird still views VeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN) as a secure long-term investment. After a resilient start to the year, domain growth has flattened in the past six weeks, potentially due to factors such as weaker SMB sentiment, business starts, and lower contribution from China. The uncertainty surrounding .web is also a source of frustration. Over the past year, VeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN) shares have outperformed the S&amp;P 500, rising approximately 24%, but year-to-date performance has been weaker, with a gain of around 7% compared to the S&amp;P 500's 16% increase.06. Truist Financial Corporation (NYSE:TFC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48Truist Financial Corporation (NYSE:TFC) is a banking company based in Charlotte, North Carolina. The company offers banking and trust services in the Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic US. On July 11, Truist Financial Corporation (NYSE:TFC) faced a downgrade by Jefferies analyst Ken Usdin, who shifted the rating from Buy to Hold. The price target has been revised downwards from $37 to $32.Here is what Tweedy, Browne has to say about Truist Financial Corporation (NYSE:TFC) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“The Funds received very little in the way of return contributions from many of their financial, energy, media, and healthcare holdings. While it would appear that a crisis was avoided by the quick intervention of bank regulators in the US and Switzerland, some uneasiness still remains in the global banking community. This turmoil couldn’t help but have a negative impact on investor sentiment and in turn on Fund bank holdings such as Truist Financial Corporation (NYSE:TFC).”Click to continue reading and see Analysts Are Downgrading These 5 Stocks.Suggested Articles:10 Small-Cap Mining Stocks Hedge Funds Are AvoidingTop 15 Independent Oil and Gas Companies in the World10 Biggest Nickel Mining Companies in the WorldDisclosure: None.

Additionally, a 300 KTA Hostalen Advanced Cascade Process plant for manufacturing high density polyethylene will be constructed onsite.This acknowledgment from PetroChina builds on the company's long history of working with LyondellBasell, as around 6,000 KTA of capacity has been licensed to the PetroChina group.

VMC, Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. MLM, Eagle Materials Inc. EXP and Summit Materials, Inc. SUM.Industry: Concrete &amp; AggregatesLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2119887/4-stocks-to-buy-from-promising-concrete-aggregates-industryA boost in infrastructural and public construction spending should continue to favor the Zacks Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates industry. An improving residential construction market and favorable pricing dynamics have also been aiding companies in navigating hard times. Indeed, macroeconomic uncertainties, supply-chain disruptions, weather-related woes and higher labor costs are causes of concern. Nonetheless, prominent companies in the industry, likeVulcan Materials Co., Martin Marietta Materials, Inc., Eagle Materials Inc. and Summit Materials, Inc., have been gaining from the positives.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates industry consists of manufacturers, distributors and sellers of construction materials, like aggregates and concrete, along with other related items for public infrastructure, residential and non-residential, as well as other end markets. The materials also include gypsum wallboard, recycled paperboard, concrete blocks, ready-mix concrete, and oil and gas proppants. The industry players are also involved in designing, engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and installation of external building products for commercial, residential, and repair and remodel markets in domestic as well as international markets.3 Trends Shaping the Future of Concrete &amp; Aggregates IndustryFocus on Reviving Infrastructure: On Nov 15, 2021, President Joe Biden signed a bipartisan infrastructure bill of $550 billion, in addition to the approved funds of $450 billion for five years in August 2021. Total spending may go up to $1.2 trillion if the plan is extended to eight years. This bill comprises new investments in almost every infrastructure sector over the next five-year period, including transportation, energy, broadband and water.Story continuesOut of the total allotted spending, the infrastructure development law will provide $100 billion toward roads, bridges and other major projects. It will invest $66 billion in freight and passenger rail, including potential upgrades to Amtrak.The project will allocate $11 billion to reduce car crashes and fatalities through a ""Safe Streets for All"" program. The Biden administration's endeavor to pump money for rebuilding the nation's roads, bridges and other infrastructure would give construction companies like Vulcan, Martin Marietta and others a solid foundation for growth.Acquisitions &amp; Focus on Operating Efficiency: The industry participants follow a well-chalked-out acquisition plan to enhance domestic and international portfolios. Moreover, companies are increasingly focusing on reducing controllable costs and maximizing operating efficiency across business lines to generate higher earnings and cash flows. The industry players have also been experiencing a solid pricing environment across their product portfolios, thereby helping to boost margins.Fluctuation in Input Prices, Weather Woes &amp; Shortage of Skilled Labors: The industry players are struggling with escalating material expenses, the shortage of skilled laborers and rising wage costs. The companies use electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources. Hence, supply-related woes and significant fluctuations in the prices of these resources affect operating results.Also, businesses are exposed to weather-related risks affecting production schedules and profitability. Excessive rainfall, flooding or severe droughts jeopardize shipments and production. The first and fourth quarters are mostly affected by winter. Again, hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf Coast are most active during these quarters. These impediments may bump up costs and mar the industry participants' profits.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates industry is an eight-stock group within the broader Zacks Construction sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #12, which places it in the top 5% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates impressive near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually gaining confidence in this group's bottom-line growth potential. Since April 2023, the industry's earnings estimates for 2023 and 2024 have increased 9% and 10.3% to $1.94 and $2.25 per share, respectively.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms Sector, S&amp;P 500The Zacks Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates industry has outperformed the broader Zacks Construction sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.Stocks in this industry have collectively gained 52.2% versus the broader sector's rise of 36.8% over the past year. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 15.7% in the same period.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month price to earnings, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates stocks, the industry is currently trading at 19.8X versus the S&amp;P 500's 19.5X and the sector's 16.1X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 24.7X, as low as 13.6X and at a median of 19.3X.4 Concrete &amp; Aggregates Stocks to Bet OnBelow, we have discussed four stocks from the Zacks Concrete &amp; Aggregates universe that have solid earnings growth potential.

That is because the Dec 15, 2023 $50.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Cincinnati Financial shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Cincinnati Financial is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Insurance - Property and Casualty  industry that ranks in the Bottom 24% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while two have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 91 cents per share to 77 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Cincinnati Financial right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

343,ee5505f8-b1cd-3678-ba0e-a98bc14ebfd8,GE,2023-07-14,10 Poorest Arab Countries,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-poorest-arab-countries-194725198.html,1689277645,STORY,"['PEP', 'KO', 'GE']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 10 poorest Arab countries. To skip our detailed analysis of the Arab world and poor Arab countries, you can go directly to 5 Poorest Arab Countries.In a previous article, we covered the 10 richest Arab countries in 2023. In this article, our focus will be on struggling economies in the Arab world. Before digging into the list, we will take a look at different aspects affecting poor Arab countries.Inequality Within the Arab WorldWhen we talk about the Arab League, we have a mix of economies. There are booming economies like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. On the contrary, economies like Syria, Yemen, and Somalia are suffering badly. Are the poorest Arab countries any different from the richest Arab countries? Let’s discuss the dynamics of poverty in Arab countries. The Arab world is home to some of the world's largest oil reserves, but not all countries have been able to capitalize on their oil wealth. The main reason for the downfall of many Arab countries is geo-political instability. Iraq and Syria have been at war against terrorism for over two decades. Likewise, Yemen has also suffered from war against Saudi Arabia. The global challenges have affected poor Arab economies severely, making them vulnerable to many risks. The Arab countries including Jordan, Lebanon, Sudan, and Tunisia are at the forefront of challenges arising from a pallid global economy. In that premise, the Arab world and Africa are two of the most unequal regions in the world. The inequality among Arab countries has left the region in a see-saw scenario. If you want to read about the poorest African countries, you can read our article 30 poorest countries in Africa.The SolutionIn a UN meeting on June 8, United Nations' Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, Rosemary DiCarlo, shared her views on the strategic significance between the United Arab Emirates and other Arab League countries for the development of the region. The conflicts in Arab countries have dramitcally affected the economy and human development in countries like Sudan, Palestine, and Syria. DiCarlo highlighted the point that notable regional organizations including the League of Arab States, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, the African Union, and other important players will be the key to ending the conflict in Sudan. As for her views on rising tensions in Palestine, DiCarlo believes that the only way forward is the ""two-State solution"" for long-term peace. The conflict in Palestine has created a huge financial crisis. The Arab League and United Nations are on the same page to achieve this common goal in conflict zones in Arab. “Together, we can achieve what neither organization could achieve on its own,” said Rosemary DiCarlo.Story continuesCOVID-19 Impact and Natural DisastersCOVID-19 was devastating for the entire world, but it wiped away the economies of poor countries. The Arab region is still young and needs a lot of development. Even the biggest economies in Arab are working on new sectors due to limitations and vanishing oil reserves.On May 30, the United Nations Development Programme published its second Arab multidimensional poverty report. The report highlights that Arab countries were going through severe challenges such as instability, conflict, displacement, and other economic issues before the COVID-19 pandemic. The global pandemic and the Ukraine war have inflamed money metric poverty in the region. Most of the poor Arab countries do not have enough resources to cope with any more challenges. Lockdowns during the pandemic caused a plunge in aggregate demand for labor in the private sector which had a severe effect on households. Small and medium-scale companies were affected the most. Moreover, the drop in oil prices during the COVID period weakened the remaining economy of poor Arab countries. In 2020, it resulted in the Arab world’s total gross domestic product contracting by 6.3%, compared to the global contraction of 3.2%. Moreover, natural disasters are worsening the situation in the region. The Youth Envoy for the President of the 27th UN Climate Change Conference, Omnia El Omrani, pointed out that nearly 60% of the Arab population comprises youth under 30 years of age and they are facing mental health issues.U.S. Companies' Influence in Poor Arab CountriesU.S. companies are operating in different capacities in Arab countries. Despite the struggle in poor Arab countries, there are a few nations that are trying to revive their economies, and one of them is Morocco. Some of the top U.S. companies with operations in the region include PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), and General Electric Co. (NYSE:GE), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) operates through various subsidiaries and partners in different regions of the world. One of the company's bottling partners is Equatorial Coca-Cola Bottling Company (ECCBC) based in Morocco. The Equatorial Coca-Cola Bottling Company operates in 13 countries across North and West Africa. Whereas, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)'s subsidiary Pepsi-Cola Maghreb SARL in Morocco oversees operations in the region. Over the years, U.S. companies have played a vital role in the Arab economy. The rich Arab countries already have big U.S. firms operating in the region. Whereas, poor Arab countries due to economic constraints limit their capability to attract big firms. In March, Francois Xavier Batalingaya, the UN Resident Coordinator in Comoros during an interview talked about the business opportunities in the country. Batalingaya said:""Comoros has significant untapped potential or business opportunities. For example, the tourism industry could be further developed. Looking at the tourism industry in the region, Comoros is the only country whose tourism industry is still not well developed. Neighbouring Seychelles and Madagascar receive between 400,000 and 500,000 tourists per year.""PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ: PEP) is one of the largest multinational corporations in the world. On April 25, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) posted strong earnings for the first quarter of 2023. The company reported a revenue of $17.85 billion, beating revenue estimates by $572.95 million. The company reported earnings per share of $1.40 and surpassed EPS consensus by $0.05. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is seeking new opportunities around the world. In the Q1 2023 earnings call, the company made comments on there new plans:“We are investing in our innovation, investing in our brands, investing obviously in value in different ways, pricing, sizing in mostly. So we’re seeing a good positive competitive environment in the U.S., in Europe, and also in our developing markets consistently across the world. When it comes to pricing, as we said earlier in February, we have mostly taken the pricing already this year that we needed to cover for our cost increases. And that is where we stand at this point.We’re seeing a deceleration of inflation, not a reduction of cost, but a deceleration of inflation. And we think that with the pricing that we’ve taken already most of our business around the world, that should be sufficient. Obviously, there are some markets, highly inflationary markets around the world where we might have to take additional pricing. If you think about Argentina, Turkey, Egypt though those kind of markets where the currencies are suffering, but the majority of our pricing is already done.”10 Poorest Arab CountriesOur MethodologyFor our list of the poorest Arab countries, we sourced each country's GDP per capita data from The World Bank's database. We narrowed down our selection to ten Arab countries with the lowest GDP per capita and ranked them in descending order of this metric. Syria was ranked the second poorest Arab country, however, its data was from 2020. Here are the 10 poorest Arab countries.10 Poorest Arab Countries10. PalestineTotal GDP per capita of the country (2022): $3,789.3The longtime conflict in Palestine has made the country’s economic situation worsen over the years. The trade and other restrictions by Israel in Palestine create serious economic troubles. Palestine is ranked 10th on our list of the poorest Arab countries and has a GDP per capita of $3,789.3, as of 2022.Some of the leading U.S. companies operating in the Arab world include PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), General Electric Co. (NYSE:GE), and CoCa-Cola Co. (NYSE:KO).9. TunisiaTotal GDP per capita of the country (2022): $3,776.7Tunisia is suffering from unstable political and economic circumstances. The country entered a new political phase in July 2022 with the introduction of a presidential system and a new constitution. However, growth and job outcomes have worsened as the rising import bills have put pressure on the currency. Undergoing a transition period, Tunisia is ranked ninth on our list of poorest Arab countries. 8. MoroccoTotal GDP per capita of the country (2022): $3,527.9Morocco’s economy has suffered immensely following domestic and international shocks. The real GDP plunged from 7.9% to 1.2% between 2021 and 2022. However, the Moroccan government's ongoing economic developments will help to give a cost-effective and equitable response to future shocks. Morocco Now is a large-scale initiative by the government to pave way for foreign direct investments. The country is ranked eighth on our list of the poorest Arab countries.7.

As CEO Joey Levin pointed out in his Q1 quarterly letter, IAC traded at an enterprise value below its 18% stake in MGM Resorts International (Ticker: MGM) and 85% position in Angi (Ticker; ANGI)…meaning you effectively “get” 31% of Turo, the equity of publishing giant DotDash Meredith, Care.com, Vivian Health, and other IAC companies for “free.” Levin became CEO of Angi in late 2022 and has already shown tremendous progress in improving product, rationalizing services, and restoring profitability. DotDash Meredith has shown some recovery from January ad-recession lows as it continues to migrate Meredith’s print publications to its digital platform. MGM is seeing continued strength at its Vegas properties and now has the tailwind of China’s domestic re-opening for its Macau properties.

Shares performed well in the first quarter following strong year-end business results and expectations for strong growth in 2023.We remain optimistic about the prospects for MGM because:We expect growth prospects in Las Vegas, which represent approximately 65% of the company’s cash flow, to remain strong due to strength in business group and convention activity, an increase in international visitation, and events throughout the calendar year (concerts, shows, and sports such as Formula 1 racing), which should appeal to leisure travelers…” (Click here to read the full text)MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) ranks among the likes of FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), CNX Resources Corporation (NYSE:CNX), and Warner Bros.

345,d4187ee3-886a-31bb-86bc-97d59294baee,GE,2023-07-14,Is General Electric (NYSE:GE) A Risky Investment?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-electric-nyse-ge-risky-130033962.html,1689253233,STORY,"['GE', 'BRK-A']","[The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We can see that General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) does use debt in its business. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?What Risk Does Debt Bring?Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for General Electric What Is General Electric's Debt?You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that General Electric had US$22.4b of debt in March 2023, down from US$33.6b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$22.4b, its net debt is less, at about US$6.00m.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is General Electric's Balance Sheet?The latest balance sheet data shows that General Electric had liabilities of US$48.2b due within a year, and liabilities of US$83.5b falling due after that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$22.4b and US$16.2b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$93.0b.Story continuesThis is a mountain of leverage even relative to its gargantuan market capitalization of US$121.1b. This suggests shareholders would be heavily diluted if the company needed to shore up its balance sheet in a hurry. Carrying virtually no net debt, General Electric has a very light debt load indeed.We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).General Electric's net debt to EBITDA ratio is very low, at 0.00069, suggesting the debt is only trivial. Although with EBIT only covering interest expenses 6.3 times over, the company is truly paying for borrowing. Even more impressive was the fact that General Electric grew its EBIT by 138% over twelve months. That boost will make it even easier to pay down debt going forward. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine General Electric's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. During the last two years, General Electric generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 97% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.Our ViewGeneral Electric's conversion of EBIT to free cash flow suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. But truth be told we feel its level of total liabilities does undermine this impression a bit. Taking all this data into account, it seems to us that General Electric takes a pretty sensible approach to debt. That means they are taking on a bit more risk, in the hope of boosting shareholder returns. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with General Electric (at least 1 which is a bit unpleasant)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Of course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today.Have feedback on this article?

Amazon announces this year's Prime Day was its biggest sales event on record. Pharmaceutical manufacturer Perrigo has received FDA approval on its over-the-counter birth control pill, Opill.Video Transcript- All right, let's take a look at some of the individual movers of the day. Let's start with Progressive. That stock sliding into the red after earnings lagged the Street's estimates. We're looking at a drop of just about 13%, and that is the biggest drop that we have seen since 2008. It's one of the worst performers in the S&amp;P.So obviously, these results, Ali, disappointing the Street. Wells Fargo out with a note saying that it shows that the auto insurers are continuing to be impacted by quote elevated severity, and we're seeing that caution reflected in some of the competitors as well.- Yeah. And insurance has gotten more and more expensive, but also fixing cars has gotten more expensive. So that obviously pressures margins. I'm very happy I don't have a car, so I don't have to worry about car insurance right now. But it is interesting, though, because there was a research report from JP Morgan earlier this month saying that Progressive is a leader in this space but that the stock is fully valued at this point, but clearly a lot of challenges in the insurance space as well.- No, definitely. I mean, look, you know, I have a family member who's there who gave me kind of a heads up that this was-- things were a little rough there. So I'm not as surprised to see these actual numbers play out today. I said maybe you should start looking for somewhere else. I'm sorry. That's a little bit of a sidebar.But we also know that we've talked about this before, cars becoming more expensive or maintenance because people are keeping their cars for longer. The length of time the duration people are keeping their cars around 12 years again, that putting pressure on the margins in terms of just the cost to insure the vehicle. I want to switch gears to another stock that we are watching. Shares of Amazon popping today up a little more than 2.5% on the back of its annual Prime Day event.Story continuesAdobe Analytics estimating online spending shot up 6% to $6.4 billion on the first day alone. The projection for both days is top $12 billion. I know going into this, they were expecting to see above $13 billion, and we'll see when it all shakes out. Now Amazon, of course, we know doesn't reveal its total sales for those two days, but consumers bought more than 375 million items during the event. That's what Amazon says. Did you guys buy anything?- I bought some things, yeah. I can never really stay away from Amazon Prime. They get me with all of their deals. They're too good to pass up. But a couple of things did jump out to me in these results and really what we heard from the report from Adobe, and that's the fact that average order size was up 3% on a year-over-year basis. Obviously, not a huge surprise given inflation, given the fact that these goods do cost more. But more shoppers were using buy now, pay later, and that certainly is just a sign of the times that we are in right now. Consumers more strapped for cash, and they're using that option so they don't have to pay the full amount, at least up front.- And it's hard to draw concrete conclusions about what this means on the state of consumer. You don't know if people are buying things down the line for the holidays, for Christmas, for birthdays, what have you. But $2.5 billion saved via some of these deals, and now I'm regretting not getting in on these Amazon--- Oh, I did.- --Prime Sales. I didn't--- You always have to have a list ready for a day like this.- I know.- You don't-- I mean, obviously, I am not advocating the buy now pay later kind of program, but I have my list for days like that, and I say, you know, like I have a few appliances, and I'm like what is-- so I got a blender. I'm finally there you go, proud owner of a Vitamix.- Oh, there we go.- That was a good investment.- That was a good buy.- That's worth it.- And especially because I price compared it to last year's Prime Day was the same price even though the normal price is higher this year with inflation. So even with where inflation is, they didn't cut the discount. I appreciate that.- No, but clearly, this is such a huge day days for Amazon, and they pour a lot of money marketing into this, whether it's online, TV, what have you. So good for Amazon. One stock I'm watching is Perrigo. Their Opill oral contraceptive has become the first over-the-counter birth control approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Shares closing roughly flat, but they were up more than 4% earlier today on that news.And guys, this is a big deal, especially in the United States. The company said it will likely be available in the US in early 2024. But what's interesting is that this pill was available with the prescription since 1973. So it took 50 years to get this to be over-the-counter. It is available without a prescription in over 100 countries outside of the US. So the US lagging there, but a big, big win for reproductive rights for sure.- It is, I mean, this is a huge milestone in general for women and just where we've come and the issues we've had to deal with recently. But one of the things that could be affecting the stock price is. We don't know the price of this. So how will that play into what it does revenue-wise for Perrigo and in terms of its bottom line in general. But it's a big win for women.- It certainly is a huge win. And going off of what you were saying just in terms of we don't know what the price is yet. We also don't know what insurance coverage is going to look like because insurers are not mandated to cover a pill that is over-the-counter. It does not hold up to the same standards as what is need a prescription for, so there are so many questions just in terms of what people are going to have to pay on a monthly basis if they do want to buy the pill. So it does remove the barrier given the fact that it is over the counter, but that cost is certainly a massive variable here just in terms of wider adoption.- And the company did say they want it to be affordable, but that's relative, right? Like what exactly does that mean we mean?- We'll see what that will be. But a huge day for women in terms of just the availability of it. All right, Ali, we appreciate you helping us with all of this.- Of course.]"

355,4447f728-a7eb-3ae1-afc7-503172ea1029,VLO,2023-07-14,Halliburton (HAL) Q2 Earnings on Deck: Here's How It Will Fare,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/halliburton-hal-q2-earnings-deck-122100110.html,1689250860,STORY,"['HAL', 'SWN', 'DINO', 'VLO']","[Halliburton Company HAL is set to release second-quarter results on Jul 19. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of 75 cents per share on revenues of $5.9 billion.Let’s delve into the factors that might have influenced the oilfield service firm’s performance in the June quarter. But it’s worth taking a look at HAL’s previous-quarter performance first.Highlights of Q1 Earnings &amp; Surprise HistoryIn the last reported quarter, this Houston, TX-based provider of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells beat the consensus mark on stronger-than-expected profit from both its divisions. Halliburton had reported adjusted net income per share of 72 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 67 cents. Revenues of $5.7 billion also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by some $177 million.HAL beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, which resulted in an earnings surprise of 7.7%, on average. This is depicted in the graph below:Halliburton Company Price and EPS SurpriseHalliburton Company Price and EPS SurpriseHalliburton Company price-eps-surprise | Halliburton Company QuoteTrend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second-quarter bottom line has remained unchanged in the past seven days. The estimated figure indicates a 53.1% jump year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues, meanwhile, suggests a 15.3% increase from the year-ago period.Factors to ConsiderAfter bouncing strongly from the depths of the pandemic, the oil and natural gas rig count in the U.S. has been gradually declining over the past year or so. Consequently, drilling activity — an important factor for services companies — has hit a speed bump. In the United States, a region on which Halliburton is highly dependent, rig count at the end of the second quarter was 674 compared with 753 a year ago. This is in sync with the tick-down in commodity prices. The steady decline in rig count is worrying for contracting activity.Considering the relatively soft operating environment, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second-quarter operating income of the Drilling &amp; Evaluation unit is pegged at $365 million, indicating a slight decrease of $4 million sequentially.On a further bearish note, the increase in HAL’s costs might have dented the company’s to-be-reported bottom line. The company’s first-quarter cost of sales totaled $4.6 billion, up 25.6% from the year-ago period. The upward cost trajectory is likely to have continued in the second quarter due to the prevailing inflationary environment.  But giving some respite to the company, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second-quarter operating income of Completion &amp; Production segment is pegged at $703 million, indicating a 5.6% improvement from the previous quarter on the back of higher international and offshore activity.Story continuesWhat Does Our Model Say?The proven Zacks model does not conclusively show that HAL is likely to beat estimates in the secondquarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates. But that’s not the case here.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, for this company is -0.59%.Zacks Rank: Halliburton currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stocks to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for Halliburton, here are some firms from the energy space that you may want to consider on the basis of our model:Valero Energy Corporation VLO has an Earnings ESP of +1.42% and a Zacks Rank #3.

357,04c0c68e-d342-3ac8-b58a-a54437a7781e,UNH,2023-07-14,"Lone Pine Capital: Portfolio, Team, AUM",Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lone-pine-capital-portfolio-team-114816745.html,1689335296,STORY,"['MSFT', 'UNH', 'KKR', 'DKS', 'TSM', 'TDG', 'WDAY', 'BKNG']","[In this piece, we will take a look at Lone Pine Capital's portfolio, AUM, and performance. If you want to skip the details about the hedge fund, then head on over to Lone Pine Capital's Top 5 Stock Picks. Lone Pine Capital is a hedge fund headquartered in Greenwich, Connecticut. The fund is among those that were set up by the former managers at Julian Robertson's Tiger Global. It was set up by the billionaire Stephen Mandel in 1997 after he left Tiger Global. According to Forbes Magazine, Mr. Mandel was worth $3.6 billion as of July 2023, making him one of the richest people in the world. He isn't the only one running the fund though. Lone Pine's team is run by executives with decades of experience in the finance industry, such as its chief operating officer Ms. Kerry Ann Tyler, its co-chief investment officer Ms. Kelly Granat, chief financial officer and managing director Ms. Mary E McDonnell, and head trader Mr. Brian Francis Doherty.Out of the myriad of approaches that hedge funds take when investing in the stock market, Lone Pine Capital calls itself a ""research-driven, fundamental equity investor."" In simple terms, this means that the firm takes a look at companies' balance sheets, and their strength, and conducts research into their operations and markets to gauge a sense of their financial situation and future prospects. Mathematically, this includes projecting the future cash flows of a firm and then determining its fair value to check whether it's traded above or below this value on the stock market. This analysis can involve both factors that are intrinsic to a company - such as its management, product portfolio, or research strength - and the broader macroeconomic environment such as the ease of doing business and consumer spending power.Through this approach, Lone Pine Capital invests in a variety of companies. Our research suggests that as of the first quarter of 2023, the firm had invested in 29 companies. Some of these investments belong to sectors that are expected to pick up as the coronavirus pandemic is over and the inflationary environment appears to be subsiding. Others are long term plays, particularly those in the technology industry which has been one of the fastest growing sectors in recent years owing to the proliferation of internet usage and consumer electronics such as the smartphone.Story continuesFor instance, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been a long term investment of Lone Pine Capital. The hedge fund first bought its shares in 2013's final quarter, in the form of 25 million shares that were worth $954 million back then. Based on today's share price, these would be worth a cool $8.4 billion - showcasing a massive gain in just a decade. Lone Pine's latest stake in Microsoft sees the firm own 2.6 million shares that were worth $772 million as of March 2023. In short, roughly one tenth of the hedge fund's 2013 stake in terms of shares is nearly worth the same right now. Based on Microsoft's share price in July, the same 2.6 million shares are worth $876 million.Moving forward to the hedge fund's latest investments, as 2023 kicked off, Lone Pine Capital initiated two new positions and grew its investments significantly in a handful of others. The new investments are in KKR &amp; Co. Inc. (NYSE:KKR) and BILL Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:BILL) - both of which are financial firms with different kinds of operations. KKR is purely an investment company which specializes in private equity - a sector that sees decreased activity when economic growth is slower and interest rates are high. However, as the conditions subside, the activity picks up as risk appetites expand and more firms look to grow their operations. BILL, on the other hand, is a software company that offers a cloud platform that enables businesses to automate their financial operations. KKR's shares are up 25% year to date, and since March, they have appreciated by 11.6%. BILL's shares are the opposite, as while they have gained 11.2% year to date, between March and July, the stock has appreciated by 49.7%.In terms of Assets Under Management (AUM), Lone Pine Capital faced quite a reckoning as of June 2022. By then, the hedge fund had an AUM of $5.4 billion - which marked a sharp 51% drop over the year and pushed it to be the 62nd largest hedge fund in the world. These losses were driven by the fund's bets on the growth and technology sector, with its hedge fund losing 47% between September 2021 and June 2022 and its long only fund tanking by 51.6%. The flagship fund would close the year by posting 36% in losses, and overall, Lone Pine was the fourth worst performing fund in the industry - topped only by C1 Capital, TCI Fund Management, and, of course, Tiger Global.The 2022 shocks continued to impact Lone Pine's portfolio. As of March 2023, it was worth $10.8 billion - marking an annual drop of $6 billion or 36%. And not only did the hedge fund add new positions in the first quarter, but it also removed three companies from its portfolio. These are the life sciences company Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), the regional bank First Citizens BancShares, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCNCA), and the data analytics firm Equifax Inc. (NYSE:EFX). These are part of a broad portfolio adjustment that had also taken place in Q4 2022 which saw Lone Pine divest even more companies including the star performer of 2023, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Meta has been one of the best performing stocks on the market this year, through its absolutely stunning 148% gains year to date.With these details in mind, let's take a look at Lone Pine Capital's top stock picks, with the notable ones being Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Workday, Inc. (NASDAQ:WDAY), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM).Lone Pine Capital: Portfolio, Team, AUM and PerformanceStephen Mandel of Lone Pine CapitalOur Methodology To compile our list of Lone Pine Capital's stocks, we used the fund's SEC filings for the first quarter of this year.

If you want to skip out on the details about the fund's manager, its history, and performance, then head on over to Medallion Fund Strategy, Returns, and Holdings: Top 5 Stock Picks.  Out of the different investment strategies that hedge funds and institutional managers use to invest in the stock market, one approach is quantitative investment. This strategy, as the name suggests, relies heavily on mathematics to make investment decisions. Simply put, the strategy involves determining the probabilities of stock performance and balancing the portfolio accordingly. This includes calculating variables such as the standard deviation of a stock's returns and then comparing this data with a broader set to make decisions.The 'guru' of quantitative investing in the hedge fund industry is none other than Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies. His journey on the stock market has made him one of the richest people in the world. According to Forbes Magazine, Jim Simons was worth a stunning $28 billion as of July 2023, which comfortably places him as the 49th richest person in the world.The source of Jim Simons' unimaginable wealth is his hedge fund Renaissance Technologies. The hedge fund offers its customers a pick of several different funds to invest in. These include its flagship Medallion Fund, the Institutional Diversified Alpha Fund, the Institutional Diversified Global Equity Fund, and the Institutional Equities Fund. Out of these, the Medallion Fund is Renaissance's flagship product and also one of its most successful to date.We've been covering Mr. Simons and his different funds for quite some time now. For instance, the Equities Fund gained a whopping 25.6% in the first eight months of 2011 and 5.4% in August alone. Our detailed analysis of Renaissance Technologies' performance in August 2011 revealed that the biggest stocks in his portfolio actually performed better than the full portfolio when compared to the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY). While the S&amp;P ETF had lost 5.1% during the month, the complete portfolio of Renaissance Technologies made of more than 1,500 stocks actually lost 4.9%. This performance improved when the focus was narrowed down to the top 50 stocks, which ended up losing less than half of the S&amp;P 500 ETF with -1.6% returns. This analysis also showed what a magician Mr. Simons is when it comes to quantitative trading, as he beat the market when it was going up, and then beat it again when it was going down since the RIEF itself had returned 5.4% in August 2011. To find out more on that you can read our detailed analysis here: The Mystery Behind Jim Simons’ Amazing August Returns.Story continuesThis wizardry has been the focus of a lot of attention, whether it's from investors, journalists, or even academics. Estimates suggest that the Medallion Fund has made tens of billions of dollars since being set up. For instance, until March 2020, the fund had generated annualized average returns of a whopping 66%, with Renaissance Technologies itself having generated more than $100 billion in profits between 1988 and 2020. However, the performance divergence between different funds managed by Renaissance has also created a bit of controversy for Mr. Simons and his hedge fund in the past. These became pronounced in 2009 in the aftermath of the financial crisis as the investing environment became fraught in general. In a conference call with fund managers, investors asked them why the Equities Fund had lost 17% between January and April 2009 while an internal fund exclusive to the billionaire and other Renaissance managers had actually diverged and returned 12%. The equities fund was flush with capital from new investors as it was the first to accept money in over a decade after the Medallion Fund was closed to outside investors.So, what's going on in the Renaissance world right now? Well, Mr. Simons retired from managing the daily affairs of the fund in 2010 and stepped down as an executive chairman in 2021. And the fund seems to be doing quite well even without its legendary investor. Insider Monkey's research shows that as of March 2023, the cumulative value of all investments made by the fund in its portfolio to the Securities and Exchange Commission stood at a cool $75.3 billion. However, the tech heavy side of the portfolio did see some shakeup since Q1 2022, as the portfolio had stood at $85 billion back then.During the first quarter of 2023, Renaissance Technologies had actually added positions in more than 400 companies. The biggest new position was in the industrial conglomerate Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON), with Renaissance Technologies, adding a $349 million stake in the company. Crucially though, it seems like the quantitative hedge fund has had enough of investing in the world's biggest technology firm Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Renaissance Technologies had held a massive $922 million stake in Apple by the end of December 2022, and Q1 saw the fund cut this stake down to just $1.5 million. Does this mean that the world's premier quantitative trader believes that Apple's shares have no magic left in them? You be the judge.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some top stock picks of Renaissance Technologies, out of which the notable names are Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD).Medallion Fund Strategy, Returns, and HoldingsJim Simons of Renaissance TechnologiesOur Methodology To compile our list of the Medallion Funds' top stock picks, we used data from Renaissance Technologies' top stock picks for the first quarter of this year.

A McKinsey report reveals that the beauty industry generated nearly $430 billion in revenue in 2022 and will reach nearly $460 billion in retail sales by the end of 2023. The beauty industry has shown resilience in the current macroeconomic conditions. Its retail sales dropped from $382 billion in 2019 to $355 billion in 2020 due to the global pandemic but quickly recovered in 2021 reaching sales of $390 billion. By 2027, industry sales are expected to reach over $580 billion.One of the reasons behind the resilience of the beauty industry is that consumers want to look and feel good despite the rough economic conditions. The best makeup brands take advantage of that and come up with innovations that make customers rally toward them. For example, The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.

It accounts for 42% of the industry’s market share and showed the strongest trends in recent quarters for companies like e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF) and Ulta Beauty, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA). Here is what Dave Kimbell, CEO of Ulta Beauty, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA) said at the company’s Q1 2023 earnings call:“...we are uniquely positioned to capture any consumer shifts within price points in the beauty category. Skin care was our best performing category again this quarter with both prestige and mass delivering double-digit comp growth, driven primarily by newness, engaging social media content, and strong performance through 21 Days of Beauty and Spring Haul. Newness from innovative brands like The Ordinary, Drunk Elephant, and Hero Cosmetics, as well as new brands, including Bubble, Beautycounter, and BYOMA, contributed to growth during the quarter.” Story continuesIn recent years, celebrities have jumped into the industry and launched their own brands, leading the industry to flourish because of their names.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Right now, Coty is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Estee Lauder has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that COTY has an improving earnings outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.COTY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 26.66, while EL has a forward P/E of 39.05.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Quality Dividend Stocks to Buy. During periods of uncertainty, such as recessions or inflationary environments, dividend stocks often become a preferred choice for investors. This is because dividend stocks can provide a certain level of stability and income even in turbulent times. When it comes to dividend stocks, investing in high-quality companies offers several advantages. Quality dividend stocks are those that have a track record of consistent and reliable dividend payments. These companies are well-established and have histories of generating steady cash flows, strong earnings growth, and solid balance sheets.Dividend growth rate plays a significant role in dividend investing by showcasing a company's capacity to raise its dividend payments over time. When companies can consistently increase their dividends at a healthy rate, it signals their strength and stability as investments. This growth reflects a strong and expanding cash flow, demonstrating their commitment to delivering value to shareholders. Moreover, dividend growers also showed robust performance in the past, compared to their counterparts. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we mentioned data from Ned Davis Research and Hartford Funds, which revealed that dividend growers achieved a return of 9.62% from 1972 to December 31, 2018. In contrast, dividend cutters experienced a negative return of 0.79%. During the same period, the S&amp;P 500 had an average annual return of 7.30%, indicating that dividend growers outperformed the broader market.Also read: 12 Best Long-Term Dividend Stocks To Buy NowInvestors showed great interest in stocks with substantial dividends last year, considering them popular trades in the stock market. However, this preference for dividend-heavy stocks has lost momentum since then due to growing investments in artificial intelligence (AI). According to data by Ned Davis Research, non-dividend-paying stocks in the S&amp;P 500 have experienced a collective gain of approximately 18% in 2023, as of July 1. In contrast, income-generating companies have only seen a modest 4% advance. This marks the weakest first-half performance for dividend-paying stocks compared to non-dividend-paying stocks since 2009.Story continuesHowever, it is important to note that the situation could change in the future, especially since dividend-paying stocks have historically demonstrated a tendency to outperform during periods of economic slowdown. According to a report by Wall Street Journal, there are concerns that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes could potentially lead the economy into a recession. If such a scenario unfolds, defensive companies with substantial dividends could once again outperform. This is because, during an economic downturn, consumers tend to prioritize essential expenses.Analysts also continue to support the stance on dividend stocks, as they see potential and favorable prospects for these stocks throughout the year. Paul Baiocchi, chief ETF strategist at SS&amp;C ALPS Advisors, spoke with WSJ and said that a significant part of the market’s total return has been generated by compounded dividends over time, rather than the price appreciation of the stock market itself. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) are some of the best dividend stocks with decades-long dividend growth track records. In this article, we will further discuss quality dividend stocks to consider.11 Best Quality Dividend Stocks to BuyImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur Methodology:For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 943 hedge funds as of Q1 2023 and selected blue-chip dividend companies with robust balance sheets.

Medtronic is the world’s largest device manufacturer, and it holds the number one or number two market share in most of its product segments. Medtronic’s business is heavily weighted towards complicated in-patient procedures, which are typically quite profitable. Industry dynamics are quite attractive with an aging global population and the growth of improved healthcare in emerging markets; furthermore, most of its segments are highly concentrated with just 2-3 players that split each segment’s market share, affording the key participants with significant economies of scale and pricing power. The Company has been recently addressing several temporary headwinds including a strong dollar, inflation, a delayed recovery in surgical volumes from the coronavirus pandemic, and supply chain issues.

The oldest holding is Coca-Cola, which Warren Buffett bought in 1988. He famously loves Coke and supposedly used to drink 5 to 6 cans a day.35 Years in Coca-ColaThe Coca-Cola Company (KO) is now Berkshire’s 5th largest position, as the company keeps adding to its Occidental Petroleum position and that is now the third largest.Thirty-five years in one stock is impressive. From June 1, 1988 to July 11, 2023, Coca-Cola is up 2,420% without dividends. That beats the S&amp;P 500 which is up 1,605%.But Coca-Cola remains the only stock still in the Berkshire portfolio from the 1980s. Stocks from the 1990s are rare too.Long-Term Stocks are Rare in the Berkshire Portfolio1.       American Express Co. (AXP)American Express was first bought by Berkshire Hathaway in 1994. It is another successful long-term position for the portfolio. Shares of American Express are up 2066% from the end of Q1 1994 to July 11, 2023 while the S&amp;P 500 was up 889% during that time (note, in the podcast, Tracey mistakenly says that it was up just 175%).American Express is currently a cheap stock. It trades at 15.6x forward earnings. Shares of American Express are up 18.1% year-to-date.But it remains the only stock bought in the 1990s red-hot bull market which is still in the portfolio. Why?2.       Moody’s Corp. (MCO)Moody’s is the 9th largest position in the Berkshire portfolio now. It was first added to the portfolio in the first quarter of 2001 so that means it has been in the portfolio for 22 years. That makes it the third oldest position.Story continuesMoody’s has also outperformed the S&amp;P 500, gaining 2122% since 2001 versus the S&amp;P 500 up 258%. Shares are also up in 2023, adding 26.2%. Moody’s is no longer a value stock by P/E as it trades at 35x.Should it matter that Moody’s is no longer an actual value?3.       The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. (PG)Stocks from the early 2000s are now rare in the Berkshire portfolio as Buffett has sold many of his banks that he bought in that time period. But Procter &amp; Gamble was added in the first quarter of 2005, so that means Berkshire has owned it for 18 years.Procter &amp; Gamble has underperformed however. It’s up just 148% in those 18 years compared to 278% for the S&amp;P 500, without dividends. Procter &amp; Gamble is not cheap, with a forward P/E of 23.4.Will Procter &amp; Gamble make it to the 20-year mark?4.       Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)Do you know that Berkshire Hathaway owns shares of Amazon? It bought them in the first quarter of 2019. It hasn’t added to the position, nor has it sold any of Amazon, in that four-year period.Amazon hasn’t been a great investment for the portfolio, so far. It’s up 33.5% since the last day of the first quarter of 2019 and July 11, 2023. The S&amp;P 500 is up 51.8% during that period.Will Amazon be a forever stock for Berkshire Hathaway?Should You Really Hold a Stock for Forever?  Tune into this week’s podcast to find out.[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of AMZN in her personal portfolio.]Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Horton (DHI) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 20. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis homebuilder is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.80 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -40%.Revenues are expected to be $8.33 billion, down 5.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.35% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for D.R. Horton?For D.R. Horton, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.59%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that D.R. Horton will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that D.R. Horton would post earnings of $1.90 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.73, delivering a surprise of +43.68%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success.

TD Cowen Senior Research Analyst Helane Becker joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the company’s results and what they tell us about both business and leisure travel.Video Transcript- Pent up demand for travel driving Delta earnings to a record high, the airline also boosting its full year guidance. Joining us now is TD Cowen senior research analyst Helane Becker. Now, Helane, you had predicted that they would post record numbers previously. You predicted that for this quarter and even the coming quarter. What's your first takeaway from today's numbers?HELANE BECKER: Thanks for the question. The numbers are very good. Demand is very strong and you see that at airports around not only the United States, but around the world. People really want to make up for lost time and are getting out and traveling. And the fact that they have the ability to do so, not only from a financial perspective but from the time perspective, the fact that they can travel, make almost any weekend a long weekend because of work from anywhere opportunities.- Helane, is this a case across the board, not just Delta? And also, more specifically, the comments that we heard from Ed Bastian when it comes to corporate travel, he is very optimistic that that is going to continue to move to the upside here. What does that growth look like? Are we ever going to get back to those 2019 levels?HELANE BECKER: Yeah, no, I think that's a really fair question, because he mentioned-- and he mentioned on the call this morning, and we've said this before, the US economy is, what, 15 20% bigger now than it was four years ago? So just in terms of the size of the economy, it should drive higher business traffic. It's just there's this hybrid work environment, and when you plan a business trip to go see your clients, it's increasingly difficult because some companies are in the office Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, others are in Tuesday to Thursday. It seems like Friday is a work from anywhere day.Story continuesSo I think it makes travel from a business perspective more difficult. We certainly have seen growth in attendance at conferences. We're pretty much back to 2019 and prior year levels from that perspective. And our view has really been evolving that into this more, yes, we're going to see more business travel. It's just where you're going to see it I think is changing.Small and medium sized companies have never really stopped traveling. It's just the large corporates. Tech, financial services as an example, that have curtailed travel. And I think as your competitors travel, because your travel salespeople travel, as your competitors travel and they win business, I think you'll see people start to get back on the road.- Helane, I want to ask you about just the pricing power. We know fares are much higher. Inflation in general has been sticky, although it's started to cool. Let's talk about the level of fares, where they are, what the risk is. Does Delta still have pricing power heading through the balance of the year? Even, yes, their guidance is strong, but what is the headwind that you see?- Yeah, I think that, again, you guys are really on top of it today with your questions. So I think from a pricing perspective, jet fuel prices have come down off their peaks. They're significantly below where they were a year ago, and that gives the airline some opportunity to cut fares to continue to see strong demand.We're seeing domestic fares come down a little bit on a year on year basis, and although May was up sequentially from April, that kind of makes sense because the summer months start. I guess May through July, especially if you're in the South, schools go back in early to mid August. In the North, schools don't go back until after Labor Day, so you have this elongated season where you can have strong demand that would drive higher prices.Plus, capacity in the New York area. As you guys are probably aware, the Department of Transportation asked the four big airlines serving the market, United, American, Delta, and JetBlue, to cut capacity by 10%, and capacity is already down by 10%. We are not back to 2019 capacity levels, but as I mentioned, the economy has grown and demand is fully back to 2019 levels, or in some days it's above.And so when you think about that and when you think about the ability of airlines to price, intuitively they should be buying more aircraft, but they can't do that because of OEM delivery delays, supply chain issues, and then all the other limitations on growth. There's no place to put planes at the busiest airports.So we've been for the past four or five years talking about more seats per departure and fewer departures per day as the only way you're going to be able to get growth, and now the airlines are starting to talk about that as well. But it generally-- it definitely drives higher revenue in an environment that, if you see a slower economy, you would normally see slower revenue growth or declining revenue.- And Helane, to that point, because Delta did say on the call that they believe that they've reached an inflection point when it comes to costs, but you brought up some of the issues, some of the headwinds that are facing Delta and many of its competitors today. To what degree should investors be worried about those lingering cost issues, given the fact that we are seeing pretty significant delays for some of those aircrafts?HELANE BECKER: Yeah. I think that from that perspective, we're concerned, but not as concerned as we would be if the revenue environment was slightly different. Some of the costs that you see pressure, labor costs obviously have been-- we've been talking about that for a long time, as have you, and we're seeing that percent change should start to abate in 2024. Maintenance, as airlines get new aircraft, you should see a maintenance holiday just because the newer aircraft need less maintenance than older aircraft.So that type of thing should start to-- should start to abate, but the other issues that are out there just in terms of supply chain, labor, it's not so much attracting, it's retaining. Air traffic control has been an issue. We should. There seems to be bipartisan support for an FAA reauthorization bill, which needs to be done before the end of the government's fiscal year. So I think I think there's a lot of good happening that should make '24 a better year, but at least we're hopeful. Maybe hope isn't a strategy, but we're hoping that things improve on the cost side.- All right, Helane Becker, we have to leave it there. TD Cowen, thanks so much for joining us.]"

The report affirms American’s focus on the sustainability issues most important to its business and stakeholders, including climate change, customer and team member safety, human capital, and customer service.“Over the past year, American has worked tirelessly to fly more and bring people together again,” American’s CEO Robert Isom said. “I’m deeply proud of our team for building back our airline, developing a pipeline of new and diverse talent and advancing our climate goals — all while remaining steadfastly committed to our why: caring for people on life’s journey.”American’s strategy for reaching net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 is focused on running a more fuel-efficient operation, with more fuel-efficient aircraft increasingly powered by low-carbon fuel. Over the past several years, American has undertaken the most extensive fleet renewal effort in the history of its industry — giving the airline the youngest mainline fleet among U.S. network carriers. In 2022, American took meaningful steps forward across its strategy — from adding new-generation aircraft to its fleet and finalizing its most significant sustainable aviation fuel offtake agreement to date to announcing investments in two companies focused on the development of low-carbon, hydrogen-powered aviation.In 2022, American became the first airline globally to receive validation from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) that its intermediate 2035 GHG reduction targets comply with the criteria in the SBTi’s first aviation pathway. The company’s Sustainability Report also includes a detailed discussion of American’s risks and opportunities related to climate change, as recommended by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.Story continuesEmbedding diversity, equity and inclusion across American gives its culture a competitive advantage and underpins American’s quest to be the best airline for its customers. The report describes the company’s efforts to create opportunities for people from all backgrounds, including diverse groups historically underrepresented in the airline industry, and to increase awareness, access and opportunity for everyone interested in exploring a career in aviation.The team at American is the engine behind the high level of service it provides to customers. Even as the company rapidly ramped up operations in 2022, it maintained its focus on offering the reliability, dependability and world-class experience its customers expect. Thanks to the hard work of the American team, the company recorded its best-ever customer satisfaction scores, as measured by Likelihood to Recommend, for the year. The company also continues to have an uncompromising commitment to customer and team member safety.The airline’s progress toward its sustainability goals continues to receive accolades. American was named 2023 Air Transport World Eco-Airline of the Year, and in 2022 remained the only passenger airline to be included in the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index for a second consecutive year.About American Airlines GroupTo Care for People on Life’s Journey®.

Finding her voice in a room full of men didn't rattle her.What did give her jitters was being promoted a couple of years later to a management position. ""Seventeen years ago, it was difficult to find women being promoted to leadership roles-and more difficult to find a young woman who is expecting a child to be promoted to those types of jobs,"" Norambuena says. This was her first indication that Principal was a good place to be.Independence at her rootsGrowing up, Norambuena's parents instilled a sense of independence and work ethic. While Norambuena's mom did not have formal work, she was active in her community. For instance, she once made a small factory of sweaters for a school, and would nurse for her father's medical practice, Norambuena recalls.Yet Norambuena's mom envisioned more for her daughters. ""She wanted me and my sisters to have very good jobs and not to depend on a husband,"" Norambuena says. ""It was something from the day I was born: You cannot depend on anyone, just you. It'll bring more happiness to your life, and it will probably make your marriage more balanced.""Her father was equally supportive. ""He raised me and my sisters to be good professionals, to fight for good jobs, and to seek our dreams,"" Norambuena says. She envisions the same for her own three daughters.Norambuena has also found these values reflected in her sprawling family tree. With roots back to the year 1100, she recognizes the bravery and adventure that have been in her lineage for hundreds of years. ""My ancestors knew Chile was a piece of land; that's all,"" Norambuena says. ""They came with nothing, they created a family here, and they succeeded.""Story continuesCultivating holistic supportSeveral months after her first promotion at Principal, it was time for Norambuena to return to the office from maternity leave. But there was one problem: Her baby girl was crying-all day, every day. Trusting her boss at the time who had kids himself, Norambuena approached him with the dilemma. ""I said, ‘My baby is crying a lot; I cannot leave her right now all day alone with someone else,'"" Norambuena recalls.Together, they came up with a solution. He would send her computer to her house so she could work from home until she and her baby were adjusted. (This was before hybrid work was commonplace, Norambuena points out.)""He was very ahead of his time,"" Norambuena says. ""He understood my problem perfectly and he found a solution.""Several promotions and leaders later, now a chief operating officer and managing director with Principal Chile, Norambuena still remembers times when she wanted to ""run away,"" for fear of failing and not setting a good example for other women aiming to advance their own careers. She credits the Principal culture to her success.""I think the difference in my case is that I had very, very, very supportive bosses. They were always encouraging me to take risks,"" she says. ""And they understood that I have a family; I have three girls. And understood if I had to take the baby to the doctor or something."" She also recognizes, she adds, that having a supportive husband who will split parental duties has been crucial.With this in mind, Norambuena is active in a women's mentoring program through Principal Latin America, and she also brings the men she leads into the conversations. ""If we can also help the men so they can help their wives outside of our company, that's much more impactful,"" she says. That may mean encouraging one of her male team members to take time away from the office if his child needs to go to the doctor.""To continue the change, we have to work with men,"" Norambuena says. ""I was very lucky that most of the men around me were very supportive. But if that's not the case-at work and at home-it's very difficult for a woman to grow in a company.""It's not just her; it's also her surroundings.""Find a career that fits your skills and passions at principal.com/careers.Insurance products and plan administrative services provided through Principal Life Insurance Company®, a member of the Principal Financial Group®, Des Moines, IA 50392.© 2023 Principal Financial Services, Inc.​​​ Principal®, Principal Financial Group®, and Principal and the logomark design are registered trademarks of Principal Financial Services, Inc., a Principal Financial Group company, in the United States and are trademarks and service marks of Principal Financial Services, Inc., in various countries around the world.2954334-062023Principal Financial Group, Thursday, July 13, 2023, Press release picturePhoto: Maria Eugenia Norambuena sitting at the headquarters of Principal.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Principal Financial Group on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Principal Financial GroupWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/principal-financial-groupEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Principal Financial GroupView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/767671/Maria-Eugenia-Norambuena-Building-a-Culture-of-Consideration]"

The Medalist Ratings indicate which investments Morningstar believes are likely to outperform a relevant index or peer group average on a risk-adjusted basis over time. Investment products are evaluated on three key pillars (People, Parent, and Process) which, when coupled with a fee assessment, forms the basis for Morningstar’s conviction in those products’ investment merits and determines the Medalist Rating they’re assigned. Pillar ratings take the form of Low, Below Average, Average, Above Average, and High. Pillars may be evaluated via an analyst’s qualitative assessment (either directly to a vehicle the analyst covers or indirectly when the pillar ratings of a covered vehicle are mapped to a related uncovered vehicle) or using algorithmic techniques. Vehicles are sorted by their expected performance into rating groups defined by their Morningstar Category and their active or passive status. When analysts directly cover a vehicle, they assign the three pillar ratings based on their qualitative assessment, subject to the oversight of the Analyst Rating Committee, and monitor and reevaluate them at least every 14 months. When the vehicles are covered either indirectly by analysts or by algorithm, the ratings are assigned monthly.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Quality Dividend Stocks to Buy. During periods of uncertainty, such as recessions or inflationary environments, dividend stocks often become a preferred choice for investors. This is because dividend stocks can provide a certain level of stability and income even in turbulent times. When it comes to dividend stocks, investing in high-quality companies offers several advantages. Quality dividend stocks are those that have a track record of consistent and reliable dividend payments. These companies are well-established and have histories of generating steady cash flows, strong earnings growth, and solid balance sheets.Dividend growth rate plays a significant role in dividend investing by showcasing a company's capacity to raise its dividend payments over time. When companies can consistently increase their dividends at a healthy rate, it signals their strength and stability as investments. This growth reflects a strong and expanding cash flow, demonstrating their commitment to delivering value to shareholders. Moreover, dividend growers also showed robust performance in the past, compared to their counterparts. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we mentioned data from Ned Davis Research and Hartford Funds, which revealed that dividend growers achieved a return of 9.62% from 1972 to December 31, 2018. In contrast, dividend cutters experienced a negative return of 0.79%. During the same period, the S&amp;P 500 had an average annual return of 7.30%, indicating that dividend growers outperformed the broader market.Also read: 12 Best Long-Term Dividend Stocks To Buy NowInvestors showed great interest in stocks with substantial dividends last year, considering them popular trades in the stock market. However, this preference for dividend-heavy stocks has lost momentum since then due to growing investments in artificial intelligence (AI). According to data by Ned Davis Research, non-dividend-paying stocks in the S&amp;P 500 have experienced a collective gain of approximately 18% in 2023, as of July 1. In contrast, income-generating companies have only seen a modest 4% advance. This marks the weakest first-half performance for dividend-paying stocks compared to non-dividend-paying stocks since 2009.Story continuesHowever, it is important to note that the situation could change in the future, especially since dividend-paying stocks have historically demonstrated a tendency to outperform during periods of economic slowdown. According to a report by Wall Street Journal, there are concerns that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes could potentially lead the economy into a recession. If such a scenario unfolds, defensive companies with substantial dividends could once again outperform. This is because, during an economic downturn, consumers tend to prioritize essential expenses.Analysts also continue to support the stance on dividend stocks, as they see potential and favorable prospects for these stocks throughout the year. Paul Baiocchi, chief ETF strategist at SS&amp;C ALPS Advisors, spoke with WSJ and said that a significant part of the market’s total return has been generated by compounded dividends over time, rather than the price appreciation of the stock market itself. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) are some of the best dividend stocks with decades-long dividend growth track records. In this article, we will further discuss quality dividend stocks to consider.11 Best Quality Dividend Stocks to BuyImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur Methodology:For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 943 hedge funds as of Q1 2023 and selected blue-chip dividend companies with robust balance sheets.

Here is what the firm has to say:“During the most recent quarter, Appleseed Fund added three new equity holdings: Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK), and Synovus Financial (SNV). Medtronic is the world’s largest device manufacturer, and it holds the number one or number two market share in most of its product segments. Medtronic’s business is heavily weighted towards complicated in-patient procedures, which are typically quite profitable. Industry dynamics are quite attractive with an aging global population and the growth of improved healthcare in emerging markets; furthermore, most of its segments are highly concentrated with just 2-3 players that split each segment’s market share, affording the key participants with significant economies of scale and pricing power. The Company has been recently addressing several temporary headwinds including a strong dollar, inflation, a delayed recovery in surgical volumes from the coronavirus pandemic, and supply chain issues.

380,85c683fa-2cce-33dc-a65f-9b5993999ada,FCX,2023-07-14,Earnings Preview: Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) Q2 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-freeport-mcmoran-fcx-140050200.html,1689256850,STORY,['FCX'],"[Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis mining company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.33 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -43.1%.Revenues are expected to be $5.89 billion, up 8.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 8.13% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Freeport-McMoRan?For Freeport-McMoRan, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.90%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Freeport-McMoRan will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Freeport-McMoRan would post earnings of $0.47 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.52, delivering a surprise of +10.64%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Freeport-McMoRan doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Yet most consumers were willing to pay those higher prices, even though sales volumes fell across several parts of the company, including its packaged-food business in North America.PepsiCo generated $22.3 billion in revenue in the quarter ending June 17, a 10.4% year-on-year jump. The company earned $2.7 billion in net income, almost double what it earned this time last year.Inflation in the U.S. has cooled significantly. The consumer price index rose by 3% in June, significantly lower than the 9.1% increase reported the year before.PepsiCo also raised its full-year guidance for both revenue and profit. Shares rose by 2.4% on Thursday.'Treat culture'The earnings of PepsiCo and other snack companies could be lifted by new tastes among the younger U.S. consumers, who increasingly adhere to “treat culture,” or the idea of buying a small luxury to get through the day.In the face of tough macroeconomic conditions, more tiring working conditions and increasing cost-of-living, millennial and Gen-Z consumers are turning to smaller purchases, like snacks, escapist entertainment and clothes.Story continuesYounger consumers are also just snacking more in general. Half of U.S. consumers, and primarily millennials and Gen-Z, now have three or more snacks a day, according to the Circana Group, a market research firm. That’s led to booming snack sales, which rose by 11% to hit $181 billion in 2022 per Circana Group data.Mondelez International, the owner of brands like Oreo and Toblerone, generated $9.2 billion in revenue in its most recent quarter, an 18.1% increase year-on-year. Like PepsiCo, Mondelez said it experienced little consumer blowback from increased prices.It’s not just U.S. consumers buying small luxuries for themselves to get through the day. In China—a country struggling with record youth unemployment—some social media users have taken to calling themselves the “moonlight clan,” spending money on small treats rather than saving up for an unattainable standard of living.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

(Operator Instructions). And with that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question.Story continuesQuestion and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.Bryan Douglass SpillaneSo I guess, Ramon, my question is more kind of related just how you're looking at the bigger kind of macro picture in the consumer specifically. I think as we went into this year, there was an expectation that elasticity would increase and there'd be more of a consumer response, I guess, to all the inflation we're seeing really globally. So I guess it seems like in the first half, volumes effectively have been better than expected. So I guess, as we're kind of looking forward in the back half of the year and even into next year, can you just kind of give us a little bit of some insight into how -- what you're seeing with the consumer? What your expectations are? And just how that may have differed from what we were seeing or what you were thinking maybe going into the start of the year?Ramon Luis LaguartaYes, Brian. So I'll give you 2 -- there are 2 areas which we're looking at very carefully. One is on the supply side, things like become much better. We've seen much better flow of materials from suppliers. We're seeing, in general, better labor market, and that has helped us to run a better company. So that's one area we're looking at very carefully. During COVID, it was not perfect. It's becoming better, and that's why you will see that our costs are performing better and how we're flowing some of the net revenue down into the bottom line. On the consumer front as well, we were planning the year with more of historical data on elasticities both in developed and developing markets. And we're seeing -- in the majority of the markets where we operate, we're seeing better elasticities. And that has continued to be during the first half of the year, even though we're seeing lower income consumers strategizing around, obviously, optimizing their budgets. But we're seeing the majority of consumers staying within our categories, staying within our brands and it's remarkable what our marketing teams are, commercial teams have been doing to minimize elasticity. In some respect it is what we have been investing for the last few years. Our brands are stronger. The perceived value of our products is better than it was. And obviously, we've been able to raise prices and consumers stay within our brands. Now we're seeing consumers making some adjustments. We're seeing consumers shopping in more stores than before. They're looking for better deals. They're starting to look for optimization. They're going to channels that have better perceived value. There are buying more in Dollar stores or they buy more in mass or in clubs. So every segment of the consumer is making adjustment. Overall, we're seeing very positive. And I think it has to do with the levels of unemployment that we're seeing all around the world. Unemployment is very low. In most of the economies, if you think about developed markets, but also developing markets. So markets like Mexico, record low unemployment, some markets in Asia as well. So we're seeing overall very good consumer behavior, especially when it refers to our categories. And that's why we raised guidance on our top line. And because of the first factor, we raised guidance on the second -- on the bottom line as well.OperatorOur next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.Dara Warren MohsenianSo maybe can we just extend that question a little bit. You mentioned some of the strength in Mexico. International came in very strong in general in the quarter. Obviously, you have a lot of different countries and regions within that and two distinct businesses. But just high-level thoughts on what drove the international strength, the state of the consumer internationally. And then I'm thinking particularly about the pricing side of things. Obviously, we're sort of cycling tougher comps going forward globally, not just internationally, but can you also give us an update on the competitive environment you're seeing around the world heading into a period when in theory, pricing drops off as we cycle these tougher comps?Ramon Luis LaguartaYes. Thank you, Dara. There are obviously some markets around the world that are suffering from currency situations. And there, we have to adjust to the reality. And I'm talking about Turkey, Pakistan, Egypt, Argentina. So there's a subsegment of markets where I would not apply the global rule, and we're acting very specifically in those markets. But beyond those markets overall, we're seeing -- and I think it's because what I was saying earlier, unemployment levels being very low, we're seeing consumers continue to behave in a positive way. Our category penetrations in most of those markets is still relatively low, and we continue to be an affordable treat in those markets. So our products continue to be part of the repertoire that they can afford, and they make trade-offs to stay within our category. So we're seeing that in a very positive way.Now competitive wise, I think there's very rational competition across the world from what I -- from what we can observe in the first half of the year, both in our snacks and our beverage business. And that's what we're assuming in the balance of the year.OperatorOur next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.Lauren Rae LiebermanI have to get a little bit more specific around the innovation activity that you guys have (inaudible).Ramon Luis LaguartaLauren, we cannot hear you very well. You're breaking up. I don't know if it's our phone or it's -- now it seems to be okay.Lauren Rae LiebermanIs it better a little?Ramon Luis LaguartaA little better.Lauren Rae LiebermanI will hang up and call back.OperatorOur next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.Bonnie Lee HerzogAll right. I wanted to circle back on your guidance. I just had a question on it. Your new guidance implies, I guess, above algo growth in the second half, but I guess it doesn't really imply much bottom line leverage. So I wanted to understand if there might be some level of conservatism baked in? Or if you're planning on stepping up your reinvestments in the second half? Or if there are any incremental headwinds we should be aware of?Hugh F. JohnstonYes. Great question, Bonnie. It's Hugh. You're right in that the balance or the -- yes, the balance of the year guidance is, in effect, 7.5 revenue, 8.5 EPS, that's the squeeze on the balance of the year. What is implied in the margins are two things. Number one, actually continued strong productivity. And if you look at where we are year-to-date, our pricing and our commodities are right in line with each other. So the margin improvement that you saw in the quarter, 132 bps on gross and 45 on net is entirely driven by productivity, which is reflective of the productivity investments that we've made over the last couple of years in things like digitalization and in automation and then leveraging global business services to standardize how we operate. That's actually kind of been a pivot this year. And that's a pivot that I think you'll see ongoing not just in the back half of this year, but actually into '24 and beyond where we're getting margin improvement out of these productivity initiatives. And obviously, the margins are quite good year-to-date entirely driven by productivity. In the back half, you'll continue to see that level of productivity improvement. If anything, it will accelerate but we are continuing to invest. We're investing in advertising and marketing, and A&amp;M was up 50 bps in the second quarter. You're going to continue to see us invest in A&amp;M. You're going to continue to see us invest in capabilities. And our investment cycles tend to be more back-half oriented than they are front-half oriented when we have a sense as to how the year is going to turn out. So that's what you're seeing in the implied guidance in the balance of the year. It's not that the productivity is going to diminish, it's not that anything is going on with the pricing other than the overlap effects of pricing. It's really a reflection of some of the productivity being reinvested in the back half of the year so that we continue that strong momentum into '24 and beyond.OperatorOur next question comes from Vivien Azer with TD Cowen.Vivien Nicole AzerI was looking to actually follow up on Bonnie's question, but just to drill down on PBNA margins, down a little bit year-over-year. In your prepared remarks, you reiterated your confidence in expanding margins on a full year basis. I was hoping you could just expand on some of the headwinds that you saw in the quarter and what gives you confidence on the full year margin outlook for the segment specifically?Hugh F. JohnstonYes. Vivien, it's Hugh. The margins in PBNA was down in the second quarter. We had a big gain on an asset transaction in 2022. We're cycling over that transaction in '23. And for the full year on PBNA, you'll see the margins up in a healthy way and north of 100 basis points.OperatorYour next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.Lauren Rae LiebermanIs this better, hopefully?Hugh F. JohnstonMuch better.Ramon Luis LaguartaIt is.Hugh F. JohnstonMuch better.Lauren Rae LiebermanI'm still sitting in the same place. Okay. Sorry about that. I was going to ask about Gatorade. So tons of innovation activity, you guys have talked about it. We're seeing it very much in the marketplace. And in the release, you talked about Gatorade being up double digits in the quarter. But when we look at Nielsen, it shows something that significantly trails that. And so I was just curious, I guess, about mix of on track, how much of maybe some of the performance you're seeing has to do with incremental shelf space and distribution given the breadth of innovation and new product activity there has been?Ramon Luis LaguartaYes, Lauren, I think the -- I think there are a couple of factors. The G2 DSD has a meaningful impact on timing on when we reflect our sales and when the consumer actually buys compared to previous years. So we're much -- the cycle has reduced substantially, given our DSD model and that might have some implications on the readings. We feel good about the sports category even though it has been cold in some parts of the country for the month of June and so on. But in general, within the categories continues to have healthy metrics in terms of penetration and usage and everything else. Our innovation G Fit, Gatorlyte and most importantly for us, long term, our powders and tablets is going very, very well. So we believe in those subsegments continue to develop along with G0 which continues to attract new consumers to the category.So we feel good. We're seeing all the execution metrics for Gatorade improving. So inventory on display, service levels to our customers, which were a little bit handicapped in the past due to supply chain issues. So we're seeing the health of the brand and the category at a pretty good level. It is true that there are some new entrants in the category like Prime that have been taken some space, especially with younger audiences. They've been affecting Gatorade, but they've been affecting more of some other brands in the category that had that kind of profile. So we feel good about the execution. We feel good about how the brand is performing. We've increased advertising substantially against Gatorade and we'll continue to do so in the back end of the summer and the year. So we feel good about Gatorade. And I think the G2 DSD is going to be a structural move that will give us better execution and capacity to respond to weather changes and opportunity in the marketplace going forward.OperatorOur next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.Andrea Faria TeixeiraSo my question is more on the balance of pricing and volumes. Obviously, you're lapping some of the most strong price increases from last year. And you're expecting, I would say -- are you expecting still high single digits in the second half with volumes more flattish? Or it's still negative because to get to the math of 10%, perhaps you're lapping Russia, but it seems that the U.K. and France and Spain have lagged a bit for the top line. So I'm trying to reconcile the implied organic 7.5-ish with better volumes. So in other words, you are seeing some improvement there as pricing kind of resolve for the consumer. How we should be thinking to Ramon's comment on some of the discounters and that happening? Or are you still seeing room for continued pricing, but to a lesser extent, as you mentioned, at CNBC interview?Hugh F. JohnstonGo ahead, Ramon.Ramon Luis LaguartaYes. No, we can have Hugh continue the CNBC interview.Hugh F. JohnstonAndrea, so volunteer revenue, the squeeze is 7.5%. What I think we're going to see is volumes will be sort of in the flattish range for the balance of the year. Obviously, there's still carryover pricing. And I don't think we'll do anything different than our normal cycles on pricing in the balance of the year. You tend to see pricing in the beverage business in the fourth quarter. Frito tends not to go in the balance of the year. But that's TBD. We'll see how the year plays out. But the implication that we have in the forecast right now is kind of back to our relatively more normal pricing. And obviously, that sets us up for '24. I mean a lot of ways to think about it as the back half of the year is a little bit ahead of our long-term guidance, which I think is the momentum that we'll carry forward.OperatorOur next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities.Christopher Michael CareyHugh, just one quick follow-up on the gross margin. You said that the pricing tailwinds year-to-date are basically in line or offsetting inflation. I couldn't tell if you said commodity inflation. I guess what I see is about 600 basis point benefit from pricing and a 400 basis point headwind from commodity inflation. So it seems like you're actually tracking ahead. But when you made that comment? Was that a total inflation comment or is there a mix tailwind as well? So maybe price is actually below what we can see in price mix. So I just wanted to clarify that. And I guess connected is just in the context of full year gross margin, unless there's some offsets, it seems like you could see some notable expansion for the full year. Am I reading that wrong? That's going to allow you to invest? Or are there some offsets I'm not thinking about?Hugh F. JohnstonYes. Chris, it's Hugh. So what I had said was pricing was up exactly in line with our commodity inflation. So both are in the teens and the numbers are basically identical. So that obviously is not driving margin improvement because those 2 are essentially offsetting each other. In terms of the balance of the year margins, we have previously communicated, we'd be at least equal with where we were last year. We're now clearly going to be ahead of where we were last year. So margins will improve this year as opposed to the at least equal that we had previously communicated. And the driver, of course, behind that is productivity. And the things that I've been talking about and Ramon has been talking about for a while, we've made these investments in digitalization. We've made these investments in automation. We've been investing in building out a global business services operation. And I think that's the pivot that you see happening inside of our numbers right now is that the margins will improve, I think, on a sustained basis, and it will be driven by productivity, and that productivity will come out of those 3 buckets. So I don't think this is a 1 or 2 quarter thing. I think you're going to see margins continue to steadily improve this year and into the coming years.OperatorOur next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS.Peter K. GromSo I was hoping to get some updated thoughts on the CELSIUS agreement and kind of what you've learned over the past several months. Obviously, the growth has been tremendous. But how has that outsized growth or better-than-expected share performance shifted your view as to whether this is the right structure for PepsiCo longer term? And then just having previously distributed Bang and kind of given the Bang and Monster news, do you have any updated thoughts as to whether this could impact the growth trajectory for CELSIUS looking ahead?Ramon Luis LaguartaYes. I think there's a couple of realizations on this. The number 1 is that the power of our distribution system, our DSD machine in the U.S. is very powerful. And obviously, you can see by the increase in the numerical distribution and the quality of execution. So that's one element that makes us feel very strong about our capabilities in the U.S. Beverages. Second, I think CELSIUS is a brand that is capturing new consumers to the energy category, consumers that were not consuming energy drinks for many reasons in the past, flavor or image or some other elements. That is a positive. The category keeps expanding, and we're glad that that's in our portfolio. And we're working together with CELSIUS to see additional international opportunities, whether we can expand the brand in some other markets, especially more developed markets where the category is a bit more developed. Those are the 3 conclusions that we're taking from our relationship so far.Hugh F. JohnstonRight. And the only thing I'd add is we're very happy with the investment we've made, and we feel very comfortable where we are with that company right now. I think we're both benefiting from each other's capabilities.OperatorOur next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI.Robert Edward OttensteinCongratulations on another terrific quarter. I'm wondering if we could focus on air, we haven't spent that much time talking about in the past but is really doing well and that's Europe. And maybe perhaps parse out for us, remind us the business mix in Europe between snacks and beverages. And then talk a little bit about how the business is doing so well, very significant pricing. I know you had relatively easy comps. And whether you think that there are structural long-term changes in the pricing dynamics in Europe? I mean, for many years, Europe was very deflationary and extremely tough retail. I'm sure a lot of that persists, but are there clues here that maybe there are structural changes in that environment that can go forward?Ramon Luis LaguartaYes. Thank you. Yes, good diagnostic, the fact that our European business clearly has had a terrific first half of the year, and we're expecting that to continue in the second half. A couple of elements. I think we have a portfolio that is quite robust on the snack side. We have very good market positions in snacks. And we have good challenging positions in beverages and our zero propositions in Europe are growing very fast, and they're taking market share in some of the more affluent markets in Europe. So good portfolio mix and good focus by the team on growing that portfolio. As you said, we were a little bit late to pricing last year, in '22. And the team has been courageous and has been able to find win-win solutions with our customers in '23. So as you see from the numbers, good pricing levels, but what is also very remarkable in Europe is the levels of productivity that the team has been executing through simplification of the business and everything else that Hugh was saying about digitalization and automation and also moving some service to essential points that we can service the businesses more effectively, more efficiently. So good work by the European team, both on portfolio managed simplification and then in driving productivity. So we feel good about Europe. We have a very strong business in both Central Europe, Eastern Europe and parts of the economy that are growing faster. So we feel good about the portfolio composition and the business going forward.OperatorOur next question comes from Stephen Powers with Deutsche Bank.Stephen Robert R. PowersHugh, maybe putting a final bow around Bryan's original top line question. I guess, Hugh, the volume cadence that you implied a little earlier, down 2% or so in the first half based on results reported to date, and if I heard you correctly, flattish in the second half. How does that compare with your outlook coming into the year? Because I guess, just stepping back, I'm trying to get a better sense of whether the 4 points of upside you now see in organic growth versus that February forecast is more driven by better volumes or whether the upside is really driven by greater-than-expected price mix realization or whether it's some kind of combination?Hugh F. JohnstonSteve, it's a combination. Volumes are certainly a bit better than we expected and price realization is a little better than we expected as well. So it's a combo. It's not dominant one or the other.Ramon Luis LaguartaYes. And I would say the commercial teams have done a great job in minimizing elasticity. So going into the year, of course, we were assuming a level of elasticity that was more based on historical levels. I think we've been positively surprised on the strength of the brands in some markets. And obviously, as I said earlier, the consequence of the investment we've been making. But the way the teams have executed innovation, have executed range expansion, multiple displays around the store and some of the tactics we normally use to drive volume and minimize elasticities have been really well executed. I think we link it as well to as being a more intelligent company in a broader sense, having better data, having better digitalization and execution capabilities. So it is all connected. And yes, we feel good about how the business performed in that respect versus what we had initially planned.OperatorOur next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi.Filippo FalorniA quick question on Frito-Lay North America. Clearly, very strong results in the quarter. But over the last couple of weeks, we have seen a bit of a slowdown in track channels. So the first question is, what do you think is driving the recent slowdown, partly is obviously cycling high price realization, but also just general sense on what you're seeing from a volume standpoint. And then also why are you seeing untracked channels in that business?Ramon Luis LaguartaYes, Frito-Lay is having a tremendous year again on top of a very good '22. And it's been driven by our large brands performing very well, linking to what I said earlier about very strong brand programs and commercial programs. The away-from-home business and the small store independent business where there is a lot of impulse consumption is not really reflected normally by a lot of the reports that you've probably seen. So that might be a gap there. And obviously, in the summer, this is very relevant as people move around more. But we're seeing -- the only thing we're seeing in Frito-Lay in the last few weeks is the lapping versus the P6 price increase we did last year. So that's the only element. Everything else, we're seeing a much better supply chain. So our service levels to our key customers is improving a lot. That's good news because we were a little bit handicapped in the last year and first half of this year, we're seeing much broader portfolio. So the smaller SKUs that drive -- we know they drive frequency and they drive penetration in some sub-consumers. So we're seeing a lot of positive trends, some of our innovation. If you think about minis or if you think about some of the new launches like the jerky product or a relaunch of the nuts and seeds, our permissible portfolio, they're really doing very well, along with our big brands. So we feel good about the portfolio composition and the continued executional capabilities of Frito to drive availability universally almost. So we're feeling good about the business.OperatorOur last question comes from Gerald Pascarelli with Wedbush Securities.Gerald John PascarelliMine is also on energy drinks, specifically regarding near-term distribution opportunities. You've obviously been a great partner for CELSIUS since you took over distribution of their products, which has been readily apparent in measured channels. But looking forward, how do you think about the opportunity to penetrate some of the non-measured channels that have yet to scratch the surface, specifically related to food service, like college campuses as an example. I mean the comprehensive rollout of these products, something we should expect in the back half of this year? Or is that more of a 2024 opportunity? I guess any incremental color you could provide on timing and then the potential halo effect that CELSIUS could have on your legacy portfolio of energy products would be helpful?Ramon Luis LaguartaYes. Listen, we take our energy products along with the rest of the portfolio where it makes sense, right? So some of the channels you're mentioning like college -- universities, they are very large channels for our energy execution, right? So when you go to a normal campus, you will see a ROCKSTAR, you would see CELSIUS, you will see our coffee business. You will see the new Gatorade energy Fast Twitch. So you will see all these execution. Wherever there are consumers that are looking for energy, we tend to be there. So we're not holding on any opportunities at this point to maximize the reach of our brands. So no, don't wait for '24, we're executing as we speak.Great. So I think this is the end of the conversation. Thank you very much. Thank you all of you for joining us today and especially for the confidence that you've placed in us with your investments. We hope that you all have a great summer, and stay safe and healthy. Thank you.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.]"

389,f17fb99d-cd62-3cf8-bfa7-fba9671a98e8,PEP,2023-07-14,EXPLAINER-What is aspartame and what do the new WHO rulings on cancer and consumption mean?,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/explainer-aspartame-rulings-cancer-consumption-223005148.html,1689287405,STORY,['PEP'],"[July 13 (Reuters) - Aspartame, a popular artificial sweetener found in Diet Coke, chewing gum, yoghurt and other food products, is a ""possible carcinogen"" but it remains safe to consume at the existing daily intake guidelines, according to new rulings from two different World Health Organization-linked groups. WHAT IS ASPARTAME? Discovered in 1965 by American chemist James Schlatter, aspartame is about 200 times sweeter than regular table sugar. It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1974 for use as a tabletop sweetener and as an additive in chewing gum, breakfast cereals and dry bases for foods. WHAT ARE THE NEW RULINGS, AND WHO MADE THEM? One group of experts, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), said aspartame is a ""possible carcinogen"". That means there is limited evidence showing a potential cancer link and puts it in the same classification group as aloe vera extract and some Asian pickled vegetables. Another expert panel, the WHO/FAO Joint Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), also reviewed aspartame and maintained its advice that it remains safe to consume within current recommended daily limits. For aspartame, this limit is 40 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight per day. That means an adult weighing 70 kg (approximately 150 pounds) would need to consume between 9 and 14 cans of diet soft drink in one day to surpass the limit. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? There has been some confusion around the rulings, but the agencies say they are ""complementary"". The two groups work differently, and have a different aim: while IARC flags a potential hazard based on even limited evidence, JECFA assesses the real-life risk. Gunter Kuhnle, professor of nutrition at the United Kingdom's University of Reading, said it highlighted the difference between hazard and risk. ""Sunlight is a hazard as it can cause cancer, but the risk depends on the amount of sunlight and whether we use protection. Likewise, even if aspartame causes cancer at very high amounts, there is no risk when consuming it at the amounts that are permitted in foods,"" he said. WHY IS ASPARTAME POPULAR? Because aspartame is very sweet, much less is needed in products to create the same taste as sugar, so it has a calorific value of almost zero. It also does not have the bitter aftertaste of saccharin, another sweetener. Aspartame grew in popularity as a more diet-conscious consumer emerged in the 1980s. WHAT PRODUCTS CONTAIN ASPARTAME? The low-calorie sugar substitute can be found in soft drinks, gelatin, confectionery, desserts, and sugar-free cough drops. It is also used to enhance flavoring of baked and canned foods, powdered drink mixes, candy and puddings. Here is a list of popular items that contain aspartame: Product Parent Company Diet Coke Coca-Cola (KO.N) Extra sugarfree chewing gum Mars Jell-O sugarfree gelatin dessert mix Kraft Heinz (KHC.O) Snapple zero sugar tea and juice Keurig Dr Pepper drinks (KDP.O) Sugar Twin 2 sweetener packets B&amp;G Foods (BGS.N) Equal Zero Calorie Sweeteners Whole Earth Brands (FREE.O) Trident sugar-free peppermint gums Mondelez International (MDLZ.O)/Perfetti Van Melle HAVE COMPANIES MOVED AWAY FROM ASPARTAME? Aspartame's use in food products has been debated for decades and has also prompted some companies to remove the compound from their products. PepsiCo removed aspartame from Diet Pepsi in 2015 but brought it back a year later. It remains an ingredient in Diet Pepsi. General Mills' Yoplait also removed aspartame from its yoghurts in 2014. The brand's low-sugar products now contain alternative sweeteners like sucralose. WHAT OTHER ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS ARE IN USE? Saccharin, sucralose and neotame are among the artificial sweeteners for which JECFA has recommendations. The FDA has also authorized three types of plant- and fruit-based sweeteners, including extracts obtained from the stevia plant, swingle fruit extracts and a group of proteins called Thaumatin. IS ASPARTAME USED WORLDWIDE? More than 90 countries, including the United Kingdom, Spain, France, Italy, Denmark, Germany, Australia and New Zealand have reviewed aspartame and found it to be safe for human consumption and allow its use.

Envision Sciences Pty Ltd. is an Australian-based clinical diagnostics company developing a pipeline of biomarker-based cancer diagnostic and prognostic tests in tissue and blood.Quest Diagnostics Incorporated logo. (PRNewsFoto/Quest Diagnostics Incorporated)The new, tissue-based test service is intended to address the pressing clinical need for tests to help identify and differentiate potentially aggressive cases of prostate cancer in men. Physicians in the United States, with the exception of New York, may order the test starting today.Quest developed and validated the laboratory test under an intellectual property license agreement with Envision for use of  Envision's proprietary biomarker and immunohistochemistry technology, which includes Envision's unique staining technology and novel biomarkers (named EV1, EV2 and EV3).Recently published data in Pathology shows that 22% of tissue specimens examined with a panel based on the three Envision biomarkers and technology were upgraded, and 20% were downgraded, as compared to the conventional assessment of pathologic evaluation based on hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue alone.1Prostate cancer is one of the most prevalent and deadly cancers affecting men. According to the American Cancer Society, about 1 out of every 8 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during his lifetime.2 A recent Quest Diagnostics Health Trends® study showed that, more than two years after the COVID-19 pandemic began, diagnoses of prostate and breast cancer continue to lag behind pre-pandemic levels, suggesting more people are living with undiagnosed cancers now than prior to the pandemic. Although it is one of the most common cancers globally, existing prostate cancer testing methods, particularly for early, lower grade stages, have limited accuracy across pathologists.3Story continues""Our goal for this innovative prostate biomarker test is to improve the accuracy of grading prostate cancer biopsies. We expect this service to help fill a clinical gap affecting millions of men for staging, diagnosis and treatment for prostate cancer,"" said Kristie Dolan, Vice President and General Manager, Quest Diagnostics Oncology Franchise.

(NYSE:GPS) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Gap Crunching The NumbersWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$269.0mUS$410.0mUS$882.5mUS$685.0mUS$809.0mUS$895.4mUS$968.1mUS$1.03bUS$1.08bUS$1.13bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 10.68%Est @ 8.11%Est @ 6.31%Est @ 5.05%Est @ 4.17% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 13% US$238US$320US$608US$417US$434US$425US$405US$381US$353US$325(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$3.9bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 13%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.1b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (13%– 2.1%) = US$10bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$10b÷ ( 1 + 13%)10= US$3.0bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$6.9b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$9.5, the company appears quite good value at a 49% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Gap as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 13%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.874. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for GapStrengthDebt is well covered by cash flow.Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.WeaknessInterest payments on debt are not well covered.OpportunityExpected to breakeven next year.Has sufficient cash runway for more than 3 years based on current free cash flows.Good value based on P/S ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatPaying a dividend but company is unprofitable.Revenue is forecast to decrease over the next 2 years.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

Today, more than 60% of consumers in EMEA1 expect to connect cars, appliances, energy and water to the internet, and broadband networks must scale to support this.Increased dependence on broadband for everyday tasks, however, means that while speed is still the main priority for upgrades (40% of respondents), security is now a close second (38% of respondents).Sustainability is now a key driver of consumer choice with 77% of respondents willing to pay more for broadband with a lower carbon footprint.LONDON, July 14, 2023 /CNW/ -- The Cisco Broadband Survey1, released today, finds that evolving consumer expectations will reshape the needs and economics of the internet. People in EMEA (Europe, Middle East and South Africa) are rethinking what they rely on the internet for, balancing classic demands for speed and reliability, with the intensifying needs of rising eco-consciousness, secure cloud infrastructure, and the consumerisation of technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) connecting our devices, from smart cars to home appliances. This has led to 79% of survey participants ranking broadband as critical national infrastructure, escalating the need for the technology industry to respond to these asks and accelerate the journey towards a more sustainable, secure internet for the future.Cisco SustainabilityConsumers Want to Invest in Sustainable BroadbandThe carbon-cost of broadband connectivity is a top priority for consumers. Cisco's Broadband Survey revealed that 65% of consumers in EMEA are now concerned about the carbon footprint of their broadband, with young people aged 18-24 the most concerned (73%). In addition, 77% said they would be willing to pay more for sustainable broadband, with around a quarter prepared to pay a price premium of more than 20%. This supports a wider market trend, shown in a 2019 survey by Nielsen and a 2022 survey by Globescan, revealing widespread consumer awareness around the environmental impact of the products they use and a demand for companies to step up and mitigate negative impacts on the planet.Story continuesSecurity Is a Priority as More Move OnlineIn parallel to growing environmental concerns, the emergence of hybrid work and the ever-increasing blur between the professional and personal lives of employees brings new risks into the home. Despite most consumers using their broadband for tasks like banking and work, passwords are still the most popular way (53%) that survey respondents protect home networks and devices; only a quarter have switched on their router's firewall. This is despite previous Cisco research revealing that 57% of consumers worry about cybercriminals hacking their devices. While speed is still the main priority among those planning to upgrade their broadband in the next year (selected by 40%), security is now a close second, ranked by 38% of consumers as a top priority when choosing their broadband package.Connection to Increase as Consumers Expand their Digital LivesAs the number of IoT devices online grows from billions to trillions, so does the demand for bandwidth and processing power to analyse all the data produced. According to the Cisco Broadband Survey, there's no sign of this slowing down. Consumers are instead embracing the shift toward a 'smarter' digital life. A majority already have, or expect to have, their cars (67%), lights (74%), appliances (71%), energy (76%) and water (64%) connected. Indeed, more than half of consumers surveyed (54%) indicated feeling positive about new ways to connect their homes and lives to the internet. This is despite a majority (63%) saying that the cost-of-living crisis has changed the way they spend money on digital services: 21% have reported moving to a lower cost broadband package and 16% have cancelled streaming services.""The carbon footprint of the information and communications technology sector is estimated to account for around 2.1 – 3.9% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and more than half of that comes from networks and data centers. Cisco is on a mission to transform the economics and sustainability of the Internet for the Future. That means designing products with energy efficiency and security in mind, adopting circular economy principles in product development and business operations, and taking a smart and sustainable approach to lifecycle management. In addition to the cybersecurity threat landscape constantly evolving and expanding, we have to deal with the increasing threat of climate change. Prioritizing sustainability and security in broadband infrastructure is therefore crucial to enable lasting and resilient digital transformation,"" said Gordon Thomson, Vice President Service Provider - EMEA, Cisco. ""The old technology adage of 'faster, cheaper, better' has not been relevant for a long time. It's now about simplifying solutions and building networks that can fuel global connectivity and economic growth, facilitating and protecting the digitalization and automation of everyday activities, all without losing sight of our impact on the future,"" he continued.1 About the Cisco Broadband SurveyThe Cisco Broadband Survey is based on a survey of 21,629 workers across 12 countries: UK, Germany, Italy, France, Switzerland, Poland, Spain, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Sweden, UAE and the Netherlands.

The sample included respondents based in every region of each country, who either work full-time remotely; full-time in an office; hybrid, between home and the office; or on the frontline.
