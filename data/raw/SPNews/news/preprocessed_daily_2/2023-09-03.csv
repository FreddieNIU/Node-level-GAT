Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. So when we looked at the ROCE trend of Nucor (NYSE:NUE) we really liked what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Nucor, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.26 = US$7.6b ÷ (US$33b - US$4.0b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).Therefore, Nucor has an ROCE of 26%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 10% earned by companies in a similar industry. Check out our latest analysis for Nucor roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Nucor compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Nucor here  for free.What Can We Tell From Nucor's ROCE Trend?We like the trends that we're seeing from Nucor. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 26%. Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 100% more capital is being employed now too. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Nucor thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.Our Take On Nucor's ROCETo sum it up, Nucor has proven it can reinvest in the business and generate higher returns on that capital employed, which is terrific. Since the stock has returned a staggering 208% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist.Story continuesOn a final note, we found  2 warning signs for Nucor (1 is potentially serious)  you should be aware of.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

That led the Biden administration to multiply efforts to persuade the southeast Asian nation, including through multiple visits of high-ranking members of the U.S. government in recent months.The unprecedented push has led Washington to expect to be elevated to the top tier of Vietnam's diplomatic ranking, together with China and Russia, from two notches below now.Biden said it publicly in July and officials in both countries have since informally expressed optimism about the two-step upgrade, although no official statements have been released from either government.Perhaps seeking to assuage Beijing, Vietnam is discussing top-level visits to Hanoi after or even shortly before Biden's arrival on Sept 10, with officials saying China's President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Li Qiang could meet Vietnamese leaders in coming days or weeks.Risks that a double upgrade with Washington may not go down well in Beijing remain high, but Vietnam's communist leaders may have calculated the best timing for the move is now as relations with China are ""likely to get worse in the future,"" said Le Hong Hiep, a senior fellow at Singapore's Iseas–Yusof Ishak Institute.Yet it is unclear what Vietnam, which is at odds with China over boundaries in the South China Sea, stands to gain in the short term from the upgrade.A boost of U.S. military supplies to Hanoi has long been discussed but no immediate deal is expected as these talks take time, Hiep said.Meanwhile, Vietnam is talking with several other countries to upgrade and expand its mostly Russian-made arsenal, and has recently engaged in multiple high-level defence meetings with top Russian officials.Story continuesSupporting Vietnam's ambitions to become a hub for the semiconductor industry is also part of Washington's inducements, but public funds so far available under the CHIPS Act are very limited.The U.S. may offer more, said Vu Tu Thanh, head of the Vietnam office of the US-ASEAN Business Council.Energy is another sector where cooperation could increase as Vietnam prepares to become a player in Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and offshore wind although administrative and funding delays are dampening the mood.The upgrade of relations is expected to boost U.S. firms' plans in Vietnam. Planemaker Boeing and energy firm AES may make announcements during Biden's visit, people familiar with the plans said. The companies had no immediate comment.The U.S. is already Vietnam's largest market for its exports and U.S. customs procedures could be eased to boost trade, Thanh from the US-ASEAN Business Council.

3,f9ffb1c4-b18f-348c-8bba-1e636a0d35cb,O,2023-09-03,Energy & precious metals - weekly review and outlook,Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/energy-precious-metals-weekly-review-043240234.html,1693715560,STORY,"['HO=F', 'CL=F', 'GC=F', 'NG=F']","[Investing.com - Has U.S. gasoline demand peaked for this time of year? Well, that’s what the Labor Day holiday supposedly says.To be sure, the Energy Information Administration, or EIA, reminded us in its “This Week in Petroleum” report that the Sept 2-4 holiday weekend marks the unofficial end to the U.S. summer driving season.As of Friday, average pump prices of gasoline listed by the American Automobile Association, or AAA, weren’t far either from year-ago levels, signaling a calm market.But a look at the futures markets for petroleum suggests this could be more like the calm before the storm, with crude prices rising 7% on the week.And, quite literally, it is the storm season, with Idalia, the first major hurricane of this year, pummeling Florida with a surge of seawater on Wednesday that flooded neighborhoods along much of the state’s western coast, cut power and leveled trees.But the damage inflicted by the Category 3 hurricane when it made landfall on Wednesday morning could have been far worse. By a stroke of meteorological good fortune, Idialia came ashore in a marshy and thinly populated part of Florida, southeast of Tallahassee.Hurricanes often damage oil refineries, causing prices of fuels like gasoline to soar. Idalia was also an exception on this front, pulling it away from most Gulf of Mexico refineries. In fact, the net effect of the hurricane was actually negative to fuel prices.In 2017, Hurricane Harvey triggered major refinery outages and brought enough damage to oil industry installations that forced some to close. More than 4 million barrels of refining capacity went offline temporarily from a refining capacity of some 18 million. Gasoline prices rose about 20 cents per gallon in the days afterward.Hurricane Ida in 2021 was also responsible for energy disruptions and carnage.As the impact of this week's Hurricane Idalia passes over, business activity in Florida and Georgia will likely decline for a few days. Florida alone accounted for about 6.6% of U.S. gasoline consumption and 3.9% of diesel consumption as of 2021, according to Tudor Pickering Holt analyst Matthew Blair, who used data from the Energy Information Administration. Blair, in comments carried by Barron's, said he expects the hurricane to be “a small headwind for the refining space.”Story continuesWhile refiners’ margins are below the record levels they hit shortly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year, they have stayed strong as jet fuel demand has risen and economic activity in several parts of the world has rebounded from the days of COVID-19 restrictions. Some refinery outages - not related to hurricanes - have also reduced capacity.Diesel cracks, or the margin between the cost of oil and diesel, have rebounded above $50 from below $20 in May, according to Bank of America.“Since [May], diesel cracks have performed exceptionally well, as persistent refinery issues and a recovery in jet fuel demand offset soft diesel consumption, keeping inventories tight,” wrote Bank of America analyst Francisco Blanch.Notwithstanding that, distillates, represented by heating oil futures, fell 6% on the week. Gasoline futures lost even more - 9%.The EIA’s reporting of weekly fuel stockpiles could be reason for this, with the agency citing a distillates build of 1.235M, against a forecast of 0.189M and a previous weekly gain of 0.945M.For gasoline stockpiles, the decline was well below expectations, with a drop of 0.214M versus the forecast slide of 0.933M and the previous week’s pull of 1.467M.Only crude prices had an outsized rally - reacting to a large U.S. inventory decline for a third week in a row and on expectations that the Saudi production cut of one million barrels per day will run into a fourth month in October.“Everyone’s looking at the flat price of crude oil and saying gasoline and diesel prices will also go to the moon,” said John Kilduff, founding partner of New York-based energy hedge fund Again Capital. “But fuel uptake for this summer is still very much down to earth, higher than a year ago, yes, but still below pre-pandemic levels.”“You have an odd situation where the Saudis are trying to create a supply situation even lower than the seasonal lows in demand,” Kilduff continued. “All I’ll say is don’t test the mettle of consumers and the global economy because when either collapses, your dream of higher and higher prices will also go with that.”The four-week average of U.S. gasoline consumption - the best gauge of fuel demand - was at 9.033M barrels per day for the week ended Aug. 25 versus the year-ago level of 8.874M.But consumption is still well below pre-pandemic levels, with 9.777M barrels used daily for the comparative week to Aug 23, 2019.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, which flags all major weather changes in the United States, listed just a couple of storm threats in the Atlantic this week, after the passing of Idalia. But it’s still very early in the hurricane season, and the threat of carnage cannot be underplayed.In 2022, a total of 17 hurricanes were recorded, with three of them - Ian, Nicole and Fiona - bringing extensive damage to Florida's coast and to Puerto Rico.Ian was the sole storm that season to significantly disrupt offshore oil production in the Gulf of Mexico. About 11% of production in the Gulf was shut-in by September 27 in preparation for the storm, which hit the area as a category 4 hurricane.Oil companies evacuated personnel from 14 platforms and rigs in anticipation of the storm, and approximately 190,000 barrels of oil per day in production were lost as a result of the disruption.Tankers and vessels also cleared the eastern region of the Gulf of Mexico.These measures meant that, although production was affected, no crew members were reported lost or injured as a result of Hurricane Ian or any other named storm in 2022.This is a far cry from 2021, when the crew of the Noble-owned and Shell-leased drillship, Globetrotter II, was left to weather Hurricane Ida. Her crew of 142 were tossed about, believing they were going to capsize and sink, as 150-mph winds and 80-foot waves battered the vessel. The Coast Guard was able to rescue all of the crew members, but not before they suffered significant mental and physical trauma.In 2020, Hurricane Zeta nearly claimed another rig, Transocean’s Deepwater Asgard.As I said in my previous post, hurricanes haven’t left too much of a toll on the U.S. oil industry over the past three years. With Mother Nature’s will, this year won't be an exception.Oil: Market Settlements and Activity New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude did a final trade of $86.05 per barrel on Friday after officially settling the session at $85.55 per barrel - up $1.92, or 2.3%. For the week, the U.S. crude benchmark finished up 7.2%. That was after a combined 4% drop over two prior weeks as the economy in top importer China sputtered. Prior to that, WTI gained 20% over seven weeks.London-traded Brent did a final trade of $88.99 per barrel on Friday after officially settling the session at $88.55 - up $1.72, or 2%. For the week, Brent rose 4.8%. That was after a combined 2.3% drop over two weeks. Prior to that, the global crude benchmark rose for seven weeks in a row, gaining a total of 18%.Oil: WTI Technical OutlookThe U.S. crude benchmark is veering towards an overbought situation and in need of a correction to resume a healthy rally, said Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.“Momentum has reached a critical inflection point with limited room for further upside, which will have to retest the monthly middle Bollinger Band $86.80 as target,” said Dixit. “This is very likely to witness selling pressure as short-term price action reaches overbought conditions.”On the flip side, a strong consolidation above the monthly middle Bollinger Band $86.80 could open the way for the next bullish wave towards the Nov 2022 high of $93.70, Dixit said.But a more likely scenario is a temporary pullback towards the horizontal support zone of $84.90 - $84.40, he said.This could even extend towards $82.40 and the Daily Middle Bollinger Band of $81.40 which would do well for WTI, Dixit added.Gold: Market Settlements and Activity Gold prices neared a one-month high Friday before consolidating to end the week up just over 1% after a mixed U.S. jobs report for August, where payrolls came in higher than forecast but unemployment also rose, touching 18-month highs.The U.S. economy added 187,000 non-farm payrolls last month against a forecast 170,000 while the jobless rate perked to 3.8% from a previous 3.5%, the Labor Department said. The mixed reading conveyed the messaging that the Federal Reserve might not immediately resort to more rate hikes to bring inflation to its long-standing target of 2% per annum from the about 3% it hovers at now.In Friday’s trade, gold futures’ most-active December contract on New York’s Comex did a final trade of $1,966.20 on Friday, after officially settling the session at $1,967.10, up $1.20, or 0.06%. The session peak for December gold was $1,981.70 an ounce, its highest since Aug. 7. For the week, it rose 1.4% despite falling 2% for all of August.The spot price of gold, which is more closely followed than futures by some traders, settled at $1,940.28 an ounce, up 16 cents, or 0.01%. Earlier in the session, the spot price, which is reflective of real-time trades in bullion, rose to less than a penny off $1,953, its highest since Aug. 2.Gold rallied then settled off its highs as the non-farm payrolls for August, at the least, “signal interest rates may not rise any further”, something all risk assets seemed to take positively, said Craig Erlam, analyst at online trading platform OANDA.The Fed has three more opportunities to raise rates this year, with its policy-making Federal Open Market Committee having rate decisions scheduled on September 20, November 1 and December 13.With jobs still growing more than expected each month, the central bank could opt for one or two more hikes this year.Yet, any growth in unemployment as well, as evidenced in August, will complicate the Fed’s decision-making process on this. Aside from keeping inflation at or below 2%, the central bank is mandated by the US Congress to provide maximum employment to Americans - a target identified by a jobless rate of 4% or below. Last month’s unemployment rate of 3.8% was the highest since February 2021.“The November [rate] hike odds are down to 36% and once that hits zero, there are no hikes to 'price out' any longer and it will become a waiting game for [interest rate] cuts,” economist Adam Button said, commenting on ForexLive platform.The Fed has vowed not to cut rates so long as inflation stays above 2%, setting the central bank up for what could possibly be a protracted battle in achieving its target.The changes suggest the Fed would have to ponder more deeply on how to proceed with interest rates as it targets for inflation to return to the annual 2% or less level seen before the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020.Inflation rose as much as 9.1% year-on-year in June 2022, hitting four-decade highs as the government spent trillions of dollars fighting the pandemic. As of last month, inflation had moderated to an annual growth of 3% after the Fed raised interest rates to 5.5% from a base rate of just 0.25% in March 2022. While pandemic-related spending is now over, robust jobs growth and wage growth are keeping the Fed from achieving its 2% target for inflation, the central bank said.Gold: Spot Price Outlook Spot gold had a second week of advances but still fell short of a finish that would have positioned it for a greater run higher, said SKCharting’s Dixit.“Unconvinced traders failed to establish a day/week closing above the 200-day SMA, or Simple Moving Average, of $1,954 and the descending Weekly Middle Bollinger Band of $1,951,” he said. “Thus, the spot price settled at $1,939.”Going into the week ahead, the 50-day EMA, or Exponential Moving Average, of $1,931 presents active support, Dixit. “A consistent break below $1931 will ease the path for a drop to the 200-day SMA, or Simple Moving Average, of $1,914.”On the positive side, stability above $1,942-$1,945 will favor a retest of the $1,951-$1,954 level.“Strong acceptance above this zone will eventually extend the bullish momentum targeting $1,965,” said Dixit. “Failure to establish above $1,954 will eventually resume the downward correction.”Natural gas: Market Settlements and Activity The front-month October gas contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub did a final trade of $2.762 per mmBtu, or million metric British thermal units on Friday after officially settling the session at $2.765, virtually flat on the day.For the week though, October gas jumped 22.5 cents, or 8.85%. The U.S. gas benchmark also scaled a three-week high of $2.865 in Thursday’s session.Natural gas: Technical OutlookDixit of SKCharting noted that in yet another bullish weekly rebound, natural gas had the descending 200-day SMA perfectly aligned with the swing high of $3.00 psychological handle.“If this zone is successfully cleared with price action stability above the line, expect to witness gains reaching overhead resistance at the monthly Middle Bollinger Band of $3.25,” said Dixit. “Our major upside target is the 50-week EMA of $3.46.”A break below the 5-day EMA of $2.70 will be the first sign of exhaustion for the current upside in gas, followed by a drop to the 50-day EMA $2.60 and the weekly Middle Bollinger Band of $2.50.Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related ArticlesOil rises to highest in over seven months on supply worriesOil jumps 7% on week as rally restarts on OPEC threat of more cuts]"

When the North Field expansion is completed in 2026-2027, Qatar will have significantly higher LNG export capacity, which is set to boost export revenues and public spending.Qatar is estimated to have spent around $220 billion to host the World Cup at the end of last year in what was the most expensive World Cup ever. Most of the funds were spent on hospitality, transportation infrastructure, and telecommunications.With these amounts of spending now over, the Qatari economy slowed in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, when the tournament was held.Qatar’s quarterly gross domestic product (GDP) at constant prices rose by 2.7% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period of 2022, Qatar’s Planning and Statistics Authority said this week.However, compared to the previous quarter, when Qatar hosted the World Cup, the quarterly GDP shrank by 3.9%.Lower international oil and gas prices also led to lower proceeds for the state and for spending. Oil and gas-related growth, the so-called mining and quarrying activities, was 0.3% in terms of real gross value added (GVA) in Q1 2023 compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Non-hydrocarbon activities, on the other hand, saw a 6.3% decline quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter of 2023.Qatar, one of the world’s top three LNG exporters alongside the United States and Australia, gets most of its revenues from gas sales, and the Gulf state’s long-term contracts are linked to international crude oil prices. So, volatility and a decline in energy commodity prices impact budget revenues.Story continuesLNG prices globally have sunk by 55% so far this year, following the record highs seen in August 2022 when Europe scrambled for supply after Russia cut off gas deliveries to most of its previous European customers.Qatar’s economy this year reflects not only the lower global gas prices but also the lack of significant spending on major infrastructure projects after the World Cup ended.Economists and analysts expect slower GDP growth for Qatar this year compared to 2022.In April, BMI, a Fitch Solutions company, slightly lowered its projections for Qatar’s real GDP growth in 2023 to 2.3%, from 2.6% previously expected.“Our revision is mostly driven by lower global energy price expectations, including gas prices in key LNG export markets, which will drive down government revenue and, hence, public investment spending,” the report said.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects Qatar’s real GDP to grow by 2.4% in 2023, following 4.2% growth in 2022.“After very strong growth in 2022 boosted by the World Cup, the economy is expected to normalize in the near term while the outlook remains relatively favorable,” the IMF said in May.Real GDP growth is expected at 2–2.5% in 2023 and 2024 on robust domestic demand and the ongoing LNG expansion, with inflation moderating gradually to around 3%, the fund noted.“Medium-term growth is likely to rise to around 4–4½ percent after the North Field expansion starts boosting LNG production. Aided by buoyant export revenue and public spending, the fiscal and external current accounts are projected [to] be in surpluses throughout the medium term,” the IMF concluded.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:New Data Proves Nuclear Energy Is Safer Than You ThinkIs Central Asia The Next Flashpoint In A Warming World?Air Traffic Chaos Exposes Crisis In The SkiesRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

If you are not interested in reading the detail of the supermarket industry, feel free to head straight to the 5 Biggest Supermarket Chains In The US. The United States boasts a diverse and expansive retail landscape, with a multitude of supermarket chains catering to the ever-evolving needs of consumers. These supermarket giants have not only transformed the way Americans shop for groceries but have also become integral parts of their daily lives. From coast to coast, these retail giants offer various products, from fresh produce to household essentials, making them the go-to destinations for millions of shoppers. In this overview, we'll explore some of the most prominent and influential supermarket chains that have left an indelible mark on the American shopping experience, redefining convenience, variety, and quality in the world of retail. Historical Overview of the U.S. Supermarket Industry The U.S. supermarket industry has a rich and fascinating history that spans over a century. In the early 20th century, independent grocers were the leading players in the market, but they faced increasing competition from chain stores in the 1920s and 1930s.  The first supermarket, King Kullen, set the standard for modern supermarkets with its wide selection of goods and low prices. During World War II, the industry experienced significant growth due to increased demand for food due to rationing. The post-war years saw even more growth as the baby boom increased demand for family-friendly supermarkets. The industry consolidated in the 1960s and 1970s as large chains acquired smaller stores, increasing efficiency, lowering prices and raising concerns about the impact on small businesses. A few large chains dominate the U.S. supermarket industry today, but there is still room for independent stores and speciality markets.  According to recent statistics, the industry generated over $420 billion in sales in 2022, with Walmart leading as the largest supermarket chain in the country. Online shopping and home delivery have become increasingly popular, with online grocery sales reaching $9.3 billion in January 2021. By 2025, online grocery is forecasted to constitute a substantial portion of the $1.16 trillion grocery market, with an estimated value of around $250.26 billion. Story continuesDespite the changes, the supermarket remains a cornerstone of the American retail landscape, and it continues to evolve to meet the needs of consumers. Market Strategies and Innovations of Major Supermarket Chains Major supermarket chains in the U.S.A. like Walmart, H.E.B. and Target are constantly striving to stay ahead of the competition, and one of the ways they do this is by offering a wider variety of products to customers. Supermarkets cater to diverse customers, from organic, gluten-free, and vegan options to speciality items such as exotic fruits and internationally sourced spices. In fact, according to a report by I.F.T., the organic food market in the U.S. alone was worth over $50 billion in 2019. Another innovation in the supermarket industry is the integration of technology into the shopping experience. With the option to order groceries online and pick them up in-store or have them delivered to their doorstep, customers can enjoy a convenient and contactless shopping experience.  Sustainability and eco-friendliness are also essential factors for many supermarket chains. By implementing recycling programs, reducing plastic packaging, and sourcing products from local farmers and suppliers, supermarkets contribute to a more sustainable future. Overall, it's clear that major supermarket chains in the U.S.A. are not only innovating their market strategies but also taking steps towards a more sustainable and customer-centric future. Consumer Preferences and Trends in Supermarket Shopping Regarding supermarket shopping in the U.S., consumers have various preferences and trends shaping the industry. One of the biggest trends is the desire for healthier options, with many shoppers seeking organic, non-GMO, and locally sourced products.  Convenience is also a top priority for many consumers, with online grocery shopping and home delivery services becoming increasingly popular. A recent survey found that 72% of U.S. shoppers have purchased groceries online in the past 90 days. Price is always a consideration for shoppers, and many are turning to discount retailers and private-label brands to save money. However, quality and brand recognition are crucial for many consumers when purchasing. In 2020, private label sales in the U.S. reached $229 billion.  Finally, sustainability is becoming a more important consideration for shoppers, with many seeking out products and retailers that prioritize environmentally friendly practices and packaging. According to a survey, 75% of consumers would switch to a more environmentally friendly brand. 20 Biggest Supermarket Chains in The USOur Methodology  For our methodology, we have ranked the biggest supermarket chains in the U.S. based on their revenues in 2022 in ascending order, based on the publicly available data.

13,e7334ccc-977a-3ef7-a6b5-14a7d825eaee,SYY,2023-09-03,Here's Why Sysco (NYSE:SYY) Has A Meaningful Debt Burden,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-sysco-nyse-syy-120023371.html,1693742423,STORY,['SYY'],"[Some say volatility, rather than debt, is the best way to think about risk as an investor, but Warren Buffett famously said that 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. As with many other companies Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY) makes use of debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?Why Does Debt Bring Risk?Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for Sysco How Much Debt Does Sysco Carry?The chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Sysco had US$10.1b in debt in July 2023; about the same as the year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$745.2m, its net debt is less, at about US$9.37b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Strong Is Sysco's Balance Sheet?According to the last reported balance sheet, Sysco had liabilities of US$8.54b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$12.2b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$745.2m in cash and US$5.10b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$14.9b.This deficit isn't so bad because Sysco is worth a massive US$35.5b, and thus could probably raise enough capital to shore up its balance sheet, if the need arose. But we definitely want to keep our eyes open to indications that its debt is bringing too much risk.Story continuesWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.Sysco has a debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.4 and its EBIT covered its interest expense 3.7 times. This suggests that while the debt levels are significant, we'd stop short of calling them problematic. Worse, Sysco's EBIT was down 27% over the last year. If earnings continue to follow that trajectory, paying off that debt load will be harder than convincing us to run a marathon in the rain. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Sysco can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. During the last three years, Sysco produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 77% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.Our ViewSysco's EBIT growth rate was a real negative on this analysis, although the other factors we considered cast it in a significantly better light. In particular, its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow was re-invigorating. When we consider all the factors discussed, it seems to us that Sysco is taking some risks with its use of debt. While that debt can boost returns, we think the company has enough leverage now. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.

Meanwhile, the analysts at Goldman Sachs have been busy curating their ‘top picks’ for the coming year.Goldman Sachs’ Top Picks give investors a useful pointer toward solid stock choices, but they aren’t the only one. Another comes from the Smart Score, an AI-driven, algorithm-based data collection and collation tool that does the leg-work of gathering, sorting, and analyzing the wealth of raw information generated in the markets. Each stock is given a score, a simple single-digit score showing how the stock measures up against a composite of 8 factors known to predict future gains. A ‘Perfect 10’ from the Smart Score indicates a stock that is worth a closer look.When these ‘Perfect 10′ Smart Score stocks align with Goldman Sachs’ Top Picks, it creates a compelling signal that the average investor can’t afford to overlook.With that in mind, let’s take a look at a few of those tickers – ones that have earned a spot on Goldman Sachs’ Top Picks list and nailed a ‘Perfect 10’ on the Smart Score.Philip Morris International (PM)We’ll start with a classic ‘sin stock,’ the tobacco company Philip Morris International. Philip Morris has long been a leader in its industry, and has a headline asset – the full rights to produce and market the Marlboro brand, one of the world’s largest cigarette brands, in the international markets. The company also owns the Next, Chesterfield, L&amp;M, and the eponymous Philip Morris brands. PM is positioned in more than 175 markets around the world, and boasts of holding first- or second-place market shares in most of them.The tobacco industry was valued at over $867 billion last year, and despite social pressures against it, it is expected to expand to $1.05 trillion by the end of this decade – so Philip Morris’s market-leading positions are no small potatoes. The company is working hard to maintain its position, and adapt to the social trends, through moves toward new products. PM has, over the past several years, put more than $10.5 billion into developing and expanding smokeless tobacco products. This is an expanding market for Philip Morris, which saw smokeless non-nicotine products make up 29.1% of its total revenue in 2021, and 32.1% in 2022.Story continuesThe company’s efforts – both in its smokeless and ‘traditional’ product lines – have been paying off. Philip Morris realized net revenues of $9 billion in 2Q23, up 14.5% year-over-year and beating the forecast by $259.5 million. At the bottom line, PM reported an adjusted diluted EPS of $1.60, showing a near-17% y/y gain and coming in 12 cents ahead of the forecasts.Keeping all of that in mind, Goldman has taken a bullish view of Philip Morris. the firm’s consumer product analyst Bonnie Herzog sees the company’s smokeless and traditional cigarette product lines as powerful assets, and writes of the stock, “We see a very compelling set-up for the stock this year given the robust compounding effect of iQOS, PM’s hugely cash-generative combustible cig portfolio and its promising investments beyond nicotine… We believe that PM’s earnings visibility and momentum will hold strong throughout the year, especially given upside potential from a broader &amp; more aggressive global rollout of ILUMA, an accelerated RRP (reduced risk product) innovation pipeline, and increased penetration of iQOS/accelerated user acquisition in lower-income markets driven by further price segmentation… PM remains one of our top stock picks.”Herzog goes on to give the shares a Buy rating with a $122 price target to imply a 27.5% upside in the coming months. (To watch Herzog’s track record, click here)Philip Morris stock holds a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street’s analysts, and it is unanimous, based on 7 recent positive ratings. The shares are trading for $95.68 and their $116.71 average price target suggests a one-year upside potential of 22%. (See PM stock forecast)PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP)Next up is another familiar name in consumer products, PepsiCo, the famous cola challenger to Coke. In addition to its line of Pepsi beverages, the company’s brands, more than 500 in all, include Doritos, Gatorade, SodaStream, and Cheetos, to name just a few.PepsiCo has a global footprint, with strong market positions in Latin America, Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, and North Africa and the Middle East. The company has a long and successful record of adjusting product lines to match local preferences – just ask Canadians about their Lay’s dill pickle flavored potato chips – and from its New York State headquarters, the company oversees a food and beverage empire that generated over $86 billion in total revenues last year.More recently, PepsiCo beat the quarterly forecasts in its 2Q23 report. The company’s revenue total, at $22.3 billion, was up almost 10.4% y/y and was $590 million better than had been anticipated. PepsiCo’s earnings, a non-GAAP core EPS of $2.09, was 13 cents better than the estimates.Even better, looking ahead, for the second time this year, the company raised both its top-and bottom-line guide for FY2023, anticipating 10% revenue growth (vs. 7% beforehand) and 12% core constant currency EPS growth (compared to the previous 9%).It’s a solid foundation for a consumer staple stalwart, and PepsiCo’s generally strong position is what attracts Goldman’s Herzog. The consumer goods expert writes of this company, “We continue to believe PEP is one of the best-positioned companies across the global food &amp; bev landscape to deliver outsized growth over the next decade based on our in-depth global category growth analysis given their advantaged exposure to snacking and to developing &amp; emerging markets despite what is likely more modest growth (vs the prior decade) across the industry as inflation-led pricing continues to fade. As a result, we believe PEP is poised to drive sustainable long-term topline growth at the high end, possibly exceeding the company’s long-term algo – which we think should be viewed favorably by investors. PEP remains one of our top stock picks.”In line with her sanguine view of PEP, Herzog gives the shares a Buy rating with a $212 price target that indicates potential for a 21% gain on the one-year time frame.The 13 recent analyst reviews on PEP shares break down 9 to 4 in favor of Buys over Holds, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The stock has an average price target of $204.50, implying a 17% upside potential from the share price of $175.32. (See PepsiCo stock forecast)Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD)Wrapping up, we’ll look at Warner Bros. Discovery, a major name in the world’s entertainment industry. This company is the modern embodiment of the storied Warner Bros. company, and counts the brand’s library of famous movies among its assets. WBD entered its current incarnation in April of 2022, when TimeWarner merged with Discovery, Inc. The company brought in $33.8 billion in revenues last year, and boasts a market cap over $28 billion.All of this is built on a sound platform of entertainment assets. In addition to the legacy Warner Bros. cartoons and movies, WBD can claim ownership of DC Studios; DC Entertainment, the publisher DC Comics; HBO and CNN; and the cable channels brought to the merger by the Discovery Channel. The company’s offerings include something for nearly every viewer, from sports and news to food and cooking shows to superhero movies and gaming. The entertainment portfolio is wide-ranging and diverse, and gives WBD a leadership position as a global media distributor.Looking at results, we find that Warner Bros. Discovery had 2Q23 revenues of $10.36 billion. While this was up 5.4% y/y, it missed expectations by some $80 million. The company’s bottom line was reported as a GAAP EPS loss of 51 cents per share. This was a notable improvement from the $1.50 EPS loss registered in the prior-year quarter, but was still 10 cents deeper than had been forecast. Positively, free cash flow (FCF) was expected to come in under $1 billion, but came in some distance above that, at $1.7 billion.That strong metric partly informs Goldman analyst Brett Feldman’s positive thesis, who, despite the earnings miss in Q2, sees plenty to like here. Feldman writes, “We see WBD’s solid 2Q23 report as supporting our outlook for material EBITDA growth, strong FCF generation, and rapid delevering during the remainder of 2023 and through 2024, driven by synergies that are trending ahead of plan and improved go-to-market execution. As such, WBD remains our top pick in Media.”For Feldman, this adds up to a Buy rating on the stock, and his $20 price target points toward an upside potential of 73% in the next 12 months. (To watch Feldman’s track record, click here)Overall, this stock has picked up 10 recent analyst reviews, including 7 Buys and 3 Holds, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The $11.56 current trading price and $20.88 average price target combine to predict a potential one-year gain of 80.5%.

(NYSE:PM) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Philip Morris International The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$10.6bUS$11.4bUS$12.0bUS$12.5bUS$13.0bUS$13.4bUS$13.8bUS$14.2bUS$14.5bUS$14.9bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x4Est @ 5.37%Est @ 4.40%Est @ 3.73%Est @ 3.25%Est @ 2.92%Est @ 2.69%Est @ 2.53%Est @ 2.41% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.5% US$9.9kUS$10.0kUS$9.9kUS$9.7kUS$9.5kUS$9.2kUS$8.9kUS$8.6kUS$8.2kUS$7.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$92bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$15b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.5%– 2.2%) = US$349bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$349b÷ ( 1 + 6.5%)10= US$186bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$278b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$95.7, the company appears quite good value at a 47% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Philip Morris International as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.871. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Philip Morris InternationalStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Total liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.Dividends are not covered by earnings and cashflows.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

The aerospace and defense market is projected to reach $1076.56 billion by 2027, indicating a CAGR of 5.9%. PwC's analysis indicated that in 2022, the aerospace and defense sector generated $741 billion in revenue, marking a modest 3% increase compared to the previous year. Simultaneously, the industry achieved $67 billion in operating profit, reflecting an 8% rise. However, the revenue growth was less than anticipated due to the industry's struggle to meet soaring market demand, hindered by production constraints stemming from supply chain and labor issues.Don't Miss: Goldman Sachs Growth Stocks: Top 12 StocksIn 2023, aerospace and defense organizations may encounter significant challenges primarily related to supply chain disruptions and talent shortages as well. Additionally, the aerospace and defense sector is sensitive to jet fuel prices, as they affect ticket prices and, subsequently, passenger travel demand. A sudden and sustained increase in jet fuel prices can disrupt traffic and introduce market volatility. To tackle these challenges, aircraft manufacturers are investing in the development of more fuel-efficient aircraft and engines to reduce operating costs. They are also exploring the creation of lower and zero-emission commercial aircraft for the future. According to Deloitte's outlook survey, 88% of senior executives surveyed expressed an optimistic outlook for the aerospace and defense industry in the coming year, ranging from somewhat positive to very positive. Several factors contribute to this optimism, including advancements in new technologies and sectors like advanced air mobility, evolving business models in areas such as space exploration, and the adoption of digital thread and smart factory practices. Aerospace and defense companies that prioritize innovation and are prepared to seize emerging opportunities are likely to outperform their peers in 2023, as per Deloitte. Story continuesAlso Read: Goldman Sachs AI Stocks: Top 10 Stock PicksDespite facing temporary operational challenges, FitchRatings maintains a positive outlook for the global Aerospace &amp; Defense sector in 2023. The industry is expected to maintain positive free cash flow generation and improved financial flexibility throughout the year, which should help mitigate short-term issues such as a decrease in aircraft deliveries. The robust demand for air travel and the aging aircraft fleets underline the necessity for new deliveries, exemplified by the combined backlog of Boeing and Airbus, which exceeds $700 billion or comprises more than 12,000 aircraft over multiple years. FitchRatings’ initial projection for 2023 commercial aircraft deliveries by Airbus and Boeing, which started the year at a 20% growth rate, has been adjusted downward to a low-teens growth rate. This revision is primarily driven by ongoing supply chain challenges, especially at Airbus. The new forecast anticipates more than 1,250 aircraft deliveries in 2023 compared to 1,140 in 2022, with Boeing contributing the majority of this growth.See Also: Goldman Sachs EV and Battery Stocks: Top 10 Stock PicksTo benefit from the growth potential in the defense industry, the Goldman Sachs portfolio holds stocks including Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX), and The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA). Our Methodology We used Goldman Sachs’ Q2 2023 portfolio and selected the 10 biggest positions in defense firms during the quarter for this list.

Pretty amazing. All four stocks have been solid performers this year, contributing nicely to the Fund’s returns.Since we run a small-cap fund but want to hold on to these great investments as they continue to compound and perform, we reduce the positions sizes over the holding period so that the overall market capitalization of the Fund is palatable.

Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance). C4ISR refers to digital systems that translate data picked up from different sensors-such as an incoming hypersonic missile or advancing troops-into a common format, and then escalate key information to the right people These differentiated technologies are especially relevant in a time of increased geopolitical tensions. Northrop also benefits from large barriers to entry in this stable industry, which should enable continued strong earnings and cash flow.” Click to continue reading and see Goldman Sachs Defense Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks.  Suggested articles:15 Highest Paying Countries for Architects10 Best Uninterrupted Power Supplies in 202325 Richest to Poorest Countries in Europe by GDP Per Capita (PPP) Disclosure: None.

TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG) has grown from $1.1 billion at purchase to $49 billion presently (and the stock has appreciated 29% annually since the Fund’s initial purchase 17 years ago).

The Trade Desk is now valued at $38 billion and was $433 million when we first purchased shares over 6 years ago. The stock has appreciated almost 60% annually since our initial purchase. Pretty amazing. All four stocks have been solid performers this year, contributing nicely to the Fund’s returns.Since we run a small-cap fund but want to hold on to these great investments as they continue to compound and perform, we reduce the positions sizes over the holding period so that the overall market capitalization of the Fund is palatable. For each of the four stocks mentioned above, we presently own 11% or less of our peak positions. We take the proceeds from the trimming of these positions to fund new small-cap investments, with the hopes of somehow replicating these results.”8. Howmet Aerospace Inc.

Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance). C4ISR refers to digital systems that translate data picked up from different sensors-such as an incoming hypersonic missile or advancing troops-into a common format, and then escalate key information to the right people These differentiated technologies are especially relevant in a time of increased geopolitical tensions. Northrop also benefits from large barriers to entry in this stable industry, which should enable continued strong earnings and cash flow.” Click to continue reading and see Goldman Sachs Defense Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks.  Suggested articles:15 Highest Paying Countries for Architects10 Best Uninterrupted Power Supplies in 202325 Richest to Poorest Countries in Europe by GDP Per Capita (PPP) Disclosure: None.

One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for QUALCOMM What's The Estimated Valuation?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$10.0bUS$12.3bUS$11.7bUS$12.5bUS$13.1bUS$13.6bUS$14.1bUS$14.6bUS$15.0bUS$15.4bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x7Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 4.83%Est @ 4.03%Est @ 3.46%Est @ 3.07%Est @ 2.79%Est @ 2.60% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.0% US$9.2kUS$10.3kUS$9.1kUS$8.9kUS$8.5kUS$8.1kUS$7.7kUS$7.3kUS$6.9kUS$6.5k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$82bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 9.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$15b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (9.0%– 2.2%) = US$228bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$228b÷ ( 1 + 9.0%)10= US$96bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$179b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$115, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 28% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at QUALCOMM as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.373. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for QUALCOMMStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

No wonder financial analysts and market professionals recommend having them in your portfolio. Blue-chip companies offer investors stability and growth with impressive balance sheets and market dominance. Blue-chip stocks may not provide high-flying returns like small caps and growth companies. However, they still offer your portfolio a safe and steady growth source, enough to warrant a look during these turbulent times.While not all blue-chip stocks can promise to grow your portfolio, some are cut above the rest if you look carefully at emerging trends, market sentiment, and consumer spending shifts.If you don’t know where to start, here are three blue-chip stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsVisa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comVisa Inc. (NYSE:V) is a global financial services company that most people immediately consider associated with credit card payments.

Its core business includes credit, debit, prepaid, and cash access programs for different types of account holders like individual consumers, businesses, and government account holders.The company is a favorite among analysts and is recommended as a “Strong Buy” by many analysts due to its continuously growing revenue and earnings. With the continuous growth in consumers’ shift to digital payments, Visa offers investors a long growth runway for cashless payments. Visa has been a long-established market leader and has maintained its presence despite the ongoing evolution of the payments industry. With emerging markets’ continuous growth, this can spurt growth for Visa even if developed markets grow slowly, making it one of the best blue-chip stocks to own.Story continuesElly Lilly and Co. (LLY)Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in backgroundSource: shutterstock.com/Michael ViEli Lilly and Company (NASDAQ:LLY) is a pharmaceutical company best known for producing Prozac, Cymbalta, and Zyprexa. Eli Lilly has been developing and manufacturing different kinds of pharmaceutical products and revolutionizing medicine with its long history of more than 140 years. The company has produced a variety of drugs that help patients fight depression, diabetes, Alzheimer’s, and more.The approval of its Mounjaro™ (tripeptide), a treatment for adults with type 2 diabetes as an adjunct to exercise and diet, has boosted the growth of LLY.

The drug works by targeting the amyloid plaques that are often associated with the progression of Alzheimer’s symptoms. Donanemab could be a massive stride in combatting the disease, which currently has no cure.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the defense sector, head directly to Goldman Sachs Defense Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks. The worldwide aerospace and defense industry expanded from $795.92 billion in 2022 to $855.62 billion in 2023, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.5%. The aerospace and defense market is projected to reach $1076.56 billion by 2027, indicating a CAGR of 5.9%. PwC's analysis indicated that in 2022, the aerospace and defense sector generated $741 billion in revenue, marking a modest 3% increase compared to the previous year. Simultaneously, the industry achieved $67 billion in operating profit, reflecting an 8% rise. However, the revenue growth was less than anticipated due to the industry's struggle to meet soaring market demand, hindered by production constraints stemming from supply chain and labor issues.Don't Miss: Goldman Sachs Growth Stocks: Top 12 StocksIn 2023, aerospace and defense organizations may encounter significant challenges primarily related to supply chain disruptions and talent shortages as well. Additionally, the aerospace and defense sector is sensitive to jet fuel prices, as they affect ticket prices and, subsequently, passenger travel demand. A sudden and sustained increase in jet fuel prices can disrupt traffic and introduce market volatility. To tackle these challenges, aircraft manufacturers are investing in the development of more fuel-efficient aircraft and engines to reduce operating costs. They are also exploring the creation of lower and zero-emission commercial aircraft for the future. According to Deloitte's outlook survey, 88% of senior executives surveyed expressed an optimistic outlook for the aerospace and defense industry in the coming year, ranging from somewhat positive to very positive. Several factors contribute to this optimism, including advancements in new technologies and sectors like advanced air mobility, evolving business models in areas such as space exploration, and the adoption of digital thread and smart factory practices. Aerospace and defense companies that prioritize innovation and are prepared to seize emerging opportunities are likely to outperform their peers in 2023, as per Deloitte. Story continuesAlso Read: Goldman Sachs AI Stocks: Top 10 Stock PicksDespite facing temporary operational challenges, FitchRatings maintains a positive outlook for the global Aerospace &amp; Defense sector in 2023. The industry is expected to maintain positive free cash flow generation and improved financial flexibility throughout the year, which should help mitigate short-term issues such as a decrease in aircraft deliveries. The robust demand for air travel and the aging aircraft fleets underline the necessity for new deliveries, exemplified by the combined backlog of Boeing and Airbus, which exceeds $700 billion or comprises more than 12,000 aircraft over multiple years. FitchRatings’ initial projection for 2023 commercial aircraft deliveries by Airbus and Boeing, which started the year at a 20% growth rate, has been adjusted downward to a low-teens growth rate. This revision is primarily driven by ongoing supply chain challenges, especially at Airbus. The new forecast anticipates more than 1,250 aircraft deliveries in 2023 compared to 1,140 in 2022, with Boeing contributing the majority of this growth.See Also: Goldman Sachs EV and Battery Stocks: Top 10 Stock PicksTo benefit from the growth potential in the defense industry, the Goldman Sachs portfolio holds stocks including Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX), and The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA). Our Methodology We used Goldman Sachs’ Q2 2023 portfolio and selected the 10 biggest positions in defense firms during the quarter for this list.

Pretty amazing. All four stocks have been solid performers this year, contributing nicely to the Fund’s returns.Since we run a small-cap fund but want to hold on to these great investments as they continue to compound and perform, we reduce the positions sizes over the holding period so that the overall market capitalization of the Fund is palatable. For each of the four stocks mentioned above, we presently own 11% or less of our peak positions. We take the proceeds from the trimming of these positions to fund new small-cap investments, with the hopes of somehow replicating these results.”8. Howmet Aerospace Inc.

Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance). C4ISR refers to digital systems that translate data picked up from different sensors-such as an incoming hypersonic missile or advancing troops-into a common format, and then escalate key information to the right people These differentiated technologies are especially relevant in a time of increased geopolitical tensions. Northrop also benefits from large barriers to entry in this stable industry, which should enable continued strong earnings and cash flow.” Click to continue reading and see Goldman Sachs Defense Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks.  Suggested articles:15 Highest Paying Countries for Architects10 Best Uninterrupted Power Supplies in 202325 Richest to Poorest Countries in Europe by GDP Per Capita (PPP) Disclosure: None.

(NYSE:PHM) saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine PulteGroup’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. See our latest analysis for PulteGroup What Is PulteGroup Worth?According to my valuation model, PulteGroup seems to be fairly priced at around 0.5% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy PulteGroup today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $83.05, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because PulteGroup’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.Can we expect growth from PulteGroup?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Though in the case of PulteGroup, it is expected to deliver a negative earnings growth of -15%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. It appears that risk of future uncertainty is high, at least in the near term.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? PHM seems fairly priced right now, but given the uncertainty from negative returns in the future, this could be the right time to reduce the risk in your portfolio. Is your current exposure to the stock optimal for your total portfolio? And is the opportunity cost of holding a negative-outlook stock too high? Before you make a decision on the stock, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on PHM for a while, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. The stock appears to be trading at fair value, which means there’s less benefit from mispricing. Furthermore, the negative growth outlook increases the risk of holding the stock. However, there are also other important factors we haven’t considered today, which can help gel your views on PHM should the price fluctuate below its true value.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

(NYSE:WMB) For Its Upcoming Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-checks-buying-williams-companies-120637782.html,1693742797,STORY,['WMB'],"[The Williams Companies, Inc. (NYSE:WMB) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Accordingly, Williams Companies investors that purchase the stock on or after the 8th of September will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 25th of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.45 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$1.79 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Williams Companies stock has a trailing yield of around 5.2% on the current share price of $34.69. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. As a result, readers should always check whether Williams Companies has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. See our latest analysis for Williams Companies Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. It paid out 78% of its earnings as dividends last year, which is not unreasonable, but limits reinvestment in the business and leaves the dividend vulnerable to a business downturn. It could become a concern if earnings started to decline. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It paid out 77% of its free cash flow as dividends, which is within usual limits but will limit the company's ability to lift the dividend if there's no growth.Story continuesIt's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with falling earnings are riskier for dividend shareholders. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. So we're not too excited that Williams Companies's earnings are down 3.1% a year over the past five years.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Williams Companies has delivered an average of 3.3% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. The only way to pay higher dividends when earnings are shrinking is either to pay out a larger percentage of profits, spend cash from the balance sheet, or borrow the money. Williams Companies is already paying out 78% of its profits, and with shrinking earnings we think it's unlikely that this dividend will grow quickly in the future.The Bottom LineIs Williams Companies an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? It's never good to see earnings per share shrinking, but at least the dividend payout ratios appear reasonable. We're aware though that if earnings continue to decline, the dividend could be at risk. It's not that we think Williams Companies is a bad company, but these characteristics don't generally lead to outstanding dividend performance.With that being said, if you're still considering Williams Companies as an investment, you'll find it beneficial to know what risks this stock is facing. We've identified 2 warning signs with Williams Companies (at least 1 which is a bit concerning), and understanding these should be part of your investment process.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

Electricity to light their homes, gas for heat, and everyone needs running water. That’s why utilities stocks are usually a pretty safe bet, particularly as winter comes and people nudge their thermostats a little higher.I suggest utilities stocks for investors who don’t have a great risk tolerance because you can count on them for dependable returns. Although you won’t see the world-beating returns you’ll get from the best growth stocks.In addition, many utility companies are regulated monopolies, so you’re assured of a decent return, but government regulators won’t let the companies set super-high rates to inflate profits.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsInstead, utilities stocks are more of a defensive play. When the market gets volatile, or the economy begins to wobble, investors can usually find safety in the utilities sector.But even when the market is humming along, there are some reasons to appreciate utilities. These stocks typically provide a decent dividend. And there’s always something satisfying about investing in a company that pays you back.Here are several from which to choose.Oneok (OKE)Oneok company logo icon on websiteSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.comOneok (NYSE:OKE) is a natural gas supplier in Tulsa, Oklahoma. It connects the natural gas liquid supply in the Rocky Mountain, mid-continent and Permian regions with customers.Its assets, which stretch as far north as North Dakota and to the Gulf of Mexico, use a network of 40,000 miles of pipelines.Oneok is also working on a deal announced in May to acquire Magellan Midstream Partners (NYSE:MMP) in an $18.8 billion transaction.The calls for Magellan shareholders to receive $25 and 0.667 shares of OKE stock for each share of MMP stock. The deal should close later this year, giving Oneok another revenue stream and an opportunity to reduce redundancies.Investors are on board. Oneok stock is up 13% since the merger announcement. As a bonus, Oneok is one of the better dividend stocks on the New York Stock Exchange, providing a yield of nearly 6%.Story continuesOKE stock has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Energy Transfer (ET)A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for Energy Transfer (ET).Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comEnergy Transfer (NYSE:ET) is also in the business of transporting natural gas and propane.The Dallas-based company has nearly 125,000 miles of pipelines and energy infrastructure across 41 U.S. states.The company is a major player responsible for transporting about 30% of the nation’s oil and natural gas.It’s also in acquisition mode. Energy Transfer announced a deal to buy Crestwood Equity Partners (NYSE:CEQP), a master limited partnership with midstream assets in the Powder River Basin, Williston Basin and Delaware Basin, for $7.1 billion.Crestwood has 143 wells, including 73 connected in the last quarter, so its assets will be an excellent addition to ET.Energy Transfer had revenue of $18.32 billion in the second quarter and topped EPS estimates by posting 26 cents per share. But its revenue was down nearly 30% from a year ago as commodity prices fell.However, ET should bring home consistent, if not overwhelming, profits. And that’s what you want from utilities stocks.

The company has paid a quarterly dividend for nearly 50 years, with a yield currently that’s better than 5%. It also has a streak of 26 consecutive quarters, beating analysts’ EBITDA estimates.WMB stock is up 5% this year and has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Enterprise Products Partners (EPD)A magnifying glass zooms in on the website of Enterprise Product Partners (EPD)Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comEnterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD) is a master limited partnership based in Houston. As a master limited partnership, ownership shares of EPD trade publicly like a stock.Investors realize increased dividend payouts and reduced taxes because of the MLP’s unique tax structure; the corporation pays taxes on earnings before sharing the windfall with investors.That makes MLPs a reliable choice for income investors and a safe investment. Enterprise Products Partners is diversified, operating in natural gas liquids, crude oil, natural gas and petrochemicals. It has more than 50,000 miles of pipeline.Earnings in the second quarter included $1.3 billion, or 57 cents per share.

Cheniere is one of the best utilities stocks you can buy.The company is the largest exporter of liquified natural gas in the U.S. and profits handsomely from its shipments to Europe. European customers badly needed natural gas because Russia cut off their supply in retaliation for the West’s sanctions against Moscow over its war with Ukraine.As long as that conflict continues and Russia remains on the outs with Europe, Cheniere Energy will have a willing trading partner.The company reported second-quarter revenue of $4.1 billion and net income of $1.4 billion.

However, the revenue growth was less than anticipated due to the industry's struggle to meet soaring market demand, hindered by production constraints stemming from supply chain and labor issues.Don't Miss: Goldman Sachs Growth Stocks: Top 12 StocksIn 2023, aerospace and defense organizations may encounter significant challenges primarily related to supply chain disruptions and talent shortages as well. Additionally, the aerospace and defense sector is sensitive to jet fuel prices, as they affect ticket prices and, subsequently, passenger travel demand. A sudden and sustained increase in jet fuel prices can disrupt traffic and introduce market volatility. To tackle these challenges, aircraft manufacturers are investing in the development of more fuel-efficient aircraft and engines to reduce operating costs. They are also exploring the creation of lower and zero-emission commercial aircraft for the future. According to Deloitte's outlook survey, 88% of senior executives surveyed expressed an optimistic outlook for the aerospace and defense industry in the coming year, ranging from somewhat positive to very positive. Several factors contribute to this optimism, including advancements in new technologies and sectors like advanced air mobility, evolving business models in areas such as space exploration, and the adoption of digital thread and smart factory practices. Aerospace and defense companies that prioritize innovation and are prepared to seize emerging opportunities are likely to outperform their peers in 2023, as per Deloitte. Story continuesAlso Read: Goldman Sachs AI Stocks: Top 10 Stock PicksDespite facing temporary operational challenges, FitchRatings maintains a positive outlook for the global Aerospace &amp; Defense sector in 2023. The industry is expected to maintain positive free cash flow generation and improved financial flexibility throughout the year, which should help mitigate short-term issues such as a decrease in aircraft deliveries. The robust demand for air travel and the aging aircraft fleets underline the necessity for new deliveries, exemplified by the combined backlog of Boeing and Airbus, which exceeds $700 billion or comprises more than 12,000 aircraft over multiple years. FitchRatings’ initial projection for 2023 commercial aircraft deliveries by Airbus and Boeing, which started the year at a 20% growth rate, has been adjusted downward to a low-teens growth rate. This revision is primarily driven by ongoing supply chain challenges, especially at Airbus. The new forecast anticipates more than 1,250 aircraft deliveries in 2023 compared to 1,140 in 2022, with Boeing contributing the majority of this growth.See Also: Goldman Sachs EV and Battery Stocks: Top 10 Stock PicksTo benefit from the growth potential in the defense industry, the Goldman Sachs portfolio holds stocks including Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX), and The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA). Our Methodology We used Goldman Sachs’ Q2 2023 portfolio and selected the 10 biggest positions in defense firms during the quarter for this list.

Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance). C4ISR refers to digital systems that translate data picked up from different sensors-such as an incoming hypersonic missile or advancing troops-into a common format, and then escalate key information to the right people These differentiated technologies are especially relevant in a time of increased geopolitical tensions. Northrop also benefits from large barriers to entry in this stable industry, which should enable continued strong earnings and cash flow.” Click to continue reading and see Goldman Sachs Defense Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks.  Suggested articles:15 Highest Paying Countries for Architects10 Best Uninterrupted Power Supplies in 202325 Richest to Poorest Countries in Europe by GDP Per Capita (PPP) Disclosure: None.

(NASDAQ:PYPL) institutional investors who lost 30% over the past year",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/positive-week-paypal-holdings-inc-140020012.html,1693663220,STORY,['PYPL'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, PayPal Holdings' stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsA total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 40% ownershipOwnership research along with  analyst forecasts data  help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stockEvery investor in PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 72% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).After a year of 30% losses, last week’s 3.9% gain would be welcomed by institutional investors as a likely sign that returns might start trending higher.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of PayPal Holdings, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for PayPal Holdings ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About PayPal Holdings?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.PayPal Holdings already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at PayPal Holdings' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in PayPal Holdings. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.4% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 6.8% and 4.2% of the stock.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of PayPal HoldingsThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that PayPal Holdings, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$105m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 27% stake in PayPal Holdings. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.I always like to check for a history of revenue growth.

If you are not interested in reading the detail of the supermarket industry, feel free to head straight to the 5 Biggest Supermarket Chains In The US. The United States boasts a diverse and expansive retail landscape, with a multitude of supermarket chains catering to the ever-evolving needs of consumers. These supermarket giants have not only transformed the way Americans shop for groceries but have also become integral parts of their daily lives. From coast to coast, these retail giants offer various products, from fresh produce to household essentials, making them the go-to destinations for millions of shoppers. In this overview, we'll explore some of the most prominent and influential supermarket chains that have left an indelible mark on the American shopping experience, redefining convenience, variety, and quality in the world of retail. Historical Overview of the U.S. Supermarket Industry The U.S. supermarket industry has a rich and fascinating history that spans over a century. In the early 20th century, independent grocers were the leading players in the market, but they faced increasing competition from chain stores in the 1920s and 1930s.  The first supermarket, King Kullen, set the standard for modern supermarkets with its wide selection of goods and low prices. During World War II, the industry experienced significant growth due to increased demand for food due to rationing. The post-war years saw even more growth as the baby boom increased demand for family-friendly supermarkets. The industry consolidated in the 1960s and 1970s as large chains acquired smaller stores, increasing efficiency, lowering prices and raising concerns about the impact on small businesses. A few large chains dominate the U.S. supermarket industry today, but there is still room for independent stores and speciality markets.  According to recent statistics, the industry generated over $420 billion in sales in 2022, with Walmart leading as the largest supermarket chain in the country. Online shopping and home delivery have become increasingly popular, with online grocery sales reaching $9.3 billion in January 2021. By 2025, online grocery is forecasted to constitute a substantial portion of the $1.16 trillion grocery market, with an estimated value of around $250.26 billion. Story continuesDespite the changes, the supermarket remains a cornerstone of the American retail landscape, and it continues to evolve to meet the needs of consumers. Market Strategies and Innovations of Major Supermarket Chains Major supermarket chains in the U.S.A. like Walmart, H.E.B. and Target are constantly striving to stay ahead of the competition, and one of the ways they do this is by offering a wider variety of products to customers. Supermarkets cater to diverse customers, from organic, gluten-free, and vegan options to speciality items such as exotic fruits and internationally sourced spices. In fact, according to a report by I.F.T., the organic food market in the U.S. alone was worth over $50 billion in 2019. Another innovation in the supermarket industry is the integration of technology into the shopping experience. With the option to order groceries online and pick them up in-store or have them delivered to their doorstep, customers can enjoy a convenient and contactless shopping experience.  Sustainability and eco-friendliness are also essential factors for many supermarket chains. By implementing recycling programs, reducing plastic packaging, and sourcing products from local farmers and suppliers, supermarkets contribute to a more sustainable future. Overall, it's clear that major supermarket chains in the U.S.A. are not only innovating their market strategies but also taking steps towards a more sustainable and customer-centric future. Consumer Preferences and Trends in Supermarket Shopping Regarding supermarket shopping in the U.S., consumers have various preferences and trends shaping the industry. One of the biggest trends is the desire for healthier options, with many shoppers seeking organic, non-GMO, and locally sourced products.  Convenience is also a top priority for many consumers, with online grocery shopping and home delivery services becoming increasingly popular. A recent survey found that 72% of U.S. shoppers have purchased groceries online in the past 90 days. Price is always a consideration for shoppers, and many are turning to discount retailers and private-label brands to save money. However, quality and brand recognition are crucial for many consumers when purchasing. In 2020, private label sales in the U.S. reached $229 billion.  Finally, sustainability is becoming a more important consideration for shoppers, with many seeking out products and retailers that prioritize environmentally friendly practices and packaging. According to a survey, 75% of consumers would switch to a more environmentally friendly brand. 20 Biggest Supermarket Chains in The USOur Methodology  For our methodology, we have ranked the biggest supermarket chains in the U.S. based on their revenues in 2022 in ascending order, based on the publicly available data.

In the dynamic world when it comes to technology, robotics and artificial intelligence will play a key role across industries. Companies need to adopt these technologies to stay competitive and cut costs.I therefore believe that some of the best robotics stocks should be in the long-term portfolio. To put things into perspective in terms of growth, it’s expected that the industrial robotics market will be worth $60.56 billion by 2030. An optimistic estimate indicates that the market for industrial robotics can be potentially worth $142.8 billion by 2032.All these estimates point to sustained growth for the industry. This column discusses three robotics stocks that are positioned to benefit from positive industry tailwinds. In the long term, these stocks are likely to deliver multi-bagger returns.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLet’s discuss the reasons to be bullish on these attractively valued stocks.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)a robotic hand reaching out to a human hand against a black background, with the pointer fingers touching. robotics stocksSource: shutterstock.com/sdecoretIntuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) is among the top robotics stocks to buy. After trading at July highs of $358, ISRG stock has corrected by 20%. I believe that this correction is a good opportunity to accumulate.As an overview, Intuitive Surgical has a global presence in the robotic-assisted, minimally invasive surgery business. For Q2 2023, Intuitive reported healthy revenue growth of 15% on a year-on-year basis to $1.76 billion. With the growing adoption of robotics-assisted surgical procedures, revenue growth is likely to remain robust.It’s also worth noting that 79% of the company’s revenue is recurring. As the installed base of Da Vinci System swells globally, the company’s cash flow visibility will increase. This provides ample headroom for dividend growth and investment in innovation.Another key growth trigger is as follows. As of Q2 2023, the Da Vinci System installed base in the U.S. was 4,805. Internationally, the number was at 3,237. Clearly, the company’s presence is well diversified and there is big growth potential in Europe and emerging Asia.Story continuesUiPath (PATH)a robot built in the essence of a human raising its hand to its chin implying deep thoughtSource: Phonlamai Photo / Shutterstock.comUiPath (NYSE:PATH) stock has been volatile with a downward bias in the last year. I however believe that business developments are positive for this robotic process automation solutions provider. The correction is a good opportunity to accumulate PATH stock for the long term.For Q1 2024, UiPath reported revenue of $289.6 million. For the same period, the company’s GAAP operating loss narrowed significantly. With annual recurring revenue continuing to increase on a quarter-on-quarter basis, I am bullish on sustained improvement in key margins. The positive trend in the number of large customers also points to continued margin improvement. I believe that as operating cash flows turn positive on a sustained basis, PATH stock will trend higher. sAn important point to note is that the company’s AI-powered UiPath Business Automation Platform has applications across all major industries. The addressable market is therefore significant and the company’s heavy investment in R&amp;D will ensure a competitive edge.Teradyne (TER)a computer rendering of Miso Robotics's ""Flippy"" robotSource: Miso RoboticsTeradyne (NYSE:TER) stock has marginally trended higher in the last few quarters. A breakout on the upside seems imminent after the current period of consolidation. At a forward price-earnings ratio of 35.8, the growth stock looks attractive.As an overview, Teradyne is a provider of advanced test solutions and collaborative and autonomous mobile robots. For Q2 2023, the company reported revenue and operating profit of $684 million and $151 million respectively.An important point to note is that the company’s robotics business was negatively impacted due to slowing global industrial activity. However, this is likely to reverse in the coming quarters and will boost growth. The company has already initiated shipment of UR20, which has a “substantial backlog.”Currently, robotics contributes to 13% of total sales with 87% coming from automated tests. The company expects revenue contribution from the robotics business to increase to 19% by 2026. With sustained free cash flows, there is a strong case for potential acquisitions to boost growth.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

In June 2023, our SECaaS ARR was $9.7 million, 4% higher than our SECaaS ARR in March 2023 and 41% higher than our SECaaS ARR for June 2022. The first half of 2023 was challenging for us. The transition of the business into SECaaS recurring revenue model has proven to be slower than we originally anticipated. In addition, our core DPI business is experiencing some macro-related headwinds. While we don't expect these challenges to disappear in the near term, given the challenging economic backdrop, we continue to make progress with the aspects of the business that we can control.I remain optimistic about our future. During today's call, I will discuss the challenges we are facing, the opportunities we see and why I am confident in the future. During the second quarter, our cash balance fell by $11 million as a result of Allot's inventory increase and accounts payable decrease. This cash burn is, of course, higher than we would like it to be. As our cost-cutting efforts come into effect partially in the fourth quarter and in full in 2024, together with a projected increase in revenues, we expect to improve our cash flow and we are reiterating our expectations to be profitable in 2024. Our gross margin in the second quarter was 71% due to our deal mix. We continue to target a gross margin of 70% for 2024 despite expecting a lower gross margin in Q3 as a result of the specific deal mix.In July, we announced an increase of approximately $14 million in the allowance for credit losses relating to receivables arising from sales in three African countries. We have been assessing the collectibility of these accounts receivable on a quarterly basis, and in our most recent assessment, the company determined that these accounts previously disclosed as outstanding would not with reasonable certainty be collected. We are continuing our efforts to collect these amounts and believe we should be able to collect them. However, as I said, we could no longer state this with reasonable certainty, so we took an allowance for credit losses. As we announced in July, given the challenges facing our business, the Board formed an executive committee that has worked with management to identify and recommend opportunities for further improvement with a focus on driving sustainable profitability and enhancing shareholder value.The executive committee and management agreed that the right direction is to maintain SECaaS as our main growth engine. In this area, we will continue to focus on network native security solutions. In our traffic management and analytics solutions, we are modifying our initiatives to prioritize profitability. In order to conserve cash, reach profitability in 2024, and ensure that we have staying power even as SECaaS takes longer to ramp up, we are implementing a cost reduction plan. Specifically, our actions will result in a reduction of approximately 20% from our current employee headcount as well as other cost reductions. We expect this cost-cutting effort to save approximately $15 million per year. The relevant employees that may be affected have already been notified.This cost reduction plan will have a onetime cost of approximately $2 million, which will be booked in the third quarter. Now, I would like to discuss our different product lines. I would like to start by discussing our traffic management and analytics business addressed by our Allot Smart product line. The main use cases we see today in CSP continues to be in traffic management, congestion management, quality of user experience, especially for video, policy and charging control and digital enforcement. As governments look to fight crime and terrorism, we see a growing interest globally and being able to block illegal activities such as drug trafficking, child phonography and terrorism. We have solutions that address these issues, and we are seeing growing interest in our products.We will continue to pursue this direction as we believe this is a segment that will continue to grow. In CSPs, we see the need for analytics continuing. In traffic management use cases, such as fair use, policy-based charging and congestion management, we still see quite a few opportunities from low ARPU countries, some of which are to replace a competitive product. In our enterprise business, we continue to see demand for on-prem systems such as ours from enterprises in developing countries where bandwidth is relatively expensive. In developed countries, such as North America and Europe, we see reduced demand from enterprises that are moving to the cloud, with growing demand from government entities that require monthly for security reasons, on-prem solutions.Currently, after our deal with Broadcom, we remained the major solution provider for this need. Overall, we recognize that we are facing several challenges that continue to make it more difficult for us to forecast our business over short timeframes. First, as we discussed in previous earnings calls, due to tighter headwinds and tighter expense control by the CSPs, it is taking longer to close DPI deals than in the past. And the total number of DPI bids for CSPs we are seeing is not growing. Second, the move of CSPs to 5G standalone port is very slow, negatively impacting our ability to grow our 5G NetProtect product. Third, in the enterprise market, we believe the growth we saw as a result of the Broadcom deal has peaked. As we stated in our last earnings call, while we continue to have a strong pipeline of large deals for the remainder of the year, the dynamics I just mentioned, together with the potential lumpiness of large deals, makes it challenging to forecast our DPI business over short timeframes.I want to turn your attention now to what we see in our cybersecurity business and how the market is developing. As I have said previously, Allot is transforming into a cybersecurity company and this is where we see most of our future growth coming from. Our SECaaS revenues are growing steadily, albeit not at the pace we would like, as we continue to see slower deployment than expected. Nevertheless, there are quite a few positive notes worth highlighting. I would like to start with the North American market. I am very happy to announce that a couple of months ago, Verizon Business launched their network native security service, which incorporates Allot NetworkSecure. I am very excited about this offering from Verizon, which provides protection services for segments of Verizon's fixed wireless broadband business customers and help defend them against cyberthreats.This cybersecurity service puts a layer of defense at the Internet [indiscernible], intersecting threats before they can even reach devices. Verizon believes that simple zero-touch solutions like ours are especially helpful for small businesses, which might not have in-house expertise to manage more complicated security measures. The service is being well received, and we are discussing with Verizon various ways to expand its reach. I will note that Verizon did not generate any SECaaS revenues for Allot during the second quarter, but Verizon will begin contributing to revenues in the third quarter. As I stated in earlier calls, I continue to believe that the Verizon opportunity is our single largest signed SECaaS opportunity. Furthermore, as other CSPs see Verizon's success, I believe some will follow suit.We are already getting enhanced interest from other operators to better understand what Verizon is doing and how they might do the same. On a bittersweet note, one of the operators we signed was a Canadian CSP, has decided not to launch the SECaaS service for now, as they are refocusing their business following a major network issue they had unrelated to Allot. This CSP is also an Allot Smart customer and have recently expanded significantly the [indiscernible] business they have with us. Cancellation of this SECaaS launch is a significant contributor to the reduction in our ARR forecast for the year. In APAC, we are also progressing well. Recently, we signed two additional SECaaS deals in APAC. One is a relatively small deal, where we deploy NetworkSecure in a small Pacific Island.The other is a DNS Secure deal with a major Tier 1 telecom operator with more than 50 million subscribers, most of whom are prepaid. The services will initially be offered to their postpaid customers and potentially later to other high-value customers. I believe these deals are a testament to the importance CSPs see in providing business and consumers with network-based security services. Also in Asia, Far EasTone, or FET, in Taiwan has experienced a very successful launch. Since the launch in December of 2022, the service has been expanding rapidly and we are now in the process of expanding the capacity to handle more subscribers. I will note that our ARR from FET has not been growing even as the number of subscribers has ramped because FET committed to a minimum payment per month from day one.That minimum has been exceeded, so we should start seeing ARR growth as the number of subscribers grow. FET and their presidents look at security service as strategic and important to their brand image and in line with their core commitments to their customers. As we discussed in the past, this is an excellent example of how successful SECaaS can be when the CSP aligns security with its strategy. It is noteworthy that this FET experience shows that on average, the security services blocked 47 attacks per user per month. I believe this is a strong validation of the importance and value of the network native security solution. As we look at the market, we see that the direction and momentum of operators interested in launching network-based security services continues to be positive.We see that in many markets, with various operators provide services that are on par with respect to speed, coverage and reliability. As they look for differentiation, network-based security is emerging as an important element. Because it is a service native to the operator's network, network security is directly coupled to the access network itself. There are several Tier 1 operators who have reached the conclusion of providing network-based security to their customers is of significant importance to them and they are discussing with us how to do so. In addition, we are in discussions with several other operators globally, where we hope to be able to conclude deals over the coming months. I would like to say a few words about convergence. CSPs worldwide, have been talking about convergence for quite a few years, mostly combining their fixed and mobile services.Unfortunately, many CSPs have been struggling to bring tangible value to their customers and basically provide unified billing and discounts. The Allot Secure platform combine security enforcements in the core on the DNS line and in the router under a unified management system and protocol. This is perhaps one of the few tangible convergence value CSPs can bring to their customers, offering a unified experience on both mobile and fixed access. We don't see CSPs starting with a convergence offering but we are in discussions with several CSPs in Europe that have launched our SECaaS service to mobile customers and are looking to expand it to a converged mobile plus fixed offering. As we discussed in previous calls, I want to remind you that we changed our strategy for the Allot Secure business.We are putting more emphasis on large strategic accounts that can have a high revenue impact, while in small to medium deals, we are looking for minimum revenue thresholds. These changes reduce the number of new CSPs we can sign up. However, it allows us to focus our resources on the smaller number of CSPs that see more strategic value in the SECaaS service, which should drive profitable revenue growth for Allot. We remain excited about our SECaaS opportunity as we have a differentiated, scalable solution for CSPs. Our SECaaS revenues for the second quarter were $2.4 million and the SECaaS ARR at the end of the second quarter was $9.7 million, a significant growth year-over-year. As of June 30, 2023, we have 28 signed customers, but seven of them have been canceled and discontinued mainly due to our strategy to focus on large customers.Unfortunately, only 14 have started to generate revenues. Most of them are relatively small operators and the majority of them launched the service only to a portion of their subscriber base. There are a few more launches planned for this year. Looking ahead, I want to summarize our expectations for 2023. We expect SECaaS revenues for 2023 to be around $11 million. We expect the SECaaS ARR for December '23 to be between $12 million and $14 million and our total ARR, including support and maintenance, to be between $51 million and $55 million. Regarding our total revenue, operating loss and cash flow guidance, we are providing a wide range because of a specific large expansion deal we expect to close this year. We expect our total revenues for the full year 2023 to be between $95 million and $110 million.Non-GAAP operating loss to be between $38 million and $44 million, including the $14 million doubtful debt reserve. And cash burn for the whole year to be between $24 million and $44 million. As I stated, we remain committed to reach profitability for the full year 2024. This will be achieved through some revenue growth, mainly in SECaaS combined with tight expense control. We expect the third quarter revenues to be approximately $25 million, but with a lower-than-average gross margin of 50% due to the specific expected deal mix. Our strategy remains the same. While we believe that our DPI business has limited growth potential and the lumpiness of the business makes it difficult to forecast over short timeframes, we think we can maintain a stable level of revenues through new use cases and market share gains, and we are using DPI's profitability and cash flow generation to invest in our SECaaS business, because our SECaaS business is where we see significant future growth opportunities.While our SECaaS revenues are being recognized later than we would have liked and later than we expected, I remain convinced of the large potential of this business and I'm confident that it will grow significantly in the coming years. I have full faith in our company, our team and our products, and I believe the actions we are taking to make our goal -- and I believe in the actions we are taking to make our goals achievable. And now, I would like to open the call for questions and answers. And Ziv and myself will be available to take your questions. Operator?See also 12 Cheapest and Best Countries for Plastic Surgery and 20 Biggest Supermarket Chains In The US.Q&amp;A SessionOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Eric Martinuzzi of Lake Street. Please go ahead.Eric Martinuzzi: I have a question regarding the bad debt write-off, the $14 million credit allowance. Are we still doing business with the reseller or resellers in Africa that were responsible for that write-off?Ziv Leitman: Hi, Eric. We are not doing new business with this reseller, but we are making an effort to collect the money. But we don't have any new deals.Eric Martinuzzi: All right. The strategy examination that you announced on July 17, are we complete with that? Or is that still an ongoing process? Obviously, we're focused on growth on SECaaS and a return to profitability. But does that say that the strategic examination is complete?Erez Antebi: I would say that we've done a lot of work over the past few weeks on this. We've reached some high-level conclusions both on the general strategic direction that we are continuing to focus on the SECaaS opportunities because we believe in it. We've reached the conclusion that we need to significantly reduce our cost structure, which we are implementing already. And I think that we will continue to work to see how we both implement this and continue to bring the company back to growth in the future. So I wouldn't say it's complete. I would say it's a work in process, but we've done a lot until now.Eric Martinuzzi: Okay. And I appreciate the color on the full year outlook as well as the Q3 revenue of $25 million and I think you said it was 50% on the gross profit. What should we be thinking about for a normalized operating expense post the restructuring?Ziv Leitman: So, as we said, the total cost reduction is supposed to be around $15 million on a yearly basis. And let's assume the baseline could be Q2 expenses, most of this will be in the OpEx, smaller part, it will be in the core. But all together, as we said, we are positive -- will be positive in 2024.Eric Martinuzzi: Understand. Thanks for taking my questions.Operator: The next question is from Nehal Chokshi of Northland Capital Markets. Please go ahead.Nehal Chokshi: Yes. Thanks. Ziv, I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you that well. What was the comment -- what was the detail on the OpEx run rate that you had just given out? Could you say that again? I'm sorry.Ziv Leitman: So, the baseline is the Q2 expenses, and the $15 million reduction in cost, most of it will be in expenses and in smaller part will be in the core. But all together, this should bring us to be profitable in 2024. But as was mentioned, we will see the full effect of this cost cutting on the results at the end of the year.Nehal Chokshi: Okay. Understood. And when you say profitable in calendar '24, does that mean profitable in each quarter of calendar '24, profitable for the full year '24, or just profitable by the end of calendar '24?Ziv Leitman: It means full year of 2024, doesn't mean each one of the quarter, as we mentioned already in the previous quarter.Nehal Chokshi: Okay. And so, looking into the September quarter, what's the worst-case scenario you see transpiring with respect to the DPI business?Ziv Leitman: Not quite sure how to answer that. I know that's -- and honestly, I'm not quite sure of the question. We gave you the forecast for the revenue -- or the guidance, I would say, for the revenues in third quarter. So, maybe if you can elaborate what you're looking for, I can try and help.Nehal Chokshi: Yes. Okay. Let me be a little bit more explicit. So, your full year guidance of $95 million to $110 million, that's a big range given that you have two quarters left. And what I'm trying to figure out is, if -- you basically see this $25 million that you did in the June quarter as a sustainable level given your order book and the uncertainty is with whether or not you have an inflection in DPI within the December quarter, or is there uncertainty with respect to even the September quarter revenue level?Ziv Leitman: So, Nehal, as we talked about this issue also in previous quarter. Even at this point, one month before the end of the quarter, we don't have all the revenues in hand. So, when we say that's our focus for the third quarter, the $25 million, this is our focus. We don't have it in hand. So for June, we don't have all the revenues of Q2 in hand. So, when we said that the range is $95 million to $110 million, this is our forecast. It doesn't mean that we have in hand the $95 million and we are just waiting for [the uptick] (ph). This is the normal course of the business. It was the same situation also a year ago and two years ago.Nehal Chokshi: Okay. Understood. And how do you know that the DPI softness is definitively macro related as opposed to say, hey, encryption is reducing irrelevant to the DPI market or some other market phenomenon that might be going on?Erez Antebi: Again, I think it's very hard -- it's hard for me to really differentiate what the macro level consists of. I do see the operators tightening very much their budgets and expenses. You've seen operators in the U.S. announced layoffs and reduction in costs. We've seen that in operators in Europe. So this affects, I think, not only Allot, I think it probably affects other technology providers who are selling to the operators. Now, I don't think that there's -- I don't see technically a material change in the ability of DPI to provide value because of encryption or something like that. We're dealing with increased encryption and we have certain algorithms and I would say, certain algorithms, some of them [indiscernible] some of them based on AI and machine learning to help us cope with that.I don't think that, that's a major contributor, but the macro environment is definitely harder for operators today and as a result for companies providing them with the technology.Nehal Chokshi: Okay. Great. Thank you for answering my questions.Operator: The next question is from Marc Silk of Silk Investment Advisors. Please go ahead.Marc Silk: Excuse me. Thanks for taking my questions. I had questions on the July 20 announcement of a Tier 1 with more than 50 million, mostly prepaid customers. So, you're initially offering it to the postpaid customers and then potentially to other high-value customers. Does that include the prepaid customers? Or that's basically something that's not a product for prepaid?Erez Antebi: High-value customers include both postpaid customers, which typically pay a lot more than prepaid, and some of the prepaid customers as well. Prepaid means different things in different geographies. I mean, it's always in prepaid, obviously, but it's not necessarily just very, very poor people who have very, very little money and are trying to save every cent. It's also a way of how people spend their money and how they choose to contract with the telecom operator. So, high-value customers or a mix of both. Now having said that, the majority of the -- and you can imagine, this is an APAC customer, tens of millions of customers, we said more than 50 million. We can assume that a majority of them are really very low revenue producing, a very low ARPU type customers to the operator and they will probably not be relevant or not relevant to a large extent to the service.Marc Silk: Okay. So the report that China continues to basically try to infiltrate Taiwan as far as with phishing et cetera, et cetera, are you seeing that from other Asian countries that might be an impetus to use your products or you don't really hear that from some of these customers?Erez Antebi: No. I haven't heard that as the reason or motivation from any of our customers or any of the operators, neither in Taiwan nor elsewhere.Marc Silk: Okay. And then I'm just concerned about this 2024 profitability, which I know you're trying to do the right things here. But I'm worried that we could have a recession next year and then you have another excuse. So, I think it's important that the executive committee, as you're looking at this, as they go throughout the rest of the year, they're going to really make an assessment if you get to -- you can get to profitability, because the story is getting a little old and it's frustrating because you have fantastic technology. So, I think they got to kind of maybe think outside the box because your stock price is not reflecting your revenues or the success of your product. So, has that been discussed as well as saying that maybe a bigger company could do better?Erez Antebi: I shared what I can from the discussions that with -- the conclusions that we had with the executive committee. And I think, as I said with the response to a previous question by someone else on this call, the work is not done. We've reached the conclusions until now and we will continue to work to make sure that we find a way both to reach profitability next year and to create shareholder value.Marc Silk: Okay. And on a positive note, I did see an advertisement for Verizon and I did call them and it's being well received. And they said there haven't been any issues with the customers. And they say, usually, if people call us back, then there's problems and they haven't really got any call back. So let's hope that this can accelerate growth and maybe bring some other big customers on board. So good luck, I guess, and I'd like to see the Board and management buy shares in the open market. It's the only way to show confidence because stock is cheap, money talks. Thank you.Erez Antebi: Thank you.Operator: The next question is from Rory Wallace of [Outbridge] (ph). Please go ahead.Rory Wallace: Hey, Erez and Ziv. Following on Marc's point there, it does seem like Verizon is showing a pretty good commitment to the service with the way they've launched it. The way they priced it, they're certainly pricing it as a pretty incrementally valuable service of $10 or $20 per line. And there's obviously 30 million Verizon business lines across their group. But currently, probably 1 million of that or less is on FWA. So, you mentioned potential expansion opportunity within Verizon based on how the service seems to be going for them so far, it would seem logical that they might expand at some point. But I want to understand your thought process around that. And also just when you talk about it being the largest contract that you've won and the biggest opportunity you see, what are you sort of basing that analysis around?Is it the FWA opportunity over a few years' time and that alone is enough to make it the biggest? Or is it really predicated on kind of growing outside of FWA into the full business group or even the consumer group?Erez Antebi: Okay. So, I'm obviously very excited about what's happening in Verizon. And so far, it looks to be successful for everyone, and that's great. Now, right now, as you mentioned, it has been sold only to fixed wireless access customers. We're talking and I mentioned this in my notes before, we're talking to Verizon about -- because it's going well, about possibility to expand that, to expand the service and the reach of the service beyond what it is today. I cannot elaborate whether this will be expanded to and if it will be expanded to anyone. If and when things are concluded, as Verizon allows us to share, I will be happy to share it. Regarding my comment on the size -- the potential size of Verizon, I think the contract we have is with Verizon, the company.No, we don't have a contract on fixed wireless access in Verizon. We have a contract with Verizon. They have launched it to a specific segment. When I look at overall, I look at the size of Verizon and the potential where this can go. I look at the -- not just the size, number of subscribers but also the fact that Verizon is in the United States with high revenue per customer and high ARPU. You mentioned that the price that they're putting out in the market for the security services between $10 to $20 a month. And I think that translates to a very large opportunity for us. How much of that opportunity will materialize? I do not know. But anyway, I look at it, I believe today that it's the single largest signed opportunity that we have.Rory Wallace: Yes, that makes a lot of sense and I appreciate those comments. So yes, good work and congratulations on that launching and it's been well so far. To your comments on the rest of the U.S. market or sort of halo opportunities coming out of Verizon watching the service, can you give any more specific about the nature of those conversations? I know you -- it takes a long time to win these Tier 1s and you've been knocking on their doors and having meetings of senior executives for some time in some of these companies. But is it really potentially accelerating actual signings of large merchant opportunities for you?Erez Antebi: As you said correctly, it's a long process, it takes time. It's hard for me to predict any short-term revenue -- short-term, sorry, results. So, I would rather not create any expectations that I may not be able to stand behind. So, I think we're talking to the other operators. I think it's interesting. I think there's potential there. But beyond that, I wouldn't comment.Rory Wallace: Got it. And then as far as that Tier 1 Canadian operator, they've had a few things come up and it's not totally shocking to hear that, I guess, they're pushing out the launch. I just wanted to be clear, are they backing away from offering SECaaS at any point in time? Or is it just that they sort of deferred the launch date to an unknown future date, so you've kind of conservatively taken that out of any future projections? And then I think you mentioned they're still taking DPI equipment from Allot. And I was wondering if that might be part of the reason for the Q3 gross margin being lower, might be that -- maybe there was a bundled thought process around how you structure that contract. Just trying to understand because the gross margin, did you say 50% or 60% for Q3, but it's a lot lower than the gross margin you've had in any other quarter.Ziv Leitman: So I said 50% for Q3, 50% for Q3. There's no difference between postponing indefinitely to not doing, because it's subject to change anyway regardless. So, right now, we're not doing it. That's how we look at it. In the future, future can be many things. It's obviously no longer in any of our forecasts. And regarding the Q3 projected margin, it's very low and it's related to a mix of a few deals. But beyond that, I don't want to specify where exactly it's coming from.Rory Wallace: Okay. That's fair. And then with sort of other large opportunity on Vodafone for HomeSecure, I think you mentioned the convergence of mobile and then fixed services. But can you comment any more on the opportunity with Vodafone or any of these other fixed line deals that you've won for the HomeSecure product?Erez Antebi: Like we announced, I don't remember when, but a while ago, we signed an agreement with Vodafone to launch the HomeSecure product. And that's -- and we're very hopeful that it will launch and will be successful. I don't have other comments on that. We're talking to various other operators, both in Europe and in other places about launching HomeSecure. It's one of our product lines. We are actively selling it. And I'm not sure I have much more to add beyond that.Rory Wallace: Okay. And then the operating expense run rate that you mentioned you used Q2, you previously said Q3 would come down from Q2 levels out before this most recent cost reduction actions. So, is there some cushion in that? Or is there a reason why that prior sort of expected step down in the Q3 OpEx level wouldn't have been happening anyway?Ziv Leitman: In Q3, as we said, we are going to book the $2 million of one-time [lease] (ph) expenses. And the other expenses should be roughly in the same level as the second quarter.Rory Wallace: Okay. Got it. And then, in terms of working capital, you had the inventory come up quite a bit. I guess some of that's going to be related to this, the lower-margin business. But what should we expect from working capital going forward? I mean is your goal going to be to kind of bring back these days of inventory and receivables and payables kind of back to where they were? And that should be a tailwind for cash flow at some point letting alone that $14 million bad debt receivable that's still sitting out there. I mean is it fair to think that working capital should normalize at some point?Ziv Leitman: Currently, I wouldn't take it into account. It can sharply go down, but definitely, it will not be increased further.Rory Wallace: Okay. Thank you for taking my questions.Ziv Leitman: Thank you.Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Antebi, would you like to make your concluding statement?Erez Antebi: Yes. I want to thank you all again for joining this call and for asking the questions and participating, and I look forward to talking to you in the next conference call next quarter. Thank you very much.Operator: Thank you. This concludes the Allot second quarter 2023 results conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may go ahead and disconnect.]"

Microsoft and Meta are both set to hold events in September to show off their latest innovations in artificial intelligence, while Salesforce is expected to further tout AI efforts at its annual Dreamforce conference.""AI is probably not priced in,"" Spouting Rock Asset Management chief strategist Rhys Williams told Yahoo Finance about the opportunity to invest in artificial intelligence. ""The AI story is terrific right now. ... We’re still in the early innings.""Artificial intelligence will likely be a theme at Goldman Sachs’ Communacopia &amp; Technology Conference in September too, where leaders across telecoms, media, and technology could give insight on various AI investments.Story continuesInvestors holding cashMore investors are holding cash or investing in cash-related products amid higher rates and uncertainty over the Fed’s path of monetary policy.And excess cash could help the market regain momentum and drive further gains, one strategist said.""With all of this fear, I think people are underestimating the amount of cash on the sidelines that has to play catch-up for underperformance in the first half of the year,"" Great Hill Capital chairman Thomas Hayes told Yahoo Finance.The total assets in money market funds have risen dramatically this year, totaling $5.57 trillion as of Aug. 23, according to the Investment Company Institute.Read more: The best high-yield money market accounts for September 2023Apple’s upcoming product eventApple’s run to $3 trillion in market value earlier this year helped the Nasdaq 100 post a record first half of the year, and given the company’s dominance in equity markets, an impressive lineup of products could be a positive catalyst.Apple’s next major product unveiling is set for Sept. 12 at the tech giant’s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. And while Apple has not disclosed details, Wall Street is expecting the company to debut its iPhone 15 as well as new Apple watches.Apple CEO Tim Cook looks at a new iPhone 14 Pro during an Apple special event on Sept. 7, 2022, in Cupertino, Calif.

""It might be a gadget, a prime product push.""Apple is under pressure to impress at its event. The tech giant snapped its seven-month win streak in August after iPhone sales declined for the third quarter in a row.While only time will tell whether or not these factors will be enough to upend the well-known ""September effect,"" they give investors reason to believe there’s a chance markets could surprise to the upside.Seana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

53,9e3e59bc-a5d5-3918-80f9-690544140289,DIS,2023-09-03,Jim Cramer Recommended These 10 Stocks,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-recommended-10-stocks-035934459.html,1693713574,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'F', 'HON', 'LNG', 'DIS', 'WM', 'TSLA']","[In this article, we discuss Jim Cramer recommended these 10 stocks. If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Jim Cramer Recommended These 5 Stocks.It’s been almost a year since Jim Cramer made solid bets on stocks investors should consider buying on the weakness. When the Mad Money Host made the recommendations, oil prices had declined from $124 a barrel to about $82. The slide resulted in many commodity stocks coming under pressure and pulling back from the highs of the time.Following the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022, oil prices skyrocketed above the $100 a barrel level amid supply constraints and rising demand.  Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) were some of the beneficiaries of the high commodity prices that made it possible for them to resume dividends and buybacks as free cash flows increased significantly.“Oil’s down big, gasoline down big, and you can now buy all sorts of stocks that benefit from cheaper fuel, especially the travel and leisure plays,” Cramer said at the time.Stocks were under immense pressure in August last year as the US Federal Reserve embarked on an aggressive monetary policy tightening spree. At the time, the focus was to push inflation levels lower through the hiking of interest rates. Cramer criticized the Fed for the aggressive stance that he believed would drag down the markets.On the other hand, the concern was that higher interest rates would tip the economy into recession as it was trying to bounce back from the COVID-19-triggered slowdown. While it’s always recommended to sell industrial stocks during an economic slowdown, declining commodity prices such as oil, according to Cramer, provided an opportunity to purchase at highly discounted levels.Cramer has always insisted on capitalizing and building positions whenever the market gets challenging. Some of his long-term themes have always been in the tech industry and energy sector, which he believes will always outperform regardless of what policymakers do.Story continuesWhile the focus has always been tech plays, the Mad Money host has also made a name for himself by calling for greater diversification into other sectors.Jim Cramer Recommended These 10 StocksWhile it is essential to stick with the magnificent seven of - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), it’s become increasingly clear that other stocks have value. Getty Images Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:GETY)  is one of the stocks that the CNBC commentator touted as having a solid business with solid long term outlook after it went public again via a SPAC merger.While most people have always shunned SPAC stocks Cramer touted Getty Images for its core business that revolves around providing high quality visual images backed with a massive library of content“This is one of the rare SPACs story where the merger target is a quality business, its actually profitable,” Cramer said. The remarks came after the stock had registered a 149% gain in a single day. However, as days went on the stock struggled to maintain the upward momentum.Additionally, Cramer has always seen winners in the consumer discretionary sector as well as the healthcare sector going by his recommendations. He also maintains a close eye on the financial sector with eyes on JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) and Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC).While there has always been skepticism about Cramer’s recommendations, Long Cramer ETF, which goes long Cramer’s recommendations, is up by about 16% year to date. The outperformance attests to CNBC’s commentator's ability to get it right on winners in the market.Our MethodologyIn August 2022 Jim Cramer during his Mad Money show on CNBC made some stock recommendations. In this article we decided to take a look at how those stock recommendations played out. We calculated returns of each stock Cramer recommended back then and compared those returns with S&amp;P 500's returns during the same period.Jim Cramer Recommended These Stocks10. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F)Stock Gain since August: -21% S&amp;P 500 Gain since August: 9.4%Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) is one of the oldest automakers in the US that designs, develops, and delivers a range of Ford trucks, commercial cars, and vans. The company remains under pressure as it continues to face headwinds in its bid to launch electric vehicles.While Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) has underperformed when compared to Tesla, the CNBC commentator believes there is significant   value to unlock in the company.“I think the market ingenuity an innovation here at Ford are undervalued. Undervalued vs Tesla and possibly against everything else in the market,” Cramer said.The automaker has already moved the launch of its all-electric Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) Explorer for the European market to the summer of 2024 from early in the year. The company has already reiterated that its EV ramp-up may take longer than anticipated.As other companies focus on electric vehicles, Ford may bring to market more hybrid options driven by the success of its current gasoline-electric options.The focus on pure electric cars might explain why the stock is down by about 21% over the past 12 months compared to a 9.4% gain for the S&amp;P 500.9. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Stock Gain since August: -20% S&amp;P 500 Gain since August: 9.4%The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is an entertainment company that engages in film and episodic television content production and distribution. In addition to content production, it also runs some of the biggest theme parks in the world. It has turned out to be one of Cramer’s big mistakes as the stock has struggled over the past one year.The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) has had to contend with revenue struggles everywhere apart from international parks over the past 12 months. In the most recent quarter, the company lost about 12 million streaming subscribers as it also took a hit on restructuring costs and missed revenue projections.Since Cramer recommended the stock, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is down by about 20% underperforming the S&amp;P 500 by wide margins.8. Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM)Stock Gain since August: -4.8% S&amp;P 500 Gain since August: 9.4%Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) is a company that engages in the provision of environmental solutions to residential, commercial, and industrial customers. Its core business revolves around collecting and transporting waste and recyclable materials.The recommendation came at a time when Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) had signed big contracts and rewarded investors with a big dividend boost. While the stock has been in consolidation in recent months, it is down by 4.8% from August of last year, underperforming the S&amp;P 500, which is up by about 9.4%.7. Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) Stock Gain since August: -1% S&amp;P 500 Gain since August: 9.4%Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) is a diversified technology and manufacturing company. It operates in the Aerospace segment, offering auxiliary power units and propulsion engines, among other things. The Honeywell Building technologies provide software applications for radar and surveillance systems.Cramer recommended Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) as one of the stocks well poised to benefit from declining commodities prices, such as oil, that was expected to fuel activity in the aviation industry. Additionally, he remained confident about the stock following great earning results.Nevertheless, Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) has been extremely volatile, rallying by more than 28% from October lows only to give back a good chunk of the gains. It is currently down by about 1% from when Cramer recommended it.6. Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE:LNG)Stock Gain since August: 10.8%   S&amp;P 500 Gain since August: 9.4%Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE:LNG) is an infrastructure company that specializes in liquefied natural gas-related business. The company owns and operates one of the largest pipelines out of Texas. When Cramer recommended the stock in August of last year, it was up by more than 59% on benefiting from rising commodity prices.Cramer insisting that the stock was pretty darn cheap was spot on as the stock did rally 15% afterward. Nevertheless, as the year came to a close, Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE:LNG) did come under pressure giving back a significant chunk of the gains.Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE:LNG) has outperformed the S&amp;P 500, which is up 9.4% over the past 12 months. Cheniere is up by about 10.8% over the past 12 months.Click to continue reading and see Jim Cramer Recommended These 5 Stocks.Suggested articles:Jim Chanos’ 10 Short Positions in 2023Goldman Sachs Tech Stocks: Top 12 Stock Picks10 Most Promising Penny Stocks According to AnalystsDisclosure: None. Jim Cramer Recommended These 10 Stocks is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Electricity to light their homes, gas for heat, and everyone needs running water. That’s why utilities stocks are usually a pretty safe bet, particularly as winter comes and people nudge their thermostats a little higher.I suggest utilities stocks for investors who don’t have a great risk tolerance because you can count on them for dependable returns. Although you won’t see the world-beating returns you’ll get from the best growth stocks.In addition, many utility companies are regulated monopolies, so you’re assured of a decent return, but government regulators won’t let the companies set super-high rates to inflate profits.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsInstead, utilities stocks are more of a defensive play. When the market gets volatile, or the economy begins to wobble, investors can usually find safety in the utilities sector.But even when the market is humming along, there are some reasons to appreciate utilities. These stocks typically provide a decent dividend. And there’s always something satisfying about investing in a company that pays you back.Here are several from which to choose.Oneok (OKE)Oneok company logo icon on websiteSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.comOneok (NYSE:OKE) is a natural gas supplier in Tulsa, Oklahoma. It connects the natural gas liquid supply in the Rocky Mountain, mid-continent and Permian regions with customers.Its assets, which stretch as far north as North Dakota and to the Gulf of Mexico, use a network of 40,000 miles of pipelines.Oneok is also working on a deal announced in May to acquire Magellan Midstream Partners (NYSE:MMP) in an $18.8 billion transaction.The calls for Magellan shareholders to receive $25 and 0.667 shares of OKE stock for each share of MMP stock. The deal should close later this year, giving Oneok another revenue stream and an opportunity to reduce redundancies.Investors are on board. Oneok stock is up 13% since the merger announcement. As a bonus, Oneok is one of the better dividend stocks on the New York Stock Exchange, providing a yield of nearly 6%.Story continuesOKE stock has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Energy Transfer (ET)A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for Energy Transfer (ET).Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comEnergy Transfer (NYSE:ET) is also in the business of transporting natural gas and propane.The Dallas-based company has nearly 125,000 miles of pipelines and energy infrastructure across 41 U.S. states.The company is a major player responsible for transporting about 30% of the nation’s oil and natural gas.It’s also in acquisition mode. Energy Transfer announced a deal to buy Crestwood Equity Partners (NYSE:CEQP), a master limited partnership with midstream assets in the Powder River Basin, Williston Basin and Delaware Basin, for $7.1 billion.Crestwood has 143 wells, including 73 connected in the last quarter, so its assets will be an excellent addition to ET.Energy Transfer had revenue of $18.32 billion in the second quarter and topped EPS estimates by posting 26 cents per share. But its revenue was down nearly 30% from a year ago as commodity prices fell.However, ET should bring home consistent, if not overwhelming, profits. And that’s what you want from utilities stocks. ET has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Williams Companies (WMB)The Williams Companies (WMB) logo displayed on a smartphone.Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.comAlso based in Tulsa, Williams Companies (NYSE:WMB) is involved in natural gas processing and transportation.Its footprint goes from coast to coast, with pipelines and operations connecting Washington state to New York state.It claims to handle 30% of natural gas production in the U.S. and has a network of 30,000 miles of pipeline covering 25 states.For Williams, stability and security are the name of the game. The company has paid a quarterly dividend for nearly 50 years, with a yield currently that’s better than 5%. It also has a streak of 26 consecutive quarters, beating analysts’ EBITDA estimates.WMB stock is up 5% this year and has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Enterprise Products Partners (EPD)A magnifying glass zooms in on the website of Enterprise Product Partners (EPD)Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comEnterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD) is a master limited partnership based in Houston. As a master limited partnership, ownership shares of EPD trade publicly like a stock.Investors realize increased dividend payouts and reduced taxes because of the MLP’s unique tax structure; the corporation pays taxes on earnings before sharing the windfall with investors.That makes MLPs a reliable choice for income investors and a safe investment. Enterprise Products Partners is diversified, operating in natural gas liquids, crude oil, natural gas and petrochemicals. It has more than 50,000 miles of pipeline.Earnings in the second quarter included $1.3 billion, or 57 cents per share. Enterprise increased its dividend by 5.3% to 50 cents per share, giving it a dividend yield of 7.6%.EPD earned a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Fluence Energy (FLNC)FLNC stock.

The Virginia company operates in the energy storage products and services space and provides cloud-based software for renewables and storage.AI powers the company’s Fluence IQ Platform, which provides software-as-a-service products that allow its customers to manage and optimize renewables and storage.This utilities stock is an interesting play on wind power and green energy, which provides a good alternative in your portfolio to companies focused on crude oil, petrochemicals and natural gas liquids.Goldman Sachs analyst Brian Lee said the recent pullback in solar and energy stocks is a good buying opportunity for FLNC stock, which he says has a 78% upside potential.Third-quarter earnings of $536 million were 13% better than analysts expected, although the company still lost 20 cents per share.FLNC stock has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Cheniere Energy (LNG)LNG stock: the Cheniere logo displayed on a phoneSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comCheniere Energy (NYSEAMERICAN:LNG) doesn’t trade on the main New York Stock Exchange, but don’t that dissuade you. Cheniere is one of the best utilities stocks you can buy.The company is the largest exporter of liquified natural gas in the U.S. and profits handsomely from its shipments to Europe. European customers badly needed natural gas because Russia cut off their supply in retaliation for the West’s sanctions against Moscow over its war with Ukraine.As long as that conflict continues and Russia remains on the outs with Europe, Cheniere Energy will have a willing trading partner.The company reported second-quarter revenue of $4.1 billion and net income of $1.4 billion. It also revised its full-year guidance from a range between $8.2 billion and $8.7 billion to a range of $8.3 billion and $8.8 billion.LNG stock is up 7.5% in 2023 and has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Antero Midstream (AM)Large tanker ship carrying natural gas at dusk in harborSource: shutterstock.com/Wojciech WrzesienAntero Midstream (NYSE:AM) is a midstream energy company with operations in the Appalachian Basin and the Marcellus and Utica shales. It’s one of the nation’s leading producers of natural gas liquids and natural gas, with enough inventory to last a few decades.Earnings for the second quarter included revenue of $258.29 million, just beating expectations of $257.13 million.The company also reported free cash flow after dividends of $31 million, a massive improvement from a year ago when it posted a $2 million deficit. The quarter was the fourth consecutive quarter of posting positive FCF after dividends.The stock has rebounded nicely since April and shows a 10% gain in 2023. And then, when you add that to the company’s generous 7.5% dividend yield, you have a stock that gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.On the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in LNG.

(NASDAQ:MU) with 82% ownership",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-investors-lot-riding-micron-110032656.html,1693738832,STORY,['MU'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Micron Technology's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions50% of the business is held by the top 22 shareholders Insiders have sold recently Every investor in Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 82% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.And as as result, institutional investors reaped the most rewards after the company's stock price gained 10% last week. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 26%.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Micron Technology, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Micron Technology ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Micron Technology?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Micron Technology. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Micron Technology's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Micron Technology. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.6% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.2% and 7.9%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 22 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Micron TechnologyWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Micron Technology, Inc. in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$188m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 17% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored.

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 70% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about McDonald's. See our latest analysis for McDonald's ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About McDonald's?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that McDonald's does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of McDonald's, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in McDonald's. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.4% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.0% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.7% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of McDonald'sThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of McDonald's Corporation in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$369m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 30% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over McDonald's. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand McDonald's better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with McDonald's .If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

They claim momentum-driven market movement is due to cognitive biases towards stocks that have performed well. This leads to more investors choosing those stocks, driving prices further upward and leaving low-return stocks in the dust. In essence, herd mentality powers the continuous increase or decrease in stock prices and makes it a self-fulfilling prophecy.Regardless, momentum investing has its place in investing and finance. The way you take advantage of such an opportunity is the important point. One of the primary ways of looking at momentum is a stock’s price performance, like year-to-date (YTD) or 52-week return.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSo, investors and traders looking for market-leading, high-performing momentum stocks might consider these three companies.Technip FMCPLC (FTI)Stocks to buy FTI Stock: The Technip logo on the side of a buildingSource: abu emran / Shutterstock.comTechnipFMC plc (NYSE:FTI) is a French-American, U.K.-domiciled oil and gas technology company operating in the energy industry.First, TechnipFMC offers fully-integrated projects, technologies, products, and services through both subsea and surface technologies. These segments provide the company’s design and manufacturing service to oil and natural gas production and exploration companies. Also, TechnipFMC designs and manufactures technologically advanced, high-pressure valves, pumps, and wellhead systems for exploration and stimulation in the oilfield industry.In addition, FTI has exhibited strong stock price performance with a 49.88% YTD increase and a 52-week performance bump of 114.69%. This is partially due to FTI increasing investments in offshore production with its reputation for being the top provider of subsea equipment and services.With its innovation and problem-solving reputation, the company is one of the go-to firms for clients looking for solutions to the industry’s most challenging engineering issues. In turn, FTI is winning contracts left and right. The company’s latest announcement was the Azule energy contract. Furthermore, FTI’s Subsea 2.0 platform has given it significant advantages in providing its customers with cost-saving subsea equipment and service solutions.Story continuesEmcor Group, Inc.

The Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) CEO has one of the best long-term investing track records and seen as a guru among many in the investing community. This stellar track record means many investors follow Buffett’s buying activity closely. As a steadfast buy-and-hold advocate, his recent moves raise interest. Though he’s trimmed holdings in sectors facing challenges, his remaining holdings reveal where the Oracle of Omaha wants to be positioned right now. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCertainly, independent research is essential. Relying on a single individual or source is unwise. Still, Buffett’s extensive experience counts. As far as his current portfolio holdings are concerned, here are three stocks I think are worth consideration as long-term picks, particularly if any material declines are seen moving forward.Apple (AAPL)Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple LayoffsSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock is a staple in many hedge funds due to its strong, consistent growth, high margins, and loyal customer base. Its closed-loop ecosystem further solidifies its position as a safe, long-term investment.Predicting Apple’s stock direction is challenging, yet investors have historically benefited, unlike short sellers. After earnings, AAPL’s decline results from overly high expectations. Despite claims, Apple’s iPhone sales only dropped 2.4%, considering inflation. Additionally, its $81.8 billion revenue was down just 1% and matched Wall Street’s estimate.In Q3 2023, Apple’s revenue dipped by 1.4%, and MacBook sales fell by 7%. However, services revenue surged by 8% to $21.2 billion sequentially. That’s the most important factor that concerns most long-term investors, as Apple continues to transition from a mainly hardware maker to a services company.Given the company continues to move in the right direction (with a solid balance sheet), Apple remains a top defensive option in the world of mega-cap tech worth buying now.Story continuesOccidental Petroleum (OXY)Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comBuffett continues to increase his investment in Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), owning almost 25% of the company’s stock, valued at around $12 billion. His optimism in Occidental’s future, including its transition to sustainable energy, warrants attention. This move could also yield short-term gains due to volatile oil markets affected by production disputes among major countries.It’s important to highlight that Occidental is among the energy players showing strong growth and profitability. Its diversification also shouldn’t be overlooked, with divisions like OxyChem contributing in a big way to the company’s record earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of $2.5 billion in 2022. If these diversified operational segments can continue to outperform, Occidental may become a different discussion among many investors. Buffett expresses optimism about Occidental’s future, praising its leadership’s strategic vision earlier this year. He reassures investors of the company’s potential and competent management during a May shareholder meeting. With OXY stock trading around the $61 level, and at a price-earnings ratio of around 10-times, this is a stock worth loading up on right now, in my view.Bank of America (BAC)bank of america stockSource: PL Gould / Shutterstock.comAmid uncertainties in the banking sector, Buffett has scaled back on bank stocks like Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) and U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), but he maintained his holdings in Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). Despite caution, he endorsed Bank of America at a shareholder meeting, highlighting his confidence in its management. His stake is valued at over $32 billion, around 13% of the company, reflecting his trust in the bank’s strength and market position.The company’s Q2 results showcased robust operations and a strong balance sheet. Bank of America gained $7.4 billion post-tax, representing 21% year-over-year earnings per share growth. Earnings excelled across segments, with the company’s consumer segment seeing its 18th positive new account quarter, adding 157,000 customers. Impressively, the lender’s Global Wealth division added 12,000 new relationships.Bank of America exceeded expectations in both earnings per share and revenue, driven by rising interest rates on loans. Despite slowing loan growth, its resilience and long-term potential are notable.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald has a LONG position in AAPL.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the defense sector, head directly to Goldman Sachs Defense Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks. The worldwide aerospace and defense industry expanded from $795.92 billion in 2022 to $855.62 billion in 2023, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.5%. The aerospace and defense market is projected to reach $1076.56 billion by 2027, indicating a CAGR of 5.9%. PwC's analysis indicated that in 2022, the aerospace and defense sector generated $741 billion in revenue, marking a modest 3% increase compared to the previous year. Simultaneously, the industry achieved $67 billion in operating profit, reflecting an 8% rise. However, the revenue growth was less than anticipated due to the industry's struggle to meet soaring market demand, hindered by production constraints stemming from supply chain and labor issues.Don't Miss: Goldman Sachs Growth Stocks: Top 12 StocksIn 2023, aerospace and defense organizations may encounter significant challenges primarily related to supply chain disruptions and talent shortages as well. Additionally, the aerospace and defense sector is sensitive to jet fuel prices, as they affect ticket prices and, subsequently, passenger travel demand. A sudden and sustained increase in jet fuel prices can disrupt traffic and introduce market volatility. To tackle these challenges, aircraft manufacturers are investing in the development of more fuel-efficient aircraft and engines to reduce operating costs. They are also exploring the creation of lower and zero-emission commercial aircraft for the future. According to Deloitte's outlook survey, 88% of senior executives surveyed expressed an optimistic outlook for the aerospace and defense industry in the coming year, ranging from somewhat positive to very positive. Several factors contribute to this optimism, including advancements in new technologies and sectors like advanced air mobility, evolving business models in areas such as space exploration, and the adoption of digital thread and smart factory practices. Aerospace and defense companies that prioritize innovation and are prepared to seize emerging opportunities are likely to outperform their peers in 2023, as per Deloitte. Story continuesAlso Read: Goldman Sachs AI Stocks: Top 10 Stock PicksDespite facing temporary operational challenges, FitchRatings maintains a positive outlook for the global Aerospace &amp; Defense sector in 2023. The industry is expected to maintain positive free cash flow generation and improved financial flexibility throughout the year, which should help mitigate short-term issues such as a decrease in aircraft deliveries. The robust demand for air travel and the aging aircraft fleets underline the necessity for new deliveries, exemplified by the combined backlog of Boeing and Airbus, which exceeds $700 billion or comprises more than 12,000 aircraft over multiple years. FitchRatings’ initial projection for 2023 commercial aircraft deliveries by Airbus and Boeing, which started the year at a 20% growth rate, has been adjusted downward to a low-teens growth rate. This revision is primarily driven by ongoing supply chain challenges, especially at Airbus. The new forecast anticipates more than 1,250 aircraft deliveries in 2023 compared to 1,140 in 2022, with Boeing contributing the majority of this growth.See Also: Goldman Sachs EV and Battery Stocks: Top 10 Stock PicksTo benefit from the growth potential in the defense industry, the Goldman Sachs portfolio holds stocks including Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX), and The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA). Our Methodology We used Goldman Sachs’ Q2 2023 portfolio and selected the 10 biggest positions in defense firms during the quarter for this list.

The Trade Desk is now valued at $38 billion and was $433 million when we first purchased shares over 6 years ago. The stock has appreciated almost 60% annually since our initial purchase. Pretty amazing. All four stocks have been solid performers this year, contributing nicely to the Fund’s returns.Since we run a small-cap fund but want to hold on to these great investments as they continue to compound and perform, we reduce the positions sizes over the holding period so that the overall market capitalization of the Fund is palatable. For each of the four stocks mentioned above, we presently own 11% or less of our peak positions. We take the proceeds from the trimming of these positions to fund new small-cap investments, with the hopes of somehow replicating these results.”8. Howmet Aerospace Inc.

Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance). C4ISR refers to digital systems that translate data picked up from different sensors-such as an incoming hypersonic missile or advancing troops-into a common format, and then escalate key information to the right people These differentiated technologies are especially relevant in a time of increased geopolitical tensions. Northrop also benefits from large barriers to entry in this stable industry, which should enable continued strong earnings and cash flow.” Click to continue reading and see Goldman Sachs Defense Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks.  Suggested articles:15 Highest Paying Countries for Architects10 Best Uninterrupted Power Supplies in 202325 Richest to Poorest Countries in Europe by GDP Per Capita (PPP) Disclosure: None.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Jim Cramer Recommended These 5 Stocks.It’s been almost a year since Jim Cramer made solid bets on stocks investors should consider buying on the weakness. When the Mad Money Host made the recommendations, oil prices had declined from $124 a barrel to about $82. The slide resulted in many commodity stocks coming under pressure and pulling back from the highs of the time.Following the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022, oil prices skyrocketed above the $100 a barrel level amid supply constraints and rising demand.  Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) were some of the beneficiaries of the high commodity prices that made it possible for them to resume dividends and buybacks as free cash flows increased significantly.“Oil’s down big, gasoline down big, and you can now buy all sorts of stocks that benefit from cheaper fuel, especially the travel and leisure plays,” Cramer said at the time.Stocks were under immense pressure in August last year as the US Federal Reserve embarked on an aggressive monetary policy tightening spree. At the time, the focus was to push inflation levels lower through the hiking of interest rates. Cramer criticized the Fed for the aggressive stance that he believed would drag down the markets.On the other hand, the concern was that higher interest rates would tip the economy into recession as it was trying to bounce back from the COVID-19-triggered slowdown. While it’s always recommended to sell industrial stocks during an economic slowdown, declining commodity prices such as oil, according to Cramer, provided an opportunity to purchase at highly discounted levels.Cramer has always insisted on capitalizing and building positions whenever the market gets challenging. Some of his long-term themes have always been in the tech industry and energy sector, which he believes will always outperform regardless of what policymakers do.Story continuesWhile the focus has always been tech plays, the Mad Money host has also made a name for himself by calling for greater diversification into other sectors.Jim Cramer Recommended These 10 StocksWhile it is essential to stick with the magnificent seven of - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), it’s become increasingly clear that other stocks have value. Getty Images Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:GETY)  is one of the stocks that the CNBC commentator touted as having a solid business with solid long term outlook after it went public again via a SPAC merger.While most people have always shunned SPAC stocks Cramer touted Getty Images for its core business that revolves around providing high quality visual images backed with a massive library of content“This is one of the rare SPACs story where the merger target is a quality business, its actually profitable,” Cramer said. The remarks came after the stock had registered a 149% gain in a single day. However, as days went on the stock struggled to maintain the upward momentum.Additionally, Cramer has always seen winners in the consumer discretionary sector as well as the healthcare sector going by his recommendations. He also maintains a close eye on the financial sector with eyes on JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) and Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC).While there has always been skepticism about Cramer’s recommendations, Long Cramer ETF, which goes long Cramer’s recommendations, is up by about 16% year to date. The outperformance attests to CNBC’s commentator's ability to get it right on winners in the market.Our MethodologyIn August 2022 Jim Cramer during his Mad Money show on CNBC made some stock recommendations. In this article we decided to take a look at how those stock recommendations played out. We calculated returns of each stock Cramer recommended back then and compared those returns with S&amp;P 500's returns during the same period.Jim Cramer Recommended These Stocks10. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F)Stock Gain since August: -21% S&amp;P 500 Gain since August: 9.4%Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) is one of the oldest automakers in the US that designs, develops, and delivers a range of Ford trucks, commercial cars, and vans. The company remains under pressure as it continues to face headwinds in its bid to launch electric vehicles.While Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) has underperformed when compared to Tesla, the CNBC commentator believes there is significant   value to unlock in the company.“I think the market ingenuity an innovation here at Ford are undervalued. Undervalued vs Tesla and possibly against everything else in the market,” Cramer said.The automaker has already moved the launch of its all-electric Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) Explorer for the European market to the summer of 2024 from early in the year. The company has already reiterated that its EV ramp-up may take longer than anticipated.As other companies focus on electric vehicles, Ford may bring to market more hybrid options driven by the success of its current gasoline-electric options.The focus on pure electric cars might explain why the stock is down by about 21% over the past 12 months compared to a 9.4% gain for the S&amp;P 500.9. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Stock Gain since August: -20% S&amp;P 500 Gain since August: 9.4%The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is an entertainment company that engages in film and episodic television content production and distribution. In addition to content production, it also runs some of the biggest theme parks in the world. It has turned out to be one of Cramer’s big mistakes as the stock has struggled over the past one year.The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) has had to contend with revenue struggles everywhere apart from international parks over the past 12 months. In the most recent quarter, the company lost about 12 million streaming subscribers as it also took a hit on restructuring costs and missed revenue projections.Since Cramer recommended the stock, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is down by about 20% underperforming the S&amp;P 500 by wide margins.8. Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM)Stock Gain since August: -4.8% S&amp;P 500 Gain since August: 9.4%Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) is a company that engages in the provision of environmental solutions to residential, commercial, and industrial customers. Its core business revolves around collecting and transporting waste and recyclable materials.The recommendation came at a time when Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) had signed big contracts and rewarded investors with a big dividend boost. While the stock has been in consolidation in recent months, it is down by 4.8% from August of last year, underperforming the S&amp;P 500, which is up by about 9.4%.7. Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) Stock Gain since August: -1% S&amp;P 500 Gain since August: 9.4%Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) is a diversified technology and manufacturing company. It operates in the Aerospace segment, offering auxiliary power units and propulsion engines, among other things. The Honeywell Building technologies provide software applications for radar and surveillance systems.Cramer recommended Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) as one of the stocks well poised to benefit from declining commodities prices, such as oil, that was expected to fuel activity in the aviation industry. Additionally, he remained confident about the stock following great earning results.Nevertheless, Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) has been extremely volatile, rallying by more than 28% from October lows only to give back a good chunk of the gains. It is currently down by about 1% from when Cramer recommended it.6. Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE:LNG)Stock Gain since August: 10.8%   S&amp;P 500 Gain since August: 9.4%Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE:LNG) is an infrastructure company that specializes in liquefied natural gas-related business. The company owns and operates one of the largest pipelines out of Texas. When Cramer recommended the stock in August of last year, it was up by more than 59% on benefiting from rising commodity prices.Cramer insisting that the stock was pretty darn cheap was spot on as the stock did rally 15% afterward. Nevertheless, as the year came to a close, Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE:LNG) did come under pressure giving back a significant chunk of the gains.Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE:LNG) has outperformed the S&amp;P 500, which is up 9.4% over the past 12 months. Cheniere is up by about 10.8% over the past 12 months.Click to continue reading and see Jim Cramer Recommended These 5 Stocks.Suggested articles:Jim Chanos’ 10 Short Positions in 2023Goldman Sachs Tech Stocks: Top 12 Stock Picks10 Most Promising Penny Stocks According to AnalystsDisclosure: None. Jim Cramer Recommended These 10 Stocks is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. Check out our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group How Fast Is UnitedHealth Group Growing?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. UnitedHealth Group managed to grow EPS by 8.1% per year, over three years. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Our analysis has highlighted that UnitedHealth Group's revenue from operations did not account for all of their revenue in the previous 12 months, so our analysis of its margins might not accurately reflect the underlying business. EBIT margins for UnitedHealth Group remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 14% to US$349b. That's a real positive.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-historyThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for UnitedHealth Group's future EPS 100% free.Are UnitedHealth Group Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$441b company like UnitedHealth Group. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$1.4b. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.3% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Is UnitedHealth Group Worth Keeping An Eye On?One important encouraging feature of UnitedHealth Group is that it is growing profits. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. The combination definitely favoured by investors so consider keeping the company on a watchlist. It is worth noting though that we have found 1 warning sign for UnitedHealth Group that you need to take into consideration.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want. But if you prefer to focus on stocks that have demonstrated insider buying, here is a list of companies with insider buying in the last three months.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

71,63fbae04-0932-3a9e-9876-32555b45c0e3,EL,2023-09-03,Should We Be Delighted With The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.'s (NYSE:EL) ROE Of 16%?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/delighted-est-e-lauder-companies-110020343.html,1693738820,STORY,['EL'],"[While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Estée Lauder Companies is:16% = US$1.0b ÷ US$6.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.16.Does Estée Lauder Companies Have A Good Return On Equity?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Estée Lauder Companies has a higher ROE than the average (13%) in the Personal Products industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk . To know the 4 risks we have identified for Estée Lauder Companies visit our risks dashboard for free.How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesEstée Lauder Companies' Debt And Its 16% ROEEstée Lauder Companies does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.28. There's no doubt its ROE is decent, but the very high debt the company carries is not too exciting to see. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.ConclusionReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.Of course Estée Lauder Companies may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have high ROE and low debt.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

Meanwhile, the analysts at Goldman Sachs have been busy curating their ‘top picks’ for the coming year.Goldman Sachs’ Top Picks give investors a useful pointer toward solid stock choices, but they aren’t the only one. Another comes from the Smart Score, an AI-driven, algorithm-based data collection and collation tool that does the leg-work of gathering, sorting, and analyzing the wealth of raw information generated in the markets. Each stock is given a score, a simple single-digit score showing how the stock measures up against a composite of 8 factors known to predict future gains. A ‘Perfect 10’ from the Smart Score indicates a stock that is worth a closer look.When these ‘Perfect 10′ Smart Score stocks align with Goldman Sachs’ Top Picks, it creates a compelling signal that the average investor can’t afford to overlook.With that in mind, let’s take a look at a few of those tickers – ones that have earned a spot on Goldman Sachs’ Top Picks list and nailed a ‘Perfect 10’ on the Smart Score.Philip Morris International (PM)We’ll start with a classic ‘sin stock,’ the tobacco company Philip Morris International. Philip Morris has long been a leader in its industry, and has a headline asset – the full rights to produce and market the Marlboro brand, one of the world’s largest cigarette brands, in the international markets. The company also owns the Next, Chesterfield, L&amp;M, and the eponymous Philip Morris brands. PM is positioned in more than 175 markets around the world, and boasts of holding first- or second-place market shares in most of them.The tobacco industry was valued at over $867 billion last year, and despite social pressures against it, it is expected to expand to $1.05 trillion by the end of this decade – so Philip Morris’s market-leading positions are no small potatoes. The company is working hard to maintain its position, and adapt to the social trends, through moves toward new products. PM has, over the past several years, put more than $10.5 billion into developing and expanding smokeless tobacco products. This is an expanding market for Philip Morris, which saw smokeless non-nicotine products make up 29.1% of its total revenue in 2021, and 32.1% in 2022.Story continuesThe company’s efforts – both in its smokeless and ‘traditional’ product lines – have been paying off. Philip Morris realized net revenues of $9 billion in 2Q23, up 14.5% year-over-year and beating the forecast by $259.5 million. At the bottom line, PM reported an adjusted diluted EPS of $1.60, showing a near-17% y/y gain and coming in 12 cents ahead of the forecasts.Keeping all of that in mind, Goldman has taken a bullish view of Philip Morris. the firm’s consumer product analyst Bonnie Herzog sees the company’s smokeless and traditional cigarette product lines as powerful assets, and writes of the stock, “We see a very compelling set-up for the stock this year given the robust compounding effect of iQOS, PM’s hugely cash-generative combustible cig portfolio and its promising investments beyond nicotine… We believe that PM’s earnings visibility and momentum will hold strong throughout the year, especially given upside potential from a broader &amp; more aggressive global rollout of ILUMA, an accelerated RRP (reduced risk product) innovation pipeline, and increased penetration of iQOS/accelerated user acquisition in lower-income markets driven by further price segmentation… PM remains one of our top stock picks.”Herzog goes on to give the shares a Buy rating with a $122 price target to imply a 27.5% upside in the coming months. (To watch Herzog’s track record, click here)Philip Morris stock holds a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street’s analysts, and it is unanimous, based on 7 recent positive ratings. The shares are trading for $95.68 and their $116.71 average price target suggests a one-year upside potential of 22%. (See PM stock forecast)PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP)Next up is another familiar name in consumer products, PepsiCo, the famous cola challenger to Coke. In addition to its line of Pepsi beverages, the company’s brands, more than 500 in all, include Doritos, Gatorade, SodaStream, and Cheetos, to name just a few.PepsiCo has a global footprint, with strong market positions in Latin America, Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, and North Africa and the Middle East. The company has a long and successful record of adjusting product lines to match local preferences – just ask Canadians about their Lay’s dill pickle flavored potato chips – and from its New York State headquarters, the company oversees a food and beverage empire that generated over $86 billion in total revenues last year.More recently, PepsiCo beat the quarterly forecasts in its 2Q23 report. The company’s revenue total, at $22.3 billion, was up almost 10.4% y/y and was $590 million better than had been anticipated. PepsiCo’s earnings, a non-GAAP core EPS of $2.09, was 13 cents better than the estimates.Even better, looking ahead, for the second time this year, the company raised both its top-and bottom-line guide for FY2023, anticipating 10% revenue growth (vs. 7% beforehand) and 12% core constant currency EPS growth (compared to the previous 9%).It’s a solid foundation for a consumer staple stalwart, and PepsiCo’s generally strong position is what attracts Goldman’s Herzog. The consumer goods expert writes of this company, “We continue to believe PEP is one of the best-positioned companies across the global food &amp; bev landscape to deliver outsized growth over the next decade based on our in-depth global category growth analysis given their advantaged exposure to snacking and to developing &amp; emerging markets despite what is likely more modest growth (vs the prior decade) across the industry as inflation-led pricing continues to fade. As a result, we believe PEP is poised to drive sustainable long-term topline growth at the high end, possibly exceeding the company’s long-term algo – which we think should be viewed favorably by investors. PEP remains one of our top stock picks.”In line with her sanguine view of PEP, Herzog gives the shares a Buy rating with a $212 price target that indicates potential for a 21% gain on the one-year time frame.The 13 recent analyst reviews on PEP shares break down 9 to 4 in favor of Buys over Holds, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The stock has an average price target of $204.50, implying a 17% upside potential from the share price of $175.32. (See PepsiCo stock forecast)Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD)Wrapping up, we’ll look at Warner Bros. Discovery, a major name in the world’s entertainment industry. This company is the modern embodiment of the storied Warner Bros. company, and counts the brand’s library of famous movies among its assets. WBD entered its current incarnation in April of 2022, when TimeWarner merged with Discovery, Inc. The company brought in $33.8 billion in revenues last year, and boasts a market cap over $28 billion.All of this is built on a sound platform of entertainment assets. In addition to the legacy Warner Bros. cartoons and movies, WBD can claim ownership of DC Studios; DC Entertainment, the publisher DC Comics; HBO and CNN; and the cable channels brought to the merger by the Discovery Channel. The company’s offerings include something for nearly every viewer, from sports and news to food and cooking shows to superhero movies and gaming. The entertainment portfolio is wide-ranging and diverse, and gives WBD a leadership position as a global media distributor.Looking at results, we find that Warner Bros. Discovery had 2Q23 revenues of $10.36 billion. While this was up 5.4% y/y, it missed expectations by some $80 million. The company’s bottom line was reported as a GAAP EPS loss of 51 cents per share. This was a notable improvement from the $1.50 EPS loss registered in the prior-year quarter, but was still 10 cents deeper than had been forecast. Positively, free cash flow (FCF) was expected to come in under $1 billion, but came in some distance above that, at $1.7 billion.That strong metric partly informs Goldman analyst Brett Feldman’s positive thesis, who, despite the earnings miss in Q2, sees plenty to like here. Feldman writes, “We see WBD’s solid 2Q23 report as supporting our outlook for material EBITDA growth, strong FCF generation, and rapid delevering during the remainder of 2023 and through 2024, driven by synergies that are trending ahead of plan and improved go-to-market execution. As such, WBD remains our top pick in Media.”For Feldman, this adds up to a Buy rating on the stock, and his $20 price target points toward an upside potential of 73% in the next 12 months. (To watch Feldman’s track record, click here)Overall, this stock has picked up 10 recent analyst reviews, including 7 Buys and 3 Holds, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The $11.56 current trading price and $20.88 average price target combine to predict a potential one-year gain of 80.5%.

(NASDAQ:PEP) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for PepsiCo The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$9.88bUS$10.5bUS$11.2bUS$11.7bUS$12.1bUS$12.4bUS$12.8bUS$13.1bUS$13.4bUS$13.7bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 3.30%Est @ 2.96%Est @ 2.71%Est @ 2.55%Est @ 2.43%Est @ 2.34% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.2% US$9.3kUS$9.3kUS$9.4kUS$9.2kUS$9.0kUS$8.7kUS$8.4kUS$8.1kUS$7.8kUS$7.6k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$87bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$14b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.2%– 2.2%) = US$350bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$350b÷ ( 1 + 6.2%)10= US$193bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$280b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$175, the company appears about fair value at a 14% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at PepsiCo as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for PepsiCoStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Beverage market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatDividends are not covered by cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.
