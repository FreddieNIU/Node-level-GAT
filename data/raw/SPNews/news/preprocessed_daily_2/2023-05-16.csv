The positions include some of the same mid-sized institutions that came under intense investor pressure following the March failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.Scion's new holdings include $7.6 million in shares of New York Community Bank (NYCB), which purchased loans and assumed deposits from Signature, as well as $4.4 million in Western Alliance (WAL), $2.4 million in PacWest (PACW) and $2 million in San Francisco lender First Republic.He also purchased $2 million of Huntington Bank (HBAN), a regional lender in Columbus, Ohio.Not all of his buys were regionals. Scion also picked up $4.6 million in industry giant Wells Fargo (WFC).One of the banks he bet on now has a new owner. Regulators seized First Republic on May 1, wiping out its shareholders, and sold the bulk of its operations to JPMorgan Chase (JPM).Two others, Western Alliance and PacWest, have been struggling to assure investors that the worst of the regional banking crisis is behind them.But Scion's bank stocks rose Monday on a new wave of optimism about their prospects. Western Alliance and PacWest closed the trading day up 12% and 17%. Year to date, those banks have fallen 48% and 76%, respectively.Michael Burry at a 2015 screening for ""The Big Short."" (Photo by Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images) (Astrid Stawiarz via Getty Images)Burry gained fame for his moves during the 2008 crisis, a severe downturn that began with a US housing bust. Burry predicted a collapse in residential real estate prices as early as 2007 and then shorted a number of subprime deals through the use of credit default swaps.He became a central figure in Michael Lewis’s 2010 book “The Big Short,” and Christian Bale later portrayed Burry in a 2015 film adaptation of the Lewis book.Scion, his firm, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the investments.Story continuesNot all large investors piled into banks during the chaos of the first quarter.The family office of billionaire George Soros reduced its position in Memphis-based regional lender First Horizon (FHN) by 38% and sold off all its Citigroup (C) holdings while closing a $1.7 million short position on crypto-friendly bank Silvergate Capital, which said in March that it would wind itself down voluntarily.The Soros Fund did take smaller call options on Charles Schwab (SCHW) and UBS Group AG (UBS).Billionaire investor George Soros speaking in 2019.

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.The Charles Schwab Corporation currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.79, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 14 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.79 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 14 recommendations that derive the current ABR, eight are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 57.1% and 14.3% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for SCHWBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for SCHWCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for The Charles Schwab Corporation here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying The Charles Schwab Corporation, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is SCHW a Good Investment?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for The Charles Schwab Corporation, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 11.1% over the past month to $3.38.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for The Charles Schwab Corporation. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for The Charles Schwab Corporation with a grain of salt.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

""Given that there is a solid deadline approaching for the debt ceiling, that is more likely what investors are waking up to this week and anticipating that there will be a resolution,"" said Peter Andersen, founder of Andersen Capital Management.""And as Washington leaks out increments with rolling disclosure about how the discussions are proceeding ... that probably is bolstering confidence in investors.""At 8:42 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 51 points, or 0.15%, S&amp;P 500 e-minis were up 7.5 points, or 0.18%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 20.75 points, or 0.15%.Investors will also be tracking speeches by a host of Federal Reserve officials this week, including Chair Jerome Powell on Friday, for clues on potential rate cuts this year.Atlanta Fed PresidentRaphael Bostic said on Monday he does not expect any interest-rate cuts this year as he does not see inflation going down as fast as market participants believe.Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari and Fed Board Governor Lisa Cook are among other Fed officials set to speak later in the day.Story continuesFutures also trimmed some gains after The New York Federal Reserve's ""Empire State"" index on current business conditions dropped to a reading of 31.8 in May, against expectations of a 3.75 decline.Retail sales, housing data and a reading on weekly jobless claims will also be watched through the week, after data on Friday showed that consumer sentiment slumped to a six-month low in May, and U.S. long-term inflation expectations jumped to the highest since 2011.Among stocks, Oneok Inc fell 5.6% in premarket trading as it agreed on Sunday to buy U.S. pipeline operator Magellan Midstream Partners in a cash-and-stock deal valued at about $18.8 billion including debt. Shares of Magellan rose 15.3%.Shares of Google-parent Alphabet Inc fell 1% on a report that Loop Capital downgraded its stock to ""hold"" from ""buy"", while shares of Meta Platforms Inc rose 1.1% after the brokerage upgraded to ""buy"" from ""hold"".Charles Schwab Corp added 2.2% after Raymond James upgraded the financial services co to ""outperform' from ""market perform"" on its ability to attract new accounts.

Further, growing demand for WiFi hotspots, as the number of wirelessly connected devices increases in households, is enhancing industry prospects. Cisco forecasts that number of hotspots worldwide will reach 600 million in 2023.Innovation is Opening up Business Avenues: The rapid proliferation of IoT, wearables, drones, VR/AR devices, autonomous cars, and ADAS is expected to drive the demand for RF semiconductor products beyond smartphone devices, favoring industry prospects. Notably, RF Semiconductors are setting the pace for technology modernization by consequently digitizing aspects like connectivity, healthcare, transport and defense.The diversified utilization of RF Semiconductor products bodes well for the industry players. Moreover, the evolution of semiconductor manufacturing processes from 10 nanometers (nm) to 7 nm, and even 5 nm and 3 nm technology, is anticipated to bolster the industry prospects.The rollout of bands and band combinations has led to considerable design challenges for OEM smartphone manufacturers. Industry participants are looking to address these challenges with a robust range of antenna-plexer portfolios utilizing the BAW technology.Growing Adoption of Electric Vehicles Aids Prospect: Industry players are gaining from the increasing inclusion of their products in electric vehicles (EVs). The market for EVs is expected to expand fourfold by 2027.Supply-Chain and Higher Commodity Costs to Hinder Prospects: The industry players are reeling under the impacts of supply-chain constraints, as well as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.

SPB came out with second-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while sales missed the same. Both metrics fell year over year. Results were hurt by lower first-half demand and inventory reduction.However, shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 9.3% in the past three months against the industry's decline of 9.1%.Q2 HighlightsThe company reported an adjusted loss of 14 cents per share against earnings of 41 cents in the year-ago period due to lower adjusted EBITDA. The reported loss was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 23 cents and our estimate of a loss of 11 cents. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Spectrum Brands' net sales fell 9.7% year over year to $729.2 million and lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $767 million and our estimate of $780.6 million. Acquisition-related gains of $22.1 million aided the top line, while adverse foreign currency impacts of $19.4 million remained a drag. Organic net sales declined 10.1%. The downside was mainly due to retailer inventory management strategies and slower category POS, offset by positive pricing.The gross profit decreased 16.1% year over year to $214.5 million, while the gross margin contracted 220 basis points (bps) year over year to 29.4% due to a decline in sales volume, unfavorable mix and sales of higher cost inventory accumulated in the prior year, which more than offset pricing actions.SG&amp;A expenses fell 14.2% to $219.3 million. As a percentage of sales, SG&amp;A expenses contracted 150 bps to 30.1%.The company’s operating loss was $77 million compared with the prior-year quarter’s loss of $8.1 million due to an intangible asset impairment of $67 million, offset by lower distribution costs, fixed-cost reduction efforts, and reduced project spend on restructuring, optimization and strategic transaction initiatives.Adjusted EBITDA plunged 35.4% to $51 million in the fiscal second quarter. The adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 280 bps to 7% due to reduced volume and currency headwinds.Story continuesSegmental PerformanceSales in the Home &amp; Personal Care segment decreased 11.7% to $279.2 million due to a category decline from lower demand, particularly in kitchen appliances, and continued retailer inventory management in North America. Excluding the $22.1-million gain from the acquisition and the $11.8-million impact of adverse currency rates, organic net sales for the segment fell 14.9%.The segment's adjusted EBITDA came in at a loss of $1.9 million against earnings of $10.6 million. Meanwhile, adjusted EBITDA margins contracted 410 bps year over year to 0.7% due to lower volume, the sales of higher cost inventory accumulated in the prior year and unfavorable foreign currency in EMEA, partly offset by cost savings and additional actions undertaken during the quarter.The Global Pet Care segment's sales inched down 0.5% year over year to $296.7 million, driven by strong growth in companion animals stemming from strength in chews in North America, and Dog and Cat food in EMEA, partly offset by declines in other hard goods and aquatic environments. Excluding the $7.6-million impact of unfavorable foreign currency, organic sales rose 3.1%.The segment's adjusted EBITDA grew 5.7% to $46.3, while the adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 180 bps year over year to 15.6%, driven by lower distribution costs, positive pricing, savings from the prior year’s cost-reduction initiatives and additional cost-reduction actions.The Home &amp; Garden segment's sales declined 22% to $153.3 million due to a reduction in retailer inventory and adverse weather conditions. Also, drab cleaning products sales in the spring season led to a POS decline in the relevant categories. The segment's adjusted EBITDA of $15.1 million decreased 60% from $37.7 million in the prior-year quarter due to a sales decline, which was offset by gains from fixed-cost restructuring and operational cost reductions initiated in the second half of last year.Other FinancialsAs of Apr 2, 2023, the company’s cash balance was $328 million, with an outstanding debt of $3,222 million. It has $362 million available on its $1.1-billion cash flow revolver.

The Oracle of Omaha sold a large portion of Berkshire’s holdings in US banks between 2020 and 2022, some just months before the banking system upheaval that began in mid March.The 92-year-old investor has over the decades played the role of rescuer to a number of institutions, including in the 2008 financial crisis. He has yet to emerge as a white knight for any banks in trouble during this current crisis, at least in any way that has thus far been made public.Buffett made it clear at Berkshire's annual shareholders meeting earlier this month that he is still ""cautious"" about holding many bank stocks. One exception he cited was Bank of America, which remains one of Berkshire’s largest holdings.Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffett at a 2019 shareholders meeting. REUTERS/Scott Morgan (Scott Morgan / Reuters)In the first quarter, according to filings, Berkshire maintained its Bank of America holdings. The stake lost $4 billion in value through the quarter.""I like Bank of America and I like the management,"" Buffett said at the shareholder gathering in Omaha, Nebraska.Buffett has a long history with Bank of America. He injected $5 billion into the Charlotte, N.C.-based bank in 2011. At the time Brian Moynihan was still a relatively new chief executive and the lender's shares were under severe pressure due to losses from subprime loans.Buffett did invest more deeply into several other financial stocks in the quarter. Berkshire added $954 million of Capital One (COF) and raised its holding in Ally Financial (ALLY) by $10.6 million. The conglomerate also sold $1.1 million of Jefferies Financial Group (JEF) and didn't touch its stake in Citigroup (C).Story continuesUS Bancorp, BNY Mellon and Jefferies were down in early after hours trading while Bank of America, Citi, Capital One and Ally were up.Berkshire Hathaway was far from the only high profile investment manager selling bank shares last quarter.Bridgewater Associates, the world's biggest hedge fund, sold about $180 million in bank stocks.That included more than 80% of its holdings in Bank of New York Mellon and US Bancorp. Bridgewater also zeroed out positions in 15 other US lenders, including Bank of America (BAC), Western Alliance, Zions (ZION), PacWest (PACW) and New York Community Bank (NYCB).Correction (5/16): an earlier version of the article said Berkshire Hathaway raised its Bank of America holdings in the first quarter.

This means that a larger number of shares were sold by insiders in relation to shares purchased.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Cintas The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At CintasIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive VP &amp; Chief Administrative Officer, Michael Thompson, sold US$6.6m worth of shares at a price of US$445 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$469. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. It is worth noting that this sale was only 18% of Michael Thompson's holding. The only individual insider seller over the last year was Michael Thompson.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year.

While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Does Cintas Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Cintas insiders own about US$7.1b worth of shares (which is 15% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Cintas Insiders?The fact that there have been no Cintas insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Cintas, we can't say the same about the selling of shares.

Joining us now to do a deep dive is Christine Short, Wall Street Horizon Vice President of Research, and Oliver Chen, TD Cowen Senior Research Analyst.So Christine, let's get right to you. What are you anticipating most from retail earnings in the week ahead?CHRISTINE SHORT: Yeah, well, it depends who we're talking about. It's going to be a mixed bag, as it often is. But there's four key areas we're looking at for this week. And that's the home improvement retailers, the discount, off-price, and fast fashion e-commerce. Of course, as you know, for home improvement, that was sort of a darling coming out of the pandemic, with Home Depot and Lowe's, everyone kind of rushing out and making large ticket purchases of appliances and doing DIY projects in their houses.And this is sort of softened, right? We're not as home as much. And inflation and higher interest rates have crept in. So folks aren't as willing to take on those large projects as they once were. And you can see that in analysts' estimates. Home Depot and Lowe's expected to be down year over year on both profits and revenues.Next, I think discounters and off-price are two areas that are going to be winners this week. So on the discount front, you've got Walmart and Target. If I had to pick a winner, Walmart's really been outpacing Target. They're expected to be up year over year on both top and bottom line. Target expected to see profits fall about 19%. Why? Well, Walmart has a larger share of the grocery space. We know everyone's really been focused on staples. If you get someone in for their groceries, perhaps they look around, and they shop more.Story continuesAlso e-commerce, Walmart's really just hit it out of the Park when it comes to e-commerce post-COVID. And they're also not only retaining their regular customer base. But they're getting higher-income customers that are trading down, same with off-price. We have Ross Stores and TJX Companies out this week. The space has been really hot, right? Because those that are not maybe typically shopping there are starting to trade down. They're looking for bargains. They're looking for value. And both of those names are expected to do well. We've seen even the department stores like Nordstrom and Macy's really focus on their off-price segments.And then just lastly, fast fashion. We're looking at Boohoo. That is a British e-commerce retailer loved by Gen-Z and TikTokers. They own brands like Pretty Little Things and Nasty Gal. They haven't been doing so well. We have an indicator that shows they pushed their earnings date back actually two weeks later than usual. Academic research shows when you push your earnings date back too far, it's usually positively correlated and highly correlated with bad news coming on the call.That wouldn't be surprising. They already said in their first half call that sales would likely be down 10% this year. And we saw what ASOS reported last week. ASOS is cutting costs and struggling with profit margins as well.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, so at least some worrisome trends. Oliver, let's drill down into Walmart. It's one of the big reports that we will be watching this week. I know you cover that name. What are you expecting just in terms to see some of the trends? Because consumers have been trading down and have been going to Walmart.OLIVER CHEN: Yeah, Sean, it's great to be here. The big story here is value. Save money, live better, what Walmart does really well is everyday low prices. Also about 60% of the assortment is food and essentials. That's been a category that's been working due to both inflation and as well as Walmart offering exceptional value.Walmart's also tech-enabled. So it's save money and people, but it's about technology too. And Walmart+, their membership program, has 24 million members based on our estimates. That's getting more high-income shoppers. And what's happening is this new generation of omni, meaning curbside pickup, buy online, pickup in-store, and really flexing up on convenience. Higher household income customers as well as value-seeking consumers like Walmart.Conversely at Target, Target has more discretionary goods, think home, think apparel, think Target. A smaller percentage of Target is food. So we're watching these trends. Discretionary is very difficult to be in right now, given the inflation trends and given the pressure in the economy.However, on the positive side, the consumer's mixed. There's over $900 billion of savings on the sidelines and unemployment low at 3.4%. So there are crosscurrents with the consumer. The bottom line is all consumers are looking for value. And that's a key theme that we'll see.We also like very premium luxury goods. Our top idea here has been LVMH.DIANA KING HALL: All right, Christine, I want to bring you back into the conversation here and talk about the macro perspective. We've got retail sales out tomorrow. We talked about some key names in focus this week, of course, Walmart, Home Depot, et cetera. What are you looking to come out tomorrow? And is there anything that would surprise you?CHRISTINE SHORT: Yeah, look, right now, the expectation is that retail sales are going to rebound from March. We're looking at the April reading. By how much we don't know. And ex-autos and gas and building materials, it's actually expected to be only about maybe a 0.3% increase. We'll see. I mean, a lot of the consumer data that we've seen recently isn't looking so good.If you look back on Friday, University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment prelims came out and dropped 6 points. The reading dropped 6 points, showing that consumer confidence is waning. And you just mentioned the debt crisis. That is something that consumers are acutely aware of.Not only have we been talking heavily about a potential recession, whether that be mild or moderate, happening towards the back half of the year, that's something investors-- or consumers have been concerned about. But now they're worried, what if we default on national debt for the first time in history? What does that do to jobs? What does that do to retirement benefits?So they're acutely aware that that could be catastrophic. I think some other numbers we're looking at are Bank of America's credit card spending was at its lowest level in two years. We had New York Fed out with consumer debt at the highest level ever today. And that wasn't for mortgages. Mortgage originations were the lowest they've been since 2014.Oliver talks about jobs. Yep, jobs numbers have been one of the steady things that has kept consumers resilient in the face of inflation and increasing interest rates. And we've been talking about that for the last year. But I think you're starting to see that waver a little, especially with initial claims out last week. Ending the week of May 6, initial claims were at their highest level in a couple of years. And so you're starting to see the jobs picture break down a little bit.And when you look at some of these sentiment surveys, you can tell investors-- sorry, consumers are starting to think about that. And I think they're trading down. And you're going to see that in some of the retail results this week.SEANA SMITH: Oliver, you mentioned luxury retail--OLIVER CHEN: Yeah, to build on Christine--SEANA SMITH: Oh, go ahead Oliver.OLIVER CHEN: Oh, yeah, consumers are becoming more choiceful. So what we're seeing is volatile traffic trends and consumers pausing and also delaying. On the other hand, parts of luxury goods remain very robust as the whole world goes out again and travels. Think about handbags. Think about beauty and wellness and helping the new wealth as very good key themes to pay attention to for the long term.Also what's really important for investors is which stocks have pricing leverage. And there are stocks like Louis Vuitton and Dior that are able to price despite this difficult mixed environment.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, Oliver, I was curious just about LVMH, why that is a top pick within your coverage list, given the fact that we really have seen strength across the board, it seems like, when it comes to a number of these luxury names.OLIVER CHEN: Yeah, what we're excited about is the gradual reopening of China. That's a key positive. The Louis Vuitton flagship brand has done a great job being very culturally relevant with Virgil Abloh and Pharrell Williams. Also they've been able to achieve very nice price increases.Lots of people around the world love Sephora too. It's a phenomenal beauty concept. It's about 20% of the business. And Louis Vuitton is the largest market cap company in Europe. So what that really means quite simply is they have $7 to $8 billion of advertising and promotional dollars to spend. And big can get bigger in the context of that because what happens is--I teach a class at Columbia University called Magic and Logic. Part of luxury innovation is magic. And that has to do with spending money towards making these highly emotional flagship experiences too. So these are very sustainable brands for the next hundreds of years. And that's why LVMH has been an attractive idea for us.We also like Costco, keep in mind, as we think about the bow tie approach and going high and going low and being selective.DIANA KING HALL: Well, Oliver, it's so interesting that you mention that because that's one of the things I thought about, especially because, Christine, you mentioned the possible headwind of a potential recession and what that can do to the consumer.Christine, let's ask you really quickly-- and then Oliver, if you want to chime in-- I think we know your answer, Oliver. But who are the winners in this environment with the pressures facing the consumer?CHRISTINE SHORT: Well, like I said, certain discounters, Walmart, and then I would say the off-price retailers or those that have an off-price segment. I'd also say leisure is still strong. Oliver kind of mentioned that. We've seen good numbers from restaurants. We've seen good numbers from the airlines, maybe not necessarily for Q1. Some of the international carriers reported numbers that missed or weren't as good as expected. But if you look at bookings going out into the summer peak travel season, bookings were-- a lot of them showing record amounts of bookings.And we've seen that with even some of the hotels, Hilton, Marriott, maybe not necessarily Airbnb. They came in lower than expected when they reported for Q1. But some of the hotel chains really still doing well. We see a consumer that is transitioning more of their discretionary income over to experiences, maybe away from things in certain scenarios. And I think that's still the impact you're seeing from the pandemic.People don't want to miss out anymore. So they're willing to spend on certain things.DIANA KING HALL: Oliver?OLIVER CHEN: Yeah, it's all about bricks and clicks and even portals and AI as we think ahead. Walmart's very well-positioned. When you think about artificial intelligence, one of the key aspects of this is the training models, which very simply means Walmart has a lot of data which they can really harness for the membership program. That's something we're excited about going forward.Thinking about Costco, it's back to basics. Everybody loves Costco. And there's lots of things you find there that you never knew you wanted in that treasure hunt. It also offers exceptional value. And then LVMH is the top idea. As I mentioned, the scale, the cultural relevance, the real dominance in luxury goods is very impressive.So the barbell approach is the theme. Go high, go low, think about value. And we're watching the US consumer, which continues to be fairly volatile. But we are in a consumer discretionary recession. So we've seen negative trends in discretionary. The bright spots are beauty, health, and wellness. I think health will be a great structural trend to follow everywhere from physical to mental to being beautiful.And then TikTok-ification, that's another thematic thing we're paying a lot of attention to. I think Gen-Zers will think very hard about sustainability as well as short-form video for the long term. So lots of excitement in retail too.SEANA SMITH: Lots of excitement, that is sure. And again, Gen-Z trends so important here when we talk about the future within retail. All right, Oliver Chen, Christine Short, thanks so much.]"

Walgreens and Walmart (WMT) also announced similar efforts. Then, last year, the FDA issued a new mandate for clinical trials to focus on diversity, which included pharmacies as potential partner sites — which is why CVS's move to pull out of the space is surprising.CVS confirmed to Yahoo Finance in a statement Monday that it would be closing this line of business by 2024. ""We continually evaluate our portfolio of assets to ensure they are aligned with our long-term strategic priorities. As a result, we’re winding down our Clinical Trial Services business in a phased way, with a full exit expected by December 31, 2024,"" CVS said in a statement.In response, Walgreens reiterated its commitment to remain in the space and that clinical trials are part of the company's long-term strategy.Ramita Tandon, Walgreens' chief clinical trials officer, told Yahoo Finance as much in an interview Monday.""We are full steam ahead as we continue to support many of our manufacturers that have come into the ecosystem since June,"" Tandon said, referring to when it launched its clinical trial segment.""We're very focused on what we're doing at Walgreens because its part of the broader health care mission and journey that we're on,"" she added.In addition, Tandon said, Walgreens believes that the company has staffed its line of business with experts in the field, rather than just relying on pharmacists, to give it a more robust approach.""It's not easy to be able to execute clinical trials as a provider organization. The staff that we have in place, the leadership...have either worked at a site or worked in different entities that allowed us to understand and appreciate those complexities and those challenges,"" Tandon said of different styles of trial sites. That's where the retailers came into the picture.Story continuesCVS will shut down its clinical trial business after a two-year run to focus on its ""core business""What are Walmart and Walgreens thinking, who both launched a clinical trials business last year? Seeing CVS's clinical trials vertical go down after 2 years is quite ominous pic.twitter.com/udSIXE45yl— Jared Dashevsky, MD, MEng 💌 (@jareddashevsky) May 15, 2023Clinical trials are often conducted at locations that are academic centers or contracted clinical sites, and tend to skew more urban, according to researchers. That leaves a large swath of the country's population out of the loop. During the pandemic, some trials began checking in on patients virtually, when possible, opening up the possibility of different styles of trial sites. That's where the retailers come into the picture.The National Institutes of Health has also emphasized the need to have more diverse patients participate in clinical trials since the start of the pandemic. At the time, the lack of diversity in trials and access issues were in full focus.""After reviewing 20 years of data shared through clinical research trials, researchers found that less than half of studies included information about the race or ethnicity of participants,"" the agency said in a report last year.By doing so, it could help clinicians better understand who benefits more from new drugs and therapies.""This disparity contributes to biased medical evidence and excludes minorities from the benefits of clinical trial participation,"" the study said.The agency's efforts, along with the new FDA mandate, provides more flexibility for clinical trials to include hybrid approaches that will help diversify the patient population, Tandon said.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"
24,78704dd1-4159-34ce-8416-f6d74df552cd,WMT,2023-05-16,4 Quarterly Reports Worth Watching This Week,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-quarterly-reports-worth-watching-185406146.html,1684176846,STORY,"['WMT', 'CSCO', 'DE', 'HD']","[As earnings season begins to slowly fade, a key takeaway has been that quarterly results have primarily turned out to be better than feared, the opposite of what many had been screaming from the rooftops warning us of. And this week, we have many notable companies slated to report, including Walmart WMT, Cisco Systems CSCO, Home Depot HD, and Deere &amp; Company DE.Overall, it’s a big week for retail stocks, but there’s still representation from many sectors. How do the four above shape up heading into their respective quarterly prints? Let’s take a closer look at estimates.Home DepotHome Depot’s quarterly expectations have been lowered since February, with the $3.81 per share estimate being revised downward by 7.5% from $4.12 per share. The quarterly estimate reflects a modest pullback in earnings from the year-ago quarter, with rising costs likely negatively impacting the quarter’s results.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, the Zacks Consensus Sales Estimate presently sits at $38.5 billion, with the estimate down 2% since February and reflecting a decline of 1% compared to the year-ago period.The market has primarily had mixed reactions to HD’s quarterly results over the recent term, as illustrated by the arrows circled in the chart below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCisco SystemsCisco’s earnings outlook has improved nicely since February, with the $0.97 per share estimate up nearly 8% and reflecting year-over-year growth of 11.5%. Top line growth is also there, with our consensus estimate of $14.4 billion indicating a 12% climb year-over-year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIt’s worth noting that CSCO shares have recently broken through the 50-day moving average, indicating a short-term bearish trend with upward momentum fading. A solid quarterly print can push life into the stock; CSCO shares have seen buyers step up following both of its recent earnings releases.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesWalmartWalmart’s quarterly print will undoubtedly be watched like a hawk, as the results will provide a solid gauge of consumer sentiment. The company’s business offers a solid blend of products at reasonable prices, which allows it to capture revenue from lower and higher-end consumers who decide to ‘trade down’ and save their cash.Walmart has consistently delivered better-than-expected results in a challenging operating environment, exceeding earnings and revenue expectations in each of its last three prints. For the quarter to be reported, we expect the company to post EPS of $1.31 and $148 billion in quarterly revenue.Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWalmart shares are a bit expensive on a relative basis, with the current 25.1X forward earnings multiple sitting above the 23.2X five-year median and the Zacks Retail and Wholesale sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDeere &amp; CompanySimilar to CSCO, Deere’s earnings outlook for the quarter to be reported has ticked 5% higher to $8.51 per share, implying an improvement of 25% year-over-year. The company has posted back-to-back quarters of exceeding both earnings and revenue expectations.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDE shares have recently witnessed the ‘death cross,’ which occurs when the 50-day moving average heads below the 200-day moving average. It could potentially reflect a bearish shift for shares, something investors should be aware of.This ‘death cross’ is illustrated below, with another recent example also blended in.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineWhile earnings season is winding down, we still have many quarterly prints to sort through, including those from Cisco Systems CSCO, Deere &amp; Company DE, Walmart WMT, and Home Depot HD.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE: ADC) is a Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based net-lease REIT that focuses on retail properties. Its portfolio includes 1,908 properties totaling 40 million square feet across 48 states. Sixty-eight percent of its tenants are investment grade.Agree Realty was founded as Agree Development Co. in 1971.

Its largest tenants include Walmart, Dollar General, Tractor Supply Co., Best Buy, Kroger, CVS, Lowe’s and Home Depot.Its tenant base by sector is well-diversified among grocery stores, home improvement stores, automotive services, dollar stores, convenience stores and others. The largest sector is grocery stores with a 10.5% total of Agree Realty’s ABR. One of Agree Realty’s acquisition criteria is recession resistance. Come rain or shine, people still have to buy food, so grocery stores are usually among the most stable sectors. A store like Kroger also acts as an anchor for other stores in the strip malls.Story continuesThe chart below provides a snapshot of Agree Realty’s breakdown of tenants and tenant sectors by ABR and percentage of ABR in its portfolio:Tenant ProfilesWalmart Inc.

Its initial public offering (IPO) at $16.50 per share was in August 1972. Today its annual revenue of $570 billion makes it the largest company by revenue in the world.

It also operates a number subsidiaries such as Geek Squad, Magnolia Audio Video and 50 Pacific Sales stores and outlets. Revenue for the 12 months ending Jan. 31 was $46.3 billion.

The weighted average term of these leases is 11.1 years. Investment-grade companies account for 87% of the leases.Looking at company debt, Agree Realty seems to be in good shape.

(NYSE:JWN), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 49% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).And institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's share price fell by 3.3% last week. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 37% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors. Institutions or ""liquidity providers"" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell Nordstrom, which might have negative implications on individual investors.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Nordstrom. See our latest analysis for Nordstrom ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Nordstrom?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Nordstrom already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Nordstrom's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthWe note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Nordstrom. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Bruce Nordstrom with 16% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 9.8% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 9.5% by the third-largest shareholder. Furthermore, CEO Erik Nordstrom is the owner of 1.8% of the company's shares.We also observed that the top 6 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of NordstromThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own a reasonable proportion of Nordstrom, Inc.. It has a market capitalization of just US$2.4b, and insiders have US$710m worth of shares in their own names. That's quite significant.

31,03dd5f0b-5de1-4de2-a9b1-5a1cd7faf06c,MGM,2023-05-16,Fanatics' $150 million deal for PointsBet reflects industry 'growing up',Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fanatics-150-million-deal-for-pointsbet-reflects-industry-growing-up-192120184.html,1684178480,STORY,"['MGM', 'CZR', 'DKNG']","[The sports betting industry is becoming an increasingly slim hierarchy.Fanatics Betting and Gaming agreed to buy PointsBet’s US sports gambling business for $150 million on Sunday night. For Fanatics, a privately-held company valued at $31 billion, the move will provide access to more than 15 states as the company initially known for sports merchandise plans to roll out online sportsbook offerings ahead of the 2023 football season.For PointsBet, an Australian-based sportsbook, the potential acquisition marks the end of a four-year run in the US at a valuation Joel Simkins, a managing director at Houlihan Lokey called ""obviously low.""The deal shows how the sports betting industry — which some believe could more than double to be worth $167 billion by the end of decade —has been a tough one for smaller players to survive in.In all, four operators: FanDuel (PDYPY) DraftKings (DKNG),Caesars (CZR) and BetMGM (MGM) now own more than 95% of the gross gaming revenue market share in New York, the nation's largest mobile wagering market. FanDuel and DraftKings alone account for more than 80%.Those businesses have all benefited from heavy investment to back extending spending, something Fanatics CEO Michael Rubin plans to do with the company's new sportsbook. Boasting a database of more than more than 95 million customers, the company plans to inject roughly $1 billion into its new spots betting division, per the Wall Street Journal.So for companies like PointsBet, which names itself in the release as the seventh largest online operator out of more than 60 online operators in the US, options have become limited as competition among the top players has only intensified. It's either find more capital to keep up with the Joneses, or leave the neighborhood like fuboTV (FUBO) did when it wound down its sportsbook operations in October.""We're seeing a rationalization of the industry,” said Simkins. “Everybody is starting to realize we need to go at this in a responsible manner. We need to dial back some of the aggressive marketing and customer acquisition spend.""Story continues“We're moving from the infancy in the sector to maybe like the toddler phrase, a little more rationality, maturity and discipline. So the industry seems to be growing up a bit.""Sep 11, 2022; Glendale, Arizona, USA; The BetMGM Sportsbook opened for business during the season opener between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Arizona Cardinals on the Great Lawn outside of State Farm Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Rob Schumacher-Arizona Republic (USA TODAY USPW / reuters)'Costs of operating' add upFor its part, PointsBet still has operational businesses in Australia and Canada, where mobile sports betting has been legal for longer. Those businesses will “be at or around EBITDA breakeven on a stand-alone basis,” according to the release announcing the deal.In the US, things played out differently, though, as some of the top operators appeared harder to chase. Mobile sports wagering launched in New York in January 2022 and with it came a prime example of what overspending can do for sportsbook operators.Caesars promoted heavily leading up to last year’s Super Bowl, offering system credit matches up to a deposit of $3,000. The operator also added a $300 bonus, meaning if a user deposited $3,000 into their account, they would have $3,300 of free play money courtesy of the sportsbook.This helped Caesars gain early market share, but it didn’t translate to sustained success. The company started the year ahead in monthly gross gaming revenue, per the New York State commission, but finished 2022 handily in third place behind industry leaders Fanduel and DraftKings.In the first four months of 2023, PointsBet owned just more than 1% of gross gaming revenue market share in New York.“Despite the strategic success building a valuable asset in the US, the costs of operating in a state-by-state environment, together with the requirement to build significant scale to compete against well capitalized operators, led us to explore a number of options,” PointsBet Managing Director and Group CEO Sam Swanell said in a statement. “The sale of the US Business to Fanatics Betting and Gaming delivers the most attractive risk-adjusted value outcome for shareholders compared to the risks and benefits of other options including the status quo.”Josh is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

The company is benefiting from increased business volume and travel activity, primarily at MGM China and Las Vegas Strip Resorts. The removal of COVID-related travel restrictions in Macau resulted in high contributions from MGM China segment. The company is also planning to expand its footprint in New York.

33,f2da0586-5814-3781-ae33-9edd6ce6604f,MGM,2023-05-16,Marriott (MAR) Rewards Shareholders With 30% Dividend Hike,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marriott-mar-rewards-shareholders-30-170805455.html,1684170485,STORY,"['MAR', 'MGM', 'BYD']","[Marriott International, Inc. MAR recently announced a 30% hike in its quarterly dividend payout which reflects its intention to utilize free cash to boost shareholders’ returns.MAR raised the quarterly dividend to 52 cents per share (or $2.08 annually) from the previous payout of 40 cents (or $1.60 annually). The hiked dividend will be paid out on Jun 30, to shareholders on record as of May 26.  Based on the closing price of $174.10 per share on May 12, the stock has a dividend yield of 1.2%.Along with boosting shareholders’ returns, dividend hikes raise the market value of a stock. Companies often attract new investors and retain old ones through this strategy. Year to date (through Apr 28), Marriott has paid approximately $1.5 billion to its shareholders in the form of cash dividends and repurchases of common stock.What’s Driving the Dividend Policy?Marriott has been gaining from pent-up leisure demand, increased cross-border travel and lenient travel restrictions. Throughout first-quarter 2023, the company witnessed a steady increase in demand in the United States, Canada and Europe. Also, it reported a strong RevPAR recovery in Asia pacific.Group demand in the United States and Canada increased sharply during the quarter, leading to improved occupancies and strength in ADR. With global trends improving, MAR expects the recovery momentum to continue. Attributes such as pent-up demand for all types of travel, the shift of spending toward experiences versus goods and lifting of travel restrictions (particularly in Greater China) are likely to add to the positives.MAR is benefiting from robust growth in its loyalty program. With nearly 182 million members globally, the company’s loyalty program Marriott Bonvoy is supporting its marketing strategies. Also, Marriott is engaging its customers with promotional offers such as grocery and retail spending accelerators on its co-branded credit cards.During first-quarter 2023, digital revenues increased 26% year over year. Mobile app users were up 31% year over year, while digital room nights rose 17% year over year. Backed by solid customer acceptance for credit card programs and a rise in credit card average spending, the company anticipates higher contributions from credit card fees in 2023.Meanwhile, Marriott is consistently trying to expand its presence worldwide and capitalize on the demand for hotels in international markets. On May 1, it completed the acquisition of the City Express brand portfolio. The initiative involved the addition of approximately 150 properties located in Mexico, Costa Rica, Colombia, and Chile. The transaction also paved a path for entry into the high-growth mid-scale segment.We believe that the initiatives are likely to strengthen MAR’s business and drive the sustainability of its cash flows in the upcoming periods.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSo far this year, shares of Marriott have gained 16.9% compared with the Zacks Hotels and Motels industry's 10.7% growth.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Marriott sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are MGM Resorts International MGM, Boyd Gaming Corporation BYD and Crocs, Inc.

The reported loss was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 23 cents and our estimate of a loss of 11 cents. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Spectrum Brands' net sales fell 9.7% year over year to $729.2 million and lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $767 million and our estimate of $780.6 million. Acquisition-related gains of $22.1 million aided the top line, while adverse foreign currency impacts of $19.4 million remained a drag. Organic net sales declined 10.1%. The downside was mainly due to retailer inventory management strategies and slower category POS, offset by positive pricing.The gross profit decreased 16.1% year over year to $214.5 million, while the gross margin contracted 220 basis points (bps) year over year to 29.4% due to a decline in sales volume, unfavorable mix and sales of higher cost inventory accumulated in the prior year, which more than offset pricing actions.SG&amp;A expenses fell 14.2% to $219.3 million. As a percentage of sales, SG&amp;A expenses contracted 150 bps to 30.1%.The company’s operating loss was $77 million compared with the prior-year quarter’s loss of $8.1 million due to an intangible asset impairment of $67 million, offset by lower distribution costs, fixed-cost reduction efforts, and reduced project spend on restructuring, optimization and strategic transaction initiatives.Adjusted EBITDA plunged 35.4% to $51 million in the fiscal second quarter. The adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 280 bps to 7% due to reduced volume and currency headwinds.Story continuesSegmental PerformanceSales in the Home &amp; Personal Care segment decreased 11.7% to $279.2 million due to a category decline from lower demand, particularly in kitchen appliances, and continued retailer inventory management in North America. Excluding the $22.1-million gain from the acquisition and the $11.8-million impact of adverse currency rates, organic net sales for the segment fell 14.9%.The segment's adjusted EBITDA came in at a loss of $1.9 million against earnings of $10.6 million. Meanwhile, adjusted EBITDA margins contracted 410 bps year over year to 0.7% due to lower volume, the sales of higher cost inventory accumulated in the prior year and unfavorable foreign currency in EMEA, partly offset by cost savings and additional actions undertaken during the quarter.The Global Pet Care segment's sales inched down 0.5% year over year to $296.7 million, driven by strong growth in companion animals stemming from strength in chews in North America, and Dog and Cat food in EMEA, partly offset by declines in other hard goods and aquatic environments. Excluding the $7.6-million impact of unfavorable foreign currency, organic sales rose 3.1%.The segment's adjusted EBITDA grew 5.7% to $46.3, while the adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 180 bps year over year to 15.6%, driven by lower distribution costs, positive pricing, savings from the prior year’s cost-reduction initiatives and additional cost-reduction actions.The Home &amp; Garden segment's sales declined 22% to $153.3 million due to a reduction in retailer inventory and adverse weather conditions. Also, drab cleaning products sales in the spring season led to a POS decline in the relevant categories. The segment's adjusted EBITDA of $15.1 million decreased 60% from $37.7 million in the prior-year quarter due to a sales decline, which was offset by gains from fixed-cost restructuring and operational cost reductions initiated in the second half of last year.Other FinancialsAs of Apr 2, 2023, the company’s cash balance was $328 million, with an outstanding debt of $3,222 million. It has $362 million available on its $1.1-billion cash flow revolver.

Month-to-month changes will be a key focus, especially for companies that have enjoyed a lift from China's economic improvements. With more on the influence of the Chinese consumer for US companies, we have Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferre joining us. Hey, Ines.INES FERRE: Hey, Rachelle, that's right. And investors will be paying close attention to that data that you just mentioned, especially when it comes to retail sales, especially when it comes to sales related to services because remember that the Chinese lockdowns were pretty severe. So now that they have been lifted, companies have been talking about what they've seen with the consumer.The consumer spending more on dining out. The consumer spending more when it comes to traveling as well. And we've already seen some companies that have been benefiting from the China recovery and some of these include the ones that you see there on your screen, like Starbucks, Disney, Procter &amp; Gamble, Marriott.So taking a look at Starbucks, for example, its fiscal second quarter, a big turning point for the company, surprising the Street with China sales up 3%. The Street had expected for those to be lower. Starbucks has been on an expansion plan when it comes to China, increasing its footprint in China. And during their last earnings calls, management talked about the decision to keep opening stores during the pandemic despite disruptions. That decision is paying off.Moving on to Disney. Disney's international parks have been a bright spot for the company with Shanghai Disney Resort. That's seeing improvement, with management talking in their last earnings calls about higher attendance and improved financial results when it comes to Shanghai.Also looking at MGM. MGM's results blew it out of the park when it comes to MGM China, where their net revenue increased 130% from the prior quarter. The end of the lockdowns definitely very positive for the company. MGM is up 26% year-to-date, Rachelle.RACHELLE AKUFFO: All right, great stuff there. Keeping an eye on some of those impacts there, Ines Ferre there for us. Thanks so much.]"

The increase of adding electronic components to applications across the automotive, industrial and consumer industries has spurred the need for far-reaching USB cabling products. To provide long-distance and reliable USB solutions to the market, Microchip Technology (Nasdaq: MCHP) today announces two new reclocker/redriver devices. The automotive EQCO510 and industrial EQCO5X31 reclocker/redriver devices extend USB coverage up to 15 meters for maximum reach and are compatible with the USB 3.2 Generation 1 SuperSpeed protocol.The EQCO510 and EQCO5X31 are USB reclocker/redriver devices that can send high-speed data signals with a rate of 5 Gbps in both directions. The reclocking feature includes a bit-level Clock-Data Recovery (CDR) that is used to restore signal timing and prevent jitter accumulation. The redriving feature restores the levels and shape of the signal being driven into the next segment such as a cable or printed-circuit board (PCB) trace, thus compensating for signal degradation due to cable attenuation.“Our customers now have the capability to implement a fast, reliable and long-distance USB connectivity solution of up to 15 meters, extending the three meter standard by five times,” said Matthias Kaestner, corporate vice president of Microchip’s automotive infotainment systems business unit. “These devices also provide our customers with a comprehensive option that reduces board space because of the on-chip clock and small form factor.”The USB devices are equipped with EyeOpen™ cable compensation at the receiver to automatically adjust for frequency dependent losses in the cable and adjusting the signal strength between 0 and 24 dB with 1 dB steps. The devices also feature MarginLink™ signal integrity testing, which allows runtime evaluation of the integrity of the whole signal path.Story continuesThe EQCO510 and EQCO5X31 ICs support shielded twisted pair and coax cables. The devices include an integrated crystal-less CDR, which reduces the need for additional components and overall board space. Both USB devices are available in a 20-pin, 4 mm QFN package with wettable flanks. The automotive EQCO510 is compliant with automotive reliability standard AEC-Q100 Grade 2 and operates in temperatures ranging from -40°C to 105°C.Microchip’s USB devices can be used in many automotive applications such as infotainment systems, data communication modules and real-time video systems. Other use cases in industrial applications and consumer products include machine vision, gaming accessories and smart cables.Development ToolsThe EQCO5X31 is supported with two evaluation boards including the EVB-EQCO5X31 USB Type-C® Cable Extender and the EVB-EQCO5X31 USB Type-C Cable Repeater. Both evaluation boards enable the ability to demonstrate use with longer cables.Pricing and AvailabilityThe automotive EQCO510 is available for $4.82 each in 1,000-unit quantities.

But there are 10 cost saving options that work better",Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mass-layoffs-terrible-shareholders-study-110900104.html,1684148940,STORY,['IT'],"[Good morning,More from Fortune:  5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from home Looking to make extra cash? This CD has a 5.15% APY right now Buying a house? Here's how much to save This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home Do mass layoffs reflect poor management? That's up for debate. But a new analysis suggests the practice harms shareholder returns, and companies should instead consider tactics like a four-day workweek to cut costs.CFOs tend to underestimate the “organizational drag” that’s created as a result of layoffs, according to the research and advisory firm Gartner. This can inadvertently reduce shareholder returns in the long term instead of protecting them, an analysis finds.“The first thing to recognize is that there is an immediate upfront cost to layoffs as a business will need to reorganize itself around a smaller group of employees and typically incur costly upfront severance payments,” Vaughan Archer, senior director of research and advisory in the Gartner Finance practice, said in a statement. And what will follow is an increased need for contractor hiring, which can be costly, and remaining employees have a ton of more work and more demands for increased compensation, according to Archer.Within three years, the forecasted savings from layoffs tend to become offset by the unforeseen consequences, Gartner said. Even if a business avoids ""a vicious cycle of employee turnover"" driven by overworked staff and low morale, any cost savings from layoffs will likely be lost. And when businesses start to rehire at some point, it will likely be at higher rates than the employees who were laid off.“In the more negative scenarios, the factors detailed here are also going to harm growth in existing and new business, and ultimately a firm will start losing its customers,” Archer said.Four days instead of fiveA four-day workweek is one of the 10 cost savings actions companies can take instead of mass layoffs, Gartner suggests. Trimming the traditional workweek model to four days is “not about cutting pay, but may control pay growth and staff turnover as employees find better work-life balance and increased productivity as burnout is reduced,” the firm noted.Story continuesThis work dynamic has certainly been a hot topic of discussion. Monster conducted a survey of 868 workers in March focusing on work productivity. Sixty-one percent said they’d rather have a four-day workweek and 33% say they’d leave their job for one with a shortened week.Britain announced in February the results of the world’s biggest trial of a four-day working week, Fortune reported. The six-month pilot included over 60 companies and just under 3,000 to feedback on the “100:80:100” working model: 100% pay for 80% of the time, in exchange for 100% productivity. The results included a 65% reduction in the number of sick days, maintained or improved productivity at most businesses, and a 57% decline in the likelihood that a worker would quit, improving job retention.Andrew Barnes is the cofounder of the nonprofit 4 Day Week Global, helping organizations in various countries, including the U.K., pilot shorter schedules. Barnes also owns Perpetual Guardian, one of New Zealand's largest corporate trustee companies. During MIT Sloan Management Review’s virtual summit on May 4, he talked about his company’s experience.“We implemented the four-day workweek five years ago,” he said. “We’re twice as productive on a per capita basis now as our nearest competitor. We’re not seeing any adverse impacts.”Voluntary reduction in hours, internal redeployment, reducing executive compensation, remote work, voluntary leave of absence, a hiring freeze, benefit cuts, organization-wide pay cuts, and sabbaticals are the other options companies can take instead of mass layoffs, Gartner advises.If the livelihood and well-being of employees and shareholder returns are on the line, there’s a lot to consider before deciding on a major workforce reduction.Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.comThis story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

The data reveals that as companies and employees face continued high inflation and economic uncertainty, financial benefits are taking on new significance:Financial benefits can drive retention: 89% of employees agree they would be more invested in staying at their company if it provided financial benefits that met their needs. And, most HR leaders (90%) are worried that their employees would leave if their company did not provide benefits that met employee needs.Employees are paying closer attention to financial benefits, and employers are taking notice: Nearly 69% of employees say they are paying more attention to reviewing their financial benefits in 2023, up nine percentage points from last year. Similarly, more HR leaders increasingly expect their employees to pay more attention to their benefits (86%).Yet companies have pulled back on benefits: Employees and employers seem to be at odds over expectations around financial benefits, with more employees requesting benefits that their company does not offer (88% vs. 78% in 2021). And one in four HR leaders shared that they are cutting back on employee financial benefits to prepare for a recession.HR leaders and employees agree employers should step up support: Both employees (95%) and HR leaders (98%) agree that employers should offer the best employee benefits available in their industry. In looking ahead, most employees (89%) and HR leaders (97%) agree that their company needs to do a better job providing resources to maximize the financial benefits offered to them.Story continues""Economic instability has led both employers and employees to tighten their belts—and ask a lot of their workplace benefits in the process,"" said Brian McDonald, Head of Morgan Stanley at Work. ""We're seeing momentum on both the employer and employee side to engage more intelligently with financial benefits as a ballast against uncertainty.

The biggest tidbit of gossip was that Buffett considers Apple to be the best business that they own. Additionally, he said Berkshire was not intending on buying out Occidental Petroleum.But what if, as an investor, you wanted to own the various businesses that Buffett owns, but you didn't want to do so by owning shares of Berkshire Hathaway? Berkshire Hathaway now has $130 billion in cash but doesn't pay a dividend. That's a lot of cash sitting on the sidelines.It's also not cheap, with a forward P/E of 17.Creating Your Own Mini Berkshire HathawayAnyone can mimic Berkshire Hathaway's equity portfolio. That's easy. The company files Form 4s every quarter disclosing what stocks they are buying, and selling.But what about its other businesses? It owns See's Candy, Dairy Queen, BNSF Railroad, Nebraska Furniture Market and a bunch of other companies.5 Berkshire-Like Companies You Could Buy Right Now1.       Union Pacific Corp. UNPUnion Pacific Corp. is a big American railroad, similar to Berkshire's BNSF.Shares of Union Pacific are down 4.3% year-to-date but it's not that cheap. It trades with a forward P/E of 17.8.Story continuesEarnings are expected to be up 0.09% this year and 7.1% in 2024. But is that enough to pay 17.8x?Should you buy Union Pacific, an ""old economy"" stock, in 2023?2.       Haverty Furniture HVTHaverty Furniture operates 100 showrooms in 16 southern and Midwest states. Founded in 1885, Haverty is in the same mold as some of Buffett's furniture investments like Nebraska Furniture Market.Shares of Haverty have fallen 14.6% year-to-date. It's dirt cheap, with a forward P/E of 6.7. Haverty also pays a dividend, currently yielding 4.3%.However, with the US housing market slowing, so are Haverty's sales. Sales fell 5.9% in the first quarter.Is Haverty a deal?3.       The Hershey Company HSYHershey is a confection and food company that makes famous candy brands such as Reese's and Almond Joy. While it's not identical to Berkshire's See's Candy, it's the closest publicly traded candy company out there.Hershey shares have been on a tear in 2023, gaining 18.7%. It's also near a 5-year high. But Hershey doesn't come cheap. It's trading at 29x.Is Hershey overbought?4.       Signet Jewelers Ltd. SIGSignet Jewelers is an option if you want to own a jewelry store like Warren Buffett. Berkshire Hathaway bought Helzberg Diamonds in 1996.Shares of Signet Jewelers are up 5.5% year-to-date and 88% over the last 5 years. The 5-year performance easily beats the S&amp;P 500, which is up 51.7% during that time.Signet Jewelers is cheap, with a forward P/E of 6.2.Should you consider Signet Jewelers even though a recession may be coming?5.       Redfin Corp. RDFNRedfin is a real estate brokerage. Did you know that Berkshire Hathaway also owns one? It's Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices.It's been a wild couple of years for Redfin's shares. Over the last 2 years, it's down 78% but in 2023, Redfin is hot, gaining 161%.Redfin doesn't have a P/E as earnings are expected to be negative in both 2023 and 2024.Is a rebound in housing already priced into Redfin shares?What Else do Value Investors Need to Know About Creating a Mini Berkshire Hathaway?

Walgreens and Walmart (WMT) also announced similar efforts. Then, last year, the FDA issued a new mandate for clinical trials to focus on diversity, which included pharmacies as potential partner sites — which is why CVS's move to pull out of the space is surprising.CVS confirmed to Yahoo Finance in a statement Monday that it would be closing this line of business by 2024. ""We continually evaluate our portfolio of assets to ensure they are aligned with our long-term strategic priorities. As a result, we’re winding down our Clinical Trial Services business in a phased way, with a full exit expected by December 31, 2024,"" CVS said in a statement.In response, Walgreens reiterated its commitment to remain in the space and that clinical trials are part of the company's long-term strategy.Ramita Tandon, Walgreens' chief clinical trials officer, told Yahoo Finance as much in an interview Monday.""We are full steam ahead as we continue to support many of our manufacturers that have come into the ecosystem since June,"" Tandon said, referring to when it launched its clinical trial segment.""We're very focused on what we're doing at Walgreens because its part of the broader health care mission and journey that we're on,"" she added.In addition, Tandon said, Walgreens believes that the company has staffed its line of business with experts in the field, rather than just relying on pharmacists, to give it a more robust approach.""It's not easy to be able to execute clinical trials as a provider organization. The staff that we have in place, the leadership...have either worked at a site or worked in different entities that allowed us to understand and appreciate those complexities and those challenges,"" Tandon said of different styles of trial sites. That's where the retailers came into the picture.Story continuesCVS will shut down its clinical trial business after a two-year run to focus on its ""core business""What are Walmart and Walgreens thinking, who both launched a clinical trials business last year? Seeing CVS's clinical trials vertical go down after 2 years is quite ominous pic.twitter.com/udSIXE45yl— Jared Dashevsky, MD, MEng 💌 (@jareddashevsky) May 15, 2023Clinical trials are often conducted at locations that are academic centers or contracted clinical sites, and tend to skew more urban, according to researchers. That leaves a large swath of the country's population out of the loop. During the pandemic, some trials began checking in on patients virtually, when possible, opening up the possibility of different styles of trial sites. That's where the retailers come into the picture.The National Institutes of Health has also emphasized the need to have more diverse patients participate in clinical trials since the start of the pandemic. At the time, the lack of diversity in trials and access issues were in full focus.""After reviewing 20 years of data shared through clinical research trials, researchers found that less than half of studies included information about the race or ethnicity of participants,"" the agency said in a report last year.By doing so, it could help clinicians better understand who benefits more from new drugs and therapies.""This disparity contributes to biased medical evidence and excludes minorities from the benefits of clinical trial participation,"" the study said.The agency's efforts, along with the new FDA mandate, provides more flexibility for clinical trials to include hybrid approaches that will help diversify the patient population, Tandon said.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Month-to-month changes will be a key focus, especially for companies that have enjoyed a lift from China's economic improvements. With more on the influence of the Chinese consumer for US companies, we have Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferre joining us. Hey, Ines.INES FERRE: Hey, Rachelle, that's right. And investors will be paying close attention to that data that you just mentioned, especially when it comes to retail sales, especially when it comes to sales related to services because remember that the Chinese lockdowns were pretty severe. So now that they have been lifted, companies have been talking about what they've seen with the consumer.The consumer spending more on dining out. The consumer spending more when it comes to traveling as well. And we've already seen some companies that have been benefiting from the China recovery and some of these include the ones that you see there on your screen, like Starbucks, Disney, Procter &amp; Gamble, Marriott.So taking a look at Starbucks, for example, its fiscal second quarter, a big turning point for the company, surprising the Street with China sales up 3%. The Street had expected for those to be lower. Starbucks has been on an expansion plan when it comes to China, increasing its footprint in China. And during their last earnings calls, management talked about the decision to keep opening stores during the pandemic despite disruptions. That decision is paying off.Moving on to Disney. Disney's international parks have been a bright spot for the company with Shanghai Disney Resort. That's seeing improvement, with management talking in their last earnings calls about higher attendance and improved financial results when it comes to Shanghai.Also looking at MGM. MGM's results blew it out of the park when it comes to MGM China, where their net revenue increased 130% from the prior quarter. The end of the lockdowns definitely very positive for the company. MGM is up 26% year-to-date, Rachelle.RACHELLE AKUFFO: All right, great stuff there. Keeping an eye on some of those impacts there, Ines Ferre there for us. Thanks so much.]"

80,34db4713-f182-3478-8a1a-f10c88a8dbee,ADM,2023-05-16,10 Best Vertical Farming and Hydroponic Stocks to Buy,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-vertical-farming-hydroponic-185756923.html,1684177076,STORY,"['MOS', 'IPW', 'VFF', 'AGFY', 'ADM', 'DE']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 10 best vertical farming and hydroponic stocks to buy. To see more of these stocks, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Vertical Farming and Hydroponic Stocks to Buy.The agriculture and farming sector has long been a vital part of not only financial markets but also day-to-day living for the global population. With global food insecurity being on the rise in recent years, this sector has become even more important and, thus also more burdened. To meet rising demand, increasingly dangerous agricultural practices have been adopted in the past, which have been taking an immense toll on the planet. Many climate change activists thus place the blame on agricultural practices for many current issues such as climate change, deforestation, and soil degradation. Because of this, innovations within the agriculture sector that enable sustainable, environmentally friendly, and affordable crop production have become necessary. Two such innovations are what we know as vertical and hydroponic farming.What are Vertical and Hydroponic Farming?Simply put, vertical farming is farming on vertical surfaces rather than horizontal surfaces. In this method, vertically stacked layers are used to enable farmers to produce more food on the same amount of land, if not less. In many cases, vertical farming is integrated into buildings such as greenhouses and even skyscrapers. However, much more accommodation has to be made for crops being grown with such a method. For instance, farmers have to ensure their crops have enough artificial temperature, light, and water. As such, the area where vertical farming is operative is almost highly controlled by experienced professionals to ensure no crops are lost or wasted.Many agricultural and farming companies, such as Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE), The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS), and Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) have been focusing on sustainable agricultural practices. However, the companies operating directly within the vertical farming and hydroponics space have been leading the agricultural sector in terms of sustainability. Like vertical farming, hydroponic farming is another sustainable agricultural practice. In this method, farmers grow their plants using a water-based nutrient solution instead of soil. This agricultural practice has actually been around for a long time, so it's not exactly a new innovation. According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), the process of growing plants in water culture or sand culture without soil is actually one that has been used by physiologists for over a century. However, with the means and technology utilized by companies working in this space today, the scope and effectiveness of this agricultural practice have grown to greater lengths than ever before.Story continuesAmerican Support for Innovative AgricultureThe USDA has long been committed to increasing the scope of urban and innovative agricultural production on a local level. In 2021, the department announced a grant of $4 million to support this initiative. The 2021 grant was the second of its kind offered by the US government for this purpose, and it spanned two kinds of projects: Planning Projects and Implementation Projects.Under the first category, the USDA attempted to encourage farmers, gardeners, citizens, government officials, schools, and any other stakeholders in urban and suburban areas to initiate projects targeting key areas of food access and more. Under the second category, the department aimed to accelerate the growth and progress of existing urban, indoor, and other agricultural practices to improve local food access.The grants offered by the government in the past were only succeeded by even more generous opportunities in 2022. In October, the USDA again announced that it was investing $14.2 million in 52 grants to support urban agriculture and innovative production. This move was meant to expand the population's access to nutritious foods and increase awareness of climate change, and the money promised in these grants further built on $26.3 million already invested in similar projects since 2020. Such stringent and enthusiastic efforts on the part of the government have managed to make vertical and hydroponic farming more widely practiced across the country and spell out only good news for the companies operating within this space. As such, we have compiled a list of some of the best vertical farming and hydroponic stocks to buy today since they may well skyrocket sometime in the near future.10 Best Vertical Farming and Hydroponic Stocks to BuyPixabay/Public DomainLet's now take a look at the 10 best vertical farming and hydroponic stocks to buy.Our MethodologyTo select the stocks for our list below, we used Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the fourth quarter, when 943 hedge funds were tracked.

81,6cdeefd5-686f-3f2d-b6b0-5c9f9476526e,HST,2023-05-16,Here's Why Host Hotels (HST) is an Apt Portfolio Pick for Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-host-hotels-hst-115511790.html,1684151711,STORY,['HST'],"[Host Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc.’s HST has a portfolio of luxury and upper-upscale hotels in the United States and abroad. With the lodging industry rebounding, HST’s well-located properties in markets with strong demand drivers, like central business districts of main cities, close to airports and in resort/conference destinations, are likely to benefit.Earlier this month, this Bethesda, MD-based lodging real estate investment trust (REIT) reported first-quarter adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) per share of 55 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 48 cents and our estimate of 44 cents. The figure jumped a whopping 41% from the prior-year quarter’s 39 cents.Its quarterly results reflected better-than-anticipated revenues, aided by continued strong leisure demand and growth in city center markets.Management also raised its 2023 outlook for AFFO per share. It now expects the same to lie in the range of $1.84-$1.95, up from the prior expectation of $1.60-$1.83.Analysts, too, seem bullish on this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 FFO per share has increased 2.2% over the past week, indicating a favorable outlook for the company.Shares of HST have lost 3.6% in the past three months, narrower than its industry's decline of 8.5%. Given its progress on fundamentals and upward estimate revisions, the stock is likely to keep performing well in the quarters ahead, and hence the dip offers a good entry point.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFactors Aiding Host HotelsHealthy Operating Performance: Host Hotels has been experiencing healthy operating performance owing to the continued recovery in leisure travel demand, particularly in the Sunbelt markets and Hawaii region, where the company has a strong presence. Also, healthy demand from small and medium-sized businesses, representing a large share of the company’s corporate demand, has aided business transient recovery.   In the first quarter of 2023, HST’s comparable revenue per available room (RevPAR) was $217.77, climbing 31.1% from the year-ago quarter’s $166.12. The figure also improved 7.4% from the first-quarter 2019 tally. Comparable EBITDA came in at $439 million, climbing 43.9% from $305 million reported a year ago.With improving industry demand-supply fundamentals, HST is likely to witness healthy operating performance in the upcoming period.Strategic Acquisitions: The company is focused on enhancing the quality of its portfolio and has made significant acquisitions of high-quality properties over the past years with long-term growth prospects. Additionally, to achieve a higher portfolio EBITDA and revenues, HST has broadened its acquisition focus to include urban markets beyond the top 25 ones.In November 2022, the company acquired the Four Seasons Resort and Residences Jackson Hole for $315 million in cash. The buyout of the 125-room luxury resort, located in Jackson Hole, WY, aims to elevate the EBITDA growth profile of the company’s portfolio.Capital Recycling Efforts: Host Hotels’ capital recycling efforts are encouraging. Over the years, HST has been disposing of its non-strategic assets that have maximized their value and utilizing the proceeds for acquiring or investing in premium properties in markets that are anticipated to recover faster.Per its May 2023 Investor Presentation, from 2021 to the beginning of 2023 through May 4, 2023, total dispositions amounted to approximately $1.5 billion, which is 17.5 times the EBITDA multiple. During the same period, acquisitions totaled $1.9 billion, representing EBITDA multiple of 13.1 times.Capital Expenditure: Host Hotels engages in strategic capital allocations to improve its portfolio quality and strengthen its position in the United States, where it has a greater scale and competitive advantage. In the first quarter of 2023, Host Hotels incurred around $146 million in capital expenditure and in 2022, the same aggregated $504 million. For 2023, the company expects capital expenditure in the range of $600-$725 million.Balance Sheet &amp; Cash Flow Strength:  HST maintains a healthy balance sheet with no material debt maturities until April 2024. As of Mar 31, 2023, the company had $2.3 billion in total available liquidity. Moreover, it is the only company with an investment-grade rating among lodging REITs. It enjoys investment-grade ratings of Baa3 from Moody’s and BBB- from both Fitch and S&amp;P Global, providing easy access to debt at favorable costs. This financial flexibility will aid capital deployment for long-term growth opportunities and facilitate redevelopment activities.HST’s current cash flow growth is projected at 71.75% compared with 8.77% growth estimated for the industry. In addition, its trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) is 11.83% compared with the industry’s average of 3.50%. This reflects that the company is more efficient in using shareholders’ funds than its peers.Story continuesOther Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are VICI Properties VICI, Iron Mountain IRM and Stag Industrial STAG, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2.

In the year-ago reported quarter, LUV had reported a loss of 32 cents per share.LUV incurred first-quarter 2023 loss due to the unfavorable financial impact of almost $380 million pre-tax, or $294 million after-tax, related to the December 2022 operational disruption. The majority of this impact was backed by an unfavorable revenue impact of almost $325 million, as a result of cancelations of holiday return travel and a decline in bookings for January and February 2023 travel. Despite that, travel demand and revenue trends in March 2023 remained solid and resulted in profitability for the month and record first-quarter revenues.Revenues of $5,706 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,741.4 million but improved 21.6% year over year.Southwest Airlines Co. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseSouthwest Airlines Co. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Southwest Airlines Co. QuoteHow is Southwest Airlines Doing?Continued recovery in air-travel demand (mainly on the leisure front) bodes well for Southwest Airlines. In the first quarter of 2023, air traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles, jumped 11.6% year over year to 29.54 billion. Capacity or available seat miles (ASMs) climbed 10.7% year over year to 38.06 billion in the first quarter of 2023.  Anticipating the trend to continue, Southwest Airlines’ management expects second-quarter 2023 ASMs to improve 14% from the year-ago reported figure. For 2023, LUV now expects capacity to improve 14-15% (prior view: up 15-16%) from the 2022 level.LUV’s liquidity position raises optimism in the stock. At the end of first-quarter 2023, the carrier’s cash and cash equivalents were $$8,359 million, higher than the long-term debt (less current maturities) of $7,999 million, implying that the company has enough cash to meet its debt obligations.Story continuesDespite the aforementioned tailwinds, escalating fuel prices continue to remain a concern. In first-quarter 2023, fuel cost per gallon (inclusive of fuel tax: economic) rose 38.7% to $3.19. For second-quarter 2023, economic fuel costs per gallon are expected between $2.45 and $2.55. For 2023, economic fuel costs per gallon are now estimated between $2.60 and $2.70 (prior view: $2.65 and $2.75). Although full-year guidance for fuel prices has been lowered, fuel expenses continue to act as a major concern for the company's bottom line.Apart from the increase in fuel costs, a rise in labor and airport costs is also likely to dent bottom-line growth, resulting in a spike in operating expenses. In first-quarter 2023, consolidated unit cost or cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel, oil and profit-sharing expenses, and special items increased 5.9% year over year. Due to an increase in labor and airport costs, as well as lower productivity levels, LUV expects CASM, excluding fuel, oil and profit-sharing expenses, and special items, to increase 5-8% in the second quarter of 2023 from the comparable period in 2022.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderSouthwest Airlines currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors interested in better-ranked stocks from the Zacks Transportation – Airline industry can consider Copa Holdings, S.A.

It has amassed assets over $424.31 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Style Box - Small Cap Blend. GSSC, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity Index.The Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity Index is designed to deliver exposure to equity securities of small capitalization U.S. issuers.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Story continuesOperating expenses on an annual basis are 0.20% for GSSC, making it on par with most peer products in the space.GSSC's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 1.36%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsETFs offer diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk, but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Industrials sector - about 19.20% of the portfolio. Financials and Healthcare round out the top three.Taking into account individual holdings, Jun 23 Cme Eminirus2k (RTYM3) accounts for about 1.16% of the fund's total assets, followed by Atkore Inc (ATKR) and Emcor Group Inc (EME).The top 10 holdings account for about 4.28% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe ETF has lost about -1.33% so far this year and is down about -1.09% in the last one year (as of 05/16/2023).

89,c2c5b557-a5de-3095-8ca5-c26a67534d99,GS,2023-05-16,Family office 'overwhelmingly overweight' in developed markets investments: Goldman Sachs partner,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/family-office-overwhelmingly-overweight-developed-002739935.html,1684196859,VIDEO,"['^DJI', 'GS', 'BTC-USD', '^GSPC', '^IXIC']","[Sara Naison-Tarajano, Goldman Sachs Global Head of Private Wealth Management Capital Markets, joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss where Goldman Sachs family offices are investing according to a survey, cryptocurrency investments, and the company's outlook based on investment trends.Video Transcript- Goldman Sachs getting the pulse of where the ultra wealthy are looking to invest this year. Joining us now is Sarah Naison-Tarajano, Goldman Sachs Global Head of Private Wealth Management Capital Markets. Sara, it's great to see you here. So you're out with the new report. You spoke to a number of family offices. One of my big takeaways from this report was this risk on attitude, the sentiment that you guys found speaking with all these family offices. What do you think is driving that?SARA NAISON-TARAJANO: Yeah, and I would say, look, the reason that we've talked about this risk on sentiment is that we see a number of families talking about looking to invest in equities in the future even more. So 48% say they're prepared to invest in equities in the future in the next 12 months and over 40% in alts. I think that really comes down to family offices being a very nimble investor based who can act when others are running away from the market.You have to remember, they aren't answering to a set of outside investors. They don't have to worry about redemptions the way other investors do, so they can be in a position to act. And I think they are prepared to do so upon dislocations.- So Sara, I wanted to ask you. Was there anything that surprised you in terms of this data? Because, for instance, my perspective, when I was looking at the geographic allocation going forward and I saw that only 26% of respondents plan to increase their allocation to US markets, talk to us about the breakdown of where they're looking to put their money, and was there anything that surprised you?SARA NAISON-TARAJANO: Yeah, I would say, overall, in terms of the results of the survey, one thing I'll just start with is, actually, the allocations have stayed quite similar from our last paper published in 2021. And I think this is really a testament to family offices being patient capital, and also, the lack of leverage in the system. So there hasn't been a need to really shift significantly the asset allocations. When we surveyed this group in 2021, they had 45% in alternatives. Today, they have 44%.Story continuesIn terms of why we don't necessarily see a higher move to the US, that is because this family office group is overwhelmingly overweight, the US in developed markets. And if you look at the US investors, in particular, they have 77% of their capital already in the United States. So I think the focus, particularly in a more volatile environment that we've seen for the last six months, is to stay invested in developed markets.- Sara, how are you advising clients in this very uncertain environment given the fact that we had the debt ceiling showdown down in DC, and also, this higher rate and higher for longer, it seems like, environment here from the Fed?SARA NAISON-TARAJANO: Yeah, look, it's a great question. I would say our advice to clients is to really be calm, and that's what we've seen. When we think about our role as advising clients, it's about preservation of capital, and when you think about what it takes to reverse capital, what really impacts the preservation of capital is permanent loss. And when you're a for seller, that creates permanent loss.So we're advising clients to stay calm through these cycles. Look, they've experienced it through COVID when the market dislocated significantly in March 2020. They saw it in the great financial crisis, and I'll just throw a stat at you. And I tell this stat to our clients all the time. If you look back at the performance of the equity market from 2009, until today from Summer 2009, if you were out of the market for the 50 best trading days, that's 50 trading days in, what, almost a 15 year period? You would have given up 100% of the return of the equity market.And if you had been out the 10 best days, you'd give up almost half the returns of the equity market. So what we're telling clients is don't panic, look at dislocations as ways to create further exposure. I will say that our family offices are really disciplined and focused right now. The bar for investing is high, and I would say we definitely have more muted equity market return expectations over the next six to 12 months.So you've probably heard us talking about this, but we're spending time on things, like private credit, given that you can get to double digit returns in private credit today. And that's an area, I think, our family offices are spending a lot of time with in equities. They're really focused on balance sheet, path to profitability, margins. There's a lot of discipline around making sure they're invested in companies that can weather the storm of market dislocations.- Sara, you mentioned 2009. Back then, crypto was a blip. Let's talk about alternatives in general, and what is the feel-- you also mentioned private credit as well. What is the sentiment around crypto and alternatives in general?SARA NAISON-TARAJANO: Yeah, that's actually a great question, and when you ask me what surprised me most, that might be-- I'll start with crypto, and then we'll talk about alternatives. I would say the crypto response surprised us a little bit. What we found on crypto is that family offices have really made up their mind about crypto. So if you read the report at first glance, in 2021, we only saw 16% of our family offices invested in cryptocurrencies.Today, that number is 26%, so you might see that and say, well, more people are invested in crypto. But actually, if you look at how many people were invested for the future, that went from 45% in 2021 to only 12% today. And what I'd say about crypto is we've got a group of family offices that absolutely understand the space. They're comfortable with the volatility. Many of them have experience as public market investors and can manage that volatility, but I would say less families are engaged in crypto than they were in 2021.The picture for alts-- sorry, just real quick, the picture for alts is a little bit different. Our families are very comfortable with illiquidity, and what I would say about that is when you have family offices with significant pools of capital, they've seen the outperformance of alternatives over cycles versus public assets. They're comfortable with that illiquidity. It allows them to be patient. They definitely take a vintaging approach, where they look to add exposures each year to sort of average into their exposures in alts. And as I said earlier, these family offices have some of the largest allocations that we've seen to alts in investor base, so 44% of their assets in alternatives.- All right, we've got to leave it there, Sara Naison-Tarajano of Goldman Sachs. Thanks so much for joining us.]"

(NYSE:AIG) Stock A Sign That The Market Could be Wrong Given Its Strong Financial Prospects?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weakness-american-international-group-inc-110024972.html,1684234824,STORY,['AIG'],"[American International Group (NYSE:AIG) has had a rough three months with its share price down 15%. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. In this article, we decided to focus on American International Group's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for American International Group How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for American International Group is:14% = US$6.6b ÷ US$46b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.14.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.American International Group's Earnings Growth And 14% ROETo begin with, American International Group seems to have a respectable ROE. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 9.5%. This probably laid the ground for American International Group's significant 57% net income growth seen over the past five years. We believe that there might also be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that American International Group's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 12% in the same period, which is great to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is AIG fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is American International Group Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?American International Group's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 9.7%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 90% of its profits. So it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business and this reflects in its earnings growth number.Additionally, American International Group has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 21% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected increase in the payout ratio explains the expected decline in the company's ROE to 11%, over the same period.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with American International Group's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

96,7ded0008-e31b-3e7a-9c30-c4faf39696a2,AIG,2023-05-16,5 Attractive Value Picks Based on Discounted PEG,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-attractive-value-picks-based-130001748.html,1684155601,STORY,"['NXPI', 'BYD', 'F', 'CAH', 'AIG']","[In a market dealing with external shocks, value investing is fast gaining popularity. The success of value investors like Warren Buffett underscores this. Buffett and his business partner, Charlie Munger, managed to register a 20.1% CAGR for Berkshire Hathaway from 1965 through 2021. This favorably compares with a 10.5% rise of the S&amp;P 500 Index during the same period.Several other stocks, which have surged significantly in the recent past, have shown the overwhelming success of this pure-play investment strategy. Here we discuss five such stocks — Cardinal Health CAH, Boyd Gaming BYD, Ford Motor F, NXP Semiconductors N.V NXPI and American International AIG.More on Value InvestingWhile searching for a suitable investment option, value investors with a varied risk appetite are unlikely to consider price/earnings to growth (PEG) ratio among several other popular metrics like price/earnings (P/E), price/sales (P/S) or price/book value (P/B).This is because they often find this ratio complicated, considering the limitations in calculating a stock's future earnings growth potential. Yardsticks, such as dividend yield, P/E or P/B, are commonly used to single out stocks trading at a discount.However, while not taking into account the growth potential of a stock, these ratios might end up convincing us to invest in stocks that are at a discount just because of their poor show. This might often lead to “value traps” — a situation when these value picks start to underperform over the long run as the temporary problems, which once pulled down the share price, turn out to be persistent.In such a case, even if you buy a stock at less than its fair value, you might still end up paying more. And here comes the importance of this not-so-popular but crucial value investing metric, the PEG ratio.The PEG ratio is defined as (Price/ Earnings)/Earnings Growth RateA low PEG ratio is always better for value investors.Story continuesWhile P/E alone fails to identify a true value stock, PEG helps find the intrinsic value of a stock.There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio. It doesn’t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates, such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth rate, followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate over the long term.Hence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration.Here are some of the screening criteria for a winning strategy:PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP/E Ratio (using F1) less than X Industry Median (for more accurate valuation purpose)Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) (Whether good market conditions or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.)Market Capitalization greater than $1 Billion (This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity.)Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50,000 (A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.)Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than 5% (Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism, suggesting further bullishness.)Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 (Hold) offer the best upside potential.Here are the five out of the 25 stocks that qualified the screening:Cardinal Health: Headquartered in Dublin, OH, Cardinal Health is a nationwide drug distributor and provider of services to pharmacies, healthcare providers and manufacturers. The company has two reporting segments – Pharmaceutical and Medical.Cardinal Health has a long-term expected growth rate of 12.4%.

(NASDAQ:HOLX) received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$87.67 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$77.07. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Hologic's current trading price of US$82.77 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Hologic’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for Hologic What's The Opportunity In Hologic?According to my valuation model, Hologic seems to be fairly priced at around 5.3% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Hologic today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $87.44, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Hologic’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from Hologic?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 22% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Hologic. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in HOLX’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on HOLX, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you'd like to know more about Hologic as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

104,e254a47a-4493-3f6a-95ec-939bfa237a1c,PSX,2023-05-16,7 Dividend Stocks to Buy as Oil Prices Soar in 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-dividend-stocks-buy-oil-002651521.html,1683851211,STORY,"['SOI', 'CAT', 'CVX', 'ENB', 'PSX', 'NOV']","[At first glance, the idea of dividend stocks to buy as oil prices soar seems incredibly contrarian. Although the alliance between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-member oil-producing nations — known as OPEC+ — in early April sparked initial fears because of their surprise production cuts, prices have been relatively muted.Nevertheless, forward-looking investors should keep the best dividend stocks for oil price surges in mind. As CNBC pointed out when interviewing various experts on the matter, demand from India, as well as China’s reopening, may eventually boost prices. To be sure, it’s a contested topic. Nevertheless, crude oil moving higher isn’t a zero-probability event. And to reiterate, the OPEC+ cut implies that the Federal Reserve isn’t the only major influencer of the dollar. It’s not impossible for another production cut to materialize. Therefore, investors should keep the dividend stock winners from the oil price rise list in mind.CATCaterpillar$210.03ENBEnbridge$39.48CVXChevron$156.22PSXPhillips 66$93.40BKRBaker Hughes$27.36SOISolaris Oilfield$7.59NOVNOV.$15.12InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCaterpillar (CAT)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comThough not a direct player in the oil and natural gas industry, mining equipment manufacturer Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) easily ranks within the dividend stock picks for the oil price rally list. Caterpillar provides the equipment and services necessary to keep international drilling and production operations running safely and efficiently. While it’s had a rough start to the year – down nearly 11% – shares appear to be stabilizing recently.Financially, Caterpillar doesn’t offer a remarkable profile. However, its main strength is that it gets the job done reliably and predictably. In particular, it enjoys a trailing-year net margin of 11.53%, ranked above 87.44% of the companies in the heavy construction machinery sector. For passive income, Caterpillar’s forward yield is a relatively modest 2.25%. However, its payout ratio sits at 26.46%, implying confident sustainability. In addition, it commands 30 years of consecutive dividend increases.Story continuesFinally, Wall Street analysts peg CAT as a consensus moderate buy. On average, their price target comes out to $239.62, implying over 12% upside potential.Enbridge (ENB)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comA midstream specialist in the hydrocarbon value chain, Enbridge (NYSE:ENB) is one of the dividend stock opportunities from the oil price boom thanks in part to its massive footprint. Transporting crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids, its network of pipelines crosses 17,809 miles (28,661 kilometers) across North America. Since the beginning of this year, ENB gained nearly 2% of its market value.As with Caterpillar above, Enbridge doesn’t have the most remarkable financial statistics. However, it gets the job done, leveraging a consistently profitable enterprise. Perhaps most notably, Enbridge’s trailing-year operating margin comes in at 16.76%, ranked above 62.67% of the competition.At the moment, Enbridge’s forward yield stands at 6.66%. Although lofty, investors should also realize that it runs a payout ratio of 119%. Therefore, sustainability may be a concern. Still, ENB may attract attention as one of the dividend stocks to buy as oil prices soar thanks to analysts’ support. Wall Street’s experts peg ENB as a buy with a price target of $45.65 implying 15% upside potential.Chevron (CVX)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockStanding as a member of the oil and gas supermajors, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) needs no introduction. However, those who are seeking dividend stocks to buy as oil prices soar may want to target CVX. To be sure, it’s not a distinct idea nor is it particularly exciting. Also, the value of the security fell nearly 10% since the beginning of this year.Nevertheless, Chevron benefits from a balanced profile combining capital return potential, passive income, and solid financials. Regarding the latter, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 18.1%, ranked above 69.07% of its peers. Also, it enjoys a robust balance sheet, with an Altman Z-Score of 4.58 indicating high stability and low bankruptcy risk.On the passive income front, Chevron’s forward yield is 3.84%, which is a bit lower than the energy sector’s average yield of 4.24%. However, the payout ratio sits at a sustainable 41.38%. Lastly, analysts peg CVX as a consensus moderate buy. Overall, their price target lands at $190, implying 21% upside potential.Phillips 66 (PSX)sheet of paper marked ""dividends"" with a $20 bill on top of it to represent dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockA downstream energy specialist, Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) primary claim to fame as a potential target for dividend stocks to buy as oil prices soar comes down to a captive audience. Because of the harsh economics of electric vehicles – namely, that they’re too expensive – gasoline station operators will be relevant for years (if not decades). Therefore, the nearly 7% dip in PSX could be a discounted opportunity.Financially, Phillips 66 brings a balanced profile to the table. Operationally, its three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 14.9%, above 63.55% of sector peers. Also, with shares trading at a trailing multiple of 3.64, PSX might be modestly undervalued.For passive income, Phillips 66 carries a forward yield of 4.46%, just slightly higher than the energy sector’s average yield. Still, it features a low payout ratio of 34.14%, which should boost confidence regarding sustainability. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg PSX as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target hits $126.57, implying over 34% upside potential.Baker Hughes (BKR)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Houston, Texas, Baker Hughes (NASDAQ:BKR) bills itself as an energy technology company. It develops and deploys the most advanced solutions to serve energy and industrial companies to enhance efficiency and reliability. As with the other dividend stocks to buy as oil prices soar, it hasn’t had a great start to the year, losing 3%. Still, it’s a promising enterprise, particularly if we encounter some geopolitical hiccups.To be fair, Baker has been slow on the operational front. In 2020, the company posted revenue of $20.71 billion. It dipped slightly in the following year, posting sales of $20.5 billion. However, in more recent times, Baker has picked up the pace. In the first quarter of 2023, it rang up $5.72 billion, up 18% year-over-year.According to TipRanks, Baker carries a dividend yield of 2.63%. Its payout ratio is on the high side at 71.65%. Still, what’s attractive here is that analysts peg BKR as a consensus strong buy. Overall, their average price target stands at $37.50, implying over 34% upside potential.Solaris Oilfield Infrastructure (SOI)dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockAlso based in Houston, Solaris Oilfield Infrastructure (NYSE:SOI) claims to deliver comprehensive, automated systems to optimize its enterprise-level clients’ safety, efficiency, and execution. Since the beginning of this year, SOI slipped almost 16%, which isn’t the most encouraging sign. However, for those that don’t mind speculating on their dividend stocks to buy as oil prices soar, SOI might intrigue the daring.Financially, Solaris would probably rank middling as best. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate is 8.3%, just a bit better than the oil and gas sector’s median stat of 7.7%. Its net margin is 7.29%, which isn’t bad but not great. As for the passive income, Solaris’ forward yield is 5.62%, above average for the sector. As well, its payout ratio sits at 27%, providing confidence regarding sustainability.Lastly, analysts peg SOI as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $11.83, implying 51% upside potential.NOV (NOV)Glass jar of coins marked ""dividends"" to represent dividend stocks. stocks with dividendsSource: ShutterstockA multinational energy equipment provider, NOV (NYSE:NOV) – formerly known as National Oilwell Varco – serves the oil and gas drilling industry. These services include production operations, oilfield solutions, and supply chain integration initiatives, primarily for upstream (exploration and production) companies. However, NOV represents a risky proposition among dividend stocks to buy as oil prices soar, with shares down 21% year-to-date.Frankly, circumstances don’t get that much better on the financials. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate sits at 6.1% below zero. Plus, with an Altman Z-Score of 1.78, NOV suffers from questionable fiscal stability and a higher-than-normal risk of bankruptcy. Fundamentally, NOV aligns more heavily toward growth potential, with the company carrying a forward yield of only 1.28%. That said, the payout ratio sits at a lowly 12.08%, with management focusing on making sure shareholders can depend on the passive income.On a final note, analysts peg NOV as a consensus moderate buy. On average, their price target stands at $23.86, implying over 52% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 78% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amgen-inc-nasdaq-amgn-largely-110047795.html,1684234847,STORY,['AMGN'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Amgen's stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsThe top 25 shareholders own 49% of the companyUsing data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a companyTo get a sense of who is truly in control of Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 78% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Amgen. View our latest analysis for Amgen ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Amgen?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Amgen already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Amgen's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Amgen. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.1% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 9.0% and 5.6% of the stock.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of AmgenThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Amgen Inc. in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$201m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 22% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company.

You can skip our detailed analysis and jump to 5 Best Places in Florida to Retire On a Budget.2022 witnessed retirement 401(k) balances lose nearly one-quarter of their value, severely impacting retirement plans. Trillions of dollars have been wiped out due to the U.S. stock market rout, and those retiring in these conditions are being hit the hardest. The real question is managing the cost of living expenses in your dream retirement destination and how to recover 401(k) losses incurred in the previous years.Cost of Living in FloridaThe sunshine state of Florida is home to 22 million people. Blessed with a subtropical climate and up to 300 days of sunshine, the state is Americans' number one retirement destination—no wonder the state witnesses its population growing by approximately 1,000 people daily. The state also boasts the highest % of citizens 65 or older at 19.1%. The U.S. Census Bureau has estimated that by the year 2030, 32.5% of the population in Florida will be 60 years or older.With regard to retirement, the president of the Sarasota/Manatee Realtors Association, Brian Tresidder, firmly believes that the pandemic has accelerated people's retirement plans. Moreover, since Florida is a peninsula with limited development sites available, the influx of new residents has been exerting pressure on the real estate market.320,000 Americans relocated to the state in 2022 alone. Housing prices have significantly risen as a result, with the median single-family home price standing at $405K with a 2% year-on-year gain. Available inventory, or the number of homes available for sale, remains comparatively low at 2.7 months’ supply. Together, these trends imply that homes that are correctly priced, sell off as soon as they hit the market. Typical home values have been growing by 11.1% as of 2023, with the median sale-to-list ratio standing at 0.997.Story continuesIf retirement costs $1,120,408 on average in the United States, it costs retirees an estimated $1,184,110 to retire in Florida. While a high cost of living drives these costs, another reason for the higher-than-average numbers is the increased average life expectancy in the state. According to data, the average life expectancy for Floridians over the age of 65 is 19.2 years.Slight declines in these figures have also been recorded due to pandemic-related deaths and drug overdoses. The Missouri Economic Research and Information Centre (MERIC) notes that the cost of living index for Florida stands at 102.8. This means that, on average, the cost of living in the state is 2.8% higher than in the rest of the nation. Moreover, food, groceries, and utilities in the state cost higher than average.The U.S. Census Bureau notes that the median monthly cost for a mortgage is $1,168.00, while the median monthly cost for rent is $1,301. Federal taxes are between 12-24% on average. However, the state does not tax social security income. Meanwhile, costs for Medicare start at $164.90 per month. While the cost of living in the state is a little higher than average, Florida offers great weather, good livability, high quality of life, and decent healthcare for retirees to live in the state.Recovering 401(k) lossesFidelity Investments reports that average 401(k) balances have plummeted by 23% to $103,900. Average retirement balances sank by 20% to $112,572, while there was an increase in the number of hardship withdrawals. Moreover, since nearly three-quarters of all retirement money is held in the form of stocks, Americans are heavily impacted by stock market volatility. S&amp;P was down by 19.4% in 2022, Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 8.8%, and the Nasdaq Composite was down by 33.3%.These figures help explain why 48% of Americans have started to believe that they will outlive their retirement savings. It is also one of the reasons why the number of older adults working has been growing rapidly. As of 2021, the workforce participation rate stood at 25.8% among adults aged 65 to 74. Moreover, the share of workers aged 70 and over is expected to reach 11.1% from 8.6%.Another strategy being used by prospective retirees is adding quality investments during market dips. Of course, this is a strategy that can only be adopted by those who have the time and money. It helps to increase the contribution percentage to 401(k)s. Currently, the average (401) k contribution rate stands at 13.7%, while the recommended rate is 15%.Employees who are yet to retire must benefit from the retirement plans being offered by their company, such as those by ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN). Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) provides comprehensive retirement plans with an upfront contribution of 5% regardless of contributions initiated by employees. On the other hand, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) provides several retirement products to their employees as well. As such, both ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and Amgen Inc (NASDAQ:AMGN) play an important role in the provision of retirement plans to employees.13 Best Places in Florida to Retire On a BudgetMethodologyIn order to compile a list of the 13 best places in Florida to retire on a budget, we take a look at six (1,2,3,4,5,6) sources.

This is the latest in the wave of deals in the sector as global miners seek to boost their exposure to metals like copper and gold. If completed, the acquisition would be the largest-ever gold-mining deal.The deal came on the back of weeks of talks over a sweetened offer by the U.S. company. Newcrest initially rejected a $19-billion offer from Newmont in February. The American gold giant subsequently raised its offer to nearly A$29.4 billion in April, including debt (read: Why Investors Are Flocking to Gold ETFs).This put the spotlight on gold mining ETFs, which could be the best way for investors to tap the opportunity arising from the proposed deal. Investors should keep a close eye on the movement of these ETFs — iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners ETF RING, Market Vectors Gold Mining ETF GDX, Sprott Gold Miners ETF SGDM, SPDR S&amp;P North American Natural Resources ETF NANR and SPDR S&amp;P Metals &amp; Mining ETF XME — over the coming weeks.Deal in FocusPer the terms of the deal, Newcrest shareholders will receive 0.400 Newmont shares for each Newcrest share and a special dividend of up to $1.10 per share paid by Newcrest, representing a 30.4% premium to where NCM shares were trading in early February before Newmont’s interest was known.Should the transaction be complete, Newmont would become the largest gold and copper producer by market capitalization in the United States. The acquisition will strengthen Denver-based Newmont’s operations in Australia, Canada and Papua New Guinea and potentially create a ripple effect in the industry as smaller mines owned by the combined business are shed. Newmont would have combined annual copper production of approximately 350 million pounds from Australia and Canada.The takeover is subject to a shareholder vote, scheduled to be held in September or October, and will also require approval from the Foreign Investment Review Board and regulators in Canada and PNG. Newmont is expected to deliver $500 million in annual synergies and to generate an estimated $2 billion in cash flow as a result of the takeover.The combined company will maintain a listing on the ASX, while Newcrest investors will have the choice of receiving New York Stock Exchange-listed shares or Australian-listed CDIs as payment.Story continuesETFs in FocusLet’s delve into each ETF below:iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners ETF (RING)iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners ETF offers exposure to companies that derive the majority of their revenues from gold mining.

Newmont Mining has security $19.2 billion deal to acquire its Australian rival, Newcrest Mining. That deal is pending regulatory approval. But it does mark the largest deal ever in the gold mining sector. This is something that's been talked about now for a little bit here. It was public that Newmont was pursuing Newcrest here. And the initial proposal was made back on February 5.So this is about a 30% premium at this deal price to where it was trading right before that deal was first proposed. In addition to beefing up the gold mining capability for Newmont, this also increases its exposure to copper. Newmont's, the real bulk of its revenue does come from gold, about in the 80% to 90% range. Whereas Newcrest also is very reliant on gold but has a little bit more of a copper operation, too.- Yeah, and within the need or the push for more copper, you think about the areas within even the Inflation Reduction Act that had carved out space for electric vehicles to really get even more of a credit and/or not just credits, but even more of the build out and where copper comes into play for so many of those batteries as well. But then also, you think about the prices that we had seen in gold. Gold is still, if I remember correctly, hovering, or near the ballpark of some of those record highs, too. So all of this taking place as you're taking a look at gold futures right now sitting above $2,000 at this point- Wow. Yeah.]"

Although the alliance between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-member oil-producing nations — known as OPEC+ — in early April sparked initial fears because of their surprise production cuts, prices have been relatively muted.Nevertheless, forward-looking investors should keep the best dividend stocks for oil price surges in mind. As CNBC pointed out when interviewing various experts on the matter, demand from India, as well as China’s reopening, may eventually boost prices. To be sure, it’s a contested topic. Nevertheless, crude oil moving higher isn’t a zero-probability event. And to reiterate, the OPEC+ cut implies that the Federal Reserve isn’t the only major influencer of the dollar. It’s not impossible for another production cut to materialize. Therefore, investors should keep the dividend stock winners from the oil price rise list in mind.CATCaterpillar$210.03ENBEnbridge$39.48CVXChevron$156.22PSXPhillips 66$93.40BKRBaker Hughes$27.36SOISolaris Oilfield$7.59NOVNOV.$15.12InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCaterpillar (CAT)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comThough not a direct player in the oil and natural gas industry, mining equipment manufacturer Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) easily ranks within the dividend stock picks for the oil price rally list. Caterpillar provides the equipment and services necessary to keep international drilling and production operations running safely and efficiently. While it’s had a rough start to the year – down nearly 11% – shares appear to be stabilizing recently.Financially, Caterpillar doesn’t offer a remarkable profile. However, its main strength is that it gets the job done reliably and predictably. In particular, it enjoys a trailing-year net margin of 11.53%, ranked above 87.44% of the companies in the heavy construction machinery sector. For passive income, Caterpillar’s forward yield is a relatively modest 2.25%. However, its payout ratio sits at 26.46%, implying confident sustainability. In addition, it commands 30 years of consecutive dividend increases.Story continuesFinally, Wall Street analysts peg CAT as a consensus moderate buy. On average, their price target comes out to $239.62, implying over 12% upside potential.Enbridge (ENB)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comA midstream specialist in the hydrocarbon value chain, Enbridge (NYSE:ENB) is one of the dividend stock opportunities from the oil price boom thanks in part to its massive footprint. Transporting crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids, its network of pipelines crosses 17,809 miles (28,661 kilometers) across North America. Since the beginning of this year, ENB gained nearly 2% of its market value.As with Caterpillar above, Enbridge doesn’t have the most remarkable financial statistics. However, it gets the job done, leveraging a consistently profitable enterprise. Perhaps most notably, Enbridge’s trailing-year operating margin comes in at 16.76%, ranked above 62.67% of the competition.At the moment, Enbridge’s forward yield stands at 6.66%. Although lofty, investors should also realize that it runs a payout ratio of 119%. Therefore, sustainability may be a concern. Still, ENB may attract attention as one of the dividend stocks to buy as oil prices soar thanks to analysts’ support. Wall Street’s experts peg ENB as a buy with a price target of $45.65 implying 15% upside potential.Chevron (CVX)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockStanding as a member of the oil and gas supermajors, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) needs no introduction. However, those who are seeking dividend stocks to buy as oil prices soar may want to target CVX. To be sure, it’s not a distinct idea nor is it particularly exciting. Also, the value of the security fell nearly 10% since the beginning of this year.Nevertheless, Chevron benefits from a balanced profile combining capital return potential, passive income, and solid financials. Regarding the latter, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 18.1%, ranked above 69.07% of its peers. Also, it enjoys a robust balance sheet, with an Altman Z-Score of 4.58 indicating high stability and low bankruptcy risk.On the passive income front, Chevron’s forward yield is 3.84%, which is a bit lower than the energy sector’s average yield of 4.24%. However, the payout ratio sits at a sustainable 41.38%. Lastly, analysts peg CVX as a consensus moderate buy. Overall, their price target lands at $190, implying 21% upside potential.Phillips 66 (PSX)sheet of paper marked ""dividends"" with a $20 bill on top of it to represent dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockA downstream energy specialist, Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) primary claim to fame as a potential target for dividend stocks to buy as oil prices soar comes down to a captive audience. Because of the harsh economics of electric vehicles – namely, that they’re too expensive – gasoline station operators will be relevant for years (if not decades). Therefore, the nearly 7% dip in PSX could be a discounted opportunity.Financially, Phillips 66 brings a balanced profile to the table. Operationally, its three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 14.9%, above 63.55% of sector peers. Also, with shares trading at a trailing multiple of 3.64, PSX might be modestly undervalued.For passive income, Phillips 66 carries a forward yield of 4.46%, just slightly higher than the energy sector’s average yield. Still, it features a low payout ratio of 34.14%, which should boost confidence regarding sustainability. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg PSX as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target hits $126.57, implying over 34% upside potential.Baker Hughes (BKR)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Houston, Texas, Baker Hughes (NASDAQ:BKR) bills itself as an energy technology company. It develops and deploys the most advanced solutions to serve energy and industrial companies to enhance efficiency and reliability. As with the other dividend stocks to buy as oil prices soar, it hasn’t had a great start to the year, losing 3%. Still, it’s a promising enterprise, particularly if we encounter some geopolitical hiccups.To be fair, Baker has been slow on the operational front. In 2020, the company posted revenue of $20.71 billion. It dipped slightly in the following year, posting sales of $20.5 billion. However, in more recent times, Baker has picked up the pace. In the first quarter of 2023, it rang up $5.72 billion, up 18% year-over-year.According to TipRanks, Baker carries a dividend yield of 2.63%. Its payout ratio is on the high side at 71.65%. Still, what’s attractive here is that analysts peg BKR as a consensus strong buy. Overall, their average price target stands at $37.50, implying over 34% upside potential.Solaris Oilfield Infrastructure (SOI)dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockAlso based in Houston, Solaris Oilfield Infrastructure (NYSE:SOI) claims to deliver comprehensive, automated systems to optimize its enterprise-level clients’ safety, efficiency, and execution. Since the beginning of this year, SOI slipped almost 16%, which isn’t the most encouraging sign. However, for those that don’t mind speculating on their dividend stocks to buy as oil prices soar, SOI might intrigue the daring.Financially, Solaris would probably rank middling as best. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate is 8.3%, just a bit better than the oil and gas sector’s median stat of 7.7%. Its net margin is 7.29%, which isn’t bad but not great. As for the passive income, Solaris’ forward yield is 5.62%, above average for the sector. As well, its payout ratio sits at 27%, providing confidence regarding sustainability.Lastly, analysts peg SOI as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $11.83, implying 51% upside potential.NOV (NOV)Glass jar of coins marked ""dividends"" to represent dividend stocks. stocks with dividendsSource: ShutterstockA multinational energy equipment provider, NOV (NYSE:NOV) – formerly known as National Oilwell Varco – serves the oil and gas drilling industry. These services include production operations, oilfield solutions, and supply chain integration initiatives, primarily for upstream (exploration and production) companies. However, NOV represents a risky proposition among dividend stocks to buy as oil prices soar, with shares down 21% year-to-date.Frankly, circumstances don’t get that much better on the financials. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate sits at 6.1% below zero. Plus, with an Altman Z-Score of 1.78, NOV suffers from questionable fiscal stability and a higher-than-normal risk of bankruptcy. Fundamentally, NOV aligns more heavily toward growth potential, with the company carrying a forward yield of only 1.28%. That said, the payout ratio sits at a lowly 12.08%, with management focusing on making sure shareholders can depend on the passive income.On a final note, analysts peg NOV as a consensus moderate buy. On average, their price target stands at $23.86, implying over 52% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

WY.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Top Stock Reports for Microsoft, BP and ZoetisThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Microsoft Corp., BP p.l.c and Zoetis Inc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Microsoft shares largely tracked the Zacks Tech sector this year, but the stock hasn't looked back since the very strong Q1 earnings release on April 25th. As a result, Microsoft shares are now up +28.4% this year vs. +22% for the Zacks Tech sector and the +8.6% gain for the S&amp;P 500 index.The company is benefiting from strong Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes revenues. Intelligent Cloud revenues were driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. Productivity and Business Processes revenues increased due to strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions. Microsoft is also seen as having a better offering on the artificial intelligence (AI) front than rival Alphabet. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as gain in revenue per user drove top-line growth. However, More Personal Computing revenues decreased due to weak Windows and Devices businesses.Steady performance in Talent Solutions aided LinkedIn revenues. However, declining gaming revenues has been a headwind. Increasing spend on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space remains a concern.(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of BP have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (+24.4% vs. +10.2%). The company has a strong portfolio of upstream projects, backing impressive production growth. The company boasted that the target of adding a net production of 900 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2021 from key projects was met successfully.Story continuesBP expects $2-$3 billion of divestment and other proceeds in 2023. Before reporting its June-quarter results, the integrated energy major is willing to complete an additional $1.75 billion in share buy-backs. Also, BP reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings resulting from an increase in oil-equivalent production volumes.However, the energy giant's balance sheet is considerably more levered than most peers, limiting its financial flexibility. Also, increasing exploration expenses have been affecting the company's income. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on BP here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Zoetis shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Drugs industry over the past year (+12.9% vs. -1.8%). The company's innovative portfolio of pet care parasiticides, including Simparica Trio and key dermatology products maintain momentum for the company.The strong uptake of Librela and Solensia in Europe, its new monoclonal antibody therapies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats, is encouraging. The launch of innovative products bolstered the portfolio and should fuel growth.However, Zoetis had earlier faced supply challenges which impacted demand. Although the constraints have eased out, a similar situation will impact growth.

And certainly, investors are on edge as they do await for President Biden's expected meeting with congressional leaders tomorrow. Now, markets are coming off two straight weeks of declines. But Diane, like Keith Lerner did just tell us earlier in the program, he does think a deal could be a catalyst here for stocks to break out of that tight trading range and to the upside. The number that he was looking at was 4,200, which has actually been a resistance level.DIANA KING HALL: Yeah, it has been a resistance level. And it will likely continue to be a resistance level, especially when you have this debt ceiling overhang. And he juxtaposed it with what we saw historically. We went through this before in 2011 and the challenges that caused for the market and the US credit rating, if you will.So hopefully we don't get to that level. There's been a lot of political maneuvering and brinksmanship with regard to the debt ceiling. So that is certainly something that could help the market break out, honestly, one way or the other, what happens. So that's certainly something that we've seen that's putting some pressure on the market or, again, to your point, keeping us in a narrow range.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, it's been keeping us in a narrow range. I think everyone's just trying to figure out what exactly the next couple of weeks look like. Up until now, investors have largely been brushing off the fact that we don't have a deal done in Washington. That certainly has not been priced into the market yet.DIANA KING HALL: Right.SEANA SMITH: If we don't get a deal soon, certainly a number of research analysts have come out over the last week or so saying, as we get closer and closer to that X date, this is no surprise. Markets will start to react to the risk of a default. So we could certainly see volatility enter the action, re-enter the action if we don't get a deal soon.Story continuesDIANA KING HALL: Indeed. And we're seeing shares of NRG closing the day higher. And this is on news it is facing activist pressure. We talked about this a little earlier today. Elliott Management disclosing a position in the power company for the second time in six years. Now, Elliott wants a boardroom overhaul and a strategic overhaul. So this point that we talked about with regard to some activist investor action, we talked about Shake Shack as well within that context.SEANA SMITH: Yeah Shake Shack's within the mix here. When it comes to NRG Energy and what we're seeing there, we know that when Eliott management enters the room-- this is what we have been told from numerous guests in the past. Everyone straightens up and listens to what they have to say. So NRG Energy closing up just about 3% today.In terms of the activist investor activity over the last 12, 14 months and even looking at what we've seen so far this year, it has certainly been off to a strong start. More and more activist investors are targeting companies because of their underperformance, because of their cheaper valuations. And it's not just some of these smaller companies.You're looking at NRG Energy. And then you also have Disney, Salesforce, some of the activist campaigns that they have faced over the last several months here. But when you take a look at the numbers, Q1 activist campaigns, 36% were initiated at companies that had also been targeted by other activists in recent periods. So certainly just points to the fact that they're under a tremendous amount of pressure from a number of investors.DIANA KING HALL: Indeed, yeah. And Elliott saying they didn't like a move that NRG made for agreeing to buy a home tech company. That's Vivint Smart Home. They didn't like that move.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, a lot of times they tried to shake up the board. It's just one of the things that Elliott is pushing for here.All right, let's take a look at Crocs because shares jumping on a note from Baird, calling the stock a fresh pick for 2023 and also saying that the company can meet or exceed guidance this year. We know that Crocs has been a name here in focus over the last several months. It did get some momentum here.Certainly during the pandemic, it was a pandemic favorite. You're looking at gains of just about 2 and 1/2 percent. Baird thinks a lot of people are going to be heading out to the stores and buying some Crocs soon.DIANA KING HALL: I guess so. I mean, but they needed this win. I guess to them, a win is a win because recently they faced some pressure. They were a pandemic darling. But then they saw issues with regard to Hey Dude. The sales weren't as strong as expected there.But the stock has not been in favor as much. I mean, in terms of the Wall Street popularity contest, it lost some of its luster. So you're looking at that downward trend that they had. And it's kind of starting to come to a lateral move. So they definitely needed this win today.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, they did. And you're looking at losses of almost 6% here over the last three months, Diane.DIANA KING HALL: Indeed.]"

(""Elliott""), which manages funds that have an investment of approximately $1 billion representing a more than 13% economic interest in NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NRG) (""NRG"" or the ""Company""), today sent a letter to the Board of Directors of NRG. According to the letter, the purpose of the materials is to present a clear path forward for how best to remedy NRG's meaningful underperformance and create significant and sustainable value.Elliot logo (PRNewsfoto/Elliott Advisors (UK) Limited)Elliott previously disclosed a large investment in NRG in 2017, and its engagement with the Company catalyzed the highly successful Transformation Plan and resulted in NRG becoming the best-performing stock in the S&amp;P 500 in that year, Elliott wrote. In its letter, Elliott said that since the conclusion of its prior engagement with NRG, the Company has meaningfully underperformed due to a number of operational and strategic missteps. Among the missteps, Elliott wrote, is the Company's recent acquisition of Vivint, which, measured by the one-week market reaction following its announcement, was the single worst deal in the power and utilities sector in the past decade.In its letter, Elliott outlined the necessary steps for the Company to take to right the course in the following three areas:Leadership: Add new independent directors with strong power and energy industry expertise to refresh the Board and help guide the necessary changesOperations: Improve operations and reliability. Achieve at least $500 million of recurring, EBITDA-accretive cost reductionsStrategy and Capital Allocation: Conduct a strategic review of its home services strategy, including Vivint. In conjunction, establish a new capital allocation framework to return to shareholders at least 80% of free cash flow, with growth investments focused on its generation and retail businessesStory continuesElliott believes that successful execution of this plan could create over $5 billion of shareholder value, driving the Company's stock price to reach or exceed $55 per share, the letter said. Elliott looks forward to meeting with the Board in the near term to work constructively with the Company toward the implementation of a new value creation plan.The full letter and presentation can be downloaded at RepowerNRG.com.The full text of the letter follows:May 15, 2023The Board of DirectorsNRG Energy, Inc.910 Louisiana StreetHouston, TX 77002Attn: Dr. Lawrence Coben (Chairman of the Board)Dear Dr. Coben and Members of the Board,We write on behalf of Elliott Associates, L.P. and Elliott International, L.P. (together, with its affiliates, ""Elliott"" or ""we""), which have an investment of approximately $1.0 billion representing a more than 13% economic interest in NRG Energy, Inc. (the ""Company"" or ""NRG"").As you know, this is not the first time that Elliott has made a large investment in NRG. In 2017, we disclosed a large ownership stake and approached NRG's management team and Board with a plan to address the Company's share price underperformance. The opportunity we saw at the time was both significant and unique: We made the case that through a combination of operational improvements and portfolio actions, NRG could rapidly improve its competitive position and create a significant amount of shareholder value.The Board was receptive to our case, and we worked constructively with the Company to develop the highly successful Transformation Plan, a roadmap for NRG to become an efficient and focused integrated power company. At the conclusion of our engagement, we believed that with continued adherence to the principles of the Transformation Plan, NRG was well-positioned to drive sustained long-term value creation for shareholders. As proof that investors believed that the Company was on the right course, in 2017 NRG was the best-performing company in the S&amp;P 500.Unfortunately, despite this initial progress and shareholder enthusiasm, NRG has sharply pivoted away from the parameters of the Transformation Plan and now resembles the unfocused company that we first encountered six years ago. Since the conclusion of our involvement, NRG has suffered operational setbacks, missed financial guidance, and – with the recent acquisition of Vivint, a home security business with stark operational differences to NRG's core power businesses – regressed to the same unfocused, overleveraged business model that predated our initial involvement.The purpose of today's letter and the accompanying presentation is to present a clear path forward for how best to remedy NRG's underperformance, building on the same framework of cost excellence and portfolio simplification that we advocated during our initial investment in the Company. We hope the Board will consider these views, which we are making public today in the spirit of fostering a transparent and robust discussion. We look forward to meeting in the near term to work constructively with the Company toward the implementation of a new value creation plan.The 2017 Transformation PlanWhen we first invested in NRG, we saw a company with enormous potential for value creation. The Company had an attractive collection of generation and retail assets but, due to operational weaknesses and an unfocused portfolio, had significantly underperformed and cumulatively lagged the S&amp;P over a 10-year timeframe by 140%. We believed that the Company had lost its focus as it expanded beyond its core merchant power and retail electricity businesses, resulting in an uncompetitive cost structure, overleveraged balance sheet and excessively complex asset portfolio.At the time, we recommended that NRG focus on its core businesses by aggressively reducing costs, monetizing non-core assets to simplify its portfolio and paying down debt. We worked closely with NRG as it conducted an intensive, four-month business review that culminated in the Transformation Plan. The new plan reinvigorated NRG by targeting clear, ""line-of-sight"" initiatives, including $1.065 billion of total cost and margin improvement, $2.5 billion to $4.0 billion of asset divestitures and $13 billion of debt reduction. During Elliott's engagement, NRG achieved a 156% total shareholder return (""TSR"").1Importantly, the growing support for NRG as a public investment reflected a belief that the Company had made a renewed commitment to operational excellence and portfolio focus that would be maintained over the long term. Unfortunately, that belief was misplaced and has not been rewarded.NRG Has Since Meaningfully UnderperformedSince the conclusion of our engagement, NRG has reversed much of the progress made under the Transformation Plan. The Company has underperformed the S&amp;P Utilities Index by 44% and integrated power peers by 53%2, and NRG's share price today is lower than it was at the conclusion of our engagement3. This is not dissimilar to NRG's performance before our involvement – in the two years prior, NRG stock declined by 46%. In fact, in the past ten years, the only period of sustained outperformance was during Elliott's engagement with the Company in 2017-2018. We believe that the underperformance prior to and subsequent to our involvement reflects repeated missteps in execution and strategy in the absence of a true and enduring commitment to operational excellence and portfolio focus.Operational FailuresIn 2021 and 2022, NRG missed two years of financial guidance after struggling with repeated plant outages (including at both of its key Limestone and Parish power plants) and demonstrating an inability to manage through extreme weather events. This record of poor execution stands in contrast to strong earnings achieved by peers in 2022. Consistent execution and plant reliability are particularly important to the success of NRG's asset-light retail strategy, but operational missteps have eroded investor confidence in management.Loss of Strategic DirectionAdditionally, NRG lost strategic direction with its poorly conceived, ""all-in"" pivot to the home security business founded on the acquisition of Vivint. We and other investors struggle to understand why NRG would make such a significant bet on a strategy that many other companies have already failed to execute successfully, especially given the Company's previous lack of success in entering home services. The market's reaction to the Vivint transaction – a 20% decline in NRG's market capitalization over the first week, or nearly $2 billion in value loss – was both predictable and justifiable. As measured by the share price reaction following its announcement, the Vivint transaction ranks as the single worst deal in the power and utilities sector during the past decade.4 The transaction continues to draw near-universal skepticism among investors and sell-side analysts.The Repower NRG PlanNotwithstanding these setbacks, we have strong conviction in the attractiveness of NRG's integrated power business and the critical role that the Company plays in Texas and other energy markets in the Northeast and Midwest. The Company's retail franchise is a crown jewel that has remained a market leader in Texas for more than 20 years, navigating a rapidly evolving industry backdrop. We believe that with the right leadership and strategy, NRG can correct its course and create significant and sustainable value. The necessary steps are familiar, and include elements that NRG undertook following Elliott's engagement with the Company in 2017:Leadership. First, NRG must restore the credibility of the management team and the Board. We believe that the Company should add new independent directors with expertise in the power and energy industry. Elliott has identified five highly credible executives to help guide the necessary operational and strategic changes. The Board should also evaluate the management team's ability to drive high-performance operations on a sustained basis.Operations. We believe that NRG is capable of achieving at least $500 million of recurring, EBITDA-accretive cost reductions by 2025. Additionally, we believe NRG has headroom to realize these cost savings while sustaining elevated maintenance capex to improve its fleet reliability and mitigate outage risk.Strategy and Capital Allocation. As evidenced by the strong outperformance by NRG in 2017 and 2018, we are convinced that an optimized NRG focused on its core integrated power business can drive compelling shareholder returns. For this reason, NRG must conduct a strategic review of its home services strategy, including Vivint. In conjunction, NRG should establish a new capital allocation framework to return to shareholders at least 80% of free cash flow, with any growth investments focused on its generation and retail businesses. By implementing the Repower NRG Plan, the Company would have the ability to return $6.5 billion of excess capital, or approximately 85% of NRG's current market cap, to shareholders over the next three years.Successful execution of the Repower NRG Plan could create over $5 billion of shareholder value, driving the Company's stock price to reach or exceed $55 per share. We believe the execution of these initiatives is squarely within the Company's control and can be carried out in the next 18 months.Given NRG's failure to sustain the momentum of the Transformation Plan, strong management will be key to the success of the Repower NRG Plan. The Board must ensure that the management team has the appropriate skillset and expertise to carry out the necessary changes as well as maintain long-term cost leadership and strategic focus. The Repower NRG Plan is predicated on enduring cost discipline and high-performance operations; an operationally focused management team, along with improved governance and oversight, is critical to winning back the confidence of investors and setting the Company on the path to long-term success.Moving ForwardWe have strong conviction in the attractiveness of NRG's assets and believe that the Company can become the leading integrated power company in North America. However, the Company's strategic decisions, execution and stock price underperformance make clear that significant changes are needed to Repower NRG and restore the level of strategic focus and investor trust that drove the Company's outperformance six years ago.We look forward to discussing our recommendations with you. We believe that the addition of new highly credentialed board members and the establishment of a formal Board-level committee and review process (much like the 2017 Business Review Committee) are the logical next steps for NRG. Our goal is to engage with the Company constructively and align with the Board on the path forward as soon as practicable. We thank you again for your consideration, and we will make ourselves available promptly to meet in person and begin working together on next steps.Sincerely,          John PikePartnerBobby XuPortfolio ManagerAbout ElliottElliott Investment Management L.P. manages approximately $55.2 billion of assets as of December 31, 2022.

The Oracle of Omaha sold a large portion of Berkshire’s holdings in US banks between 2020 and 2022, some just months before the banking system upheaval that began in mid March.The 92-year-old investor has over the decades played the role of rescuer to a number of institutions, including in the 2008 financial crisis. He has yet to emerge as a white knight for any banks in trouble during this current crisis, at least in any way that has thus far been made public.Buffett made it clear at Berkshire's annual shareholders meeting earlier this month that he is still ""cautious"" about holding many bank stocks. One exception he cited was Bank of America, which remains one of Berkshire’s largest holdings.Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffett at a 2019 shareholders meeting. REUTERS/Scott MorganIn the first quarter, according to filings, Berkshire maintained its Bank of America holdings. The stake lost $4 billion in value through the quarter.""I like Bank of America and I like the management,"" Buffett said at the shareholder gathering in Omaha, Nebraska.Buffett has a long history with Bank of America. He injected $5 billion into the Charlotte, N.C.-based bank in 2011. At the time Brian Moynihan was still a relatively new chief executive and the lender's shares were under severe pressure due to losses from subprime loans.Buffett did invest more deeply into several other financial stocks in the quarter. Berkshire added $954 million of Capital One (COF) and raised its holding in Ally Financial (ALLY) by $10.6 million. The conglomerate also sold $1.1 million of Jefferies Financial Group (JEF) and didn't touch its stake in Citigroup (C).Story continuesUS Bancorp, BNY Mellon and Jefferies were down in early after hours trading while Bank of America, Citi, Capital One and Ally were up.Berkshire Hathaway was far from the only high profile investment manager selling bank shares last quarter.Bridgewater Associates, the world's biggest hedge fund, sold about $180 million in bank stocks.That included more than 80% of its holdings in Bank of New York Mellon and US Bancorp. Bridgewater also zeroed out positions in 15 other US lenders, including Bank of America (BAC), Western Alliance, Zions (ZION), PacWest (PACW) and New York Community Bank (NYCB).Correction (5/16): an earlier version of the article said Berkshire Hathaway raised its Bank of America holdings in the first quarter.

Renewable natural gas is methane-rich biogas emitted from sources such as animal manure, landfills and sewage that has been captured and processed to produce pipeline-quality natural gas.Production of US renewable natural gas has grown steadily since its inclusion in the federal Renewable Fuel Standard and interest in RNG will continue to expand as companies seek to reduce their carbon footprint. According to S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights' Planning Scenario forecasts, renewable natural gas supply will grow threefold to 2030, and as much as fivefold, according to its more ambitious Fast Transition outlook to 2050.California is the first state in the US to adopt a renewable gas standard and is a key consumer of renewable natural gas. The California transportation fuels market historically has been considered the market of choice for RNG sellers across North America, with the stacked combination of the state's Low Carbon Fuel Standard and federal Renewable Fuel Standard credits providing a ""price to beat"" for other buyers.Platts has launched two RNG price assessments:  One that reflects California transport fuels market incentives where the transacted gas is consumed within California, and another that reflects RNG supplied to consumers outside of California and thus does not include those additional state-level incentives. The new Platts price assessments reflect the premium that pipeline quality RNG receives over pipeline-quality fossil natural gas, delivered on a spot basis in North America, with a pathway that has a carbon intensity (CI) of 45 *: Story continuesPlatts North America RNG (California) -- assessment reflects the price premium for renewable natural gas sold into and purchased in CaliforniaPlatts North America RNG Premium (Excl. California) – assessment reflects the price premium for renewable natural gas sold and purchased outside of CaliforniaUS RNG transportation fuel productionAlan Hayes, Head of Energy Transition Pricing, S&amp;P Commodity Insights, said: ""We believe our new Platts RNG assessments bring much needed price transparency to this nascent and growing market, and we see the demand for renewable natural gas pricing information continuing to grow, as RNG becomes ever more important as a component of the energy transition.""Platts will also publish the North America renewable natural gas carbon intensity value per point, which represents the change in value of the North America RNG Premium based on a one-point decrease in the carbon intensity of the production pathway.Mark Callahan, Director Americas Natural Gas Pricing, S&amp;P Commodity Insights, said: ""Renewable natural gas is one of the solutions market participants have to reduce methane emissions and carbon intensity. Having this new price information will allow companies to better value their RNG portfolios on a daily basis regardless of production pathway or location.""The assessments may be found in S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights products and services, including: Platts Gas Daily, Americas Natural Gas Alert pages, Platts Dimensions Pro, and in the Platts price database.*The CI of 45 was chosen to reflect a typical CI for landfill-derived RNG, the most commonly available type of RNG currently on the market Media Contacts: Americas: Kathleen Tanzy + 1 917-331-4607, kathleen.tanzy@spglobal.com EMEA: Paul Sandell + 44 (0)7816 180039, paul.sandell@spglobal.com Asia and India: Melissa Tan + 65-6597-6241, melissa.tan@spglobal.com About S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights At S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, our complete view of global energy and commodities markets enables our customers to make decisions with conviction and create long-term, sustainable value.We're a trusted connector that brings together thought leaders, market participants, governments, and regulators and we create solutions that lead to progress.

This marks the first-ever comprehensive offering of base rates incorporating alternative fuel pricing and it complements Platts' pre-existing, well-established suite of voyage and time-charter tanker freight assessments.S&amp;P Global Inc. logoPlatts Base Rates can be applied to calculate tanker freight rates based on ""Points"" and dollars per ton, as well as various product netback and net forward assessments, along with crude oil yield and netback prices.Peter Norfolk, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights Editorial Director of Global Shipping &amp; Freight, said, ""This launch is historic for Platts and the industry, with a new and unique tanker freight scale being introduced for the first time in decades. In addition, we offer market participants Platts Base Rates that are calculated using alternative bunker fuels. With both yearly and dynamic options, Platts Base Rates aim to help the shipping industry navigate the energy transition with heightened price transparency.""With sustainability and energy transition a growing focus globally, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights expects the maritime sector's use of alternative fuels including LNG to grow significantly in the next few years, with Platts Base Rates enhancing supply chain insights and shedding light on pricing for the future fuel mix.Platts Base Rates are largely future proofed for use in tanker freight assessments and can easily replicate standard rates based on alternative bunker fuels such as LNG, Methanol and Ammonia. Platts will publish yearly Base Rates along with dynamic Base Rates - published daily using daily Singapore and Rotterdam bunker price assessments.Story continuesThe calculation of the Base Rate has one established assumption, which is to list all the possible costs for the entire voyage and divide it by the deadweight tonnage of the standard vessel to arrive at the $/MT Base Rate, which equates to 100 points on the scale. Given market evolution and the tanker sector's growing preference for larger-size vessels, the Platts Base Rates are calculated on the basis of a larger tanker size of 105,000 deadweight (dwt).For additional information on shipping price assessments, contact shipping@spgobal.com.

Reports of stockpiling items due to price or supply fears are now running below historic norms, indicating that firms' concerns toward inflation and supplier delivery times have alleviated.Commenting on the April data, Volker Roelofsen, vice president, supply chain consulting, GEP, said: ""After months of companies aggressively destocking, there is now excess capacity in the world's supply chains, providing buyers with greater leverage to extract favourable prices and terms for the second half of 2023 and into 2024. The good news is that companies' demand for components and raw materials, while subdued, is holding steady, indicating that central banks are, at least for now, successfully engineering a measured slowdown.""Story continuesThe key findings from April's data:DEMAND: Global demand for raw materials, commodities and components continues to be subdued, especially in Europe. In North America, the trend is improving despite high interest rates.INVENTORIES: Inventories fall as companies continue to address overstocked warehouses. Reports of safety stockpiling are below their historic average for the first time since the start of the pandemic in 2020.MATERIAL SHORTAGES: Business reports of item shortages are at their lowest since September 2020. Shortages were particularly low for metals and chemicals, although poor availability is still ongoing for semiconductors and electrical items.LABOR SHORTAGES: As has been the case since the start of 2023, labor shortages are having little adverse effect on suppliers, indicating current staffing is adequate to cope with demand.TRANSPORTATION: Global transportation costs remain stable and anchored around historically normal levels, reflecting efficiently operating supply chains as pressures on freight have subsided.REGIONAL SUPPLY CHAIN VOLATILITY: Global supply chain volatility is falling in Europe and North America. Suppliers feeding in Asia are under the least amount of strain since August 2020 because of China's fully reopened economy.GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index May 2023 GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index May 2023For more information, visit www.gep.com/volatilityNote: Full historic data dating back to January 2005 is available for subscription.

To skip our detailed analysis of the blockchain sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Biggest Blockchain Companies in the World in 2023.Blockchain is a recent technology breakthrough that derives its major value from providing decentralized database storage systems due to which it provides the ultimate form of digital security and scalability. This security means that blockchain technologies will have a major role in the progress of the digitalized economy. A report by OECD discusses how Decentralized Finance, or 'DeFi', will keep gaining significance due to the speed of execution, transaction costs, and security it provides. Despite cryptocurrencies having recent crises, the technology utilized in blockchains that power those currencies is indisputable.What is DeFi?DeFi is a more recent trend in the crypto-asset space. It is meant to replicate traditional financial activities in a decentralized and autonomous manner. This basically entails the provision of financial instruments without any reliance on intermediaries such as exchanges or brokerages. DeFi offers financial services primarily by using smart contracts on a blockchain.One of the major uses of blockchain technology is that of cryptocurrencies. While the cryptocurrency market did see major drops in 2022, Bitcoin, along with many other cryptocurrency tokens, has seen a large rally over the past several months, and a number of crypto-focused equity names have seen substantial year-to-date moves. Investor sentiment towards cryptocurrencies also appears to be healthy, and the reintroduction of the United States legislation to allow retirement plans to include cryptocurrencies show support for the market. In February, Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville spearheaded this move. He stated that the Financial Freedom Act, first introduced in the US Senate in May 2022, was meant to reverse the Department of Labor's policy directing what type of investments were allowed in retirement plans. Tuberville further stated that this bill would bar the Department of Labor from interfering with the usage of brokerage windows to invest in cryptocurrency. This move of governmental support is expected to sustain the rise of cryptocurrency.Story continuesAccording to analysts, this rise is expected to continue due to an ease in macroeconomic activities. Companies including Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) have been investing to leverage blockchain technologies and profit from the crypto rally. At the same time, investors are eyeing the blockchain and crypto sector as a potentially profitable investment option in the long run, leading to us compiling a list of the biggest blockchain companies in the world today.Let's now take a look at the 20 biggest blockchain companies in the world.Our MethodologyWe scoured several different financial reports to look at a number of companies involved in the usage of blockchain technologies.

In December 2021, several entities filed a joint waiver request to deploy this safety-enhancing technology as soon as possible.Traffic fatalities reached a 16-year high in 2021 with an estimate of more than 42,000 fatalities caused by vehicle traffic crashes.1 Many of these deaths could be preventable. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that V2V safety applications could prevent or mitigate the severity of up to 80% of non-impaired crashes.2 Qualcomm is thrilled that industry stakeholders can now move forward with early-stage C-V2X deployments that will help to address this national safety crisis.The waiver permits C-V2X deployments in the dedicated upper 20 MHz portion of the 5.9 GHz band, allowing automakers and road infrastructure owners and operators to begin integrating the technology into vehicles and road infrastructure. Meaning, stakeholders can now begin rolling out applications that can assist in immediate enhanced safety for all road users.The following applications use C-V2X technology. These and others can improve road safety:Red-light violation warning (RLVW) More than half of all fatal and injury crashes happen at intersections.3 Drivers running red lights are the most common cause of all urban crashes, resulting in an average of seven fatalities and more than 1,000 injuries per day at signalized intersections across the country.4Traffic signal preemption Aimed at shortening emergency response time to help save lives, this preemption allows vehicles like ambulances and fire trucks to remotely trigger a green light. Related V2V applications share this information with nearby vehicles so drivers can take action to move out of the way, reducing congestion along the route to improve safety for first responders and road users alike.Intersection movement assist (IMA) Similar to RLVW, IMA safety applications can alert other drivers when there is a movement conflict at an intersection.Do-Not-Pass Warning (DNPW) Warns the driver that it is not safe to pass a slower-moving vehicle when vehicles are approaching from the opposite direction.Story continuesNext stepsThe US Department of Transportation (USDOT) has committed to developing a roadmap for national V2X deployments and will convene the industry to discuss the path forward at a workshop titled ""Continuing the Momentum Toward Nationwide Deployment"" on April 28. In preparation for this workshop, the Intelligent Transportation Society of America (ITSA) prepared a National Deployment Plan that includes a call to action for state and local transportation agencies and related federal agencies, and outlines targets for OEM deployment. This is the kind of industry collaboration necessary to achieve broadscale deployment. Qualcomm looks forward to working with USDOT, ITSA, and other public and private sector stakeholders on a shared national deployment vision.The recently announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law also provides funding opportunities for programs geared at improving U.S. transportation infrastructure. To provide more visibility into these programs, the USDOT has published a list of upcoming notices of funding opportunities (NOFOs).Qualcomm is committed to providing solutions that support the transportation industry with enhancing safety and traffic efficiency, learn more at qualcommm.com/automotive.1.

140,492fe47e-7b1f-37af-9de8-e4087a243bed,QCOM,2023-05-16,7 Overvalued Stocks to Sell for May 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-overvalued-stocks-sell-may-102013854.html,1683886813,STORY,"['TSLA', 'JNJ', 'QCOM', 'INTC', 'MMM', 'BB']","[While chasing returns and profits is the name of the game for investors, one way to torpedo your portfolio is to fill it with overvalued stocks.Stocks become overvalued when they trade at a higher price than their actual value, based on measurements such as earnings and growth projections. Many investors use price-to-earnings ratios, price-to-sales ratios, or price-to-book ratios to determine if a stock is overvalued, undervalued, or fairly valued.It’s one of the many reasons it pays to review your portfolio regularly, because what may have been a good company a year ago may be an overvalued stock today.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIf you’re wondering how to identify overvalued stocks, I suggest the Portfolio Grader is the obvious solution. The Portfolio Grader puts a letter grade on stocks. The best stocks get an “A,” and the worst stocks get an “F.” The Portfolio Grader uses quantitative measurements, including earnings performance, analyst sentiment and momentum, to develop the letter grade.It’s easy to fall into the trap of getting overvalued stocks. But you’re not in this alone. Here are some overvalued stocks you should avoid if you’re holding them this month.SQBlock57.31BBBlackBerry5.12TSLATesla171.69QCOMQualcomm104.25JNJJohnson &amp; Johnson 160.92INTCIntel28.85MMM3M Company100.84Block (SQ)Square (SQ) logo displayed on a smartphone screenSource: ShutterstockFintech company Block (NYSE:SQ) issued its first-quarter results that included revenue of $4.99 billion and adjusted earnings of 40 cents per share, which were better than analysts expected.Wall Street celebrated as SQ jumped more than 2% following the earnings report.But I’m not one of those who are impressed. If you take another step and look at the company’s Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, you’ll see that the Block had a net loss of $16.83 million, or 3 cents per share.Throw in the fact that Block’s CashApp has severe competition, and the company’s stock trades at a forward P/E of 34 right now, and it’s clear that SQ is overvalued. The stock has a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Story continuesBlackBerry (BB)women1600Source: ShutterstockOnce an innovative phone manufacturer that revolutionized how business people communicated, BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) is trying to rebrand itself as a force in the Internet of Things and cybersecurity.Maybe it will get there. But for this May, BB stock is just overvalued and a stock to avoid.BlackBerry’s earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 (ending Feb. 28) included revenue of $151 million, a drop of more than 18% from a year ago. The company also lost 85 cents per share, or $495 million, in the quarter.Its cash position also fell from $378 million a year ago to $295 million at the end of February.There’s nothing wrong with rooting for BB stock. But recognize that it should be on your list of overvalued stocks to avoid this May. BB stock has a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Tesla (TSLA)Tesla (TSLA) model X displayed in China auto expo during covid19 pandemic. Staff wearing face mask.Source: helloabc / Shutterstock.comElectric vehicle company Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has long been overvalued, but the ridiculous growth rate still made the stock worth having for several months.Tesla stock shot up 1,300% in a 23-month period from January 2020 to November 2021. That kind of return makes it easy to overlook a company’s flaws.But in this what-have-you-done-for-me-lately world, Tesla is underperforming, and the flaws are harder to ignore. The company’s dropping prices to maintain market share, but that’s lowering the profit margins at an alarming rate. TSLA stock fell 40% over the last year.Look at CEO Elon Musk’s involvement with Twitter, a $44 billion purchase financed by selling more than $22 billion in Tesla stock. That just pushed the stock price down, and investors should rightly be worried that Musk is too busy paying attention to Twitter to focus on Tesla.Today, TSLA has a forward P/E of more than 42 and a P/B of more than 10. Factor all that in, and you get a “D” for TSLA stock in the Portfolio Grader.Qualcomm (QCOM)Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor signSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.comQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) makes semiconductor chips used in smartphones and manufactures software and services for wireless technology.The slowdown in smartphone sales and the semiconductor market has hurt recently the San Diego-based company. QCOM stock is down nearly 20% since Feb. 1.Earnings for the company’s fiscal second quarter (ending March 26) included revenue of $9.3 billion and EPS of $2.15 – just a penny less than analysts’ estimates. But the revenue was markedly down from a year ago, falling by nearly 17%.Guidance for the third quarter was also a disappointment. Qualcomm said investors could expect revenue of $8.5 billion for the quarter and earnings per share between $1.70 and $1.90. Analysts, meanwhile, were targeting $9.1 billion in revenue and EPS of $2.16.The semiconductor slowdown will continue for the next few months – Qualcomm acknowledged as much in its post-earnings conference call with analysts. That makes Qualcomm a drain on your portfolio for now, which is why it has a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)A red Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.comJohnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a big disappointment these days, with many questions surrounding it. The maker of bandages, health products, cold and allergy medications and cough suppressants has its stock down by 8% this year.Its trailing P/E is a lofty 34. While that’s in line with the P/E of healthcare stocks right now, it’s a pricy indicator that shows how overvalued JNJ is at the moment.One thing to watch is Johnson &amp; Johnson’s spin-off of Kenvue (NYSE:KVUE), completed last week and includes many of JNJ’s most well-known brands, including Tylenol, Band-Aid, Listerine, and the company’s baby powder and shampoos.JNJ still controls about 91% of Kenvue, and the deal is expected to help Johnson &amp; Johnson refocus on its pharmaceutical and medical device divisions.If you like consumer staples, then Kenvue’s product line may be more to your liking. It remains to be seen if the Kenvue spin-off will unlock the value that investors need.JNJ stock has a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader right now.Intel (INTC)Close up of Intel sign at their San Jose campus in Silicon ValleySource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comNothing quite screams “overvalued” like a semiconductor company losing market share. Enter Intel (NYSE:INTC), a once-darling of the computing world that’s losing market share to Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD).And if it doesn’t turn things around, Intel’s position as the top dog in the global data center market won’t last.At the end of 2022, Intel had a 71% market share, while AMD had only a 20% share. But, Intel saw its data center revenue drop 16% on a year-over-year basis, while AMD’s revenue jumped 62%.In the first quarter of 2023, INTC revenues of $11.7 billion dropped 36% from the previous year. Intel also recorded a net loss of $2.8 billion, just a year after posting a net profit of $8.1 billion.Intel has a forward P/E of 66 – obviously, there’s a lot of work to do here that won’t be solved this month. INTC stock has a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.3M Company (MMM)3M logo on top of a corporate building. MMM stockSource: JPstock / Shutterstock.com3M Company (NYSE:MMM) is also heavily involved in the healthcare sector, although the conglomerate also has interests in consumer goods, electronics and manufacturing. It makes everything from protective equipment to medical supplies, tapes and labels, cleaning supplies and more.First-quarter earnings included a 6.8% drop in organic sales as the company had weak sales in home health, home improvement and auto care. The company’s consumer electronics division, which includes tablets and televisions, also fell by 11.3% in the quarter. 3M issued guidance for full-year sales to range from a 3% loss to flat on a year-over-year basis.With sales slipping for five consecutive quarters, 3M is making changes to try to right the ship. It announced plans to lay off 8,500 workers and pledged to simplify its supply chain structure while streamlining corporate.It plans to spin off the healthcare business – 3 M’s best-performing segment – into a standalone company later this year.Investors should be very cautious of 3M. Even if 3M can see some improvement from restructuring, the company won’t be as appealing without the healthcare division. MMM stock has a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.On the date of publication, Louis Navellier did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.On the date of publication, the InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article held TSLA.

142,aa5ff041-4b07-3b77-a547-812cd43d5346,LMT,2023-05-16,Returns At Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) Appear To Be Weighed Down,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/returns-lockheed-martin-nyse-lmt-120102779.html,1684238462,STORY,['LMT'],"[If you're looking for a multi-bagger, there's a few things to keep an eye out for. Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. Having said that, while the ROCE is currently high for Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), we aren't jumping out of our chairs because returns are decreasing.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Lockheed Martin, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.20 = US$7.5b ÷ (US$55b - US$17b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Thus, Lockheed Martin has an ROCE of 20%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry average of 9.5%. See our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin roceIn the above chart we have measured Lockheed Martin's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Lockheed Martin.What Can We Tell From Lockheed Martin's ROCE Trend?Things have been pretty stable at Lockheed Martin, with its capital employed and returns on that capital staying somewhat the same for the last five years. This tells us the company isn't reinvesting in itself, so it's plausible that it's past the growth phase. So while the current operations are delivering respectable returns, unless capital employed increases we'd be hard-pressed to believe it's a multi-bagger going forward. This probably explains why Lockheed Martin is paying out 48% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Unless businesses have highly compelling growth opportunities, they'll typically return some money to shareholders.Story continuesOur Take On Lockheed Martin's ROCEIn summary, Lockheed Martin isn't compounding its earnings but is generating decent returns on the same amount of capital employed. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 59% over the last five years. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.One more thing, we've spotted   2 warning signs  facing Lockheed Martin that you might find interesting.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

BellThank you, Jon, and thank you, everyone, for joining our first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. I am excited with our year-to-date performance, especially our order flow. A new even broader mix of customers are increasingly looking to Terran Orbital for the design and manufacturing of their satellite constellation and a new space-based project. Customers are choosing us because of our 10-year-plus track record of success, our state-of-the-art design and mission breadth, our rapid pace increased manufacturing speed and our world-class quality. We added a $2.4 billion, 300 satellite order from Rivada Space Networks in February, which we believe is the largest single constellation award -- commercial constellation award ever. This has driven our March quarter-end backlog to over $2.5 billion.In addition, we are pleased to announce today that we have signed a new $87 million, 16 satellite order with yet another new customer. This award combined with several other awards we recently signed, bringing our total order book to over 30 program. More to say on this, but our pipeline-to-order conversion year-to-date is a standout highlight.Now turning to our overall performance and quarterly updates. First, I am happy to announce that our team's positive momentum continues across our Space Development Agency contracts. After our successful delivery last year of our 10 Transport Layer Tranche 0 satellite to our partner, Lockheed Martin, we are very much looking forward to their launch next month. These Tranche 0 satellites will demonstrate the low-latency communication links to support the warfighter with a resilient network of integrated capabilities from low-Earth orbit. As a reminder, the SDA's transportation layer is a mesh communication network that will use hundreds of low-Earth orbiting satellite to connect with other satellite layers plus critical ground, air and sea-based systems. As such, the transport layer is foundational to the SDA-based architecture for this decade and beyond.We are pleased to contribute to the critical National Security mission through the work on the first award to this layer, known as Tranche 0 and Tranche 1. Our team is hard at work manufacturing SDA's Transport Layer Tranche 1, their 42 satellite order, and we are pleased to confirm that we are on track to begin delivery of the first batch of these satellites during 2023, and the balance by the end of the first quarter of 2024. Tranche 1 will be the first operational generation of the proliferated warfighter space architecture and it's schedule for deployment by the SDA in late-2024. The Space Development Agency strategy for construction of this advanced base architecture, which will consist of hundreds of satellites, has been to rapidly acquire and deploy at satellites [in terms of every 3] years. The SDA recently issued a solicitation with Tranche 2 satellite, and we expect this award to be announced later this year.We believe our experience and track record with Tranche 0 and Tranche 1 in partnership with Lockheed Martin, differentiate us and position us well for additional awards for the Space Development Agency. Many of you are familiar with our relationship with Lockheed Martin. This 7-plus year strategic partnership was recently extended through 2035, and we continue leveraging the full spectrum of our combined capabilities to support the Space Development Agency. Tranche 2 is a transport layer, along with the space development layer opportunity remain key pursuits for our team over the next 12 months.Second, we are very pleased to update you on the company's record $2.4 billion contract, design, manufacture, integrate and test 300 satellites for Rivada Space Network. As we announced last month, we have received a further milestone payment along with completion of the screening of our industrial partner. This vision will consist in satellites orbiting a low-Earth orbit on multiple planes using laser communication terminal. Our initial $2.4 billion contract covers only the first 300 satellites. The contract includes an option for Rivada to purchase an additional 300 satellites at an additional cost. The contract is broadly grouped into a design phase and a build phase. We are currently executing on the design phase, which includes a -- or demonstrative mission that will support the verification of gateway-less transmission from one user to another, routed within a small network of 4 satellites in space.Mission operations for the on-orbit demonstration satellites will be conducted from Terran Orbital's new state-of-the-art satellite operations control center, which is currently under construction in Irvine, California. An additional 25 satellites will be built and commissioned as part of this phase. The build phase which is delivering the balance of the 300 sellers in late-2025 and the first-half of 2026. We are still ramping this program and recently received a milestone payment, Rivada revenues are projected to steadily ramp up in the coming months.Third, we are thrilled to announce today an $87 million award from a new customer for 16 low-Earth orbit satellites. We are pleased to be partnering with this new customer, who has a long history of advancing space technology. We see ourselves not just as a pioneer, but as an industry leader and a supplier of choice, which is validated by our most recent constellation contract awards. Our backlog and pipeline both remained robust. And as of March 31, our backlog stood at $2.5 billion, representing orders for over 360 satellites and our pipeline has $11.8 billion. These March 31 metrics includes a successful conversion of the Rivada Space contract from pipeline to backlog, but exclude today's announced award.In addition to the programs we noted, we have other active programs, many of which are precursor to larger constellation both for the existing customers and as well as new and other customers will remain who value our deep mission experience and track record. These missions and others we are pursuing are diverse across customers, channel and mission. Including today is the prototyping and development of satellite and supporting a larger potential cancellation. While many of these programs are undisclosed today, they serve the see -- as a seed corn for a larger potential population awards tomorrow. Our announced Lockheed Martin LINUSS success of 2 Terran Orbital geosynchronous satellite completing the Rendezvous and Proximity operation demonstration is just one example of the revolutionary program our team is currently working on.Another is our record-setting NADA pathfinder technology demonstrated 3 satellites, which enabled a record 200 gigabits per second space-to-ground optical link. Low-latency, secured communication, proliferated systems, speed to orbit, technology innovation, each of these are customer demands for which we are delivering advances today. Supporting all of these orders and opportunities is our vertically-integrated scale design and manufacturing capability. We are investing in world-class production system to support execution of our 360 satellites backlog and over 2,600 satellites identified in our pipeline. Our new facility, which we call 50 Tech in Irvine, California adds a 60,000 square feet of workspace and brings our manufacturing capacity of approximately 20 satellites per month, once the facility is fully commissioned, later this year.Critically, this includes testing equipment, printed circuit board assembly equipment, and robotic and automated assembly lines to vastly improve throughput, quality and speed. And we are pleased to announce we are progressing with the development of our recently announced 90,000 square foot facility also in Irvine, which we expect to increase our capacity to multiples of our current capacity after commissioning in late-2024. Importantly, this new capacity includes 36-foot highway for assembly and integration of significantly larger satellites.In summary, Terran Orbital has established itself as the leading supplier of the enabling satellite infrastructure of the new [space page]. Constellations of smaller, low-Earth orbiting satellites are the preferred architecture of the future. What used to cost billions and take a decade to launch, Terran Orbital is building at a fraction of the cost in months. Our investments in scale, vertical integration and automation leverages our 10-year legacy. Our production system is designed to deliver satellites at a mass scale and at a speed and quantity our customers desire, at a price point to stimulate new markets and at margins to reward our shareholders. We are thrilled our strategy was recognized by the 2 new franchise contract awards in recent months.Now let me turn it over to Gary to review our financial performance in the quarter and provide a financial outlook for the full year. Gary?Gary A. HobartThank you, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'm happy to report that in the first quarter, we achieved multiple milestones in satellite production, resulting in a record first quarter revenue of $28.2 million for the first quarter of 2023. This is a 115% increase over the same period of the prior year. As a reminder, we recognize revenue on most of our programs on a percentage of completion basis, and adjustments and changes to our contract values and estimated cost of completions or EACs have a cumulative impact in the period in which we make the adjustment.In the first quarter, adjustments to EACs increased revenues by an estimated $800,000. Gross loss was $1.4 million for the first quarter, compared to $2.8 million in the same quarter in 2022. Excluding share-based compensation and depreciation and amortization included in cost of sales, adjusted gross profit in the first quarter was $2.3 million, compared to adjusted gross loss of $0.2 million in the same quarter in 2022. EAC adjustments positively impacted adjusted gross profit by an estimated $1.5 million during the first quarter of 2023.Selling, general and administrative expenses were $32.5 million in the first quarter of 2023, compared to $30.2 million for the same quarter in 2022. The increase was primarily driven by higher research and development activities, labor and benefits, and other costs as a result of our growth initiatives, offset by a decrease in share-based compensation expense. We continue to increase our staff to meet upcoming demand. Share-based compensation is an important part of acquiring and retaining employees. Although down year-over-year, share-based compensation still represented over $10.2 million of our first quarter expenses with approximately $6.9 million running through our GAAP SG&amp;A expenses and $3.2 million balance, reflected in our cost of sales. Subject to future equity program activity, we currently expect share-based expenses could be being below $7 million per quarter through the balance of this year.Adjusted EBITDA was negative $22.6 million for the quarter, compared with negative $14.7 million in the same period in the prior year. The decrease in adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses related to higher research and development activities, labor and benefits and other costs as a result of our growth initiatives, partially offset by an increase in adjusted gross profit. Overall, adjusted EBITDA loss is largely a function of our ramping capabilities across the company to serve our multibillion dollar backlog and pipeline in the coming quarters and years. This is part of an overall investment in our capabilities that supports our path to profitability, for which we are well positioned, particularly given the strength in our signed order book. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $2.5 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $3.2 million. Finally, as of March 31, we had approximately $57.4 million of cash on hand, and approximately $305.3 million in gross debt obligations.Now for outlook. We are very excited about our outlook for the coming year. The efficient and successful execution of our new and existing contracts remains the #1 priority for our team. The exact timing of execution on our new contract work is the primary variable affecting our projected full year 2023 results. But these contracts are the building blocks for what we believe will be a substantially higher sales base in 2024. Given our current view of our seat ramp ahead, we anticipate in excess of $250 million in sales in 2023. Upside beyond this level is possible depending on a successful execution of our customer commitments, just as our ability to achieve this target will be impacted by such execution. The timing of our new capacity commissioning and our anticipated scheduled contract milestones with LIBOR revenues to be weighted towards the second half of this year, particularly in the fourth quarter. We expect gross margins to demonstrate year-over-year improvement, but pace in improvements may be variable given the timing impacts. Finally, we note that our CapEx for the year is expected to be less than $30 million.I will now turn the call back over to, Marc.Marc H. BellThank you, Gary, and thank you, everyone, on the call for your continued support of Terran Orbital. I will now look forward to taking your questions, and I'll turn it over to the operator.Question and Answer SessionOperatorThank you. (Operator Instructions). First question comes from Ron Epstein from Bank of America.Andre MadridActually got Andre on for Ron today. So I wanted to note the CapEx expected spend for the year, along with where the cash balance is at now? How are you guys finding the financing environment largely? Could you give a little more context around that?Gary A. HobartSure. This is Gary. The financial environment is, we do a little bit of our equipment expenditures on a financing basis, and there are multiple providers of that, so I feel very comfortable and confident with that. Generally speaking from a finance perspective, we look at the company punch into the market in terms of the equity markets. And as you know, we have a little under $100 million elock in place with B. Riley. We have not tapped into it for the last couple of quarters. That is the primary area where we wish we look into the market to add additional capital. But overall, this is a tough financial environment, and we're very mindful of that.Andre MadridPerfect. I will keep it at that one. Yes, go ahead. Go ahead.Gary A. HobartNo we [just thought], there was a follow-on question. Oh yeah, and CapEx for the year, if you can just repeat your question?Andre MadridNo, yeah, it's all, I was just looking at where your cash balance is at now and then where CapEx is looking to be just obviously, and given the comment in your release about continuing to look at perspective financing beyond this point. I just kind of wanted more color as to how you are finding that and how you're planning to go about it.Gary A. HobartYes. I think, look, the way we're financing our business is we have substantial growth. As we mentioned, the back half of the year is going to be a significantly higher revenue uptick versus the last several quarters. And so the way, Marc and I and the Board are looking at our finances is really bridging from this point through our profitability. We have a fair amount of working capital needs and obviously, growth needs, and you've seen that in the last several quarters, including the first quarter. So we're matching up our financing with our needs. Overall, we're building to a path of profitability both on an EBITDA basis and a free cash flow basis during 2024. So anything we're doing as far as capital is really looking at bridging between now and that period.Marc H. BellAnd we've been very sorry. We've been very lucky in terms of -- because of the type of contracts that we're getting and the size that we are, and how we are a stand out in a new space, we understand a lot of people in our [back -- all are back] that went out. The majority of them are data as a service. We're a pure brand manufacturer, so we're in a different kind of business. And so we have been seeing a lot of attention from a number of generic financing sources should we choose to go that route. So, we are -- we feel pretty comfortable about our liquidity, pretty comfortable about our options out there, and so -- because of our customer base.Andre MadridPerfect. That's great color.OperatorWe now turn to Mike Crawford with B. Riley Securities.Michael Roy CrawfordCan you give us some more color on the timing and magnitude of the received milestone payments from Rivada. I think, one may have been before the March 31, balance sheet snapshot.Marc H. BellYes. So unfortunately, we can't disclose how much they paid for each of the 2 payments they made to us. We have an NDA with them, and we have to respect that. They want to be in control of a lot of different things, including their capital source.Michael Roy CrawfordOkay. And in that regard, it's understood that their capital sources have been disclosed to the ITU, but that public has not been made -- that filing has not been made public, yet, that should be the case at or before this upcoming meeting at the end of June. Is that still your current understanding?Marc H. BellYes. I think the meeting is July 2. And when I talked to Rivada, they feel they are a private company. They don't have to disclose to the public where their money is coming from. All I can say you, that it's public as Declan Ganley's partner, and starting with Peter Thiel.Michael Roy CrawfordOkay, Marc. And then regarding 50 T, so I think we walked through that facility 11 months ago, and it was near online, and I think on your last conference call, you talked about it being online April 1. And now you're talking about full commissioning. So am I correct to understand that there are some satellites that are being assembled in that facility as we speak.Marc H. BellEverything is currently still being done at the Barranca facility. The local electric company has taken their time in getting our power turned on, and that's why we're not upgraded to the building. And so, we're at their mercy to some extent. A lot of the equipment has been delivered. The PCBA lines have been delivered, but it can be powered up yet. We're hoping to power everything up starting next month, and then go through some testing over the summer. So we are -- but that being said, that building -- the first big constellation that will be built in that building is SDA's Transport Layer Tranche 1. Everything else is being done in the existing facility.Michael Roy CrawfordAnd when you talked about.Marc H. BellSo by August-- so let me give more clarity. So by August of 2023, we expect that building to be in-use, 100% in-use.Michael Roy CrawfordAnd at that time, when you're talking about the capacity of 20 satellites per month, are you talking about Tranche 1 Transport Layer size buses?Marc H. BellCorrect.Michael Roy CrawfordOr could you do more.Marc H. BellThat is our -- not huge sets. You're 100% correct. This is going to be all 450 kilograms, 500 kilogram type size buses, that will be done there.OperatorOur next question comes from Greg Konrad with Jefferies.Gregory Arnold KonradMaybe just to start. I mean, you mentioned screening of industrial partners for Rivada. Can you maybe talk about that a little bit? Supply chain readiness and just given that you manufacture a lot in-house, just kind of how you're thinking about that screening that you mentioned in the script?Marc H. BellSure. So we manufacture 85% of the components today that go inside of a bus, and we are working diligently to get to 100% by the end of the year, with the exception of solar panels, which are manufactured by Lockheed Martin. So when we're see screening industrial partners, we're specifically talking about the payload. So the only payloads we manufacture in-house today as Synthetic Aperture Radar and certain kinds of RF radio. And for payloads we go to the outside. So we have been screening and choosing with Rivada Network, all the different payload partners who will be part of the constellations, and then reviewing their supply chain to ensure that they can get things done on time.And on the supply chain issue, I'm going to mention, one of the -- a lot of conversations we're having now with partners who are having a supply chain issue, the #1 supply chain issue everybody is having comes with printed circuit board. Printed Circuit Board Assembly has been the whole bet of -- has been the biggest problem. And so us having 2 state-of-the-art printed circuit board assembly line operational by the summer will provide our own supply chain, where we -- as we will be manufacturing components for our supply chain in order for our own satellites and possibly for some of their other customers as well. So this is a huge difference in how we do business with our vendors.Gregory Arnold KonradAnd then maybe just more of an accounting question, but you mentioned the ramp around systems engineering for Rivada. You had some positive EACs in the quarter. And I think you mentioned most revenues are under percentage of completion. When you think about a large program such as Rivada, is there a difference in profitability between the engineering and when you get to manufacturing? Or is that all one program from an accounting profitability perspective?Gary A. HobartYes. So we haven't given the precise accounting on it, but Greg, some of the accounting on a program that large will have a mix of margins in them based on the type of cost.Marc H. BellI mean, obviously, as you do the largest scale assembly, you have milestones to hit, your more gross profit dollars will hit. So we are cognizant that we -- our path to getting to EBITDA positive, next year. And so, as the assembly and the delivery of these new satellites gets completed, that will have a dramatic impact on our bottom line.Gregory Arnold KonradAnd then maybe just one last one. I mean, thinking about the pipeline and the contracts you've announced recently, whether Rivada or the new one that you announced in the quarter, I mean, are you seeing a drift higher around ASPs per satellite versus some of those initial awards and kind of what's driving that?Marc H. BellSo we see on -- it's interesting. So customers are willing to pay more money for faster delivery. So we had a time period maybe 2 years ago, where is all that price, priced right. And now, we see customers are a little less focused on price. They are becoming much more focused on quality. You've had a lot of people launch what we call bricks in space across the industry, which only benefits us to deal. Everybody thinks it's easy to build a satellite. It's not that easy. And our 10-year plus heritage has helped us a lot. So we're seeing people focusing on the quality, on the speed of delivery and slightly less on price. They're obviously all price conscious and they want the best -- we tried to [split the deal], it's about value. And you can always buy it cheaper, but not everybody wants to drive [ugly] car. You can always find it. You can always buy a UGO, and drive a cheap car, it doesn't mean you want it.Gary A. HobartGreg, the other thing I'd say overall is we are entering the phase of the last 12, 24 months of really getting to serial builds of constellation versus the prior decade of our existence, where there was a lot of prototyping co-development. And so, what we're seeing is a price point on a serial build base is we're able to deliver to the customer a very consistent price point, even with inflation in the overall marketplace. And we're starting to lap in getting to the other side of some of the more upfront costs, whether it be nonrecurring engineering, first article costs, and we're really starting to see that flow through. That will manifest itself on our income statement and our cash flows in the coming quarters. And I'll be pleased to show that, that demonstrates that.So generally speaking, when we're building this big contracts, we're able to deliver to the customer a pretty consistent value point for the overall serial build of the constellation.Operator(Operator Instructions). We'll now turn to Erik Rasmussen with Stifel.Erik Peter RasmussenMaybe back to the outlook on the revenue. I know, you had mentioned a strong second half ramp, but how would you sort of weight the first half versus the second half, realizing that Q4 is probably the big point of the year.Marc H. BellWell, Q4 is definitely the big point of the year. I mean, I've told you all, unlike companies that are like your mobile -- your AT&amp; T Mobile is something where you have monthly recurring revenue to go on, our revenues tends to be fairly lumpy mustered around module building and the assembly of the satellite. And so, we are -- as we are growing at such a rapid rate, we still find lumpiness in our quarters, but the goal at the end of the day, we look for the total revenue for the year, I wish to say.I'll turn over to Gary, if you want to add some color?Gary A. HobartYes. So we've guided to over $250 million for the year. I would -- just to give you a rough guidance point, I look at fourth quarter being 4x our first quarter.Erik Peter RasmussenOkay. That's helpful. And then, maybe just you mentioned possible upside. What are the factors that could contribute to that upside? And then, you mentioned some gating items probably around execution or timing?Gary A. HobartYes. Well, we recognize revenue generally by best adding value into programs and value of the programs is everything from direct labor and overhead, our internal modules, and then third-party parts and services. As we're able to execute on all 3 of those that adds value to the programs, which [apparently] generates both cost on the programs, but also generates most of our revenue. So if we have programs in the ramp we have, a weak acceleration or a week delay has a big impact on the month and in the overall quarter. So what I'm trying to articulate is, with the type of lift we have in overall execution, you can have variability up and down throughout the months and quarters to come. And that maybe the best [glossy] way of describing timing on what it means. And that's why, we've guided to $250 million and indicated that it could be substantially higher, but also hitting $250 has execution challenges, and it has mostly to do with how we deliver those 3 categories into overall value of the program there.Marc H. BellAnd we're seeing -- we've dramatically expanded our business development group over the past year. We went from a few people to over 30 people in the group. And we're seeing that turning into RFIs and RFPs, where you would only have a few added any given point in time, we are seeing -- and again, we are seeing ourselves now with an enormous number of RFIs and RFPs that we've issued in the past few months. And we will expect those numbers will turn into new contracts over the next few months. So in addition, we will be bidding on almost all of the SDA work that's coming out, going forward. So as a transport layer, alpha, beta, and gamma, we'll be bidding on all 3 of those. We are looking at bidding on the tracking layer.We are doing this with our partner, Lockheed Martin, and we're thrilled to be doing it with them. And so, we have the May 11 solicitation for our 100 alpha satellite, and that follows the early request of 72 satellites for their beta solicitation. They are breaking the transport layer into different pieces now. And so, we feel that we have performed fabulously so far. And then, once [that piece of quote] ""those who deliver are those who keep winning"". We have delivered. We delivered first Tranche 0 ahead of schedule, and we delivered them good for [asset grid] this morning we've seen the need out there. And we will continue to -- but more importantly, our business development group is expanding, and we are setting up more and more RFPs. And as we expand our manufacturing footprint, we're getting more and more interest from people to build larger and larger constellations and larger and larger satellites. So this will give them all this positive data points metrics in the development of our business, and where we feel pretty confident so far.Erik Peter RasmussenGreat. And then maybe just on the margins, you expect sort of improvement. Would you expect both GAAP and adjusted gross margin to be positive in Q2? And then obviously, for the year, you'll see that trend throughout. And just remind us what the targets are for maybe gross and operating margin?Marc H. BellWhen we see margins continuing to improve. What's happening here is since we're so small as we hire, we hire a bulk of people for Rivada, for this new customer and others that we believe that we will be getting. It does have a negative impact on our financials, because we have to hire people from 6 months ahead of program to get them up to speed and you're building facilities almost 18 months ahead of program. So eventually, things will start to level off. But I'll let Gary give you some more color.Gary A. HobartYes. We generally see ourselves ramping to the high-teens throughout this year, mid-20s in the prior year and then just less than 25 to 30 in outer years. And part of that is going to be -- a part of that is going to be the mix of the programs that we're working on. A lot of the programs that we're working on now and old backlog have a lower margin base, and the newer programs have a slightly higher base.Erik Peter RasmussenGreat. Maybe just my last one. On the new award, the 16 satellites, maybe any additional color on this award. The deal suggests and I think we have talked a little bit about ASPs earlier, but it's about $5.5 million per satellite. That's sort of in between the Rivada and the SDA. And then, maybe just comment on the timing of when these satellites will be delivered.Marc H. BellAs we deal, we deal with some customers who have more confidentiality than others. At the customers request, we would not like to give any more information other than that.OperatorWe now turn to Robert Spingarn with Melius Research.Robert Michael SpingarnMarc or Gary, as you build out this $250 million plus in revenue this year, what program should we think are driving that? I assume, Tranche 1 is a big piece of that. It's not clear if Rivada is or not or any of this other stuff. So how do we think about the $250 million from a program support perspective?Marc H. BellI mean, Tranche 1 is a big part of it. Then you have Rivada right after that, and you have this new customer, and there is some other things coming down the pipe. But Tranche 1 is by far the largest part of that component, we're going to deliver, call it, 2/3 of Tranche 1 in calendar year 2023.Robert Michael SpingarnAnd in the overall.Gary A. HobartOur current backlog is, we're like 30 programs. And so, while there might be some 1s and 2s in there, there are some other programs that we are confidential, we haven't mentioned, but they contribute in aggregate to the overall numbers. So I can hear what Marc is saying, but there is a mix of deliveries this year. Keep in mind, that most of the orders we get for turning around in 2 years. Rivada is a little bit of an outlier albeit it's greater satellite call it over 3 years.Robert Michael SpingarnOkay. And then I just wanted to think about the backlog a little bit. I mean, the backlog is obviously highly weighted towards the Rivada orders. So you got $2.5 billion in backlog, $2.4 billion of that is Rivada. So it kind of suggests that the 60 non-Rivada satellites are $100 million in backlog, but I'm not sure that reconciles with Tranche -- with that Tracking 1, and the other stuff you're doing. So is there a better way to think about this?Gary A. HobartI think, with what we've disclosed is we started the year about $170 million backlog before we included Rivada, and we did for roughly [$29 million to] $28 million in the first quarter. So that might help you get to kind of a pro forma of the January 1 backlog. I think, that will help you to kind of scoot around on that.Robert Michael SpingarnRight and the $87 million?Marc H. BellAnd just regards to -- sorry, we're not doing Tracking 1. So you said tracking one, we actually didn't bid on Tracking 1, so we have strategically chosen not to.Robert Michael SpingarnI'm sorry, Tranche 1.Marc H. BellFine. Okay. Just to make sure you hear that right too.Robert Michael SpingarnTranche 1.Marc H. BellGot it.Robert Michael SpingarnYes, right. But you understood what I was getting at, is the $87 million in there? Or is that post March 31?Marc H. BellThat's not in there. So all the numbers we've given include the conversion of Rivada into backlog as of March 31, but the newly announced deal today is not in the numbers.Robert Michael SpingarnOkay. And then, the other thing I wanted to ask you, Marc, as we think about future opportunities beyond what we've already talked about today, where are some of the other opportunities outside of these 2 or 3 contracts that we focused on today?Marc H. BellSome of these opportunities are SDA. They've got -- they have got 7 new bids going out. But the 3 -- starting with the 3 new transport layer bids we're bidding on, we're going to bid on Tracking, and possibly some others. So that's just one small part of a very, very big pie.Gary A. HobartThe other thing I'll add is the cost. It is -- overall there is -- there's a lot of positive feedback loop in the marketplace. As we add and complete the existing programs and add more programs, there is a feedback loop within the marketplace where other customers are looking to us to leverage off of that experience and that track record to produce programs for them. And so, in the last 6 months in particular, but maybe even 18 months, our track record is really allowing us to get in and have good purchase with new constellations, both on the civil -- on the government side as well on the commercial side.Robert Michael SpingarnOkay. And the only other thing I was going to ask, Marc, is as you get through your capacity ramp, I wanted to clarify when the most significant milestones are? Is it at the end of '24, would you have most of your capacity in place? And what's the revenue capacity at whatever that milestone is?Marc H. BellCapacity is a never-ending thing, I'm hoping. I'm being an optimist, when we say it's never, it's always you know, it always [adds] capacity. We are looking at -- we have 20 bus this year in 50 Tech as we call it. We are with the new facility that -- perhaps is on good year [or good through] the year. That allows us to get into the $1 billion revenue category. But more importantly, that new facility not only allows us to build buses but build full satellite, we can do the payload, we can do the solar panel assembly, we can do everything under one roof, which is a big game changer for us. We do payloads on small satellites, like 12Us and stuff like that. But we couldn't do the payload, for example, on a T-0 and the existing Barranca facility. So the new add facility really takes us to the next level. So we will build Rivada in that facility. So that will only take up about 1/3 of the facility. So we have 2/3 available for other customers who we're targeting today.Robert Michael SpingarnRight. Is there a good rule of thumb for what the ASP, [L-ASP] changes when you add in payloads?Marc H. BellIt ultimately is a satellite. You can build a -- I mean, here with Starlinks go with these satellites for $300,000 with a very high failure rate, but test. Everybody is -- every customer is different, because we are doing satellites -- I think, our largest we have right now is [800 kilogram] that we're building. The way we viewed it as long as it fits on an ESPA Ring or ESPA Grande we'll build it. That's kind of what we are -- the satellites are getting larger and larger. They wanted -- we went over time. People want it smaller, they want it cheaper, we were starting with a CubeSat. CubeSat changed at all. And then, when we took a CubeSat, we started making it bigger, you know we'll be able to take 3 CubeSats and put them together, what we call the 3U, and it was a 6U, when 6 put them together. They started getting bigger.And what's happened is, they went from demonstrator to people who really wanting more power, they need more batteries. They want larger solar arrays. So now you went from trying with [0 to] 350 kilograms, to try and fly 450 kilograms, and now we see new ones coming in the 500 kilogram to 600 kilogram range. People want more power, [while I think we're] seen no longer as demonstrator by a fully functioning replacement with geosynchronous satellites that can be built and launched through current technology.And yes, there is a replacement cycle to the recurring revenue business. So every satellite we built now for constellation has to be replaced every 5 years, but that's still phenomenally cheaper than building it in geosynchronous orbit, and it allows them to continue to upgrade their technology, just like the SDA does with each tranche, they continues to update the technology on each satellite. So [the RF] business be called as a recurring revenue business down the road, what we're talking of -- but that's only -- that's a few years out.OperatorWe now turn to [Gene Inger from Inger &amp; Company].Unidentified AnalystThis is my first time on one of your calls. We just recently initiated coverage as a buy in this price range for Torren (sic) [Terran]. So obviously, we see superb prospects and congratulate you on what you've achieved so far. I do have a question speaking of business development. As to cross-ownership in the small world of space, between AE Industrial, Bain Capital, and whether or not you expect some of this to come together over time, whether it would be the Australian program, the Crescent and so on -- or that Lockheed, or whether or not you're going to be involved with constellations and space management, such as BigBear.ai is doing or anything like that. Could you expand a little bit more on whether or not you're going to be limited to manufacturing?Marc H. BellWe are not limited to anything. We can do anything that we want to do, anything that our customers want. So we do see a lot of -- we will, we do insist we have continued consolidation in the space. You saw Millennium got acquired by Boeing. Blue Canyon got acquired by Raytheon, AE got acquired -- I'm sorry, but York got acquired by AE. So we'll continue to see consolidation in the space, but we could if we chose to expand beyond satellites. And do other space-based initiatives or ground-based initiatives for that matter as we do own a ground station network. And we do, do mission operations and we -- if anything, get into AI, that is something we've been talking about a lot here. We'll have more on that later on this year.Unidentified AnalystWell, I'm glad I brought that up. And also, my only other question because so many have been asked is many of the older shareholders come back from the stack days or from beach point or from what they call, Tyvak, the original CubeSat designers, and they still have a lot of shares. How do you work through? Or could you and/or Lockheed eliminate that concern among shareholders, and therefore, eliminate overhead supply in one fell swoop?Marc H. BellWell, the reality is you have, I mean, as you're talking about the original investor, the people like myself who aren't going anywhere, you have guys like myself, you have [Marco Villa], to myself, Marco Villa , Lockheed Martin and maybe a handful of others, we are worth 50% of company -- so there are not. So we don't see any -- 1 or 2 former employees to own a few million shares, but they could do the -- those who have made the mistake have chosen themselves, that's their choice, and we all believe in the company, and we're sticking around.Unidentified AnalystGreat. I appreciate it, and I really like the Lockheed association. And given the suppressed share price, I'm hopeful that they do not acquire you, I think they won't for competitive monopolistic purposes anyway. But I should ask whether or not that allows you to maintain adequate profit margins or they have a leverage in negotiating that makes it hard for you to make money on the 11 or 12 programs you have going on with Lockheed?Marc H. BellLockheed has been an incredible partner, and they, more than anybody else would like us to become profitable as soon as possible and they've made that very clear. So we are working as quickly as possible. So they are aligned with the shareholders being a large shareholder, they want us to see profitability and they wanted it's stock go to where it needs to go and happy where it's at now. So they have been a big supporter of us to get to profitability as soon as possible.Unidentified AnalystGreat. I'm looking forward to that as well. Congratulations, and will see you another time.OperatorOur next question comes from [James Byrne from Ostrowski Investment Management.]Unidentified Analyst(technical difficulty) answers when I was in the queue. My only, I guess, comment is that I was a bit alarmed that your sales doubled year-over-year, and you weren't able to leverage any of your fixed costs, so that, into the operating margin line. I know, you're doing a lot of hiring ahead of time, but what -- like I said, what I get concerned about is I look at the statement of cash flow. And if I do a very quick analysis, you're going to run into a cash crunch in about 6 months.And the other thing going back to the cost of sales, what it tells me is that, since -- it didn't look like you were able to leverage any of your fixed costs, your variable costs are growing faster than your sales are, which does worry me a bit. It's just a comment because I've been through a number of startups before, and I've seen this kind of thing happen in. Right now, your stock in the market is about -- down about 8.5%, 9%. So I think, other people are concerned about this, too. I'm not asking you to -- I mean, I heard a lot of the commentary, I just hope that this can turn quickly so that if you're going to burn through cash, you've got to get it from somewhere, and it's going to be really hard to raise it in the open market given your -- where your stock price is, right now. So I'm just -- I'm in a different camp of a few other people, I heard on there. I'm just -- I'm a little concerned about what I see. That's all.Marc H. BellNo. I mean, we are an experienced management team. I mean, this is my partner, to my Dan and I, this is the 17th company we've taken public. We've raised over $20 billion of equity and $100 million of debt over the course of our careers combined. So we understand the capital market. We understand how to grow our business from scratch. This will hopefully be between the 2 of us, [it's kind of a Unicorn]. So we are very much aligned with you. We understand -- unfortunately, sitting where I sit, I see things differently. All together we have a lot of information of where we're going, how we're getting there. So we've had to go ahead and make sure we had be started as a very young for years. We were a tiny little company that built CubeSat.And I took over as CEO a little over 2.5 years ago. And we decided at that point to partner with Lockheed Martin, and we are growing it around the space. So yes, we are spending money. We have $100 million elock, as Gary mentioned, in place with B. Riley. And we have lots of options in the capital market, but we're going to be smart as we move forward. The last thing we want to do is we're trying to be smart as we raise capital, as we do lease our equipment out. But eventually, you'll see very quickly as these new facilities come online and these new programs start filling, that things turn very quickly in terms of revenues, in terms of profitability, and in terms of cash. And Gary, do you want add more?Gary A. HobartNo, I'd say if you think about what we're looking out with the $2.5 billion backlog, the facilities, the labor, the process, the automation, all that's built in to feed into that. And it's hard to describe the difference between the lines in our income statement that are fixed and variable. A lot of the labor, a lot of the SG&amp;A you're seeing is the precursor to be able to deliver in value to the programs. And so, you'll see numbers that show up in SG&amp;A moving into the COG line, as new labor prudence comes online and has been here, if you have a new hire that's been here for 1 or 2 months, they're not going to be contributing to the program side of things for at least 6 months. So you'll see things moving up the income statement into the COG line, and then from the COG line into revenue and then ultimately on margin. So, think of it in terms of building a business that's looking to generate $1 billion a year of revenue. And that will kind of give you a perspective on how we're trying to stand up the company as far as cost now versus performance later.Unidentified AnalystYes. I understand everything you're telling me. And I mean I've been a part of 3 start-ups, Unfortunately, all 3 of them went bankrupt. I have also been a part of a number of smaller companies that have gone through exactly what you're going through, and it's -- they were in different businesses, so it could be different. But we try to make sure as we ramped up, I mean, if we had sales double year-over-year, we are trying to make sure we leverage some of the fixed costs as we went along. So I don't -- I haven't done 17, but I've certainly done a number of companies, and I've seen some work and some not. So I just -- like I said, when I saw this income statement, I was a little bit concerned. But anyway, I heard what you said it, so I'll just -- we'll just keep watching, so.OperatorWe have a follow-up question from Mike Crawford with B. Riley Securities.Michael Roy CrawfordA little follow-up towards your comment about integrating full payloads and solar panels in addition to buses in the new facility. And that -- in that regard, can you remind us like how proprietary you think your own potential Synthetic Aperture Radar payload solutions might be versus others? And if you could comment on likelihood or a number of conversations of any of these resonating with potential customers that contract with you to build something like that for them?Marc H. BellSo I'll start on -- star panels specifically are incredibly exquisite. They were built originally for the Missile Defense Agency, what was a classified program, it got declassified by Georgia Tech Research Institute. It was paid for by the tax-payer dollars, we thank you for that. And it is an absolutely exquisite antenna. But we are -- but that being said, most of the customers we are talking to about that are a lot of government customers. And so, I can't go into the detail of who we're talking to about it, but it is a very unique American made, which is an important program, and I'm going to leave it there.OperatorOur next question comes from [Ari Santillo from Orange Consulting.]Unidentified AnalystI was wondering about Rivada's waiver that's coming up for your September 2023 delivery.Marc H. BellYou have extra [vibe]. I mean, we know everything you know about the IT. We have no information other than what is publicly filed.Unidentified AnalystFair enough.OperatorOur final question comes from Christopher Frost, a Private Investor.Unidentified AnalystThis question is for Marc. I have -- you stated that you have to replace -- satellites get replaced every 5 years. And I'm wondering with the current amount of satellites you produce, can you keep that flow going?Marc H. BellThat is the reason. Well, it's a good question, and that is the reason why we announced that new facility. So the one is under construction right now will help us, so we can continue to build to keep with that demand.Unidentified AnalystNow, my other question is, this Merritt Island. Is that still a go?Marc H. BellThat was killed by a bald eagle almost over a year ago, exactly.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, today's call has now concluded. We'd like to thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.]"

By absorbing a portion of the outstanding shares, a company effectively reduces the share count implicitly boosting the share price.Companies will do this when the stock is undervalued, or there are limited reinvestment opportunities currently available. Buybacks aren’t without limitations though as there are plenty of ways for companies to enact them in a poor way. However, many of the best companies have a long history of strategically buying back shares at the benefit of investors.Seeing a chart of declining shares outstanding can be one strong indicator of responsible management, and a stock that has likely been trending higher. To further improve the likelihood of buying a good stock, investors can utilize Zacks proprietary research, which identifies stocks with an elevated probability of moving higher in the near term.In this article I will cover three stocks that have considerably reduced their outstanding shares over the last decade, have a strong performing stock, and a high Zacks Rank.  Pulte Group PHM, Steel Dynamics STLD, and W.W. Grainger GWW fit all those criteria.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPulte Group Pulte Group is a homebuilder and financial services company based in the US. The Homebuilding segment offers a wide variety of home designs including single family detached, townhouses, condominiums, and duplexes at different prices. The financial services segment is just 2% of total revenues and offers mortgage banking and title services.Pulte Group has been a persistent buyer of its own shares over the last decade. Over that time the number of shares outstanding has been reduced by 40%. Also in the last decade, PHM shares have compounded at an annual rate of 12.6%, slightly edging out the returns of the S&amp;P 500.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesRevenues over the last ten years have grown tremendously as well, nearly tripling from $5.8 billion in 2014, to $16.8 billion today. PHM has been extremely generous to its shareholders, significantly increasing dividends over that period as well. With growing revenues, and dividends in addition to the share buybacks, PHM’s stock price appreciation is clearly more than just financial engineering.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPulte Group is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 7.5x, which is below the industry average of 10x, and below its 10-year median of 10.4x. PHM also boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSteel DynamicsSteel Dynamics is among the leading steel producers and metal recyclers in the US. It currently has steelmaking and coating capacity of around 16 million tons. STLD is one of the most diversified steel companies in the country with a vast range of specialty products. The company makes and markets steel products, processes and sells recycled ferrous and nonferrous metals, and fabricates and sells steel joist and decking products internationally.Steel Dynamics is another company that has made huge efforts to consistently buy back shares. Between 2016 and today, total shares outstanding have been reduced by 30%. Also, over that period revenues have tripled from $7.7 billion to $21.6 billion, and dividends per share have also tripled.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLike Pulte Group, Steel Dynamics stock has clearly rallied for reasons other than its share buybacks, namely the marked growth in revenues and investor friendly dividend payouts. Since 2016 STLD has compounded at an annual rate of 24%, doubling the annual returns of the broad market index.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSTLD is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 5.9x, which is below the industry average 6.6x, and below its 10-year median of 12x. With such a relatively low valuation as well as a Zack Rank #2 (Buy), STLD is a worthy consideration for investors looking at stocks buying back shares.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchW.W. GraingerW.W. Grainger is a business-to-business distributor of maintenance, repair and operating (MRO) products and services. Its operations are primarily in North America, Japan, and the U.K. Its customers represent a wide array of industries including government, manufacturing, transportation, commercial and contractors. Its products include material-handling equipment, safety and security supplies, lighting and electrical products, power and hand tools, pumps and plumbing supplies, cleaning and maintenance supplies, and metalworking tools.W.W. Grainer’s 20-year buyback campaign has reduced its outstanding shares by 45% over that time. Over that period revenues have tripled from $5 billion to $15 billion and earnings per share have 10x’d $3.02 to $32.21 per share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGWW clearly loves its investors as dividends have also been trending higher over the last 20 years. Dividends per share have climbed from $0.79 in 2004 to $6.88 per share today.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGWW is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 19x, which is in line with the industry average and just below its 10-year median of 20. W.W. Grainger also has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineThese three stocks have shown a history of returning huge amounts of money to investors through both stock buybacks and dividends. Actions like this are typical of stocks with strong long-term returns. Additionally, with the current high Zacks Ranks, they have good chances of good returns in the near-term as well. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

PHM touched a new 52-week high of $68.88 on May 12, 2023. The stock pulled back to end the trading session at $68.43, up 0.46% from the previous day’s closing price of $68.12.Apart from PHM, Taylor Morrison Home Corporation TMHC, Beazer Homes USA, Inc. BZH and M/I Homes MHO also reached new 52-week highs of $44.16, $21.75 and $70.84 on May 12. However, all three stocks pulled back to end the trading session, down by 0.8%, 3.6% and 1.66%, respectively, from the previous day’s closing price.The uptrend in investors’ sentiments might have been boosted by the latest Producer Price Index, published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which shows a 0.2% decline in building materials prices in April 2023.PHM Stock PerformancePHM has gained 50.3% so far this year compared with the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry’s 30.4% growth, the Zacks Construction sector’s 13.6% riseand the S&amp;P 500 Index’s 8.4% rally.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company has been riding on land acquisition strategies and focusing on entry-level buyers. Also, business expansion via community openings in various locations bodes well. The company regularly raises shareholders’ value via repurchases and dividend distribution, which also boosts investors’ sentiment.Despite a challenging sales environment, higher cancellation rates, supply-chain issues and significant inflation, the improving interest rate environment is raising hope.Let’s delve deeper into the factors influencing this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company.Growth Driving FactorsStrong Q1 Results: PulteGroup started 2023 on an impressive note. The company’s first-quarter 2023 earnings and revenues surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased year over year. The company witnessed solid gross orders, closings and margins in the quarter, as well as a 28% increase in earnings per share (EPS) and a 12-month return on equity of 32%. The solid EPS was driven by a 13.5% increase in revenues, improved gross margins and overhead leverage. The number of homes closed increased 6% from the year-ago level to 6,394 units. The average selling price of homes delivered was $545,000, up 9% year over year.Land Strategy: PulteGroup’s land acquisition strategies aim at improving volumes, revenues and profitability on an annual basis. In 2022 and 2021, the company spent $4.5 billion and $4.2 billion on land acquisition and development, respectively. The trend continued in first-quarter 2023, when it spent $906 million on land acquisition and development.PHM currently expects land spending to increase materially in 2023. It expects the land acquisition and development spend in 2023 to be within $3.5-$4 billion, up from the previously considered value of $3.3 billion. Of these, it estimates 65% will go toward developing owned land positions.Apart from this, PulteGroup’s land strategy emphasizes investing in shorter-lived, smaller land assets while expanding the use of land option agreements when possible, thereby mitigating market risk. Consistent with its efforts to improve overall asset efficiency and reduce land risks by optioning lots, the company has successfully reduced its owned land. It ended the first quarter of 2023 with 210,355 lots under control, of which 48.9% were controlled via option.First-Time/Entry-Level Buyers: PulteGroup remains focused on the growing demand for entry-level homes, which aim at lower-priced homes, given affordability concerns prevailing in the U.S. housing market. First-time buyers increased 18% to 3,177 homes for the first quarter of 2023. It comprised 39% of first-timers, 35% of move-ups and 26% of active adults. The shift from mix to first-time is in line with its strategy of having more than one-third of business in the first-time buyer space. Rapid Community Openings: The company recently announced community openings in various locations. On Mar 16, it unveiled a new community in Louisville, The Trails at Belmond. On Mar 8, it introduced expansion in the Greenville market with three new construction communities within its Pulte Homes brand. The first community, Indigo Park, is in Easley and is likely to open this summer. The second community — Briarwood Reserve in Spartanburg — is set to open in late 2023. The last one, Alston Park in Greenville, is expected to open in early 2024.Driving Shareholder Value: PHM has been paying quarterly dividends for nearly four decades. It has consistently focused on sharing its cash flows with shareholders and maintaining a solid financial position. In December 2022, it announced a quarterly dividend hike of 7% to 16 cents per share. This was payable on Jan 3, 2023, to shareholders of record at the close of business on Dec 14, 2022.PHM repurchased 2.8 million shares in first-quarter 2023 for $150 million. At the end of first-quarter 2023, PHM declared cash dividends of $36.1 million. As of Mar 31, 2023, the company had $232.9 million remaining in authorization. On Apr 24, 2023, its board of directors increased the share repurchase authorization by $1 billion.Story continuesDiscussion of Above-Mentioned StocksTaylor Morrison’s ongoing operational enhancements, acquisition synergies and robust pricing power have more than offset the inflationary pressure and delays in some closings. The company’s well-balanced, diverse mix of portfolio and operating strategy is encouraging. TMHC has expanded its market footprint and product positioning in recent years through acquisitions and impressive organic growth, thereby serving a broad range of consumers in the entry-level, first- and second-move-up and resort lifestyle segments across the country. The success of its efforts has been driving growth for the company and enhancing its liquidity level, enabling it to take advantage of investment opportunities as the market evolves.TMHC currently holds a Zacks Rank #1.

146,7330a63a-f296-3146-912f-f92960ba11f7,PHM,2023-05-16,Are You Looking for a Top Momentum Pick? Why PulteGroup (PHM) is a Great Choice,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-top-momentum-pick-why-160004038.html,1684166404,STORY,['PHM'],"[Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at PulteGroup (PHM), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. PulteGroup currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for PHM that show why this homebuilder shows promise as a solid momentum pick.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor PHM, shares are up 2.1% over the past week while the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry is up 0.79% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 13.78% compares favorably with the industry's 8.72% performance as well.While any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Shares of PulteGroup have increased 26.02% over the past quarter, and have gained 60.9% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 1.24% and 6.64%, respectively.Investors should also take note of PHM's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, PHM is averaging 3,308,318 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with PHM.Over the past two months, 6 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost PHM's consensus estimate, increasing from $7.44 to $9.05 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 5 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that PHM is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B.

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about PulteGroup (PHM) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.PulteGroup currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.67, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 12 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.67 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 12 recommendations that derive the current ABR, eight are Strong Buy, representing 66.7% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for PHMBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for PHMCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for PulteGroup here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying PulteGroup, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is PHM a Good Investment?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for PulteGroup, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 21.7% over the past month to $9.05.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for PulteGroup. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for PulteGroup may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Investors following this investing style typically avoid betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. They believe instead that one could make far more money in lesser time by ""buying high and selling higher.""Who doesn't like betting on fast-moving trending stocks? But determining the right entry point isn't easy. Often, these stocks lose momentum once their valuation moves ahead of their future growth potential. In such a situation, investors find themselves loaded up on expensive shares with limited to no upside or even a downside. So, going all-in on momentum could be risky at times.A safer approach could be investing in bargain stocks with recent price momentum. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system) helps identify great momentum stocks by paying close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.There are several stocks that currently pass through the screen and PulteGroup (PHM) is one of them. Here are the key reasons why this stock is a great candidate.Investors' growing interest in a stock is reflected in its recent price increase. A price change of 13.8% over the past four weeks positions the stock of this homebuilder well in this regard.While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. PHM meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 26% over the past 12 weeks.Moreover, the momentum for PHM is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.33. This indicates that the stock moves 33% higher than the market in either direction.Given this price performance, it is no surprise that PHM has a Momentum Score of B, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.Story continuesIn addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped PHM earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, PHM is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. PHM is currently trading at 0.92 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 92 cents for each dollar of sales.So, PHM appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.In addition to PHM, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick.

Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $8.25 billion, up 1.98% from the year-ago period.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Medtronic.

To see more of these stocks, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Vertical Farming and Hydroponic Stocks to Buy.The agriculture and farming sector has long been a vital part of not only financial markets but also day-to-day living for the global population. With global food insecurity being on the rise in recent years, this sector has become even more important and, thus also more burdened. To meet rising demand, increasingly dangerous agricultural practices have been adopted in the past, which have been taking an immense toll on the planet. Many climate change activists thus place the blame on agricultural practices for many current issues such as climate change, deforestation, and soil degradation. Because of this, innovations within the agriculture sector that enable sustainable, environmentally friendly, and affordable crop production have become necessary. Two such innovations are what we know as vertical and hydroponic farming.What are Vertical and Hydroponic Farming?Simply put, vertical farming is farming on vertical surfaces rather than horizontal surfaces. In this method, vertically stacked layers are used to enable farmers to produce more food on the same amount of land, if not less. In many cases, vertical farming is integrated into buildings such as greenhouses and even skyscrapers. However, much more accommodation has to be made for crops being grown with such a method. For instance, farmers have to ensure their crops have enough artificial temperature, light, and water. As such, the area where vertical farming is operative is almost highly controlled by experienced professionals to ensure no crops are lost or wasted.Many agricultural and farming companies, such as Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE), The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS), and Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) have been focusing on sustainable agricultural practices. However, the companies operating directly within the vertical farming and hydroponics space have been leading the agricultural sector in terms of sustainability. Like vertical farming, hydroponic farming is another sustainable agricultural practice. In this method, farmers grow their plants using a water-based nutrient solution instead of soil. This agricultural practice has actually been around for a long time, so it's not exactly a new innovation. According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), the process of growing plants in water culture or sand culture without soil is actually one that has been used by physiologists for over a century. However, with the means and technology utilized by companies working in this space today, the scope and effectiveness of this agricultural practice have grown to greater lengths than ever before.Story continuesAmerican Support for Innovative AgricultureThe USDA has long been committed to increasing the scope of urban and innovative agricultural production on a local level. In 2021, the department announced a grant of $4 million to support this initiative. The 2021 grant was the second of its kind offered by the US government for this purpose, and it spanned two kinds of projects: Planning Projects and Implementation Projects.Under the first category, the USDA attempted to encourage farmers, gardeners, citizens, government officials, schools, and any other stakeholders in urban and suburban areas to initiate projects targeting key areas of food access and more. Under the second category, the department aimed to accelerate the growth and progress of existing urban, indoor, and other agricultural practices to improve local food access.The grants offered by the government in the past were only succeeded by even more generous opportunities in 2022. In October, the USDA again announced that it was investing $14.2 million in 52 grants to support urban agriculture and innovative production. This move was meant to expand the population's access to nutritious foods and increase awareness of climate change, and the money promised in these grants further built on $26.3 million already invested in similar projects since 2020. Such stringent and enthusiastic efforts on the part of the government have managed to make vertical and hydroponic farming more widely practiced across the country and spell out only good news for the companies operating within this space. As such, we have compiled a list of some of the best vertical farming and hydroponic stocks to buy today since they may well skyrocket sometime in the near future.10 Best Vertical Farming and Hydroponic Stocks to BuyPixabay/Public DomainLet's now take a look at the 10 best vertical farming and hydroponic stocks to buy.Our MethodologyTo select the stocks for our list below, we used Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the fourth quarter, when 943 hedge funds were tracked.

153,1cef3511-9dee-3d5d-bb6f-eb5db733f85c,ROK,2023-05-16,3 Momentum Anomaly Stocks to Buy as Markets Witness Downtrend,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-momentum-anomaly-stocks-buy-125212793.html,1684155132,STORY,"['MSTR', 'ROK']","[The equity markets witnessed a downtrend over the past couple of days as concerns related to the health of the overall U.S. economy remained an overhang on investor sentiments. Preliminary data from the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index for May 2023 fell to a six-month low of 57.7 compared to broad-based expectations of a reading of 63.0. Despite improving job market conditions, investors remained worried about a probable recession later this year. Uncertainty over an amicable solution to the debt ceiling crisis further compounded the market gloom.A weaker-than-expected wholesale prices data – often considered a sign of easing inflation – further failed to ease the concerns of a downturn. Wholesale prices rose just 0.2% in April compared with wide expectations of a 0.3% rise. The consumer price index increased 0.4% in April, equating to a 4.9% annual inflation rate – the lowest reading since April 2021. However, lingering financial market stress and uncertain business conditions failed to cheer the markets.With uncertainty becoming the norm of the day, investors often seek to employ time-tested winning strategies to fetch sustained profits. One of the most successful game plans to beat the blues is to bet on momentum stocks when value or growth investing fails to generate the desired profits.This approach primarily tends to follow the adage, “the trend is your friend.” At its core, momentum investing is “buying high and selling higher.” It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend, it is more likely to continue in that direction because of the momentum that is already behind it. But before we delve deep into it, let us try to fathom why does the momentum strategy at all work?There are several behavioral biases that most investors exhibit in their decision-making. And these emotional responses, or rather mistakes, are the very reason that makes the momentum strategy work.For example, some investors are anxious about booking losses and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long, hopeful of a rebound in prices. On the other hand, a few investors sell their winners way too early. Momentum investing is one of the best strategies to avoid making such errors in judgment.Furthermore, investors initially tend to underreact to news, events or data releases. However, once things become clear, they have a habit of going with the flow and overreacting, causing dramatic price reactions. These behavioral problems extend trends, thus opening up huge opportunities for momentum players.To sum up, momentum investing is a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future. It is based on that gap in time before the mean reversion occurs, i.e., before prices become rational again.In this context, stocks like Inter Parfums, Inc. IPAR, Rockwell Automation, Inc. ROK and MicroStrategy Incorporated MSTR are worth betting on.Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha-generative over a long period and across market stages. So, this strategy is quite tricky to implement, as detecting these trends is no child’s play.Here, we have created a strategy to help investors get in on these fast movers and rake in handsome gains. Our screen will help you benefit from both long-term price momentum and a short-term pullback in price.Story continuesScreening ParametersPercentage Change in Price (52 Weeks) = Top #50: This selects the top 50 stocks with the best percentage price change over the last 52 weeks. This parameter ensures we get the best stocks that have appreciated steadily over the past year.Percentage Change in Price (1 Week) = Bottom #10: From the above 50 stocks, we then choose those that are also among the 10 worst performers over a short one-week period. This parameter picks the ones that have witnessed a short-term pullback in price.Zacks Rank #1: Stocks sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have a proven history of outperformance irrespective of the market conditions. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Momentum Style Score of B or Better: A top Momentum Style Score knocks out a lot of the screening process as it takes into account several factors that include volume change and performance relative to its peers. It indicates when the timing is best to grab a stock and take advantage of its momentum with the highest probability of success. Stocks with a Momentum Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy), handily outperform other stocks.Current Price greater than $5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5.Market Capitalization = Top #3000: We have chosen stocks that are among the top 3000 in terms of market value to ensure the stability of price.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that these stocks are easily tradable.Here are three of the six stocks that made it through this screen:Headquartered in New York, Inter Parfums is engaged in the manufacturing, distribution and marketing of a wide range of fragrances and related products. The company sells its products mainly through department stores, specialty stores, perfumeries, domestic and international wholesalers and distributors.

It is my sincere hope that the improvements in pay, quality of life, retirement, and insurance will enable the company to recruit and retain pilots to sustain our continued growth into new markets.”The tentative agreement now goes to union members for ratification. Three weeks of voting will begin on June 2.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Visa Inc. (V), Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and SAP SE (SAP). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Visa’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year (+17.9% vs. +7.7%). The company’s numerous buyouts and alliances paved the way for long-term growth and consistently help drive its sales. For fiscal 2023, our estimate for revenues indicates almost 10% year over year growth. Constant investments in technology are solidifying its position in the payments market.Visa reported solid fiscal Q2 results on the back of higher cross-border volumes. A shift in payments to the digital mode is a boon for Visa. Steady domestic volumes and transactions rise will aid the company in boosting its top line in the coming years. A strong cash position enables it to boost shareholder value.However, high operating expenses stress the company's margins. Ramped-up client incentives will dent the top line. The company's volumes will likely suffer due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.(You can read the full research report on Visa here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Pfizer have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (-23.5% vs. +14.7%). The company’s top line is expected to decline in 2023 due to potentially steep declines in revenues from its COVID-19 products, Comirnaty vaccine and Paxlovid oral pill, on lower demand.Concerns remain about its long-term growth drivers beyond its COVID products due to competitive pressure. Nonetheless, Pfizer boasts a diversified portfolio of innovative drugs and vaccines, including Ibrance and Prevnar.Pfizer is witnessing solid pipeline progress and expects to launch some key non-COVID products in 2023, which can drive long-term sales and profit growth. Its cash position is strong, which can be used to make acquisitions, increase dividends, buy back shares and reduce debt.(You can read the full research report on Pfizer here &gt;&gt;&gt;)SAP’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (+40.2% vs. +19.1%). The company’s performance is benefiting from continued strength in its cloud business (especially the new Rise with SAP solution) across all regions. Momentum in SAP’s business technology platform particularly the S/4HANA solutions augurs well.SAP’s restructuring plan is expected to better align its operating models and go-to-market approach with its accelerated cloud transformation. Frequent product launches like Grow with SAP and SAP Datasphere, and strategic acquisitions and collaborations bode well.However, the company’s performance is affected due to continued softness in software license and support business segment, coupled with global macroeconomic weakness and geopolitical instability. Also, increasing research &amp; development and sales &amp; marketing expenses and stiff competition in the cloud space are concerns.(You can read the full research report on SAP here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include International Business Machines Corp.

156,679977ac-72f5-3fec-9b5d-58ed5b8669f5,ILMN,2023-05-16,"What Is Illumina, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:ILMN) Share Price Doing?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/illumina-inc-nasdaq-ilmn-share-130110936.html,1684155670,STORY,['ILMN'],"[Let's talk about the popular Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN). The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$233 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$194. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Illumina's current trading price of US$209 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Illumina’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Illumina What Is Illumina Worth?According to my valuation model, the stock is currently overvalued by about 27%, trading at US$209 compared to my intrinsic value of $164.40. This means that the opportunity to buy Illumina at a good price has disappeared! If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that Illumina’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from Illumina?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. In Illumina's case, its revenues over the next few years are expected to grow by 51%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. If expense does not increase by the same rate, or higher, this top line growth should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in ILMN’s positive outlook, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe ILMN should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on ILMN for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for ILMN, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.It can be quite valuable to consider what analysts expect for Illumina from their most recent forecasts.

(Photo Credit: U.S. Army)HUNTSVILLE, Ala., May 15, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE: NOC) has delivered key Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS) components for Poland’s WISŁA medium range air defense program. With this delivery, IBCS moves closer to being fully fielded as part of Poland’s advanced air and missile defense program.The recent delivery of the IBCS Integrated Fire Control Network (IFCN) relays supports the WISŁA program’s fielding schedule, which is the first foreign military sale of IBCS. Reaching this milestone provides a critical capability to a key U.S. ally and achieves NATO interoperability goals. “Northrop Grumman is transforming decision making for the U.S. and its allies by integrating sensors and weapons for air and missile defense,” said Rebecca Torzone, vice president and general manager, Combat Systems and Mission Readiness, Northrop Grumman. “IBCS provides Polish air defenders with the ability to make faster, better-informed decisions to deter, disrupt and defeat threats across all domains.”In parallel to the IFCN relay deliveries, Northrop Grumman is conducting a series of integration and test scenarios with the Engagement Operation Centers (EOCs) previously delivered in July 2022, and the relays. These tests and the associated training are important steps toward Poland taking full delivery of their first systems and achieving Basic Operational Capability later in 2023.IBCS implements a modular, open and scalable architecture foundational to integrating available assets in the battlespace, regardless of source, service or domain onto common fire control network. Its architecture enables the efficient and affordable integration of current and future systems and extends the battlespace by disaggregating sensors and effectors. By enabling this high level of network integration, the warfighter is given unprecedented time to make accurate decisions. Through numerous successful development and operational tests and demonstrations, IBCS has proven its capability to connect and fuse multi-service sensor data to multi-service weapons, demonstrating Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) capabilities.Story continuesNorthrop Grumman is a leading global aerospace and defense technology company.

These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum.

Take-Two expects a loss between $1.27 and $1.17 per share.For the quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $1.34 billion, suggesting a rise of 58.42% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.The consensus mark for fiscal third-quarter earnings has been unchanged in the past 30 days at 70 cents, indicating a decline of 39.66% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseTake-Two Interactive Software, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. Quote Take-Two’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters, missing twice. TTWO delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of -3.90% on average.Factors to ConsiderTake-Two’s fiscal fourth-quarter revenues are expected to have benefited from the solid demand for its popular franchises, including Grand Theft Auto (GTA), Red Dead Redemption, NBA 2K and WWE 2K23. The strong adoption of NBA 2K23 and Grand Theft Auto V is expected to have continued in the fiscal fourth quarter.During the to-be-reported quarter, the company released Kerbal Space Program 2 (early access) and WWE 2K23 under its franchise that is likely to have bolstered its game pipeline and driven the top line.The acquisition of Zynga is highly accretive to Take-Two’s business. It enables Take Two to achieve powerful synergies featuring new title releases, top-class portfolio of PC and console games and the execution of cost-saving initiatives, thereby contributing to the top line.Take-Two’s acquisition of Popcore is expected to have strengthened its leadership among hyper-casual publishers with respect to downloads and revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. The combination offers a unique balance of hyper-casual experiences that also prioritize long-term player retention rates.However, rising operating costs are a concern for the company. In the fiscal third quarter, operating expenses surged 123% year over year to $889 million. The company is continuously investing in product development and advertisement to win market share, which is expected to have kept margins under pressure in the to-be-reported quarter.Story continuesWhat Our Model SaysPer the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

The company’s numerous buyouts and alliances paved the way for long-term growth and consistently help drive its sales. For fiscal 2023, our estimate for revenues indicates almost 10% year over year growth. Constant investments in technology are solidifying its position in the payments market.Visa reported solid fiscal Q2 results on the back of higher cross-border volumes. A shift in payments to the digital mode is a boon for Visa. Steady domestic volumes and transactions rise will aid the company in boosting its top line in the coming years. A strong cash position enables it to boost shareholder value.However, high operating expenses stress the company's margins. Ramped-up client incentives will dent the top line. The company's volumes will likely suffer due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.(You can read the full research report on Visa here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Pfizer have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (-23.5% vs. +14.7%). The company’s top line is expected to decline in 2023 due to potentially steep declines in revenues from its COVID-19 products, Comirnaty vaccine and Paxlovid oral pill, on lower demand.Concerns remain about its long-term growth drivers beyond its COVID products due to competitive pressure. Nonetheless, Pfizer boasts a diversified portfolio of innovative drugs and vaccines, including Ibrance and Prevnar.Pfizer is witnessing solid pipeline progress and expects to launch some key non-COVID products in 2023, which can drive long-term sales and profit growth.

The company’s performance is benefiting from continued strength in its cloud business (especially the new Rise with SAP solution) across all regions. Momentum in SAP’s business technology platform particularly the S/4HANA solutions augurs well.SAP’s restructuring plan is expected to better align its operating models and go-to-market approach with its accelerated cloud transformation. Frequent product launches like Grow with SAP and SAP Datasphere, and strategic acquisitions and collaborations bode well.However, the company’s performance is affected due to continued softness in software license and support business segment, coupled with global macroeconomic weakness and geopolitical instability. Also, increasing research &amp; development and sales &amp; marketing expenses and stiff competition in the cloud space are concerns.(You can read the full research report on SAP here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include International Business Machines Corp.

To skip our detailed analysis of the blockchain sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Biggest Blockchain Companies in the World in 2023.Blockchain is a recent technology breakthrough that derives its major value from providing decentralized database storage systems due to which it provides the ultimate form of digital security and scalability. This security means that blockchain technologies will have a major role in the progress of the digitalized economy. A report by OECD discusses how Decentralized Finance, or 'DeFi', will keep gaining significance due to the speed of execution, transaction costs, and security it provides. Despite cryptocurrencies having recent crises, the technology utilized in blockchains that power those currencies is indisputable.What is DeFi?DeFi is a more recent trend in the crypto-asset space. It is meant to replicate traditional financial activities in a decentralized and autonomous manner. This basically entails the provision of financial instruments without any reliance on intermediaries such as exchanges or brokerages. DeFi offers financial services primarily by using smart contracts on a blockchain.One of the major uses of blockchain technology is that of cryptocurrencies. While the cryptocurrency market did see major drops in 2022, Bitcoin, along with many other cryptocurrency tokens, has seen a large rally over the past several months, and a number of crypto-focused equity names have seen substantial year-to-date moves. Investor sentiment towards cryptocurrencies also appears to be healthy, and the reintroduction of the United States legislation to allow retirement plans to include cryptocurrencies show support for the market. In February, Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville spearheaded this move. He stated that the Financial Freedom Act, first introduced in the US Senate in May 2022, was meant to reverse the Department of Labor's policy directing what type of investments were allowed in retirement plans. Tuberville further stated that this bill would bar the Department of Labor from interfering with the usage of brokerage windows to invest in cryptocurrency. This move of governmental support is expected to sustain the rise of cryptocurrency.Story continuesAccording to analysts, this rise is expected to continue due to an ease in macroeconomic activities. Companies including Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) have been investing to leverage blockchain technologies and profit from the crypto rally.

(PYPL) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-holdings-inc-pypl-attracting-130001419.html,1684155601,STORY,['PYPL'],"[Paypal (PYPL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this technology platform and digital payments company have returned -19.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.9% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which Paypal belongs, has gained 1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Paypal is expected to post earnings of $1.18 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +26.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.91 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +18.9%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.67 indicates a change of +15.6% from what Paypal is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Paypal.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PYPL _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Paypal, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.26 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +6.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $29.52 billion and $32.15 billion estimates indicate +7.3% and +8.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPaypal reported revenues of $7.04 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.6%. EPS of $1.17 for the same period compares with $0.88 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.99 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.69%. The EPS surprise was +6.36%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Paypal is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Paypal. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The PayPal stock slumped 5.4% after market on May 8, responding to earnings results. Shares slumped due to transaction margin pressures despite a spike in guidance.The payments’ giant cautioned that its adjusted operating margin won’t grow as quickly as the company had previously anticipated, even after spending on its platforms surged more than expected in the first quarter, per Bloomberg (read: PayPal ETFs to Dump on Weak Guidance?).Daily Google Bull 1.5X Shares Direxion GGLL – Up 17.2%Following a series of artificial intelligence announcements made by Alphabet at its I/O developer conference, the company witnessed a significant boost in its stock prices, with shares surging approximately 5% on Wednesday. This surge resulted in an overnight increase of $82 billion in Alphabet's overall market value.

Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund UUP added about 1.6% on strong jobs data, which drove bets over more Fed rate hikes. As gold prices dived, gold miners’ stocks too declined, which is why this inverse/leveraged gold mining ETF jumped.Ultrashort Silver -2X ETF ZSL – Up 14.6%Silver, too, suffered the same fate as gold. While the metal slumped due to the rising greenback, recessionary fears also weighed on the metal as silver is viewed as an important industrial metal. As a result, inverse/leveraged silver ETFs jumped last week.Story continuesUltra Bloomberg Natural Gas 2X ETF BOIL – Up 13.0%Reduced natural gas output in Canada triggered short-covering in natural gas futures last week.  A total of 102 wildfires were burning in Alberta, with 27 regarded as out of control.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Visa Inc. (V), Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and SAP SE (SAP). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Visa’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year (+17.9% vs. +7.7%). The company’s numerous buyouts and alliances paved the way for long-term growth and consistently help drive its sales. For fiscal 2023, our estimate for revenues indicates almost 10% year over year growth. Constant investments in technology are solidifying its position in the payments market.Visa reported solid fiscal Q2 results on the back of higher cross-border volumes. A shift in payments to the digital mode is a boon for Visa. Steady domestic volumes and transactions rise will aid the company in boosting its top line in the coming years. A strong cash position enables it to boost shareholder value.However, high operating expenses stress the company's margins. Ramped-up client incentives will dent the top line. The company's volumes will likely suffer due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.(You can read the full research report on Visa here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Pfizer have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (-23.5% vs. +14.7%). The company’s top line is expected to decline in 2023 due to potentially steep declines in revenues from its COVID-19 products, Comirnaty vaccine and Paxlovid oral pill, on lower demand.Concerns remain about its long-term growth drivers beyond its COVID products due to competitive pressure. Nonetheless, Pfizer boasts a diversified portfolio of innovative drugs and vaccines, including Ibrance and Prevnar.Pfizer is witnessing solid pipeline progress and expects to launch some key non-COVID products in 2023, which can drive long-term sales and profit growth. Its cash position is strong, which can be used to make acquisitions, increase dividends, buy back shares and reduce debt.(You can read the full research report on Pfizer here &gt;&gt;&gt;)SAP’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (+40.2% vs. +19.1%). The company’s performance is benefiting from continued strength in its cloud business (especially the new Rise with SAP solution) across all regions. Momentum in SAP’s business technology platform particularly the S/4HANA solutions augurs well.SAP’s restructuring plan is expected to better align its operating models and go-to-market approach with its accelerated cloud transformation. Frequent product launches like Grow with SAP and SAP Datasphere, and strategic acquisitions and collaborations bode well.However, the company’s performance is affected due to continued softness in software license and support business segment, coupled with global macroeconomic weakness and geopolitical instability. Also, increasing research &amp; development and sales &amp; marketing expenses and stiff competition in the cloud space are concerns.(You can read the full research report on SAP here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include International Business Machines Corp.

In fact, The Weather Company has been the world's most accurate forecaster overall every year since the study began in 2017.2Accuracy has become increasingly paramount as people and businesses continue to monitor weather forecasts to help them make decisions, especially amid the growing volatility of weather and a changing climate. In fact, a recent study validated that 91% of respondents cited accuracy among the top five leading criteria for why they select a weather provider.3In its latest comprehensive report of forecast accuracy released today,2 Global and Regional Weather Forecast Accuracy Overview, 2017-2022, commissioned by IBM, ForecastWatch named IBM's The Weather Company as the weather forecast provider whose forecasts were more likely to be the most accurate across all geographic regions studied and time periods covered. Further, the report data showed that the accuracy gap between The Weather Company (noted as The Weather Channel in the report) and the next best overall provider has grown larger since the study began, from 2 times in 2017 to over 3 times more likely in 2022 to be the most accurate forecaster, even with the addition of more weather providers studied.1""We're seeing more companies jump into the business of weather forecasting as weather becomes more erratic and impactful. Despite increased competition, this report validates our continued innovation and leadership in weather accuracy,"" said Sheri Bachstein, CEO of The Weather Company, an IBM Business.

If you want to see more companies in this selection, go to the 5 Biggest Quantum Computing Companies in the World.The quantum computing industry is a rapidly evolving and expanding field with significant potential for growth and development in the coming years. According to Precedence Research, the size of the quantum computing industry is expected to grow by over 12 times from $10.13 billion in 2022 to $125 billion by the end of this decade. This would reflect a compound annual growth rate of 36.9% from 2022 to 2030. There has been a noteworthy increase in investment in the quantum computing industry in recent years, with governments, corporations, and venture capital firms all pouring funds into the development of quantum computing hardware, software, and applications.As the demand for large-scale data analysis and simulation in the industry increases, quantum computing hardware and software development have become crucial. Notable startups in this sector, including Xanadu, ColdQuanta, and QC Ware, along with well-established corporations such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), D-Wave Systems (NYSE:QBTS), and IonQ, Inc. (NYSE:IONQ) are playing an important role in advancing quantum computing hardware and software. These companies have made significant strides in improving the stability, coherence, and number of qubits, which is a crucial step toward achieving large-scale quantum computing capabilities.McKinsey has labelled quantum computing as “one of the next big trends” in the field of technology. Quantum computing, which is just one facet of the broader domain of quantum technology, holds significant promise and is projected to contribute approximately $1.3 trillion in value by the year 2035.  In the coming years, the key players in the quantum computing industry are expected to progressively enhance the qubit capacity of their computers. However, this progress is anticipated to be gradual. According to McKinsey's estimation, by 2030, the number of operational quantum computers is expected to reach approximately 5,000 only. Furthermore, the development of hardware and software capable of handling the most intricate problems may not materialize until 2035 or even later. This projected timeline underscores the challenges involved in advancing quantum computing technology to its full potential.Story continuesCurrently, prominent Wall Street banks are at the forefront of exploring the potential of quantum technology. A researcher from Goldman Sachs stated in January 2020 that quantum computing has the capacity to become a crucial technology. In addition to Goldman Sachs, other major players in the financial industry, such as JPMorgan and Citigroup, have also established their own quantum computing initiatives and have made investments in quantum computing startups. In 2020, JPMorgan conducted experiments using Honeywell International Inc.'s (NASDAQ:HON) quantum computer with the goal of streamlining mathematical operations that involve Fibonacci numbers. These initiatives show how financial organizations are becoming increasingly interested in using quantum computing to solve complex computational problems.15 Biggest Quantum Computing Companies in the WorldPhoto by Anton Maksimov juvnsky on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe conducted extensive research and consulted various industry reports, reputed publications, and news articles to shortlist the 15 biggest quantum computing companies in the world.

Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU)Market Capitalization: $41.41 billion2022 Total Revenue: $17.87 billion (¥123.68 billion)Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) is a Beijing, China-based tech corporation that has been investing in the field of quantum computing in recent years. The company's dedicated research team has been actively involved in the development of both quantum computing hardware and software. In August 2022, Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) introduced its first superconducting quantum computer, demonstrating its progress in integrating hardware, software, and applications. Additionally, Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) has pioneered the development of a comprehensive quantum hardware-software integration solution, enabling access to a wide range of quantum chips through various platforms such as cloud services, mobile applications, and personal computers.Here's what Horos Asset Management said about Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“As I mentioned at the beginning of this quarterly letter, we took advantage of the meltdown in technology platforms to initiate new positions in companies in which we had already been shareholders in the past and whose valuation did not, until now, provide a sufficiently high margin of safety. Such is the case of PayPal and Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU).In the case of Baidu, as many will know, it is known as the “Chinese Google”. The company has been the leading Internet search engine in the Asian country for years, which has given it a historically privileged position to monetize, through online advertising, a huge user base. However, the rise of two types of applications has called into question the sustainability of its business model. On the one hand, mobile social apps, such as ByteDance’s well-known TikTok, have emerged as a new model of online consumption, generating a new platform through which to monetize Internet users. On the other hand, even more disruptive in the long term, is the emergence of the so-called super apps: a sort of virtual Swiss Army knives that allow users to access many products and services without having to leave their interface at any time, making Baidu’s traditional search engine less attractive. In this field, Tencent (with its super app Weixin/WeChat), Alibaba (Alipay) and Meituan certainly stand out. These two factors have caused Baidu’s online advertising market share to drop from 17% in 2017 to less than 7% estimated for 2022.34 To this deterioration, we should add the collapse in market value of its stake in iQiyi (video platform controlled by Baidu) and its equity holdings such as Trip.com (hotel and flight platform) …” (Click here to read the full text)8. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)Market Capitalization: $115.29 billion2022 Total Revenue: $60.53 billionInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is an Armonk, New York-based technology company. The entity is considered a trendsetter in the field of quantum computing, having developed some of the earliest quantum computers and quantum algorithms. The company has also established the IBM Quantum Network, which connects researchers and developers working on quantum computing. International Business Machines Corporation's (NYSE:IBM) quantum computing technology is based on superconducting qubits, which are integrated into a quantum processor that is designed to be scalable and reliable.Diamond Hill Capital shared its outlook on International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“New positions initiated in Q4 included shorts International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), Acushnet Holdings (GOLF) and elf Beauty (ELF). Since diversified information technology company IBM’s 2019 acquisition of Red Hat, the company has aggressively pursued a hybrid cloud strategy. Though IBM and its new management team have made solid progress on this pivot, we believe the company still meaningfully lags the cloud hyperscalers and other cloud-native companies. Management has also laid out aggressive long-term targets for revenue growth and free cash flow, both of which we believe the company will struggle to achieve as it faces intense competition in its hybrid cloud business and structural headwinds in the company’s legacy businesses.”7. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)Market Capitalization: $124.55 billion2022 Total Revenue: $63.05 billionIntel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is a Santa Clara, California-based technology company that has been heavily investing in quantum computing research and development (R&amp;D). The company has made significant headway in developing its quantum computing hardware, software, and algorithms. Intel Corporation’s (NASDAQ:INTC) quantum computing technology is based on a different approach than many other companies in the industry, using spin qubits instead of superconducting qubits. Spin qubits are implemented using silicon, which is a mature and well-understood technology that Intel has extensive experience with. Intel Corporation’s (NASDAQ:INTC) approach is designed to enable easier manufacturing and scalability of quantum computing systems.Here's what ClearBridge Investments said about Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Also on the detractor side, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) delivered a disappointing revenue miss and lowered full-year revenue and earnings guidance as COVID-19-driven demand for PCs abated (where Intel enjoys half its sales) and a delay in its flagship Sapphire Rapids CPU hurt its data center business. Despite these issues, we still believe Intel is an economically sensitive turnaround story with substantial upside.”6. Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON)Market Capitalization: $132.22 billion2022 Total Revenue: $35.47 billionHoneywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) is a Charlotte, North Carolina-based company that is a new entrant in the quantum computing industry, focusing on developing quantum computers for industrial and commercial use.

A risk-averse position is the primary means by which to achieve that goal. It’s the tortoise approach of slow and steady gains that leads to a win over the long term.That means investors should choose the most reliable types of dividend stocks. High-yield stocks are out and lower-yield dividend shares with established track records of steady increases are in.Even the highest risk-seeking retail investor has to admit that being able to reliably count on a steady income and slow but sure price appreciation has its perks. That contingent should consider those factors as well, especially as we near an expected recession.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCHDChurch &amp; Dwight$96.38CBChubb$201.39AOSA.O. Smith$68.40NDSNNordson$216.24MCDMcDonald’s$294.79IBMIBM$120.90BF.BBrown-Forman$64.22Church &amp; Dwight (CHD)boxes of Arm &amp; Hammer baking sodaSource: ThamKC / Shutterstock.comChurch &amp; Dwight (NYSE:CHD) stock is in an excellent position following its strong Q1 showing. There’s a lot that can be said about it in the current macro economy. CPG firms are performing particularly well.Consumers continue to pay for name-brand goods and overall spending remains strong despite continued inflation. In 2023, that has equated to overall strength for Church &amp; Dwight.Let’s look at the numbers because they emphasize those truths clearly. Company-wide revenues increased by 10.2% in the first quarter.Those are strong numbers for a firm that has been around so long and derives the bulk of its sales from a boring product. But it’s also a testament to the power of having a brand champion like Arm &amp; Hammer baking soda that is instantly recognizable.That is especially true in the U.S. where domestic sales increased by 12.2% in the first quarter. Boring? For sure. But super reliable with a dividend that has grown continuously annually since 1985.Story continuesIf you bought CHD stock prior to the Q1 earnings release, all the better. But if you didn’t it still makes sense after the price jumped up given the increased guidance and overall reliability.Chubb (CB)Person holding cellphone with logo of Swiss insurance company Chubb Limited on screen in front of business webpage. CB stock.Source: T. Schneider / ShutterstockChubb (NYSE:CB) engages in what is arguably an even more boring business than selling baking soda. The stock represents a property and casualty insurance business.It helps people protect the things they own while also protecting people from the harm they do to others and their property. Very boring and very necessary.And while Chubb is arguably not very interesting it does excite in terms of the potential upside it offers to investors: Its target price is roughly 25% above its current price. That’s without any sort of downturn bringing prices sharply lower. Instead, Chubb shares have appreciated steadily over the past few years with additional upside ahead. That’s a sweet deal that gets sweet when you consider its reliable dividend yielding 1.72%.Chubb’s recent results showed slightly shrinking revenues. But that wasn’t a problem given the firm’s record operating income that increased by 11.8%. Earnings were strong and in line with analysts’ expectations leading to further predictability overall.A.O. Smith (AOS)Source: ShutterstockA.O. Smith (NYSE:AOS) further cements an overarching pattern among stocks that provide steady returns: Flashy, innovative business models are out, and everyday products reign supreme.That’s very true of A.O. Smith which sells commercial and residential water heaters. Although company-wide sales declined by 1% in the first quarter, it was a convincing performance. Adjusted earnings per share reached $0.94, well above the highest portion of the analyst earnings range.A.O. Smith’s GAAP EPS of $0.84 was a record for the first quarter.The result was that management raised the overall 2023 EPS outlook by 10 cents to $3.30 on the low end and $3.50 at the high end.That likely means that AOS stock can run higher in 2023 even as it is currently closing in on being fully priced. Its dividend is at the higher end of the payout range but isn’t concerning because it remains in the healthy range and hasn’t been reduced since 1985.Nordson (NDSN)AI. Circuit board. Technology background. Central Computer Processors CPU concept. Motherboard digital chip. Tech science background. Integrated communication processor. 3D illustration representing semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockNordson (NYSE:NDSN) sells adhesive application systems that are used across various industries, including semiconductors, biotechnology, and packaging.There’s nothing sexy about that, but what is sexy about the company is the fact that it has been paying increasingly greater income to investors since 1964. With a low payout ratio of 0.27, there’s plenty of room left for future increases.Nordson was added to the dividend aristocrats in 2022. In terms of reliability, it doesn’t get much better than that. It’s the kind of risk-averse provider of steady returns that quietly goes about its job and then surprises you one day.Case in point: Over the past 10 years it has provided 12.79% annual returns. That was enough to more than triple an investor’s capital over that periodNordson is a profitable company that offers strong margins and high returns to investors with a sound track record over a lengthy period of time.McDonald’s (MCD)McDonald's golden archesSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / ShutterstockMcDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) stock, like others on this list, turns capital into greater sums of capital over the mid-term.For example, the 14.41% annual returns in MCD shares over the past 10 years would have nearly quadrupled an investor’s capital. That’s far above what you’d receive in any savings account or certificate of deposit but all-in-all, nearly as safe.Strong historical performance isn’t the only reason to invest right now. McDonald’s is performing very well and continues to pass on higher prices to consumers who happily oblige.Management attributes the strong performance to operational overhauls that have improved speed and accuracy. Those certainly matter. However, the U.S. consumer has also shown their spending prowess won’t be stopped despite the macroeconomy.MCD stock is sitting near record highs but with efficiency as the current focus, there’s plenty of reason to believe shares continue to rise.IBM (IBM)The IBM 5160 is a version of the IBM PC with a built-in hard drive. Released on March 8, 1983. The 5100 series are knowns as one of the first home computers.Source: Twin Design / Shutterstock.comIBM (NYSE:IBM) shares have been an underperformer for the past decade. In fact, they’ve returned less than 1% annually during that period. IBM stock traded near $200 a decade ago. Today it trades for $122.That’s precisely the type of trend line investors want to avoid. But the rub comes from a few factors that favor IBM. For one, it is a noted leader in AI with Watson.Side note, it has paused hiring in certain jobs and expects AI to replace nearly 8,000 jobs within time and 30% of its back office over the next 5 years. It’s clear that the company has an eye toward efficiency that could erase some of the misery of its performance over the past decade.Further, it’s expected to appreciate by $20 over the next year or so. It pays a relatively high-yield dividend that makes it riskier than many might investors might care for. But the upside income it provides while AI offers growth makes IBM a potential turnaround story for this decade.Brown-Forman (BF.B)Person holding cellphone with logo of American spirits company Brown-Forman (BF-B) Corporation on screen in front of webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comBrown-Forman (NYSE:BF.B) stock hasn’t performed especially well in 2023. In fact, it’s slightly down year-to-date. The alcohol company’s most recent earnings showed moderate top-line growth of 4%. But that wasn’t the problem. The problem was declining income including operating income which fell by 11%.Those results naturally raise the question of why then should investors consider Brown-Forman at all. The answer is twofold: steady reliability and reason to believe that the company has turned a corner.It’s steady reliability is a dividend that remains in a healthy payout range and hasn’t been reduced since 1985. The reason to believe the company has turned a corner comes as normalizing supply chains that caused finished inventories to fall behind until recently.The company also has a few products that provide strong growth in its Jack Daniel’s and Woodford Reserve brands. Further, ready-to-drink products have also grown very rapidly at 12% in the most recent quarter.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Aerial footage from Houston television stations showed crews trying to put out flames at the Galveston Bay refinery, which is along a stretch of Texas coast that is heavily populated by petrochemical facilities.Neither the company nor authorities immediately said whether anyone else was injured.“The safety of our workers and the community is our top priority, and a full investigation will be conducted to determine the cause of the incident,” Marathon said in a statement.Texas City police said that by Monday afternoon the fire was under control and contained in the facility. The company had earlier said it had accounted for all workers.Fires at refineries in the area are not uncommon. Earlier this month, a fire at a Shell facility in nearby Deer Park sent nine workers to the hospital and caused massive plumes of smoke.In March, an explosion and fire at a facility owned by INEOS Phenol in nearby Pasadena, Texas, left one injured.The fire comes after a 2005 explosion — one of the worst refinery explosions in U.S. history — left 15 dead and 180 others injured at this same facility, which was then owned by BP. It was sold to Marathon in 2013, renamed the Galveston Bay refinery and in 2018 merged with another Marathon facility to become what it is today, according to previous statements by BP and Marathon.]"

Weighed down by shrinking margins, most sector operators are projected to post weaker year-over-year quarterly earnings in the remainder of 2023. Worse still, the rise in costs on the back of persistent inflation continues to eat into profits.Nevertheless, the space continues to benefit from strong product demand due to increasing travel and mobility. In the present environment, we advise investors to look at fundamentally solid companies like Marathon Petroleum, Valero Energy, Murphy USA and PBF Energy.Industry OverviewThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry consists of companies involved in selling refined petroleum products (including heating oil, gasoline, jet fuel, residual oil, etc.) and a plethora of non-energy materials (like asphalt, road salt, clay and gypsum). Some companies also operate refined products' terminals, storage facilities and transportation services. The primary activity of these firms involves buying crude/other feedstocks, and processing them into a wide variety of refined products.Refining margins are extremely volatile and generally reflect the state of petroleum product inventories, demand for refined products, imports, regional differences, and capacity utilization in the refining industry. Other major determinants of refining profitability are the light/heavy and sweet/sour spreads. Refiners are also prone to unplanned outages.3 Trends Defining the Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing Industry's FutureSoftening Margin Backdrop: While refining margins are still relatively healthy, they have moderated considerably from the spectacular levels of 2022. Crack spreads (or difference between the price of refined products and crude oil) have come down too. Recessionary impact, if any, will drive down profitability further. With oil exports from Russia continuing to find new outlets like India and China despite price caps and sanctions, product supplies have not tightened to the extent that was expected. This implies that global refinery margins have lately lost steam, depressing the profits of the downstream companies.    Story continuesFuel Demand Remains Healthy: Of late, refiners have been supported by a marked improvement in refined products' consumption — primarily gasoline and diesel — on the back of increasing travel and mobility. Per the U.S. Energy Department's latest release, gasoline inventories are around 7% below the five-year average, signaling robust oil product usage in the market. In other words, this indicates surging consumption of gasoline, diesel and other refined products.As economic activity remains resilient and Americans take to the road with a vengeance amid post-pandemic recovery, refined products' usage should continue to gain traction throughout 2023. The refiners should also benefit from increased driving and accelerating international travel.Ongoing Supply-Chain Bottlenecks: Despite the relatively bullish energy landscape and improved demand environment, the industry has not been immune to supply-chain disruptions and cost inflation. Macro issues like higher transportation expenses, driver scarcity and labor shortages have limited refiners' ability to ship packaged volumes to their customers.Most operators have also felt the impact of inflation, which is rolling through the cost structure. What's worse is that these headwinds across the system and the subsequent hit to profitability (due to difficulty in passing through the increased costs to clients) are expected to continue in the near future.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates a Bearish OutlookThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing is a 16-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #164, which places it in the bottom 34% of some 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates fairly strong near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Despite the dim near-term prospects of the industry, we will present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio. But it's worth taking a look at the industry's shareholder returns and current valuation first.Industry Outperforms Sector But Lags S&amp;P 500The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry has fared better than the broader Zacks Oil – Energy sector over the past year but has underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the same period.The industry has inched up 1.2% over this period compared with the broader sector's decline of 1%. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 4.4%.Industry's Current ValuationSince oil and gas companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just equity but also the level of debt. For capital-intensive companies, EV/EBITDA is a better valuation metric because it is not influenced by changing capital structures and ignores the effect of noncash expenses.On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 1.34X, significantly lower than the S&amp;P 500's 12.17X. It is also below the sector's trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA of 2.78X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 6.90X, as low as 1.30X, with a median of 4.31X.4 Stocks to Watch ForMurphy USA: It is a leading independent retailer of motor fuel and convenience merchandise in the United States. The proximity of Murphy USA's fuel stations to Walmart supercenters helps the company to leverage the strong and consistent traffic that these stores attract. MUSA's acquisition of QuickChek Corporation — a family-owned food and beverage chain located — is expected to help improve its offerings.Over the past 30 days, this El Dorado, AR-based Murphy USA has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 improve 2.2%. MUSA beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters, the average being 15.6%. The company carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Shares of MUSA have gained 11.5% in a year.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Marathon Petroleum: The company is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products. MPC's $23.3 billion acquisition of Andeavor has integrated the premier assets of both companies, bolstering the scale and leadership position of the combined entity in the United States. As it is, Marathon Petroleum's access to lower cost of crude in the Permian, Bakken, and Canada helps it to benefit from the differentials.MPC beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 14.2%. Valued at around $47.4 billion, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) Marathon Petroleum has gained 14.8% in a year.PBF Energy: PBF Energy has one of the most complex refining systems in the United States. As a result, the firm has the capacity to generate lighter and better grades of refined products. PBF's daily processing capacity of 1,000,000 barrels of crude is higher than most of its peers.PBF, based in Parsippany, NJ, beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters, the average being 18.5%. The Zacks #3 Ranked PBF's shares are up 16% in a year.Valero Energy: Among all the independent refiners, Valero offers the most diversified refinery base with a capacity of 3.1 million barrels per day in its 15 refineries located throughout the United States, Canada and the Caribbean. The majority of VLO's refining plants are located in the Gulf Coast area, from where there is easy access to export facilities.VLO beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 11.7%. Valued at around $40.1 billion, the Zacks Rank #3 Valero Energy has lost 11.3% in a year.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

188,07f00ee2-daf1-4d0e-972a-ca5d04f1a25d,GM,2023-05-16,NHTSA demands the recall of 67M potentially deadly airbag inflators; company disagrees,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nhtsa-demands-the-recall-of-67m-potentially-deadly-airbag-inflators-company-disagrees-185932306.html,1684177172,STORY,"['000981.SZ', 'GM']","[The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is demanding that the maker of a potentially defective airbag component recall 67 million units. But the manufacturer, ARC Automotive, says it isn’t proceeding with the recall.The Knoxville, Tennessee-based subsidiary of China’s Sensteed Hi-Tech Group (000981.SZ) makes inflators for airbag modules, which have been used by at least 12 different automakers in the U.S., according to NHTSA.The ARC airbag inflators used before 2018 have been found, based on field reports collected by NHTSA, to have a certain defect where in some cases the inflator ruptures when inflating—and metal particles are ejected in the passenger compartment. (ARC airbag inflators made after 2018 include a safety feature that detects debris in the inflator “mitigating the possibility of field rupture."")NHTSA cites 9 specific incidents that lead to bodily injury (two of which were outside the US). Those include two that lead to fatal injuries. The incidents started in 2009, with the latest in March of 2023.""NHTSA has investigated and identified a risk associated with a set of ARC air bag inflators that if left unaddressed would lead to more incidents in the future,"" a NHTSA spokesperson said in a statement to Yahoo Finance. ""While incidents are rare, the incidents that have occurred have been severe, prompting the agency to issue a recall request. NHTSA is taking this action under its authorities to investigate potential defects and oversee recalls as required by the Vehicle Safety Act.""NHTSA reports the incidents occurring in vehicles made by Stellantis (Chrysler), Kia, GM, and Audi, as well as remedial efforts made by BMW, Ford, GM and Volkswagen to address issues with the airbags.GM in fact issued a recall on May 12 of nearly 1 million vehicles with the ARC airbag inflators due to the possible defect; four of the incidents cited by NHTSA involved GM vehicles.The 2017 GMC Acadia (L) and Acadia Denali are introduced at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, January 12, 2016. REUTERS/Mark Blinch (Mark Blinch / reuters)“General Motors is voluntarily recalling certain 2014 to 2017 model year Chevrolet Traverse, GMC Acadia and Buick Enclave models. In these vehicles, the front-driver airbag inflator may contain a supplier manufacturing defect that may result in inflator rupture during deployment,” a GM spokesman said in a statement to Yahoo Finance. “GM is taking this expanded field action out of an abundance of caution and with the safety of our customers as our highest priority.”Story continuesIn a letter to NTSA dated May 11th, ARC wrote that while it agrees with GM’s move to recall the vehicles due to “potential concerns” about the inflators, it disagrees with NHTSA’s demand for a full recall.ARC wrote in its letter that NHTSA’s investigation into the defect was “not based upon any objective technical or engineering conclusion,” but rather conclusions and inferences based on the seven incidents that occurred in the US. “The Agency then asks ARC to prove a negative – that the 67 million inflators in this population are not defective,” ARC wrote.ARC says NHTSA, vehicle manufacturers, and airbag module suppliers were not able to determine a “root cause” for the ruptures in the inflators, and ARC believes the issues in defective inflators were “one-off” manufacturing anomalies that were addressed by automakers in specific recalls done in the past.ARC says that under the NHTSA Safety Act, a “defect” means more than an isolated failure, and NHTSA’s recall demand falls short of “establishing a common root cause or that these failures were anything other than occasional or isolated.”Finally, ARC says that NHTSA’s ability to demand safety recalls does not apply to parts manufacturers like ARC. “The Safety Act and NHTSA’s implementing regulations expressly provide that vehicle manufacturers, not original equipment manufacturers, shall have recall responsibility for any defects found in original equipment installed in their vehicles.”The next steps? Assuming an impasse remains between NHTSA and ARC, NHTSA could schedule a public hearing, or initiate litigation to compel ARC to recall its airbag inflators.ARC did not immediately respond when Yahoo Finance reached out for comment.—Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

This included a repurchase of 2.4 million common shares worth $0.4 billion. The repurchase was done under a 100-million repurchase plan authorized in second-quarter 2022. Of this, nearly 47% was available for repurchase as of Mar 31, 2023.However, per management, share repurchase activity is expected to be reduced in second-quarter 2023 due to the recent market volatility and increased economic uncertainty.PNC Financial has also scaled business through numerous bank and non-bank acquisitions. In September 2022, the company closed the buyout of Linga, a payment solutions firm, in a bid to expand corporate payment capabilities in the hospitality and restaurant industry space.Story continuesIn June 2021, the company completed the buyout of BBVA USA Bancshares Inc. The acquisition boosted its foothold as a commercial bank in all top 30 markets of the United States, adding$82.2 billion of deposits and $60.5 billion of loans to its balance sheet.PNC Financial stands solid from the balance-sheet perspective. Total loans and deposits have witnessed a four-year (2018-2022) compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.6% and 13%, respectively. The rising trend continued sequentially in first-quarter 2023 in terms of loans and deposits. With decent pipelines, the company is well-poised for loan balance growth in 2023. The company expects loans to rise 1-3% in 2023.PNC Financial stands solid from the balance-sheet perspective. Total loans and deposits have witnessed a four-year (2018-2022) compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.6% and 13%, respectively. The rising trend continued in first-quarter 2023. With decent pipelines, the company is well-poised for loan balance growth in 2023. The company expects loans to rise 1-3% in 2023.It must be noted that during the time when several regional banks, including Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank, witnessed deposit flights, leading to their collapse in early March, PNC was able to increase its deposit balance. Both Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank were seized by the FDIC and then sold to New York Community Bancorp, Inc. NYCB and First Citizens BancShares, Inc. FCNCA, respectively.NYCB, through its bank subsidiary, Flagstar Bank, acquired $38 billion in assets (excluding digital asset banking, crypto-related assets or the fund banking business) and assumed $36 billion of liabilities of Signature Bank, while FCNCA assumed Silicon Valley Bank’s assets worth $110 billion, deposits worth $56 billion and loans worth $72 billion.Therefore, PNC was a beneficiary of the deposits flight from the regional banking crisis. For 2023, period-end loans are expected to rise 1-3%. Despite near-term headwinds like rising expenses and a worsening operating backdrop, PNC stock is fundamentally sound.Also, the stock has lost 29.4% so far this year and is trading just 1.2% above its 52-week low, making a compelling “buy on the dip” choice.Therefore, income investors must keep this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock on their radar as this will help generate robust returns over time.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Currently, GDF Suez SA has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Pinnacle West has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that ENGIY is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.ENGIY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 8.84, while PNW has a forward P/E of 19.99. We also note that ENGIY has a PEG ratio of 1.95. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. PNW currently has a PEG ratio of 3.70.Another notable valuation metric for ENGIY is its P/B ratio of 0.79. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, PNW has a P/B of 1.48.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to ENGIY's Value grade of B and PNW's Value grade of C.Story continuesENGIY stands above PNW thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that ENGIY is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $25.37 billion, indicating a small rise of 0.8% from the prior-year reported figure.The bottom line of this general merchandise retailer is anticipated to have declined year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share for the quarter under review has declined by a couple of cents to $1.75 over the past seven days. The consensus mark suggests a sharp decline from earnings of $2.19 reported in the year-ago period.We expect revenues to be down 0.3% year over year to $25,102.6 million and the bottom line to decline 26.2% to $1.62 per share.Target has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 16.1%, on average. In the last reported quarter, this Minneapolis, MN-based company’s bottom line outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 36%.Key Things to NoteConsumer spending activity has somewhat slowed down. This is because inflation and recession-wary shoppers have curtailed spending. Underlying price pressure and a higher interest rate environment have squeezed consumers’ disposable income, compelling them to rein in discretionary spending. Target might have witnessed soft demand for discretionary products, partly offset by sustained strength in essentials.On its last earnings call, management guided a low-single-digit decline to low-single-digit growth in comparable sales for the first quarter. We expect a 0.5% decline in comparable sales in the quarter under discussion.Target Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseTarget Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseTarget Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Target Corporation QuoteWe believe that higher clearance and promotional markdown rates as well as higher net merchandise costs might have weighed on margins. Target projected first-quarter fiscal 2023 operating margin rate between 4% and 5%, down from 5.3% reported in the year-ago quarter. Target foresees first-quarter SG&amp;A expense rate to be about one percentage point higher than a year-ago period. As a result, it guided adjusted earnings per share in the band of $1.50-$1.90, down from $2.19 per share posted in the prior-year period.Nonetheless, management has been undertaking cost-control measures, such as working with vendors and driving continued operational efficiencies. The company’s digital endeavors, store investments and merchandise actions to gain market share are expected to have aided its performance.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Target this time.

196,2902edf9-0897-3e83-ad18-d4f7b77d622b,TGT,2023-05-16,"Walmart, Target and Amazon are part of Zacks Earnings Preview",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-target-amazon-part-zacks-122012988.html,1684153212,STORY,"['WMT', 'TGT', 'AMZN', '^GSPC']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 15, 2023 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Walmart WMT, Target TGT and Amazon AMZN.Retail Earnings Looming: What to ExpectWalmart shares have tracked the broader market year-to-date, with Target shares modestly on the weaker side. But since the onset of the regional banking uncertainty following the Silicon Valley Bank failure in early March, Walmart shares have been notable outperformers, up +4.9% in that period vs. an +0.8% gain for the S&amp;P 500 index and an -8.3% decline for Target shares.The stability in Walmart shares makes intuitive sense, as its core business offers a high degree of defense during periods of economic instability and uncertainty. Walmart's 'value orientation' allows it to gain market share as relatively better-off consumers 'trade down' during times of 'economic stress.'Walmart and Target are on deck to report quarterly results this week. Walmart will report on Thursday, May 18th, and Target will report on Wednesday, May 17th, with both quarterly reports coming before the market's open. Walmart's quarterly EPS expectations coming into this report have been very stable, with the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.30 per share up by a penny over the past two months and unchanged over the past month. Unlike Walmart, there has been some pressure on Target estimates, with several analysts pointing to near-term challenges for the company.One key point of differentiation between these two retail giants is Walmart's bigger grocery business, which gives its results greater stability given the 'staply' nature of that otherwise low-margin business. That said, groceries drive foot traffic and are also responsible for the aforementioned 'trade down' phenomenon that is helping Walmart gain share.Analysts see relatively greater momentum in Walmart's business on the back of higher average selling prices, foot traffic, gains on the e-commerce side, and better margin results relative to what they reported last time on February 21st. Target is seen as suffering from weak traffic during the period, with the price trend only marginally positive.Story continuesBoth companies struggled with evolving consumer behavior as the pandemic went into the rearview mirror. We saw this in their April 2022 quarterly results, for which they were punished by the market. While both took drastic steps to steady their floundering ships, Walmart clearly did a better job of adjusting to the new environment compared to Target.With respect to the Retail sector 2023 Q1 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 20 of the 33 retailers in the S&amp;P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard &amp; Poor's standard industry classification.The Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers but also online vendors like Amazon and restaurant players. The 20 Zacks Retail companies in the S&amp;P 500 index that have reported Q1 results already belong to the e-commerce and restaurant industries.Total Q1 earnings for these 20 retailers that have reported are up +11% from the same period last year on +8.1% higher revenues, with 80% beating EPS estimates and 70% beating revenue estimates.The online players and restaurant operators easily beat earnings and revenue expectations.With respect to the earnings and revenue growth rates, we like to show the group's performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 20 companies that have reported already. As we know, Amazon's Q1 earnings were up +46.8% on +9.4% higher revenues, as it beat top and bottom-line expectations.As we all know, the digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now. Amazon is now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods, and Walmart is a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.One recurring theme in the Q1 earnings season has been the continued resilience and stability of the U.S. consumer. We heard this from the banks, the leisure and hospitality players, and consumer-facing digital operators.There is undoubtedly stress at the lower end of income distribution. Given this development, one can intuitively project moderation in consumer spending as the economy further slows down under the weight of tighter monetary conditions. We will hear more about that on the Walmart and Target earnings calls, likely in the context of their outlooks for the coming periods. But on the whole, consumer spending trends remained intact in 2023 Q1, and that's what these results will reconfirm.Q1 Earnings Season Scorecard Including all the quarterly reports that came out through Friday, May 10th, we now have Q1 earnings from 459 S&amp;P 500 members, or 91.8% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these companies are down -4% from the same period last year on +4.6% higher revenues, with 77.6% beating EPS estimates and 74.9% beating revenue estimates.The proportion of these companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 62.7%.Regular readers of our earnings commentary know that we have been referring to the overall picture emerging from the Q1 earnings season as good enough; not great, but not bad either. With this reporting cycle now largely behind us, we can confidently say that corporate earnings aren't headed towards the 'cliff' that market bears warned us of.The way we see it, the 'better-than-feared' view of the Q1 earnings season at this stage may be a bit unfair, given how resilient corporate profitability has turned out to be. But the view isn't entirely off the mark either.We have about 300 companies on deck to report results, including 15 S&amp;P 500 members. In addition to the aforementioned Walmart and Target reports, this week's docket includes Home Depot, TJX Cos, Cisco Systems, Applied Materials, and Deere &amp; Company.The Earnings Big Picture 2023 Q1 earnings are expected to be down -4.1% on +4.3% higher revenues. This would follow the -5.4% earnings decline in the preceding period (2022 Q4) on +5.9% higher revenues.We get to down earnings on positive revenues when margins are squeezed. That's what we have been witnessing in the ongoing earnings season, which is in line with the trend we have been seeing for some time now. In fact, 2023 Q1 is the 5th quarter in a row of declining margins.Actual results are proving a lot better on the margins front relative to what was expected ahead of the releases.One notable recent development on the earnings front, which I flagged in the weekly Earnings Trends report in greater detail, is the reversal on the revisions front, with full-year 2023 earnings starting to go up since the start of April. This comes after almost a year of steady declines in full-year 2023 earnings, which peaked in April 2022.Since the start of 2023 Q2, aggregate bottom-up S&amp;P 500 earnings have increased +0.3% as a whole and +0.6%, excluding the Energy sector, whose estimates have been coming down. In fact, estimates for 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors are up since the start of Q2, with notable increases in the Construction, Industrial Products, Autos, Retail, and Tech sectors. On the negative side, estimates are coming down for the Energy, Basic Materials, Aerospace, and Transportation sectors.For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Analyzing Recent Earnings Estimate Revisions  Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

QuoteFactors to ConsiderWalmart has been gaining from its sturdy comp sales record, which, in turn, is driven by its constant expansion efforts and splendid e-commerce performance. Walmart has been undertaking several efforts to enhance merchandise assortments. Also, the company has been focused on store remodeling in an attempt to upgrade them with advanced in-store and digital innovations.The company’s omni-channel penetration has been increasing. Its global e-commerce sales comprised more than 13% of sales as of fiscal 2023-end. Walmart has been taking several e-commerce initiatives, including buyouts, alliances and improved delivery and payment systems. The company is innovating in the supply chain, adding capacity and building businesses, such as Walmart GoLocal, Walmart Connect, Walmart Luminate, Walmart+, Spark Delivery, Marketplace and Walmart Fulfillment Services.Walmart has taken robust strides to strengthen its delivery arm, as evidenced by its partnership with Salesforce; the expansion of InHome delivery service; investment in DroneUp; pilot with HomeValet, the launch of Walmart+ membership program; introduction of Express Delivery; and drone delivery pilots with Flytrex and Zipline among other efforts. Furthermore, the company’s store and curbside pickup options add to customers’ convenience. As of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, Walmart U.S. had 4,600 pickup locations and more than 3,900 same-day delivery stores.These upsides are likely to have aided sales in the quarter under review. For the first quarter, Walmart expects consolidated net sales growth of 4.5-5% at constant currency.However, Walmart is encountering cost inflation and expects it to remain elevated. Walmart expects product mix-related pressure to persist in fiscal 2024.On its fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call, management offered a cautious view for fiscal 2024 due to the persistence of increased prices and chances for further macroeconomic challenges. For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the adjusted earnings per share (EPS)  is likely to come in the range of $1.25-$1.30, including a three-cent effect from LIFO. The adjusted EPS was $1.30 in the comparable year-ago period.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Walmart this time.

199,8782e2e1-72fe-3012-86d7-1c63921780d5,BXP,2023-05-16,The Long Decline Of Office REITs: Is There Hope For A Rebound?,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/long-decline-office-reits-hope-175318123.html,1684173198,STORY,"['SLG', 'BXP']","[As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) cites May 11, 2023, as the end of the federal COVID-19 Public Health Emergency and the World Health Organization (WHO) declares the virus to no longer be a global health emergency, it’s easy to forget that it was only a little over three years ago that the world was turned upside down by the emerging pandemic.The impact on the U.S. stock market was tremendous, and many real estate investment trusts (REITs), especially those in the office sector, would suffer devastating losses. In the span of four weeks, stalwart office REITs such as SL Green Realty Corp. (NYSE: SLG) and Boston Properties Inc. (NYSE: BXP) fell 60% and 45%, respectively. After a recovery to near pre-COVID levels that took almost two years, the office REITs have once again tumbled to new lows since March 2022.While these drops have significantly raised dividend yields, income investors need to decide whether these REITs are terrific long-term buys at current levels or if there will be dividend cuts or further declines before the stocks reach their absolute bottoms?Many analysts have predicted the demise of office leasing as companies have discovered that employees working from home can save firms millions of dollars a year. Many companies have re-leased offices since 2020 but have also downsized the space needed with so many stay-at-home workers.Employees loved saving time and money by no longer commuting, eating lunch at home instead of in expensive restaurants and not having to put young children into costly daycare. Some were able to buy homes in less expensive rural areas because commuting was no longer an issue.But lately, many companies have changed their minds. Within the past month, large companies such as Google, Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. have all told workers they must come back to the office at least a few days per week. The general consensus is that workers are more productive in the office than at home.Story continuesOn April 20, the New York City Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced that it surpassed 4 million rides for the first time since March 12, 2020, the day before the city shut down for the pandemic. While the increase in ridership may reflect people feeling safer from contracting illness, it also suggests that more people are returning to the office in the larger cities.This could be good news for office REITs, which continue to flounder, even as other REIT subsectors like hotel, retail and mortgage REITs regain some stability. But not all office REITs are still suffering. Take a look at three office REITs that have outperformed their peers in recent weeks.JBG SMITH Properties (NYSE: JBGS) is a Bethesda, Maryland-based diversified REIT that owns and operates 18 million square feet of high-quality office, retail and residential properties in Virginia, Maryland and Washington D.C. JBG Smith is a member of the S&amp;P 400.On May 9, JBG Smith reported its first-quarter operating results. Funds from operations (FFO) of $0.33 was down a penny from the first quarter of 2022. Revenue of $152.96 million beat the estimates of $147.05 million but was 5.56% lower than in the first quarter of 2022. Still, the stock rose after the report was released.Over the past four weeks, JBG Smith has risen 10.04% and is the leading office REIT during that time. Before the pandemic, JBG Smith was a $38 stock. Its most recent closing price was $15.12.Peakstone Realty Trust (NYSE: PKST) is an El Segundo, California-based diversified REIT that owns and operates single-tenant office and industrial properties. Peakstone Realty’s portfolio has 19 million square feet of space in high-growth markets in 24 states. Its portfolio is 95% leased.Peakstone Realty launched its initial public offering (IPO) on April 13. The stock soared from $8 to $40.35 in five days. It has since backed off considerably, but over the past four weeks Peakstone Realty is still up 9.89%. Much of that has come over the past four days.On May 9, Peakstone Realty Trust reported first-quarter operating results with FFO of $0.37 per share.Investor note: As a new IPO, this stock is extremely volatile and without much history for comparison purposes.Corporate Office Properties Trust (NYSE: OFC) is a Columbia, Maryland-based REIT that owns and manages office and data center properties in locations that support the U.S. government and its contractors in the Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, Maryland, areas. It’s a member of the midcap S&amp;P 400.On April 27, Corporate Office Properties reported its first-quarter operating results. FFO of $0.59 was up a penny from the first quarter of 2022. Revenue of $151.68 million beat the consensus estimate of $150.14 million and was a 6.61% increase over revenue of $142.28 million in the first quarter of 2022.In the past four weeks Corporate Office Properties has risen 5.4%. But shares have fallen from $28 to the recent closing price of $24.01 since early February. The stock recently climbed above its 50-day moving average and appears to be stabilizing.Don't miss:How These Accredited Investors Pulled In Better Returns Than Warren BuffettWhy Warren Buffett's Investing Strategy Is More Relevant Than Ever In Today's Real Estate MarketDespite these gains, Wall Street is still quite negative on office REITs, and Charlie Munger, vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-A) recently warned of a potential crash in the U.S. commercial property market.It’s important to choose carefully among REITs in the office sector. What is noteworthy about these three office REITs is that they are diversified by also owning retail, industrial and residential properties. They are outperforming other office REITs that aren’t diversified, such as SL Green and Boston Properties.In February, the office occupancy rate in 10 major U.S. cities averaged 50.1%, but it was the first time the rate had climbed above 50% since the pre-COVID days. However, as of this past week, the occupancy rate was basically the same. Until that rate begins climbing again, most office REITs will are expected to continue to struggle.SL Green’s dividend yield is presently 15.4%. Its FFO payout ratio is still a moderate 59%, but it has declining revenue and risk of refinancing at higher rates with debt maturities of $2.2 billion before the end of 2024. Five months ago, SL Green cut its dividend from $0.3111 to $0.271. Another cut cannot be ruled out.Boston Properties has a 7.6% dividend yield which is about double its five-year dividend yield average. It appears to be in better shape as its first quarter FFO and revenue beat the estimates.With office REITs at such low levels, this could be a terrific opportunity for long-term income investors to pick up shares with higher yields. But for the moment, look to favor the office REITs that have the most diversification and the best occupancy rates, and avoid chasing the REITs that have the highest yields.Over the past five years, private market real estate investments have outperformed the publicly traded REIT market by about 50%.

ROST is scheduled to release its first-quarter fiscal 2023 results on May 18. The off-price apparel and home accessories retailer is likely to have witnessed revenue and earnings growth in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter revenues is pegged at $4.5 billion, indicating growth of 3.9% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter. For fiscal first-quarter earnings, the consensus mark of $1.06 per share suggests growth of 9.3% from the year-ago quarter's reported number. The consensus mark for earnings has been unchanged over the past 30 days.We expect the company’s fiscal first-quarter total revenues to increase 3% year over year to $4,464.6 million and earnings to rise 6.4% to $1.03 per share.In the last reported quarter, Ross Stores delivered an earnings surprise of 6.5%. In the trailing four quarters, it delivered an earnings beat of 10.3%, on average.Ross Stores, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseRoss Stores, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseRoss Stores, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Ross Stores, Inc. QuoteKey Factors to NoteRoss Stores has been benefiting from robust customer demand and improved traffic trends in the retail industry. Sales in the fiscal first quarter are likely to have benefited from broad-based growth across merchandise categories and regions, as well as robust comparable store sales. Sales are also expected to have gained from robust trends at the dd's DISCOUNTS business. Gains at the core business, driven by consumers' continued focus on value and the company’s ability to deliver value bargains to customers, bode well.Ross Stores has been consistent with the execution of its store expansion plans, which are likely to have aided the top line. The company's store-expansion efforts have been focused on continually increasing penetration in existing and new markets. The first-quarter fiscal 2023 performance is anticipated to have gained from the company’s return to normal store opening targets. Gains from new stores are expected to get reflected in ROST’s sales for the fiscal first quarter.On its last reported quarter’s earnings call, Ross Stores was optimistic about its first-quarter fiscal 2023 performance. The company expects sales growth of 1-4% year over year in the fiscal first quarter. Earnings per share are envisioned between 99 cents and $1.05 for the fiscal first quarter.However, Ross Stores has been witnessing the effects of the ongoing financial pressures on dd’s DISCOUNTS’ lower-income customer base and increased markdowns. On the last reported quarter's earnings call, the company anticipated the escalating inflationary pressures that are affecting dd's lower-income customer base and increased promotions to hurt its comps in the to-be-reported quarter.On its last reported quarter’s earnings call, Ross Stores noted that its comp performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 will reflect the continued impacts of elevated inflation on its low-to-moderate income customers. For first-quarter fiscal 2023, the company expects comps to be relatively flat on a 52 weeks basis, whereas it reported 7% comps growth in the prior-year quarter.Further, Ross Stores’ cost of goods sold is likely to have witnessed continued impacts of lower merchandise margins, unfavorable timing of pack-away-related costs and increased markdowns. Unfavorable timing of pack-away-related expenses and deleverage from its new distribution center are expected to have resulted in higher distribution costs.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Ross Stores this time around.

(V) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-inc-v-trending-stock-130001998.html,1684155601,STORY,['V'],"[Visa (V) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this global payments processor have returned -1.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.9% change. The Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, to which Visa belongs, has gained 3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Visa is expected to post earnings of $2.10 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.8%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.58 points to a change of +14.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1.8%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.67 indicates a change of +12.7% from what Visa is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Visa is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for V _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Visa, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $8.04 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $32.51 billion and $35.98 billion estimates indicate +10.9% and +10.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVisa reported revenues of $7.99 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.1%. EPS of $2.09 for the same period compares with $1.79 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.75 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.01%. The EPS surprise was +6.09%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Visa is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Visa. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While giants like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure dominate the headlines, Cloudflare quietly emerges as a hidden gem.Story continuesWith its cutting-edge technologies and comprehensive suite of cloud-based security services, Cloudflare is one of the best hyper-growth stocks to watch closely in the dynamic market.Cloudflare excelled during the pandemic by offering outsourcing website hosting and security solutions. This allowed businesses to concentrate on their core operations while benefiting from a reliable and efficient service. Many businesses turned to Cloudflare during the pandemic, contributing to its exceptional performance. However, Cloudflare’s success extends beyond industry tailwinds, as its strong business model plays a significant role in its resilience.By leveraging Cloudflare, a company’s website gains a competitive edge by placing code in over 275 global data centers, resulting in unparalleled speeds and optimized performance.

Considered one of the best hyper-growth stocks that have flown under the radar, Twilio is a hidden gem waiting to be discovered.Twilio plays a crucial role in revolutionizing customer communication for its clients. Its innovative products enable automated text messages for appointment confirmations, video call setups, and effective cost reduction in customer acquisition. However, Twilio’s growth-centric approach has led to challenges for the stock and the company.Since its 2015 initial public offering, Twilio has prioritized growth over profitability, resulting in a lack of profitability to date. As growth stabilizes, Twilio’s management has recognized the need to shift gears and prioritize profitability, initiating a transition toward a more sustainable business model. This shift marks a significant turning point for Twilio as it strives to balance growth and profitability, ensuring long-term success and value for its investors.Twilio’s revenue growth showed a significant slowdown, from 22% in Q4 to a projected 14% pace in Q1, emphasizing the urgency for the company to achieve profitability. However, despite the near-term challenges, Twilio’s valuation presents an enticing opportunity for investors. With a valuation of just 2.54 times sales, Twilio is considered a genuine bargain in the market. The stock has already factored in considerable short-term pessimism, making it an attractive buy for those looking to capitalize on Twilio’s potential rebound and long-term growth prospects.While giants in the tech industry dominate headlines, Twilio quietly continues to establish itself as a hyper-growth stock sleeper, offering untapped opportunities for investors seeking hidden gems in this dynamic market.Visa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comDiscover the hidden gems of hyper-growth stocks that have been flying under the radar, with Visa (NYSE:V) leading the pack.

But ignore it at your own peril.Visa benefits from shifting from traditional financial stocks to safer alternatives, making it a perfect growth stock.

The pandemic increased card and digital payment options, particularly beneficial for Visa in emerging markets.However, the global travel slowdown impacted cross-border transactions. As the economy normalizes, Visa is expected to resume double-digit annualized top-line growth.Done with this list? Have no fear!

208,f2da0586-5814-3781-ae33-9edd6ce6604f,MAR,2023-05-16,Marriott (MAR) Rewards Shareholders With 30% Dividend Hike,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marriott-mar-rewards-shareholders-30-170805455.html,1684170485,STORY,"['MAR', 'MGM', 'BYD']","[Marriott International, Inc. MAR recently announced a 30% hike in its quarterly dividend payout which reflects its intention to utilize free cash to boost shareholders’ returns.MAR raised the quarterly dividend to 52 cents per share (or $2.08 annually) from the previous payout of 40 cents (or $1.60 annually). The hiked dividend will be paid out on Jun 30, to shareholders on record as of May 26.  Based on the closing price of $174.10 per share on May 12, the stock has a dividend yield of 1.2%.Along with boosting shareholders’ returns, dividend hikes raise the market value of a stock. Companies often attract new investors and retain old ones through this strategy. Year to date (through Apr 28), Marriott has paid approximately $1.5 billion to its shareholders in the form of cash dividends and repurchases of common stock.What’s Driving the Dividend Policy?Marriott has been gaining from pent-up leisure demand, increased cross-border travel and lenient travel restrictions. Throughout first-quarter 2023, the company witnessed a steady increase in demand in the United States, Canada and Europe. Also, it reported a strong RevPAR recovery in Asia pacific.Group demand in the United States and Canada increased sharply during the quarter, leading to improved occupancies and strength in ADR. With global trends improving, MAR expects the recovery momentum to continue. Attributes such as pent-up demand for all types of travel, the shift of spending toward experiences versus goods and lifting of travel restrictions (particularly in Greater China) are likely to add to the positives.MAR is benefiting from robust growth in its loyalty program. With nearly 182 million members globally, the company’s loyalty program Marriott Bonvoy is supporting its marketing strategies. Also, Marriott is engaging its customers with promotional offers such as grocery and retail spending accelerators on its co-branded credit cards.During first-quarter 2023, digital revenues increased 26% year over year. Mobile app users were up 31% year over year, while digital room nights rose 17% year over year. Backed by solid customer acceptance for credit card programs and a rise in credit card average spending, the company anticipates higher contributions from credit card fees in 2023.Meanwhile, Marriott is consistently trying to expand its presence worldwide and capitalize on the demand for hotels in international markets. On May 1, it completed the acquisition of the City Express brand portfolio. The initiative involved the addition of approximately 150 properties located in Mexico, Costa Rica, Colombia, and Chile. The transaction also paved a path for entry into the high-growth mid-scale segment.We believe that the initiatives are likely to strengthen MAR’s business and drive the sustainability of its cash flows in the upcoming periods.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSo far this year, shares of Marriott have gained 16.9% compared with the Zacks Hotels and Motels industry's 10.7% growth.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Marriott sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are MGM Resorts International MGM, Boyd Gaming Corporation BYD and Crocs, Inc.

Occupancy for the week ended May 6 came in at 65.2%. The uptrend was driven by a solid leisure demand in the United States. Easing COVID-19 restrictions and improving business activity added to the upside. Hotel demands in 2023 are likely to be driven by leisure travelers from Europe and Asia-Pacific.Digitalization to Drive Growth: Hotel owners continue to focus on maintaining a balance between maximizing hotel profitability and driving guest satisfaction. To this end, hoteliers have leveraged technologies such as mobile and web check-in and mobile key. The hoteliers also increased the use of these digital tools to strengthen infrastructure, grow online package sales, enable self-service bookings, make real-time offerings and enhance the overall customer experience. This and the emphasis on pricing optimization and merchandising capabilities will likely help hoteliers capture additional market share.Initiatives to Attract Customers: Hoteliers are committed to comprehensive processes for cleaning, disinfection and infectious disease prevention. They have instated a trained hygiene and well-being leader, who is responsible for a clean and safe environment for staff and guests. The companies have been undertaking efforts to enhance the contactless experience and leveraging technologies such as mobile and web check-in and mobile key. These players have resorted to streamlining operations with efficient management levels, the benefits of which are likely to stay even after the pandemic fades out.High Costs &amp; High Inflation Remain a Woe: Higher costs are a concern for industry participants. Concerns about a global slowdown and a possible recession loom over the stock market.

Greenwoods also built a new position in TAL Education by acquiring 2.2 million shares.TAL was also on Singapore-based FengHe’s shopping list. The fund run by ex-Alibaba CTO John Wu bought 2.1 million more shares to boost its stake in the tutoring giant. It took some profit from New Oriental during the quarter, although the latter remains its second largest exposure in the U.S. market.Share prices of both New Oriental and TAL collapsed over 90% from its peak after Beijing’s ban on K-12 private tutoring. The price of two stocks have doubled from the low point in October after China dropped its strict controls against COVID-19.In China's current market conditions, education companies stand out as spending on education does not decline as household spending declines, as parents invested in their children's future, analysts say.“The past quarter was the turning point for both New Oriental and TAL which offered very positive guidance for the next quarter and FY24,” Tina Li, an education analyst at BOCI research said in a note this week.Other big investment firms including Tairen Capital, Dantai Capital, Keystone Investors and CloudAlpha Capital were also among the active buyers of U.S.-listed Chinese education companies, according to an analysis by Reuters based on the quarterly 13F filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Story continuesThe 13F filings reveal what investors owned in U.S. listed stocks by March 31, giving some insight into the latest investment trends.Another consensus buy during the first quarter was the big artificial intelligence (AI) players in the United States.Trivest Advisors, which has assets under management of over $3 billion, purchased roughly 800,000 shares in Nvidia Corp , to build a new position in the world's leading designer of computer chips used in creating AI.

It will be located on a concession in the port of Zeebrugge, which Aers Energy België has been awarded. Within this location, Aers will also operate a new secure truck stop, rest area, convenience store and restaurant.Aers Energy België emphasized sustainability: ""Hydrogen will play an important part in significantly reducing CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions from road transport. To further develop this part of the project, a partnership with Air Products was sought. This company has a great deal of expertise in the field and, thanks to its investments in new green hydrogen production capacity, can provide the necessary guarantees for a stable supply,"" said Jackij Aers of Aers Energy België.Liquid hydrogenThe new station will be the first commercial-scale hydrogen refueling station in Europe with liquid hydrogen storage. It will be built and operated by Air Products in addition to other liquid hydrogen refueling stations the company is developing throughout Europe. The project itself, is part of a wider strategy to support Belgium and Europe's sustainable development and ambition towards CO2-free heavy-duty road transport.By building a hydrogen refueling station on the TENT-T core network in Zeebrugge – which largely exceeds the required minimum capacity of 1 ton of hydrogen per day – Air Products is contributing to the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR) objectives. When the station's capacity is utilized, it will save approximately 8-11 kt of CO2 equivalent per year by displacing diesel volume.Story continues""Our technology has already been used in more than 250 projects worldwide and we are proud to be working with Aers Energy België on this important project in Belgium,"" commented Kurt Lefevere, Air Products' Vice President for Benelux, Germany and France. ""The choice of hydrogen for heavy-duty vehicles, compared to other technologies, allows for faster refueling, greater vehicle range and the elimination of all CO2 tailpipe and other criteria pollutant emissions. Air Products has over 60 years of experience in hydrogen production, equipment, logistics and services and is a first-mover in the energy transition with over $11 billion dollars of announced investment in clean hydrogen projects around the globe.""Large number of trucks in the portThe reason Aers Energy België was awarded the concession in the Port, was its ability to offer a solution to safely park the many trucks waiting to leave the port or coming to load or unload in the port area. In addition to the hydrogen refueling station and a truck parking lot with 135 spaces, drivers will have access to sanitary facilities, a store, and a catering service.Tom Hautekiet, Chief Commercial Officer Port of Antwerp-Bruges, says: ""All forms of transport, from shipping to road transport, are expected to be almost completely CO2 neutral by 2050. For freight transport, hydrogen is a clean and viable alternative to diesel. But of course, refueling stations must be available. We are delighted that Air Products is taking the lead in developing Europe's first liquid hydrogen refueling station in the Port of Zeebrugge. This shows that Air Products is already ready for the hydrogen truck of the future.""About Air ProductsAir Products (NYSE:APD) is a world-leading industrial gases company in operation for over 80 years focused on serving energy, environmental, and emerging markets.

Month-to-month changes will be a key focus, especially for companies that have enjoyed a lift from China's economic improvements. With more on the influence of the Chinese consumer for US companies, we have Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferre joining us. Hey, Ines.INES FERRE: Hey, Rachelle, that's right. And investors will be paying close attention to that data that you just mentioned, especially when it comes to retail sales, especially when it comes to sales related to services because remember that the Chinese lockdowns were pretty severe. So now that they have been lifted, companies have been talking about what they've seen with the consumer.The consumer spending more on dining out. The consumer spending more when it comes to traveling as well. And we've already seen some companies that have been benefiting from the China recovery and some of these include the ones that you see there on your screen, like Starbucks, Disney, Procter &amp; Gamble, Marriott.So taking a look at Starbucks, for example, its fiscal second quarter, a big turning point for the company, surprising the Street with China sales up 3%. The Street had expected for those to be lower. Starbucks has been on an expansion plan when it comes to China, increasing its footprint in China. And during their last earnings calls, management talked about the decision to keep opening stores during the pandemic despite disruptions. That decision is paying off.Moving on to Disney. Disney's international parks have been a bright spot for the company with Shanghai Disney Resort. That's seeing improvement, with management talking in their last earnings calls about higher attendance and improved financial results when it comes to Shanghai.Also looking at MGM. MGM's results blew it out of the park when it comes to MGM China, where their net revenue increased 130% from the prior quarter. The end of the lockdowns definitely very positive for the company. MGM is up 26% year-to-date, Rachelle.RACHELLE AKUFFO: All right, great stuff there. Keeping an eye on some of those impacts there, Ines Ferre there for us. Thanks so much.]"

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this entertainment company have returned -7.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.9% change. The Zacks Media Conglomerates industry, to which Disney belongs, has lost 8.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Disney is expected to post earnings of $1.08 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -6.5%.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.94 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +11.6%. This estimate has changed -1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.28 indicates a change of +34.1% from what Disney is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.7%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Disney is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for DIS _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Disney, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $22.73 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $89.86 billion and $94.92 billion estimates indicate +8.6% and +5.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryDisney reported revenues of $21.82 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.3%. EPS of $0.93 for the same period compares with $1.08 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.82 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.03%. The EPS surprise was +4.49%.Over the last four quarters, Disney surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Disney is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Disney. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This is both the largest amount of assistance provided – and second-largest number of customers supported – for any first quarter dating back to at least 2019. In all of 2022, ComEd connected 211,000 eligible customers to nearly $129 million in assistance.These results come after ComEd has introduced new financial assistance options that were informed by a ComEd-commissioned study that looked at how to support customers in light of CEJA’s ambitious goals for creating an equitable transition to a decarbonized future. This work helped ComEd better understand the inequities that have long impacted many communities in the company’s service territory, the barriers people within these communities face, and identified opportunities to help these individuals overcome these barriers.""We are constantly striving to improve our programs and approach to ensure customers in need are aware of and are connected with available assistance,"" said Melissa Washington, ComEd’s chief customer officer and senior vice president of customer operations. ""Some of our recent key learnings have been that people need us to meet them where they are, offer real help and make access to that help as simple as possible – and we’re pleased to have successfully implemented new programs and hosted a number of community resource fairs to do just that.""In January, ComEd expanded its portfolio of customer-assistance programs with the following options:Catch Up and Save: A two-part program that provides monthly credits to an eligible customer’s bill to eliminate past-due balances, as well as a free energy savings kit – while supplies last – to help families save on future energy bills. Each kit includes home products designed to help lower home energy use while improving the efficiency of the home.Fresh Start Services: Provides customers with both online and person-to-person help customers become aware of and navigate the options available to manage bills and energy use. This program also offers customers tools that will alert them when their energy use is trending higher than usual and help them be aware of financial-assistance options they may be eligible for.Your Neighbor Fund: Funded by donations from ComEd’s 6,300 employees who proudly work and live in the communities the energy company serves, this fund provides another needed source of grant money to help limited-income families pay their ComEd bill.Story continuesTo help remove barriers our customers sometimes face when accessing assistance options, ComEd launched a series of Community Resource Fairs which bring together local businesses, community leaders and government agencies to provide, in one place, multiple support services to help families with their finances, health services or finding the skills and jobs they need to thrive.This past weekend, ComEd collaborated with YWCA Northwestern Illinois to hold a resource fair for Rockford-area residents. Other fairs have taken place in Chicago’s West Woodlawn neighborhood and Ford Heights, Ill.

Juniper Beyond Labs will leverage innovation centers in Sunnyvale, Bengaluru, India and Westford, Massachusetts. Juniper Beyond Labs will collaborate with a community of academic and industry partners with a goal of breaking new ground for sustainable leading edge networking technologies to help meet the future needs of a digital world.Almost every aspect of the global economy now touches the network in some way, and this will only continue as AI, machine learning and cloud services continue to proliferate alongside an exponential increase in connected users and devices. This has created opportunities, but also infrastructure complexities, security vulnerabilities and environmental challenges that require new ways of deploying and managing network technology to improve the experience of network users and operators. Juniper Beyond Labs will help incubate big ideas and innovative solutions to the world’s toughest technology challenges.For Juniper customers and partners, such as Eurofiber and Intel, along with the broader academic community like Purdue University, Juniper Beyond Labs will provide an opportunity to influence research directions and pathfinding projects. The resulting contributions could spur proof-of-concept demos and the ability to provide feedback to shape the direction of research. Participating members, will also have access to Juniper Beyond Labs research and innovation developed. As an example, Juniper will be extending its collaboration with Intel and work on the integration of the Intel FlexRAN Reference Architecture, private 5G networks, Juniper RAN Intelligent Controller and the Juniper Cloud-Native Router on Intel Xeon processors, to enable new capabilities to support 5G transformation.Story continuesJuniper Beyond Labs research will focus on a cross section of networking domains, including IT, Data Center, Security, AI/Automation, Network Operations, WAN and 5G/6G along with emerging areas, like Quantum Computing, where research is ongoing. In particular, Juniper Beyond Labs will prioritize sustainability as an integral part of network design principles and related use cases to help network operators meet sustainability targets. For example, the Juniper RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) platform today offers energy savings features such as traffic steering that allows efficient utilization of network resources to meet capacity demands while avoiding additional capital investments.While Juniper Beyond Labs is officially launching today, it has already developed the award-winning Juniper RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) and the disruptive Juniper Cloud-Native Router (JCNR) which takes full advantage of container economics and operational efficiencies to provide service providers flexibility in deploying 5G.Supporting Quotes:""I’m a researcher at heart, so I’m thrilled that Juniper Beyond Labs will give us a newfound ability to research, tinker and experiment more freely with next-generation network technology to solve massive challenges the industry faces. Some of the solutions we develop could become commercially available, but the goal is to push the limits of what we think is possible to meet the needs of an evolving digital world.""- Raj Yavatkar, Chief Technology Officer, Juniper Networks""Quantum computers will eventually challenge encryption techniques, which is why Eurofiber and Juniper Networks have launched a Quantum testbed in the Netherlands. Together with Juniper Beyond Labs we are innovating a new security approach, using Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC).""- Eric Kuisch – Chief Operating Officer, Eurofiber""Working to address industry challenges requires innovation that starts at the community level. Our collaboration with Juniper across network initiatives has helped to accelerate the RAN ecosystem with tangible business outcomes at mobile operators. We look forward to continuing this momentum through our participation in Beyond Labs to advance how the digital world connects.""- Dan Rodriguez, CVP Network and Edge Solutions Group, INTEL""Network automation is key to making as-a-service, private LTE &amp; 5G connectivity offerings a reality for enterprises. Juniper's Beyond Labs efforts could position Juniper for success with automation and other adjacent enterprise services and applications.""- Will Townsend, VP &amp; Principal Analyst, Moor Insights &amp; Strategy""As a computer science professor at Purdue, I have had the pleasure of collaborating with Juniper with my undergraduate and graduate students.

(NYSE:JNPR) will increase its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 22nd of June to $0.22. This takes the annual payment to 3.0% of the current stock price, which is about average for the industry. Check out our latest analysis for Juniper Networks Juniper Networks' Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWhile it is always good to see a solid dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is feasible. Prior to this announcement, Juniper Networks' earnings easily covered the dividend, but free cash flows were negative. No cash flows could definitely make returning cash to shareholders difficult, or at least mean the balance sheet will come under pressure.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 30.5% over the next year. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 47% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendJuniper Networks Is Still Building Its Track RecordThe dividend's track record has been pretty solid, but with only 9 years of history we want to see a few more years of history before making any solid conclusions. The annual payment during the last 9 years was $0.40 in 2014, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $0.88. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 9.2% a year over that time. Investors will likely want to see a longer track record of growth before making decision to add this to their income portfolio.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. We are encouraged to see that Juniper Networks has grown earnings per share at 20% per year over the past five years. Juniper Networks is clearly able to grow rapidly while still returning cash to shareholders, positioning it to become a strong dividend payer in the future.Our Thoughts On Juniper Networks' DividendOverall, this is probably not a great income stock, even though the dividend is being raised at the moment. While the low payout ratio is a redeeming feature, this is offset by the minimal cash to cover the payments. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

248,614f6001-61d4-33ab-aac1-647950aa1fdc,CMCSA,2023-05-16,Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 86%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/comcast-corporation-nasdaq-cmcsa-favorite-110031864.html,1684234831,STORY,['CMCSA'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in Comcast implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price50% of the business is held by the top 18 shareholders Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a businessIf you want to know who really controls Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 86% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Comcast. Check out our latest analysis for Comcast ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Comcast?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Comcast. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Comcast, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Comcast. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.6%. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 9.6% and 7.6%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. Additionally, the company's CEO Brian Roberts directly holds 0.9% of the total shares outstanding.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 18 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of ComcastWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Comcast Corporation. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$1.6b worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 13% stake in Comcast. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 3 warning signs  with Comcast , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Ultimately the future is most important.

It starts with building the best productAt Comcast, we pride ourselves on building products that are made to last, as reliability is the foundation of our business. But it's also the foundation of sustainability. The distribution model for our connectivity devices ensures that customers are able to access the latest technologies and enjoy the best customer experience, while maximizing reuse so that each product is used until the end of its life - often finding multiple homes before it is decommissioned.Our design teams are constantly innovating to increase the lifespan of our products. For example, the decision to change the color and finishes on our XB gateways from Xfinity Grey to Xfinity White has reduced refurbishing and repair costs and helped reduce waste to landfills.2. Sustainable design is a constant evolutionBecause sustainability can mean so many different things - reducing material inputs, increasing recyclability, utilizing recycled materials in products, reducing embodied carbon, the list goes on - there are several tradeoffs to consider when making sustainable design choices, making it a constant process of learning, testing, and recalibrating.Story continuesFor example, our award-winning Xfinity Eco Capsule™ has been celebrated for its outstanding design as the first Xfinity modular packaging system that is 100% recyclable and reusable. Our next generation of packaging will not only prioritize recyclability, but also the carbon emissions associated with shipping and transportation.Our challenge is to innovate and adapt in constant pursuit of better, more sustainable products.3. An opportunity to use our platforms for goodThe same sustainability values we carry in designing our products also apply to our platforms. As a global media and technology company, we are uniquely positioned to help drive awareness of the world's most pressing issues and offer solutions that can drive positive change.For example, TODAY Climate, led by Al Roker, is our commitment to covering climate change and sharing sustainable solutions with our millions of viewers. In the UK, Sky produces the Daily Climate Show, investigating how global warming is changing our landscape, as well as developing a variety of other content focused on behavior change, particularly in youth programming.The Universal Filmed Entertainment Group recently launched the GreenerLight Program, an initiative focused on embedding sustainability across the entire filmmaking process including script development, locations and set needs, as well as on-screen behaviors.These are just a few examples of the ways we're continuing to drive sustainability across our products and platforms. By working together, we can drive lasting change to create a greener, cleaner future.Sara Cronenwett is Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Environmental Sustainability for Comcast Corporation.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Comcast Corporation on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Comcast CorporationWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/comcast-corporationEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Comcast CorporationView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/754903/Our-Sustainable-Future]"

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this oil and gas exploration company have returned -14.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.9% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, to which Devon Energy belongs, has lost 9.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Devon Energy is expected to post earnings of $1.54 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -40.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.40 points to a change of -23% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.7%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.08 indicates a change of +10.6% from what Devon Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.9%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Devon Energy.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for DVN _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Devon Energy, the consensus sales estimate of $4.11 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -26.9%. The $16.43 billion and $17.14 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -14.3% and +4.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryDevon Energy reported revenues of $3.82 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +0.3%. EPS of $1.46 for the same period compares with $1.88 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.93 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.65%. The EPS surprise was +5.04%.Over the last four quarters, Devon Energy surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Devon Energy is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Devon Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 10.53%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post earnings of $0.21 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.22, delivering a surprise of 4.76%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.P10, Inc. , which belongs to the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry, posted revenues of $57.25 million for the quarter ended March 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.38%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $43.28 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.P10, Inc. Shares have lost about 5.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.4%.What's Next for P10, Inc.While P10, Inc. Has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for P10, Inc. Unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.20 on $58.01 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.86 on $237.81 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

261,06047d7b-43d8-30de-a8d5-29a636a5bf2d,ORCL,2023-05-16,CORRECTED-Column: Lawyers suing Oracle draw judge's reproach for arguments with 'odor of denigrating' women,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/column-lawyers-suing-oracle-draw-212951576.html,1684186191,STORY,"['ORCL', 'INTC', '1475.HK']","[(A previous version of this story incorrectly reported that James was granted summary judgment on shareholders' breach of duty claims)By Alison Frankel(Reuters) - (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) A Delaware judge delivered a gut-punch to plaintiffs lawyers when he sided on Friday with Oracle Corp founder Larry Ellison and co-CEO Safra Catz in a long-running case accusing them of overpaying for NetSuite Inc to score a big payday for Ellison.But that wasn’t the only blow: The judge also took a swipe at law firms Robbins Geller Rudman &amp; Dowd and Friedlander &amp; Gorris for theorizing that Oracle board member Renee James, a onetime president at Intel Corp who chaired the special board committee that negotiated the $9.3 billion deal to acquire NetSuite in 2016, was not independent because she needed Ellison’s help to advance her career.That theory, wrote Vice Chancellor Sam Glasscock of the Delaware Chancery Court, was not just “strongly disproved” by the evidence at trial but also seemed to have a misogynistic subtext.Glasscock’s exact language: Plaintiffs’ arguments, he said, “had some odor of denigrating the abilities of women executives to succeed based on their merits.”To be sure, the judge made that observation just in a footnote in Friday's decision. But in a way, his criticism was all the more remarkable because it was extraneous. Plaintiffs' lawyers already agreed last December to dismiss claims against James after the judge said at a post-trial hearing that he planned to enter judgment for her. Glasscock nevertheless considered it necessary to call out shareholders' suggestion that James was beholden to Ellison.Plaintiffs' lawyer Joel Friedlander refuted the judge’s criticism in an email statement. “We stand by the arguments we made regarding Ms. James, which were based on the trial evidence, none of which is referenced in the vice chancellor’s opinion,” the statement said.Story continuesFriedlander also said that he and Robbins Geller intend to appeal Glasscock’s ruling that Ellison and Catz are not liable to the company for the NetSuite deal, citing “serious legal and factual issues.”James’ counsel from Sidley Austin and Morris, Nichols, Arsht &amp; Tunnell did not respond to my query. Their post-trial brief emphasized that James, who is currently the CEO of semiconductor company Ampere Computing LLC, is a highly accomplished, well-connected tech industry veteran who did not need to curry favor from Ellison – or, for that matter, Catz – to fulfill her ambitions.Latham &amp; Watkins, which represented Catz and Ellison, said in an email statement that Glasscock's ruling is a “complete vindication” for their clients after years of “baseless” litigation.Plaintiffs, as you may recall, alleged that Ellison, who owned nearly 40% of NetSuite's shares in addition to a 28% stake in Oracle, used his outsized influence at Oracle to push the board into a deal that suited his interests — but not those of Oracle shareholders. Catz, according to plaintiffs, helped Ellison because she regarded him as her boss. Plaintiffs' lawyers accused both of them of breaching their duties to shareholders in a deal controlled by Ellison.In 2019, two years after shareholders first filed their derivative claims, Oracle’s board made the extremely unusual decision to authorize shareholders to pursue the case on behalf of the company. Friday’s ruling followed a 10-day trial last fall.Glasscock thoroughly repudiated shareholders' theories. He concluded that Ellison was not a controller and that neither he nor Catz breached their fiduciary duties.Ellison recused from both sides of the deal in deference to the Oracle board, Glasscock said. And despite shareholders' portrayal of Catz as an Ellison surrogate, Glasscock said, the evidence showed her to be a tough dealmaker who was willing to walk away from the NetSuite acquisition if NetSuite demanded too high a price.James’ relationship with Ellison (and Catz) figured into Glasscock’s analysis of whether Ellison secretly controlled the NetSuite transaction. As I mentioned, Oracle had appointed a three-member special committee to oversee the deal in light of Ellison's conflict. Shareholders did not contest the independence of former U.S. secretary of defense Leon Panetta, who was also on the board's special committee, and dismissed claims against committee member George Conrades in December 2019. That left shareholders with only one way to cast doubt on the special committee's work: by challenging the independence of James, its chair.Several months before the trial last fall, Glasscock granted summary judgment to James on plaintiffs’ claims that she had acted in bad faith. But the judge left open the question of James' independence, holding that during the time that James served on the Oracle special committee, she was pursuing a potential Oracle investment in a new company.James had been passed over for the CEO job at Intel in 2015, Glasscock said, and the pre-trial evidentiary record showed that she was still hoping to head a tech company. The judge said he wasn’t convinced that shareholders would be able to show after trial that James was beholden to Ellison and Catz, but that the inference was reasonable.Plaintiffs' lawyers do not seem to have made any issue of James’ gender in their filings. Their opening post-trial brief mentioned only that she and Catz “regularly discussed ‘women’s career issues,” citing Catz’s deposition testimony. Shareholders' response to James’ post-trial brief repeated that assertion but placed far more emphasis on why, in their view, James' testimony showed that she regarded “proximity to Ellison and Catz” as the key to CEO ambitions. (The brief argued that Oracle did, in fact, prove crucial to James’ career: The company has invested more than $850 million in Ampere, where James is CEO.)James’ counsel did not suggest in their post-trial briefing that shareholder lawyers had asked sexist questions. Their brief argued that James was not plotting to advance her career when she served on the Oracle special committee but was spending time with her family and merely holding down a couple of ""low-demand"" posts to stay current in the industry. Shareholders had vastly exaggerated the 2016 investment pitch she floated to Catz, James said, and she hadn't even conceived of Ampere until 2017, long after Oracle’s NetSuite deal.But something at trial or in post-trial briefing prompted Glasscock to make a note of that “odor” from shareholders’ careerist depiction of James. Now it’s up to plaintiffs lawyers to clear the bad smell.(A previous version of this story incorrectly reported that James was granted summary judgment on shareholders' breach of duty claims.)Read more:NetSuite execs are off the hook in groundbreaking Oracle derivative caseOracle shareholders claim coverup as Ellison, Catz balk at discoveryOracle directors: Shareholders can go ahead with billion-dollar derivative suit(Reporting by Alison Frankel; editing by Leigh Jones)]"

This move aims to meet the increasing demand for cloud computing services from private and public sector organizations in Serbia and the surrounding region.The new cloud region will enable Serbian businesses to leverage the performance and security features of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and support the growth of industries, such as healthcare, retail and financial services.Oracle's cloud region in Serbia is part of its distributed cloud strategy, which allows the company to deliver cloud services to specific locations based on customer requirements.

However, Oracle lags in market share.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Per an AAG report, revenues from 2021 to 2022 for cloud infrastructure services reached $191 billion. Amazon.com’s AMZN Amazon Web Services (“AWS”)  has the largest market share with 32%, followed by Microsoft MSFT Azure with 23%, Alphabet’s GOOGL Google Cloud with 10% and OCI with only 3.8%.According to the same report, Microsoft Azure is preferred over AWS by organizations with lower cloud use. Among light users, 66% chose Azure, while 65% opted for AWS. For moderate users, Azure was favored by 70% and AWS by 68%. However, among heavy cloud users, 81% chose AWS, while 80% favored Azure.To ensure the best value for money, businesses are diversifying its cloud spending across multiple providers. Notably, 89% of businesses report using multi-cloud solutions. This approach prevents businesses from being dependent on a single system and helps mitigate the potential impact of provider-related issues, such as service outages.With multi-cloud solutions gaining momentum, the need to directly compete with giants also decreases. Small companies now can survive in the market by collaborating with giants for better reach.OCI is specifically designed for businesses seeking cost savings, improved operational efficiency, seamless migration of its applications to the cloud and the ability to deploy services closer to end users. In addition, it provides an extensive selection of services that cater to the diverse needs of organizations.

Household savings rates are rising as borrowing falls.None of this is guaranteed to dissuade the European Central Bank from continuing to raise rates, as core inflation, at +5.6% in April, remains too far above its 2.0% target to overlook.(3) Yellen in Spotlight, at the G7 Finance Minister Summit in JapanJanet Yellen has a three-pronged focus for the G7 finance ministers meeting under way in Niigata, Japan: tackling global inflation, bolstering long-term growth and redoubling support for Ukraine.But many of her colleagues may well be asking her how a potentially disastrous U.S. default can be averted.The U.S. Treasury Secretary delayed the start of her trip to devote more time to tackling the issue. However, bipartisan divides run deep, and President Joe Biden has hinted he may not even make it to Hiroshima for the G7 leaders meeting the following weekend.That would complicate a reported side summit with Japan and South Korea on strengthening security cooperation.Host nation Japan has more at stake than many in this standoff: It is the largest foreign holder of U.S. debt.(4) Turkey’s Long-Time President Erdogan On the RopesPresident Tayyip Erdogan has ruled Turkey with a firm grip for more than two decades. He faced a tight race against opposition rival Kemal Kilicdaroglu when the 85-million-people strong nation voted on Sunday.Their first contest ended with neither getting 50% of the vote. A runoff happens on May 28th.Polls suggested Kilicdaroglu had a chance, as many Turks are disenchanted with Erdogan, whose unorthodox economic and monetary policy has left them with a sharp decline in living standards, battered by crippling inflation and facing a collapsing lira.There was also widespread dissatisfaction over how the government responded to a February earthquake that killed more than 50,000 people and left millions homeless.Erdogan could yet prevail given a strong support base in the devout working-class Anatolian heartland. Even if he doesn't, it's hard to envisage the feisty politician quietly bowing out of office.Whoever wins has a challenging task to get the economy back on track.(5) Russia &amp; Ukraine Must Renegotiate Grain Export DealRussia and Ukraine have until May 18th to extend the Black Sea grain deal, which last year allowed the safe passage of Ukrainian exports to help tackle a global food crisis.The two sides could extend the agreement, but Russia says it will walk unless its demands to remove obstacles to its own exports are met.

CLX, McDonald's Corp. MCD, AptarGroup Inc. ATR, Rollins Inc. ROL and Graphic Packaging Holding Co. GPK.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:5 Dividend-Paying Growth Stocks to Buy for a Healthy PortfolioU.S. stock markets are directionless at present as market participants remain clueless about a near-term recession and the Fed's decision regarding the future movement of interest rate. Year to date, the Dow — the biggest gainer of 2022 — is up marginally by 0.5%.The broad-market benchmark — S&amp;P 500 Index — has advanced 7.6%. However, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has rallied 17.8%, buoyed by a lower inflation rate and the Fed's decision to reduce the magnitude of interest rate hike. However, in the past month, Wall Street remained range-bound on concerns stemming from the regional banking turmoil.  In its recently concluded May FOMC meeting, the Fed raised the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to the range of 5-5.25%, marking the highest Fed Fund rate since August 2007.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that the ongoing rate hike cycle is perhaps reaching its end, although it will depend on the outcome of economic data. The Fed Chair acknowledged that the current banking turmoil in the United States has led to tighter credit conditions, and is likely to impact economic activities.At this stage, it will be prudent to invest in growth stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank that pay regular dividend to strengthen one's portfolio.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five dividend -paying growth stocks that have solid upside left for 2023.

273,2aa7fcf7-2a8f-393d-a854-ae291f356c4b,TRIP,2023-05-16,"Further weakness as Tripadvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) drops 3.5% this week, taking five-year losses to 64%",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/further-weakness-tripadvisor-nasdaq-trip-131042571.html,1684156242,STORY,['TRIP'],"[We think intelligent long term investing is the way to go. But that doesn't mean long term investors can avoid big losses. To wit, the Tripadvisor, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP) share price managed to fall 68% over five long years. That's an unpleasant experience for long term holders. We also note that the stock has performed poorly over the last year, with the share price down 36%. Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 38% in the last 90 days. This could be related to the recent financial results - you can catch up on the most recent data by reading our company report.Since Tripadvisor has shed US$81m from its value in the past 7 days, let's see if the longer term decline has been driven by the business' economics. View our latest analysis for Tripadvisor While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).We know that Tripadvisor has been profitable in the past. However, it made a loss in the last twelve months, suggesting profit may be an unreliable metric at this stage. Other metrics might give us a better handle on how its value is changing over time.It could be that the revenue decline of 8.4% per year is viewed as evidence that Tripadvisor is shrinking. This has probably encouraged some shareholders to sell down the stock.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthTripadvisor is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Tripadvisor will earn in the future (free analyst consensus estimates)What About The Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?We'd be remiss not to mention the difference between Tripadvisor's total shareholder return (TSR) and its share price return. Arguably the TSR is a more complete return calculation because it accounts for the value of dividends (as if they were reinvested), along with the hypothetical value of any discounted capital that have been offered to shareholders. We note that Tripadvisor's TSR, at -64% is higher than its share price return of -68%. When you consider it hasn't been paying a dividend, this data suggests shareholders have benefitted from a spin-off, or had the opportunity to acquire attractively priced shares in a discounted capital raising.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveTripadvisor shareholders are down 36% for the year, but the market itself is up 2.6%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 10% over the last half decade. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. You could get a better understanding of Tripadvisor's growth by checking out this more detailed historical graph of earnings, revenue and cash flow.But note: Tripadvisor may not be the best stock to buy.

274,eff8bcda-7d78-3acb-ae0f-d45bef47308e,UPS,2023-05-16,"Should You Investigate United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) At US$169?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investigate-united-parcel-inc-nyse-130052182.html,1684155652,STORY,['UPS'],"[Let's talk about the popular United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS). The company's shares saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$196 and falling to the lows of US$169. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether United Parcel Service's current trading price of US$169 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at United Parcel Service’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for United Parcel Service What's The Opportunity In United Parcel Service?According to my valuation model, United Parcel Service seems to be fairly priced at around 14.36% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy United Parcel Service today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $147.34, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because United Parcel Service’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.Can we expect growth from United Parcel Service?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of United Parcel Service, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting earnings growth of 0.01%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in UPS’s future outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on UPS, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing United Parcel Service at this point in time. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of United Parcel Service.If you are no longer interested in United Parcel Service, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

278,f0e9d8eb-158d-30f1-8820-d2de369a316d,AXP,2023-05-16,Institutional investors may adopt severe steps after American Express Company's (NYSE:AXP) latest 3.3% drop adds to a year losses,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-investors-may-adopt-severe-120046999.html,1684152046,STORY,['AXP'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies American Express' stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsThe top 13 shareholders own 51% of the company Recent sales by insiders If you want to know who really controls American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 64% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).And institutional investors saw their holdings value drop by 3.3% last week. This set of investors may especially be concerned about the current loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 4.0% for shareholders. Often called “market makers”, institutions wield significant power in influencing the price dynamics of any stock. As a result, if the decline continues, institutional investors may be pressured to sell American Express which might hurt individual investors.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of American Express, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for American Express ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About American Express?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.American Express already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of American Express, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. American Express is not owned by hedge funds. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 20% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 6.4% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.1% by the third-largest shareholder.After doing some more digging, we found that the top 13 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of American ExpressWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that American Express Company insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$149m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 15% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over American Express. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Public Company OwnershipPublic companies currently own 20% of American Express stock. It's hard to say for sure but this suggests they have entwined business interests. This might be a strategic stake, so it's worth watching this space for changes in ownership.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for American Express that you should be aware of before investing here.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

This is because investors always try to position themselves ahead of time and look to tap stocks that are high-quality in nature.In this regard, we ran a screener that picked Clorox (CLX), Coty (COTY), Yum China (YUMC), Terex (TEX) and Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) as the likely winners on earnings beat potential.Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important?Historically, stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings (on a nominal basis) tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations. After all, a 20% earnings rise (though apparently looks good) doesn’t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend.Also, seasonal fluctuations come into play sometimes. If a company’s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 strong, then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company.On the other hand, after much brainstorming and analysis of companies’ financials and initiatives, Wall Street analysts project the earnings of companies. They, in fact, club their insights and a company’s guidance when deriving an earnings estimate.Thus, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company’s own expectation as well as the market perception. And if the margin of earnings surprise is big, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release. Thus, more than anything else, an earnings surprise can push a stock higher.How to Find Stocks that Can Beat?Now, finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line may be investors’ dream but not an easy job. One way to do this is to look at the earnings surprise history of the company.An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher. It indicates the company’s ability to surpass estimates. And investors generally believe that the company will apply the same secret sauce to execute yet another earning beat in its next release.Story continuesThe Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10%: Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again.Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20%: We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20%.Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20%: This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger.In addition, we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Only companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) rating can get through.Earnings ESP greater than zero: A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen, as per our proven model.In order to zero in on those that have long-term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too:Next 3–5 Years Estimated EPS Growth (Per Year) greater than 10%: Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock’s long-term growth prospects.Average 20-day Volume greater than 100,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to five.Here are all the five stocks:Clorox (CLX): The Zacks Rank #1 company is engaged in the production, marketing and sale of consumer products in the United States and international markets. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The average earnings surprise of CLX for the past four quarters is 25.47%.Coty (COTY): The Zacks Rank #1 company, along with its subsidiaries, manufactures, markets and distributes beauty products worldwide.The average earnings surprise of COTY for the past four quarters is 145.0%.Yum China (YUMC): Post spin-off from Yum! Brands, Inc., Yum China became an independent and publicly traded company. Zacks Rank #1 Yum China’s U.S. operations are based in Texas. The company operates both company-owned and franchised restaurants.The average earnings surprise of YUMC for the past four quarters is 301.6%.Terex TEX: The Zacks Rank #1 company is a global manufacturer of aerial work platforms, materials processing machinery and cranes.The average earnings surprise of TEX for the past four quarters is 27.06%.Martin Marietta Materials MLM:The Zacks Rank #1 company produces and supplies construction aggregates and other heavy building materials, mainly cement, in the United States.The average earnings surprise of MLM for the past four quarters is 30.98%.You can get sign up now for your 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard and start using this screen in your own trading.

For some consumers, snacks have now become entire meals, defying decades of health advice. Now, almost half of U.S. consumers have three or more snacks daily—up 8% in the last two years, according to market research firm Circana Group as cited by the Wall Street Journal Monday. And the younger generation—mainly millennials and Gen Z, from teens to people in their early 40s—are likely driving this soaring phenomenon.More from Fortune:  5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from home Looking to make extra cash? This CD has a 5.15% APY right now Buying a house? Here's how much to save This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home “Millennials took something that had a negative connotation with older generations—parents would tell you ‘don’t snack and spoil the meal’—and turned snacks into the entire meal itself,” Andrea Hernández, author of Snaxshot, an online newsletter focused on food and beverage trends, told the Journal.Snacking has been around for a long time, and currently accounts for 22% of the energy intake among U.S. adults. A rise in video gaming and in food prices is said to be responsible.The change in food choices is partly attributed to high inflation, which may be causing people to buy lower-cost food. Krogers, the largest U.S. grocery chain by sales, told the Journal that it was selling more boxes containing smaller snack bags inside to appeal to the growing snacker base.“Eating occasions have become slightly more evenly spread out throughout the day, shifting consumption away from mealtimes,” said a February report that analyzed eating patterns in the U.S. in 2022 by the Hartman Group, a research consultancy. “The decline in meal occasions witnessed in 2021 persisted in 2022, as consumers have shifted to more frequent snacks, with fewer items per occasion.”Story continuesForty-nine percent of consumers in 2023 are looking for snacks in multiple packs, up 8% a year ago, for various reasons like saving money and controlling intake portions, according to Circana.“You’ve started to see the ‘snack-ification’ of everything,” Hernández told the Journal.Snacking is global, according to international food brand Modelez. The company found patterns within snacking—such as a 42% rise in snacking between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. in 2021 compared to 2013, driven by Gen Z and millennials. Within this group, particularly women worldwide were more likely to snack in the early hours of the morning or skip meals, according to Mondelez’s 2022 State of Snacking survey published earlier this year.Nick Graham, global head of insights and analytics for Mondelez, told the Journal that millennials and Gen Z consumers typically eat about 10% more snacks daily compared to other generations.Mondelez also found that between 2020 and 2022, there was at least a 10% increase in people replacing breakfast, lunch and dinner with snacks.Junk food has negative health effects linked to obesity and diseases like diabetes. About 20% of the children aged 19 and under are obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And snacking, in particular, can result in unwanted weight gain and the absence of nutrition-rich meals.Snack boomIf snacking is booming, so too are snack-makers. U.S. snack sales reached $181 billion in 2022, up by 11% from the previous year, the Journal reported, citing Circana’s data.Companies like Mondelez, which makes Oreo cookies and Ritz crackers, and the chocolate-maker Hershey, have seen their revenue surge 22% and 30%, respectively, from 2019 to 2022.The enthusiasm for snacking is also helping some of these companies change in how they sell their products. For instance, cereals are now being sold as snack-packs while some iconic chips are available in “bite-sized” packaging.To reach a wider chunk of the young audience, food and beverage companies are trying new channels of engagement—like the metaverse, the virtual world that’s supposed to be the future, but is currently mostly a ghost town. Cheetos, the famous cheesy snack made by PepsiCo, launched a campaign targeting the metaverse in October.But these companies also face a changing consumer palette, where mindful eating and healthier options are front-and-center.Circana noted a drop in consumers picking snacks solely for taste, but found an increase in those opting for snacks that are more nutritious like granola bars and nuts. Even traditionally unhealthy snacks have found healthier ways to repackage their offering—such as fried potato chips and grain-free or baked chips.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. As with many other companies Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) makes use of debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?When Is Debt A Problem?Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together. See our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum What Is Occidental Petroleum's Debt?You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Occidental Petroleum had US$19.8b of debt in March 2023, down from US$26.3b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$1.17b, its net debt is less, at about US$18.6b.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At Occidental Petroleum's LiabilitiesThe latest balance sheet data shows that Occidental Petroleum had liabilities of US$7.44b due within a year, and liabilities of US$34.6b falling due after that. Offsetting this, it had US$1.17b in cash and US$3.27b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$37.6b.This is a mountain of leverage even relative to its gargantuan market capitalization of US$52.2b. This suggests shareholders would be heavily diluted if the company needed to shore up its balance sheet in a hurry.Story continuesIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.Occidental Petroleum has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.96. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 22.0 times over. So you could argue it is no more threatened by its debt than an elephant is by a mouse. On top of that, Occidental Petroleum grew its EBIT by 68% over the last twelve months, and that growth will make it easier to handle its debt. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Occidental Petroleum's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. Over the last two years, Occidental Petroleum actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT. That sort of strong cash generation warms our hearts like a puppy in a bumblebee suit.Our ViewHappily, Occidental Petroleum's impressive interest cover implies it has the upper hand on its debt. But truth be told we feel its level of total liabilities does undermine this impression a bit. Zooming out, Occidental Petroleum seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. While debt does bring risk, when used wisely it can also bring a higher return on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. Be aware that  Occidental Petroleum is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those can't be ignored...At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

290,01ab5062-5dd2-3724-ade5-a917eeb4db5a,OXY,2023-05-16,Is Most-Watched Stock Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY) Worth Betting on Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/most-watched-stock-occidental-petroleum-130001562.html,1684155601,STORY,['OXY'],"[Occidental Petroleum (OXY) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this oil and gas exploration and production company have returned -9.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.9% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, to which Occidental belongs, has lost 8.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Occidental is expected to post earnings of $1.34 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -57.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.4%.The consensus earnings estimate of $5.50 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -41.2%. This estimate has changed -5.9% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.36 indicates a change of +15.7% from what Occidental is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.3%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Occidental.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for OXY _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Occidental, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.7 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -28.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $31.13 billion and $32.22 billion estimates indicate -16.1% and +3.5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryOccidental reported revenues of $7.26 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -14.9%. EPS of $1.09 for the same period compares with $2.12 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.54 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -3.68%. The EPS surprise was -16.15%.Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Occidental is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Occidental. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Its peers include American Express Co and Bread Financial Holdings Inc.Capital One's stock rose 2.1% to $90.95 per share, its highest since May 1. The bank's shares have shed around 17% since early March as the banking crisis has clobbered shares of U.S. regional lenders.Morgan Stanley analysts said the selloff of U.S. regional bank stocks was overdone as markets have focused on deposit outflows instead of deposit costs, a better gauge of their financial stability.Since regional bank deposits are quite sticky and data does not show outflows accelerating, the analysts said their shares are now cheap and are headed for a rebound in coming months.""Recent declines seem overdone as quarter-to-date deposit outflows are tracking in-line with seasonality,"" the analysts said.Bank of America Global Research analysts changed their rating of Western Alliance Bancorp to ""buy"" from ""no rating,"" relying on the bank's huge share of insured deposits and ability to absorb deposit outflows with strong profitability.Western Alliance ""does not share a ton in terms of business model and balance sheet characteristics relative to the three failed banks,"" the analysts said. Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank have collapsed during the crisis.Story continuesWestern Alliance shares gained 2.7% while PacWest Bancorp lost 14.6%, nearly reversing all the gains from Monday's session The KBW Regional Banking Index fell 1.9%.After the closing bell, Western Alliance shares shot up 7.5% to $33.95 after the company disclosed in a filing that it has sold $2.3 billion out of $3 billion in loans on sale in the quarter-to-date.

Shares of peer Lowe's Companies Inc fell 1.16%.""You can argue that people are tired of spending on the house, they want experiences, they want to go out they want to do other things, they don’t want to fix up the house according to Home Depot, because they had horrendous earnings,"" said Ken Polcari, managing partner at Kace Capital Advisors in Boca Raton, Florida.The Commerce Department reported retail sales rose 0.4% in April, short of the estimate for an increase of 0.8%.

That slowing along with recent negotiations over the U.S. debt ceiling has focused attention on when the central bank will pause hiking, or cut interest rates.While the market is currently pricing in a rate cut by the end of the year, recent comments from Fed officials suggested they are not ready to cut rates soon.Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said he was ""comfortable"" with raising interest rates further if needed, but liked the ""optionality"" implied in the latest policy statement.Story continuesCleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said she does not think the central bank can hold interest rates steady yet.Lawmakers held a new round of talks about raising the debt ceiling. The Treasury Department has warned it could run out of money as soon as June 1 without a deal, which would trigger a default and likely cause a sharp economic slump.Horizon Therapeutics tumbled 14.17% as the Federal Trade Commission said it would file a lawsuit to block Amgen Inc's $27.8 billion deal to buy the company. Shares of Amgen fell 2.42%.The decline in both stocks weighed on the Nasdaq Biotech Index, which closed at a three-week low after dropping 2.44%, its biggest one-day percentage decline in three months.Shares of Capital One Financial Corp climbed 2.05% the day after Berkshire Hathaway Inc disclosed it had taken a stake of nearly $1 billion in the stock.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 4.05-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.28-to-1 ratio favored decliners.The S&amp;P 500 posted 12 new 52-week highs and 13 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 47 new highs and 188 new lows.Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.36 billion shares, compared with the 10.58 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.(This story has been corrected to say 'a rate cut,' instead of 'a rate hike,' in paragraph 8)(Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak; Editing by David Gregorio)]"

The Oracle of Omaha sold a large portion of Berkshire’s holdings in US banks between 2020 and 2022, some just months before the banking system upheaval that began in mid March.The 92-year-old investor has over the decades played the role of rescuer to a number of institutions, including in the 2008 financial crisis. He has yet to emerge as a white knight for any banks in trouble during this current crisis, at least in any way that has thus far been made public.Buffett made it clear at Berkshire's annual shareholders meeting earlier this month that he is still ""cautious"" about holding many bank stocks. One exception he cited was Bank of America, which remains one of Berkshire’s largest holdings.Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffett at a 2019 shareholders meeting. REUTERS/Scott Morgan (Scott Morgan / Reuters)In the first quarter, according to filings, Berkshire maintained its Bank of America holdings. The stake lost $4 billion in value through the quarter.""I like Bank of America and I like the management,"" Buffett said at the shareholder gathering in Omaha, Nebraska.Buffett has a long history with Bank of America. He injected $5 billion into the Charlotte, N.C.-based bank in 2011. At the time Brian Moynihan was still a relatively new chief executive and the lender's shares were under severe pressure due to losses from subprime loans.Buffett did invest more deeply into several other financial stocks in the quarter. Berkshire added $954 million of Capital One (COF) and raised its holding in Ally Financial (ALLY) by $10.6 million. The conglomerate also sold $1.1 million of Jefferies Financial Group (JEF) and didn't touch its stake in Citigroup (C).Story continuesUS Bancorp, BNY Mellon and Jefferies were down in early after hours trading while Bank of America, Citi, Capital One and Ally were up.Berkshire Hathaway was far from the only high profile investment manager selling bank shares last quarter.Bridgewater Associates, the world's biggest hedge fund, sold about $180 million in bank stocks.That included more than 80% of its holdings in Bank of New York Mellon and US Bancorp. Bridgewater also zeroed out positions in 15 other US lenders, including Bank of America (BAC), Western Alliance, Zions (ZION), PacWest (PACW) and New York Community Bank (NYCB).Correction (5/16): an earlier version of the article said Berkshire Hathaway raised its Bank of America holdings in the first quarter.

Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.14%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 5.74%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the beauty products retailer had lost 3.89% over the past month.

But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. Long term Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 123% in five years. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 16% gain in the last three months. The company reported its financial results recently; you can catch up on the latest numbers by reading our company report.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, Vertex Pharmaceuticals achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 70% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 17% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Vertex Pharmaceuticals has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.A Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Vertex Pharmaceuticals shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 37% over one year. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 17%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper.

(AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Longtime railroad exec Hunter Harrison pioneered PSR as a means to cut costs and boost operating margins. The system has three key components: minimize railroad car downtime; run longer trains at higher speeds, and minimize power requirements.Critics of PSR contend the process has been an exercise in cutting employees and running less-safe railroads to maximize the bottom line.A recent ProPublica analysis of Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) data found that 20 train derailments from 2005 to 2020 could be linked to trains being too long, for instance.The PSR model has come into focus amid Norfolk Southern derailments this year.On Feb. 3, a Norfolk Southern train with 150 cars carrying hazardous materials derailed in East Palestine, Ohio. The NTSB found the operators of the train tried to stop it after a wheel bearing overheated to a worrying level. An official cause of the derailment has not yet been shared by the NTSB.Shaw said that Norfolk Southern will be in East Palestine for ""as long as it takes"" to make things right with residents.This photo taken with a drone on Feb. 4, 2023, shows portions of a Norfolk Southern freight train still on fire that derailed on Feb. 3, in East Palestine, Ohio. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)The company incurred a $387 million charge in the first quarter related to potential clean-up efforts from the Feb. 3 derailment. Norfolk also committed to making up the difference in home value for residents who sold their homes for lower than their value before the accident.Story continuesLast week, nine cars from a Norfolk Southern freight train also derailed in Pennsylvania.But Shaw maintained that his railroad is a safe operator.""Last year at Norfolk Southern, our number of derailments was the lowest in two decades,"" he said. ""We can do better. We're looking at this stuff. We're working very closely with the NTSB.""At some point, the end game for PSR may come down to regulators.Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has criticized the PSR operating model and has clamored for tighter industry regulations.""We have a lot of concerns about the business models that the railroads have adopted,"" Buttigieg told Yahoo Finance Live. ""They strip out the human factor. Employment at some of these major railroads is down 30%, 40%. They've become wildly profitable but have not been able to dramatically improve their efficiency or their fluidity in moving goods, and it's really come on the backs of workers who are now overworked, stressed out. And this is part of what led to so much concern last year as workers were insisting on sick leave, something that we still believe these railroads need to provide.""Buttigieg is pushing for improved braking standards on freight trains, among other aspects.Norfolk Southern Chief Executive Alan Shaw testifies during a Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee hearing in Washington, U.S., March 22, 2023. REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein (Evelyn Hockstein / reuters)Shaw says he ""respects"" Buttigieg's position, but he hasn't publicly endorsed Buttigieg's thoughts on better braking systems.""There are a lot of things that Norfolk Southern does that are absolutely aligned with the administration's goals — high-paying union jobs, investments in the nation's infrastructure, pulling trucks off the highway, and the sustainability advantage of rail relative to truck,"" Shaw said. ""Relative to our long-term focus and our pivot away from that traditional rail model and hiring, that's exactly what we're doing, as I talked about in the new strategy Norfolk Southern charted in the industry.""""And then relative to rail safety, I've been on the Hill a number of times,"" Shaw added.

The elevated levels of inflation raised oil and natural gas prices. Moreover, amid the prolonged Russia-Ukraine war, Europe is likely to seek gas supplies outside Russia. This is expected to drive demand for LNG vessels.On the flip side, FLNG’s performance is expected to have been affected by supply-chain disruptions. High operating expenses due to the increased average number of vessels in its fleet are likely to have hurt the bottom line. Steep fuel costs are likely to have raised total expenses.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for FLEX LNG this time around. The combination of a positive  Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here.Earnings ESP: FLNG has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

NSC’s top line increased 7.5% year over year, with all key segments, including merchandise and coal, registering improvements in revenues. Total revenue per unit rose 8% year over year, driven by higher fuel surcharges and pricing.

From 3D TVs to MoviePass, there's plenty of failed innovation on display. The tragic sinking of the ""unsinkable"" Titanic and the Mercedes-Benz A-class compact car that failed a safety test by rolling over, show failures come in all shapes and sizes. Even tech giant Nintendo Co. Ltd. wasn't immune to failure, as evidenced by the Power Glove, a clunky and largely ineffective accessory for its gaming consoles released in 1989.But it's the food section that's particularly fascinating.West appreciates the food and beverage industry's evolutionary approach, noting that testing and trying new things is necessary for innovation. Even whiffs like beef and fish-flavored water for pets or New Coke are steps in the right direction, he said.After all, without failure, there can be no success. Just look at Heinz EZ Squirt ketchup.

Shocking, right?Crystal Pepsi only lasted for two years before it was yanked off the shelves.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Microsoft Corp. MSFT, BP p.l.c. BP, Zoetis Inc. ZTS, Lululemon Athletica Inc. LULU and Weyerhaeuser Co. WY.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Top Stock Reports for Microsoft, BP and ZoetisThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Microsoft Corp., BP p.l.c and Zoetis Inc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Microsoft shares largely tracked the Zacks Tech sector this year, but the stock hasn't looked back since the very strong Q1 earnings release on April 25th. As a result, Microsoft shares are now up +28.4% this year vs. +22% for the Zacks Tech sector and the +8.6% gain for the S&amp;P 500 index.The company is benefiting from strong Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes revenues. Intelligent Cloud revenues were driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. Productivity and Business Processes revenues increased due to strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions. Microsoft is also seen as having a better offering on the artificial intelligence (AI) front than rival Alphabet. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as gain in revenue per user drove top-line growth. However, More Personal Computing revenues decreased due to weak Windows and Devices businesses.Steady performance in Talent Solutions aided LinkedIn revenues. However, declining gaming revenues has been a headwind. Increasing spend on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space remains a concern.(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of BP have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (+24.4% vs. +10.2%). The company has a strong portfolio of upstream projects, backing impressive production growth. The company boasted that the target of adding a net production of 900 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2021 from key projects was met successfully.Story continuesBP expects $2-$3 billion of divestment and other proceeds in 2023. Before reporting its June-quarter results, the integrated energy major is willing to complete an additional $1.75 billion in share buy-backs. Also, BP reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings resulting from an increase in oil-equivalent production volumes.However, the energy giant's balance sheet is considerably more levered than most peers, limiting its financial flexibility. Also, increasing exploration expenses have been affecting the company's income. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on BP here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Zoetis shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Drugs industry over the past year (+12.9% vs. -1.8%). The company's innovative portfolio of pet care parasiticides, including Simparica Trio and key dermatology products maintain momentum for the company.The strong uptake of Librela and Solensia in Europe, its new monoclonal antibody therapies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats, is encouraging. The launch of innovative products bolstered the portfolio and should fuel growth.However, Zoetis had earlier faced supply challenges which impacted demand. Although the constraints have eased out, a similar situation will impact growth. Stiff competition from animal health business wings of Merck and Bayer remains a woe.(You can read the full research report on Zoetis here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Lululemon Athletica Inc. and Weyerhaeuser Co..Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

311,2c5a4cc1-0def-347d-ac5a-5e72dd284a68,INTU,2023-05-16,IRS looks into setting up a government-run tax filing system,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/irs-looks-setting-government-run-201555378.html,1684181755,VIDEO,"['INTU', 'HRB']","[The Yahoo Finance Live team discusses a plan for a free government-run tax self-filing service from the IRS, the popularity of e-filing, and what this means for H&amp;R Block and Intuit.Video Transcript- The IRS is releasing a report this week on the possibility of a free government-run tax filing service. Our very own Rachelle Akuffo is here with us to break this down. Rachelle, what do you think we can expect from this IRS proposal?RACHELLE AKUFFO: So as you mentioned there, so it's a combination of the IRS and the US Digital Service. Now they've been very tight-lipped on the details, but the ""Wall Street Journal"" and the ""Washington Post"" reporting that the agencies will lay out plans for this free government-run self-filing tax service this week. Now that's going to focus on some of these straightforward tax filers, so not if you have a lot of these complex tax issues. And they're supposed to be starting with a pilot test group in January of 2024.Now all of this really shouldn't come as much of a shock. I mean, the Biden administration and consumer groups have been pushing for lower filing fees, lower fees for consumers overall. And $15 million was set aside in the Inflation Reduction Act to look into a direct e-filing program. Now according to IRS estimates, the average American spends about $250 each year in tax filing services. If you look at TurboTax parent company Intuit and H&amp;R Block, they make up the bulk of the self-filing tax market.Now the popularity of e-filing has skyrocketed, climbing 100% since 2009 before paring back just a little bit since COVID. And of course, those two names with the lion's share there, having a bit of an issue here when it comes to the stock price. We saw some selling action, but it has at least pared back at least a little bit for now.- Yeah, Rachelle, how worried should those investors be because H&amp;R Block-- it's still off almost 3% today on this news?RACHELLE AKUFFO: Indeed. I mean, when you look at it, I mean, they had already been preparing a lot of their lobbying service money when you look at 18% and 29% for Intuit and H&amp;R Block, respectively. Now they argue that they already offer a lot of these services, at least for the federal filing, for free. And some of these other fees that you see more about the state filing, some additional or specialized fees there. But they're basically saying, look, keep in mind, there's already an existing free filing service that the IRS has now. That's if you're earning under $73,000.Story continuesAnd according to the most recent survey from the Government Accountability Office, over 70% of people who are eligible for it, only 4% of people are actually taking advantage of it. So even though it's there, people not using it. Now you might be wondering why. If you're eligible for this, why aren't you using it? Well, part of it is this concern about perhaps filing on a website at the same organization that's also going to turn around and potentially audit you at some point. It's almost like a roach voting for RAID. Why would I come in willingly to the IRS? That's not something that people are keen on.And also a caveat here that we saw from Kartik Meta, who's a northcoast research analyst. He was saying that, I guess what could break it is if the IRS said, we're going to take all this information and create your tax return. So not really worried about the companies right now at the moment. He said they have strong balance sheets. And again, you're not necessarily going to want to sign up to the IRS's free service if you think it's going to get you closer to getting a little bit more scrutiny.I don't know about you, Diane.- No.RACHELLE AKUFFO: I don't know that many people are that keen to do that.- [INAUDIBLE] Rachelle. I cannot-- I never thought I'd hear that on TV or digital space, a roach voting for RAID. All right, that's the takeaway right there.]"

Year to date, the stock has gained 1.1% compared with the industry’s increase of 1.8%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBusiness TailwindsCincinnati Financial is well-poised to grow on the back of solid performance across the Commercial Lines and Personal Lines segments. Performance of the Personal Lines segment is likely to be driven by the planned expansion of high-net-worth business produced by the agencies, higher renewal written premiums and the extended use of pricing precision tools.The Commercial Lines business is expected to gain from solid premiums earned, reflecting renewal written premium growth that continued to include higher average pricing and improved level of insured exposures. In this segment, average renewal pricing continued to increase near the high end of the mid-single-digit percent range in the first quarter of 2023.Investment income should continue to rise because of the surge in equity portfolio dividends and interest income. Moreover, cash flow from operating activities consistently helps the company boost investment income. From 2016 to 2022, the P&amp;C insurer saw its net investment income grow 3.96%.The property and casualty insurer is focused on earning new business through appointment of new agencies from a combination of quality service and expansion of insurance products for clients of those agencies. Agencies, appointed since the beginning of 2022, contributed 5% of total new business written premiums. So far in 2023, the insurer has appointed 66 agencies, including 23 that market only personal lines products.Cincinnati Financial has a solid balance sheet with high liquidity and low leverage. Cash flow, a contributor to investment income and interest income, remains strong.Cincinnati Financial has returned capital to shareholders through regular cash dividends as well as special dividends. In January 2023, the board increased quarterly cash dividend by 9% and this action sets the stage for a 63rd consecutive year of rising dividend payments. Its current dividend yield of 2.9% is higher than the industry’s average of 0.3%.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the property and casualty insurance industry are Kinsale Capital Group, Inc.

So the new Veralto will become publicly traded when it has already bulked up.After the spinoff is finalized, shareholders should end up with shares of both companies. To make the new company more attractive, the parent reported in a news release that Veralto will have the Danaher Business System built in.That is the continuous improvement system that has been admired by many other corporations. Most recently, when the General Electric Co. (NYSE:GE) board of directors brought in a new CEO, they recruited a Danaher alumnus.The system also provided investors with significant capital gains in the 2010s:Danaher: A Long-Term Prospect With a Potential BonusAs the chart shows, the share price averaged gains of 19.24% per year over the past 23 years. And that includes the pullback that began at the beginning of 2022.From another perspective, Danaher has gone from basically a zero market capitalization to nearly $168 billion capitalization in just over 40 years.The share price has not recovered since declining with the 2022 slump. That is likely due to short-term considerations; traders were unhappy with its most recent quarterly update and disappointing guidance.Story continuesHowever, president and CEO Rainer Blair was optimistic. He said, Looking ahead, we believe the combination of our leading businesses, the power of the Danaher Business System and the strength of our balance sheet differentiates Danaher and positions us to continue delivering sustainable, long-term shareholder value.Should we be as optimistic? Should we zig when the traders and short-term investors zag? That depends on the fundamentals.Overall, they look promising, with a GF Score of 91 out of 100. Financial strength is a bit iffy at 7 out of 10; still, it has an interest coverage ratio of 36.93 and an Altman Z-Score of 4.5. It has a solid balance sheet.Danaher: A Long-Term Prospect With a Potential BonusFurther, Danaher has returned to being a value creator after several poor years in the mid-2010s. That is displayed in this 12-year chart of return on invested capital versus the weighted average cost of capital.Danaher: A Long-Term Prospect With a Potential BonusAs for profitability, it has industry-leading (medical diagnostics and research) operating and net margins at 26.85% and 22.40%, respectively. It also has been profitable every year for the past 10 years.Give it high marks, too, for growth of revenue, Ebitda and earnings per share without non-recurring items.Over the past three years, it has generated average annual revenue growth of 20%, average Ebitda growth of 31.90% and average earnings per share without non-recurring items growth of 43.60%. All are laudable.At the same time, free cash flow, the source of funds for capital expenditures, acquisitions and dividends, has been strong as well. Over the past three years, it has averaged 29.80% per year.Speaking of dividends, Danaher currently pays 27 cents per quarter or $1.08 annually. This 10-year chart shows how the yield grew when the share price was relatively flat, then fell and rose again.Danaher: A Long-Term Prospect With a Potential BonusAs noted, the share price has fallen significantly. According to the GF Value Line, it is currently undervalued by $75.80, based on the GF Value of $303.40 and the May 12 closing price of $227.60.Danaher: A Long-Term Prospect With a Potential BonusThe price-earnings ratio of 24.53 indicates it is slightly overvalued when compared to the industry median of 21.23.The PEG ratio, calculated by dividing the price-earnings ratio by the average five-year growth rate of Ebitda (24.90%), is 0.99. Thats at the top end of the undervaluation range.On the price chart, we see it has fallen below its 10-year trendline, which is at $310.98. In my opinion, the shares are more likely to be undervalued than overvalued.Gurus like it a lot. Danaher has 24 of them among its shareholders, and that is more than almost any other stock. The big three holders, according to 13F filings for the end of 2022, were Vanguard Health Care Fund (Trades, Portfolio) (4,617,864 shares), Ken Fisher (Trades, Portfolio) of Fisher Asset Management (3,991,639) and Daniel Loeb (Trades, Portfolio) of Third Point with 2,700,000 shares.Institutional investors have a relatively modest stake, with 59.10% of shares outstanding. Insiders owned 1.13%.Investors should be aware that 13F filings do not give a complete picture of a firms holdings as the reports only include its positions in U.S. stocks and American depository receipts, but they can still provide valuable information. Further, the reports only reflect trades and holdings as of the most-recent portfolio filing date, which may or may not be held by the reporting firm today or even when this article was published.In conclusion, I would argue Danaher may be a weak stock from a short-term perspective, but a strong stock for the long term. It knows how to generate revenue, Ebitda and earnings, and how to make its shareholders happy with capital gains. Thanks to short-term issues, it is bargain-priced and may even give investors stock in a new company later this year.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Weighed down by shrinking margins, most sector operators are projected to post weaker year-over-year quarterly earnings in the remainder of 2023. Worse still, the rise in costs on the back of persistent inflation continues to eat into profits.Nevertheless, the space continues to benefit from strong product demand due to increasing travel and mobility. In the present environment, we advise investors to look at fundamentally solid companies like Marathon Petroleum, Valero Energy, Murphy USA and PBF Energy.Industry OverviewThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry consists of companies involved in selling refined petroleum products (including heating oil, gasoline, jet fuel, residual oil, etc.) and a plethora of non-energy materials (like asphalt, road salt, clay and gypsum). Some companies also operate refined products' terminals, storage facilities and transportation services. The primary activity of these firms involves buying crude/other feedstocks, and processing them into a wide variety of refined products.Refining margins are extremely volatile and generally reflect the state of petroleum product inventories, demand for refined products, imports, regional differences, and capacity utilization in the refining industry. Other major determinants of refining profitability are the light/heavy and sweet/sour spreads. Refiners are also prone to unplanned outages.3 Trends Defining the Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing Industry's FutureSoftening Margin Backdrop: While refining margins are still relatively healthy, they have moderated considerably from the spectacular levels of 2022. Crack spreads (or difference between the price of refined products and crude oil) have come down too. Recessionary impact, if any, will drive down profitability further. With oil exports from Russia continuing to find new outlets like India and China despite price caps and sanctions, product supplies have not tightened to the extent that was expected. This implies that global refinery margins have lately lost steam, depressing the profits of the downstream companies.    Story continuesFuel Demand Remains Healthy: Of late, refiners have been supported by a marked improvement in refined products' consumption — primarily gasoline and diesel — on the back of increasing travel and mobility. Per the U.S. Energy Department's latest release, gasoline inventories are around 7% below the five-year average, signaling robust oil product usage in the market. In other words, this indicates surging consumption of gasoline, diesel and other refined products.As economic activity remains resilient and Americans take to the road with a vengeance amid post-pandemic recovery, refined products' usage should continue to gain traction throughout 2023. The refiners should also benefit from increased driving and accelerating international travel.Ongoing Supply-Chain Bottlenecks: Despite the relatively bullish energy landscape and improved demand environment, the industry has not been immune to supply-chain disruptions and cost inflation. Macro issues like higher transportation expenses, driver scarcity and labor shortages have limited refiners' ability to ship packaged volumes to their customers.Most operators have also felt the impact of inflation, which is rolling through the cost structure. What's worse is that these headwinds across the system and the subsequent hit to profitability (due to difficulty in passing through the increased costs to clients) are expected to continue in the near future.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates a Bearish OutlookThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing is a 16-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #164, which places it in the bottom 34% of some 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates fairly strong near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Despite the dim near-term prospects of the industry, we will present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio. But it's worth taking a look at the industry's shareholder returns and current valuation first.Industry Outperforms Sector But Lags S&amp;P 500The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry has fared better than the broader Zacks Oil – Energy sector over the past year but has underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the same period.The industry has inched up 1.2% over this period compared with the broader sector's decline of 1%. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 4.4%.Industry's Current ValuationSince oil and gas companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just equity but also the level of debt. For capital-intensive companies, EV/EBITDA is a better valuation metric because it is not influenced by changing capital structures and ignores the effect of noncash expenses.On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 1.34X, significantly lower than the S&amp;P 500's 12.17X. It is also below the sector's trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA of 2.78X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 6.90X, as low as 1.30X, with a median of 4.31X.4 Stocks to Watch ForMurphy USA: It is a leading independent retailer of motor fuel and convenience merchandise in the United States. The proximity of Murphy USA's fuel stations to Walmart supercenters helps the company to leverage the strong and consistent traffic that these stores attract. MUSA's acquisition of QuickChek Corporation — a family-owned food and beverage chain located — is expected to help improve its offerings.Over the past 30 days, this El Dorado, AR-based Murphy USA has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 improve 2.2%. MUSA beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters, the average being 15.6%. The company carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Shares of MUSA have gained 11.5% in a year.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Marathon Petroleum: The company is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products. MPC's $23.3 billion acquisition of Andeavor has integrated the premier assets of both companies, bolstering the scale and leadership position of the combined entity in the United States. As it is, Marathon Petroleum's access to lower cost of crude in the Permian, Bakken, and Canada helps it to benefit from the differentials.MPC beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 14.2%. Valued at around $47.4 billion, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) Marathon Petroleum has gained 14.8% in a year.PBF Energy: PBF Energy has one of the most complex refining systems in the United States. As a result, the firm has the capacity to generate lighter and better grades of refined products. PBF's daily processing capacity of 1,000,000 barrels of crude is higher than most of its peers.PBF, based in Parsippany, NJ, beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters, the average being 18.5%. The Zacks #3 Ranked PBF's shares are up 16% in a year.Valero Energy: Among all the independent refiners, Valero offers the most diversified refinery base with a capacity of 3.1 million barrels per day in its 15 refineries located throughout the United States, Canada and the Caribbean. The majority of VLO's refining plants are located in the Gulf Coast area, from where there is easy access to export facilities.VLO beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 11.7%. Valued at around $40.1 billion, the Zacks Rank #3 Valero Energy has lost 11.3% in a year.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At UnitedHealth GroupIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the President &amp; COO, Dirk McMahon, sold US$8.0m worth of shares at a price of US$543 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$491. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.All up, insiders sold more shares in UnitedHealth Group than they bought, over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At UnitedHealth Group Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at UnitedHealth Group. Specifically, insiders ditched US$4.3m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Does UnitedHealth Group Boast High Insider Ownership?I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that UnitedHealth Group insiders own 0.3% of the company, worth about US$1.6b. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About UnitedHealth Group Insiders?Insiders haven't bought UnitedHealth Group stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And our longer term analysis of insider transactions didn't bring confidence, either. But it is good to see that UnitedHealth Group is growing earnings. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. You'd be interested to know, that we found 1 warning sign for UnitedHealth Group and we suggest you have a look.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

323,8782e2e1-72fe-3012-86d7-1c63921780d5,SLG,2023-05-16,The Long Decline Of Office REITs: Is There Hope For A Rebound?,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/long-decline-office-reits-hope-175318123.html,1684173198.0,STORY,"['SLG', 'BXP']","[As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) cites May 11, 2023, as the end of the federal COVID-19 Public Health Emergency and the World Health Organization (WHO) declares the virus to no longer be a global health emergency, it’s easy to forget that it was only a little over three years ago that the world was turned upside down by the emerging pandemic.The impact on the U.S. stock market was tremendous, and many real estate investment trusts (REITs), especially those in the office sector, would suffer devastating losses. In the span of four weeks, stalwart office REITs such as SL Green Realty Corp. (NYSE: SLG) and Boston Properties Inc. (NYSE: BXP) fell 60% and 45%, respectively. After a recovery to near pre-COVID levels that took almost two years, the office REITs have once again tumbled to new lows since March 2022.While these drops have significantly raised dividend yields, income investors need to decide whether these REITs are terrific long-term buys at current levels or if there will be dividend cuts or further declines before the stocks reach their absolute bottoms?Many analysts have predicted the demise of office leasing as companies have discovered that employees working from home can save firms millions of dollars a year. Many companies have re-leased offices since 2020 but have also downsized the space needed with so many stay-at-home workers.Employees loved saving time and money by no longer commuting, eating lunch at home instead of in expensive restaurants and not having to put young children into costly daycare. Some were able to buy homes in less expensive rural areas because commuting was no longer an issue.But lately, many companies have changed their minds. Within the past month, large companies such as Google, Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. have all told workers they must come back to the office at least a few days per week. The general consensus is that workers are more productive in the office than at home.Story continuesOn April 20, the New York City Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced that it surpassed 4 million rides for the first time since March 12, 2020, the day before the city shut down for the pandemic. While the increase in ridership may reflect people feeling safer from contracting illness, it also suggests that more people are returning to the office in the larger cities.This could be good news for office REITs, which continue to flounder, even as other REIT subsectors like hotel, retail and mortgage REITs regain some stability. But not all office REITs are still suffering. Take a look at three office REITs that have outperformed their peers in recent weeks.JBG SMITH Properties (NYSE: JBGS) is a Bethesda, Maryland-based diversified REIT that owns and operates 18 million square feet of high-quality office, retail and residential properties in Virginia, Maryland and Washington D.C. JBG Smith is a member of the S&amp;P 400.On May 9, JBG Smith reported its first-quarter operating results. Funds from operations (FFO) of $0.33 was down a penny from the first quarter of 2022. Revenue of $152.96 million beat the estimates of $147.05 million but was 5.56% lower than in the first quarter of 2022. Still, the stock rose after the report was released.Over the past four weeks, JBG Smith has risen 10.04% and is the leading office REIT during that time. Before the pandemic, JBG Smith was a $38 stock. Its most recent closing price was $15.12.Peakstone Realty Trust (NYSE: PKST) is an El Segundo, California-based diversified REIT that owns and operates single-tenant office and industrial properties. Peakstone Realty’s portfolio has 19 million square feet of space in high-growth markets in 24 states. Its portfolio is 95% leased.Peakstone Realty launched its initial public offering (IPO) on April 13. The stock soared from $8 to $40.35 in five days. It has since backed off considerably, but over the past four weeks Peakstone Realty is still up 9.89%. Much of that has come over the past four days.On May 9, Peakstone Realty Trust reported first-quarter operating results with FFO of $0.37 per share.Investor note: As a new IPO, this stock is extremely volatile and without much history for comparison purposes.Corporate Office Properties Trust (NYSE: OFC) is a Columbia, Maryland-based REIT that owns and manages office and data center properties in locations that support the U.S. government and its contractors in the Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, Maryland, areas. It’s a member of the midcap S&amp;P 400.On April 27, Corporate Office Properties reported its first-quarter operating results. FFO of $0.59 was up a penny from the first quarter of 2022. Revenue of $151.68 million beat the consensus estimate of $150.14 million and was a 6.61% increase over revenue of $142.28 million in the first quarter of 2022.In the past four weeks Corporate Office Properties has risen 5.4%. But shares have fallen from $28 to the recent closing price of $24.01 since early February. The stock recently climbed above its 50-day moving average and appears to be stabilizing.Don't miss:How These Accredited Investors Pulled In Better Returns Than Warren BuffettWhy Warren Buffett's Investing Strategy Is More Relevant Than Ever In Today's Real Estate MarketDespite these gains, Wall Street is still quite negative on office REITs, and Charlie Munger, vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-A) recently warned of a potential crash in the U.S. commercial property market.It’s important to choose carefully among REITs in the office sector. What is noteworthy about these three office REITs is that they are diversified by also owning retail, industrial and residential properties. They are outperforming other office REITs that aren’t diversified, such as SL Green and Boston Properties.In February, the office occupancy rate in 10 major U.S. cities averaged 50.1%, but it was the first time the rate had climbed above 50% since the pre-COVID days. However, as of this past week, the occupancy rate was basically the same. Until that rate begins climbing again, most office REITs will are expected to continue to struggle.SL Green’s dividend yield is presently 15.4%. Its FFO payout ratio is still a moderate 59%, but it has declining revenue and risk of refinancing at higher rates with debt maturities of $2.2 billion before the end of 2024. Five months ago, SL Green cut its dividend from $0.3111 to $0.271. Another cut cannot be ruled out.Boston Properties has a 7.6% dividend yield which is about double its five-year dividend yield average. It appears to be in better shape as its first quarter FFO and revenue beat the estimates.With office REITs at such low levels, this could be a terrific opportunity for long-term income investors to pick up shares with higher yields. But for the moment, look to favor the office REITs that have the most diversification and the best occupancy rates, and avoid chasing the REITs that have the highest yields.Over the past five years, private market real estate investments have outperformed the publicly traded REIT market by about 50%.

Horton (DHI) Is Up 0.43% in One Week: What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/d-r-horton-dhi-0-160004850.html,1684166404,STORY,['DHI'],"[Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at D.R. Horton (DHI), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. D.R. Horton currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for DHI that show why this homebuilder shows promise as a solid momentum pick.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor DHI, shares are up 0.43% over the past week while the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry is up 0.79% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 10.52% compares favorably with the industry's 8.72% performance as well.While any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Shares of D.R. Horton have increased 15.06% over the past quarter, and have gained 58.46% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 1.24% and 6.64%, respectively.Investors should also take note of DHI's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, DHI is averaging 2,964,711 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with DHI.Over the past two months, 16 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost DHI's consensus estimate, increasing from $9.08 to $11.01 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 14 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that DHI is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep D.R. Horton on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Aaon (AAON) is a stock that can certainly grab the attention of many investors, but do its recent returns compare favorably to the sector as a whole? By taking a look at the stock's year-to-date performance in comparison to its Construction peers, we might be able to answer that question.Aaon is a member of the Construction sector. This group includes 96 individual stocks and currently holds a Zacks Sector Rank of #1. The Zacks Sector Rank considers 16 different groups, measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the sector to gauge the strength of each group.The Zacks Rank is a proven system that emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions, highlighting a variety of stocks that are displaying the right characteristics to beat the market over the next one to three months. Aaon is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for AAON's full-year earnings has moved 11.4% higher. This shows that analyst sentiment has improved and the company's earnings outlook is stronger.Our latest available data shows that AAON has returned about 25.7% since the start of the calendar year. Meanwhile, stocks in the Construction group have gained about 14.2% on average. This shows that Aaon is outperforming its peers so far this year.Another Construction stock, which has outperformed the sector so far this year, is D.R. Horton (DHI). The stock has returned 21.8% year-to-date.In D.R. Horton's case, the consensus EPS estimate for the current year increased 21.5% over the past three months. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Looking more specifically, Aaon belongs to the Building Products - Air Conditioner and Heating industry, which includes 6 individual stocks and currently sits at #19 in the Zacks Industry Rank. On average, stocks in this group have gained 31.8% this year, meaning that AAON is slightly underperforming its industry in terms of year-to-date returns.Story continuesD.R.

From 3D TVs to MoviePass, there's plenty of failed innovation on display. The tragic sinking of the ""unsinkable"" Titanic and the Mercedes-Benz A-class compact car that failed a safety test by rolling over, show failures come in all shapes and sizes. Even tech giant Nintendo Co. Ltd. wasn't immune to failure, as evidenced by the Power Glove, a clunky and largely ineffective accessory for its gaming consoles released in 1989.But it's the food section that's particularly fascinating.West appreciates the food and beverage industry's evolutionary approach, noting that testing and trying new things is necessary for innovation. Even whiffs like beef and fish-flavored water for pets or New Coke are steps in the right direction, he said.After all, without failure, there can be no success. Just look at Heinz EZ Squirt ketchup.

But it turns out that consumers weren't too keen on a caffeine-free version of Pepsi that looked like water. Shocking, right?Crystal Pepsi only lasted for two years before it was yanked off the shelves. The former Pepsi marketing executive David Novak, who came up with the idea, admitted in an interview with Thrillist that while it was ""probably the best idea I’ve ever had,"" it was also ""the most poorly executed.""

The biggest tidbit of gossip was that Buffett considers Apple to be the best business that they own. Additionally, he said Berkshire was not intending on buying out Occidental Petroleum.But what if, as an investor, you wanted to own the various businesses that Buffett owns, but you didn't want to do so by owning shares of Berkshire Hathaway? Berkshire Hathaway now has $130 billion in cash but doesn't pay a dividend. That's a lot of cash sitting on the sidelines.It's also not cheap, with a forward P/E of 17.Creating Your Own Mini Berkshire HathawayAnyone can mimic Berkshire Hathaway's equity portfolio. That's easy. The company files Form 4s every quarter disclosing what stocks they are buying, and selling.But what about its other businesses? It owns See's Candy, Dairy Queen, BNSF Railroad, Nebraska Furniture Market and a bunch of other companies.5 Berkshire-Like Companies You Could Buy Right Now1.       Union Pacific Corp. UNPUnion Pacific Corp. is a big American railroad, similar to Berkshire's BNSF.Shares of Union Pacific are down 4.3% year-to-date but it's not that cheap. It trades with a forward P/E of 17.8.Story continuesEarnings are expected to be up 0.09% this year and 7.1% in 2024. But is that enough to pay 17.8x?Should you buy Union Pacific, an ""old economy"" stock, in 2023?2.       Haverty Furniture HVTHaverty Furniture operates 100 showrooms in 16 southern and Midwest states. Founded in 1885, Haverty is in the same mold as some of Buffett's furniture investments like Nebraska Furniture Market.Shares of Haverty have fallen 14.6% year-to-date. It's dirt cheap, with a forward P/E of 6.7. Haverty also pays a dividend, currently yielding 4.3%.However, with the US housing market slowing, so are Haverty's sales. Sales fell 5.9% in the first quarter.Is Haverty a deal?3.       The Hershey Company HSYHershey is a confection and food company that makes famous candy brands such as Reese's and Almond Joy. While it's not identical to Berkshire's See's Candy, it's the closest publicly traded candy company out there.Hershey shares have been on a tear in 2023, gaining 18.7%. It's also near a 5-year high. But Hershey doesn't come cheap. It's trading at 29x.Is Hershey overbought?4.       Signet Jewelers Ltd. SIGSignet Jewelers is an option if you want to own a jewelry store like Warren Buffett. Berkshire Hathaway bought Helzberg Diamonds in 1996.Shares of Signet Jewelers are up 5.5% year-to-date and 88% over the last 5 years. The 5-year performance easily beats the S&amp;P 500, which is up 51.7% during that time.Signet Jewelers is cheap, with a forward P/E of 6.2.Should you consider Signet Jewelers even though a recession may be coming?5.       Redfin Corp.

Over the last 2 years, it's down 78% but in 2023, Redfin is hot, gaining 161%.Redfin doesn't have a P/E as earnings are expected to be negative in both 2023 and 2024.Is a rebound in housing already priced into Redfin shares?What Else do Value Investors Need to Know About Creating a Mini Berkshire Hathaway?

And this week, we have many notable companies slated to report, including Walmart WMT, Cisco Systems CSCO, Home Depot HD, and Deere &amp; Company DE.Overall, it’s a big week for retail stocks, but there’s still representation from many sectors. How do the four above shape up heading into their respective quarterly prints? Let’s take a closer look at estimates.Home DepotHome Depot’s quarterly expectations have been lowered since February, with the $3.81 per share estimate being revised downward by 7.5% from $4.12 per share. The quarterly estimate reflects a modest pullback in earnings from the year-ago quarter, with rising costs likely negatively impacting the quarter’s results.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, the Zacks Consensus Sales Estimate presently sits at $38.5 billion, with the estimate down 2% since February and reflecting a decline of 1% compared to the year-ago period.The market has primarily had mixed reactions to HD’s quarterly results over the recent term, as illustrated by the arrows circled in the chart below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCisco SystemsCisco’s earnings outlook has improved nicely since February, with the $0.97 per share estimate up nearly 8% and reflecting year-over-year growth of 11.5%. Top line growth is also there, with our consensus estimate of $14.4 billion indicating a 12% climb year-over-year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIt’s worth noting that CSCO shares have recently broken through the 50-day moving average, indicating a short-term bearish trend with upward momentum fading. A solid quarterly print can push life into the stock; CSCO shares have seen buyers step up following both of its recent earnings releases.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesWalmartWalmart’s quarterly print will undoubtedly be watched like a hawk, as the results will provide a solid gauge of consumer sentiment. The company’s business offers a solid blend of products at reasonable prices, which allows it to capture revenue from lower and higher-end consumers who decide to ‘trade down’ and save their cash.Walmart has consistently delivered better-than-expected results in a challenging operating environment, exceeding earnings and revenue expectations in each of its last three prints. For the quarter to be reported, we expect the company to post EPS of $1.31 and $148 billion in quarterly revenue.Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWalmart shares are a bit expensive on a relative basis, with the current 25.1X forward earnings multiple sitting above the 23.2X five-year median and the Zacks Retail and Wholesale sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDeere &amp; CompanySimilar to CSCO, Deere’s earnings outlook for the quarter to be reported has ticked 5% higher to $8.51 per share, implying an improvement of 25% year-over-year. The company has posted back-to-back quarters of exceeding both earnings and revenue expectations.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDE shares have recently witnessed the ‘death cross,’ which occurs when the 50-day moving average heads below the 200-day moving average. It could potentially reflect a bearish shift for shares, something investors should be aware of.This ‘death cross’ is illustrated below, with another recent example also blended in.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineWhile earnings season is winding down, we still have many quarterly prints to sort through, including those from Cisco Systems CSCO, Deere &amp; Company DE, Walmart WMT, and Home Depot HD.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Check Out These 2 Computer and Technology Names,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-stocks-positive-earnings-momentum-130001561.html,1684155601,STORY,"['SHOP', 'CSCO']","[Earnings are arguably the most important single number on a company's quarterly financial report. Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Cisco Systems (CSCO) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.99 a share, just two days from its upcoming earnings release on May 17, 2023.CSCO has an Earnings ESP figure of 1.59%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.99 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.97.CSCO is one of just a large database of Computer and Technology stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Shopify (SHOP).Slated to report earnings on July 26, 2023, Shopify holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $0 a share 72 days from its next quarterly update.Shopify's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 100% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.Story continuesCSCO and SHOP's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

333,f86664aa-6706-3afd-ae52-c9798be98aac,CSCO,2023-05-16,Girls in ICT Day: Preparing the Next Generation for a Digital and Low-Carbon Economy,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/girls-ict-day-preparing-next-122500531.html,1684153500,STORY,['CSCO'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / May 15, 2023 / Cisco Systems Inc.Cisco Systems Inc., Monday, May 15, 2023, Press release pictureInternational Girls in ICT Day is a global movement encouraging girls and young women to pursue science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education and careers.Cisco hosts events through our Women Rock-IT program, which began in 2014 and has seen more than two million participants, with over half enrolling in one of our Cisco Networking Academy courses as a result.Join us on April 27 to hear from women who are working on critical environmental issues like climate change and learn how developing digital skills now can help protect our planet!At Cisco, we want the future to be sustainable, inclusive, and resilient. To prepare for this future, the global workforce is transitioning to jobs that will focus on finding innovative solutions to some of our biggest challenges, including climate change. We must prepare everyone for the emerging digital and low-carbon economy, particularly young people who will lead the next generation of visionaries.According to the World Economic Forum (WEF), by 2030, 9 out of 10 jobs will require digital skills. Many people, including youth and the most economically vulnerable, will need help developing these skills so they can participate in this new economy. For example, a 2020 report from the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) shows that by 2030, some 880 million children globally will not be on track to develop the skills they need to succeed in the workforce.Another skill set that will be essential in the transition to this new economy: ""green skills."" According to a 2022 guide from The International Labor Organization (ILO) for young people, job seekers and those who support them, ""The transition to the green economy will inevitably involve destruction of some jobs, but in the same time, the creation of new ones. The ILO estimates that about 100 million new jobs can potentially be created by 2030, leading to a net job creation of 25 million jobs."" And we are already seeing some progress. In the United States, over 100,000 new clean energy jobs were created across the country in just six months after the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law in August 2022. And the same research from Climate Power shows that as of January 31, 2023, there are over 90 new clean energy projects in small towns and bigger cities nationwide totaling $89.5 billion in new investments.Story continuesBut what exactly are green skills? WEF states, ""Green skills are abilities or knowledge a worker can use to prevent, monitor, or clean up pollution, and optimize stewardship and conservation of the natural resources that companies use to produce goods and services."" Green skills will be in demand across different industries, including finance, technology, transportation, and even fashion.It's critical that the workforce is prepared to facilitate the digital and low-carbon transition in tandem. We can no longer teach digital skills without also incorporating the realities of how technology can both impact and benefit the environment. Tech is enabling different ways of working and addressing environmental issues - such as apps that collect data about wildfires, IoT devices that monitor the health of the soil on a farm, advances in hardware engineering that make products more energy efficient, or video conferencing tools that support the shift into hybrid work, so people spend less time commuting. All these changes are made possible by technology innovations, and we want to ensure everyone has the skills they need to contribute to this new world.Why we need girls and women to help drive this new digital and low-carbon economyAccording to the Economist, the climate crisis disproportionately impacts girls and women. For example, women and girls are often responsible for securing household essentials like food and water for their families, which becomes more difficult during droughts and other natural disasters that are becoming more common with climate change. And according to the same article, women are less likely to survive natural disasters due to a lack of information or education, not having resources to seek safety, and less access to healthcare.At the same time, women are taking leadership positions in the field of sustainability. At large companies, 58 percent of sustainability executives are female. And according to the 2022 GreenBiz State of the Profession report, ""the number of women in sustainability leadership roles has expanded by close to 20 percentage points in every category since our first survey in 2010.""Although women are present in manager, director, and vice president roles, when it comes to ""green skills"" overall, the growth in gender equity seems to stall. According to LinkedIn's 2022 Global Green Skills Report, there is a global ""green gender gap"" with 62 women for every 100 men considered green talent in 2021, and this number hasn't changed since 2015. Why is this happening? According to Fortune, ""The technical and engineering jobs that are expected to see the most growth are still very male-dominated. Simply put: STEM fields aren't making nearly enough progress on the gender front."" According to the UN's report titled ""Progress on the Sustainable Development Goals: The Gender Snapshot 2022"", women make up just 19.9 percent of science and engineering professionals worldwide. The low-carbon economy will need engineers and other creative talent to tackle the climate crisis.According to The International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the four leading causes of the global digital gender divide are: lack of internet access, gaps in digital skills, less representation in STEM fields, and not enough women in tech sector leadership and entrepreneurship.A 2019 report from McKinsey shows that 40 to 160 million women may need to switch occupations by 2030. If they do not successfully transition to the digital and low-carbon economy, gender inequality in work could worsen. The same report shows there are barriers to reskilling as well, ""They have less time to reskill or search for employment because they spend much more time than men on unpaid care work; are less mobile due to physical safety, infrastructure, and legal challenges; and have lower access to digital technology and participation in STEM fields than men.""Despite these obstacles, the digital and low-carbon economy creates more opportunities for girls and women. According to the ITU, when girls and women are connected and have digital skills, this leads to a positive impact not only for individual women and their families but society as well:""Giving women and girls access to the Internet and the skills to use digital technologies provides them the opportunity to start new businesses, sell products to new markets, find better-paid jobs and access education, health and financial services, as well as to enhance participation in public life and improve information exchange.""And according to a 2021 Boston Consulting Group study, if women participated in STEM fields at the same level as men, the low-carbon economy could ""yield a total reduction from 2020 through 2050 of 12.7 gigatons of CO2e [carbon dioxide equivalent], or roughly 0.5 gigaton annually."" This is the equivalent of taking over 107 million gasoline-powered cars off the road each year, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator. So clearly, these benefits extend to the health of planet Earth as well.By increasing women's access to STEM fields, not only are we supporting research that shows gender diverse teams are more innovative, but this boost in innovation can help us deal with some of our biggest challenges, including climate change. Women have the right to reap the personal benefits of digital and green skills (like more pay and better benefits) while also playing an essential role in unlocking solutions for issues that impact all of us.How Cisco's technology and ecosystem are involvedCisco's technology and ecosystem can play a role in the twin transition to a digital and low-carbon economy. It starts with our company's purpose to Power an Inclusive Future for All. We see the digital and low-carbon transition working in tandem to create a more inclusive and sustainable future.When it comes to our employees, we see first-hand women who emerge in the digital and green workforce, like Beth Kochuparambil, Technical Leader in Cisco's Common Hardware Group. As a hardware engineer, Beth focuses on how our products balance power and performance through product energy efficiency. There's also Julie Boegner, a leader in our Partner Specializations organization, and Karin Surber, who leads partner incentive teams. Together, they launched the Environmental Sustainability Specialization and Takeback Incentive for Cisco partners. Environmental Sustainability Specialization recognizes partners who have been trained on how to help customers reduce their carbon footprint through Cisco products and solutions. And the Takeback Incentive offers exclusive discounts to Environmental Sustainability Specialized partners where the customer agrees to return the used hardware back to Cisco, helping to divert waste from landfills. Nearly 400 partners participated in the first year. Through this work, Julie and Karin are helping customers with their digital and low-carbon transition.Technology enables us to rethink business models in ways that are digital and low-carbon, but also improve individual wellbeing and create opportunities for communities. One example is hybrid work, which helps enable inclusion because it allows us to include more people, and more work styles, in more places. Hybrid work can also have environmental benefits, particularly when combined with smart building technology that uses sensors and low-voltage Power over Ethernet (PoE). These innovations allow us to monitor and control temperature, lighting, and air quality. This is the kind of digital, low-carbon, inclusive thinking we want to accelerate.As you can see from Beth, our engineers have made great progress in power efficiency and circular design. We're also seeing customers ask for more capabilities and greater bandwidth that increase power demands. That means we must think even bigger, exploring ways to accelerate renewable energy adoption and the greening of the grid.The Cisco Foundation helps stimulate cutting-edge innovation in areas where it's most needed. Today, the Foundation focuses on early-stage decarbonization technology and nature-based solutions to climate change. These investments send a signal to other investors about what we value and where we believe the future is headed.A Cisco Foundation grantee I'm particularly excited about is Canopy Planet, a female-led, solutions-driven, nonprofit that partners with brands to change unsustainable supply chains to protect the world's forests, species, and climate. Nicole Rycroft, Founder and Executive Director, is leading Canopy's efforts to eliminate the use of Ancient and Endangered Forests in the paper, packaging and viscose supply chain within the next 10 years. Canopy Planet is using technology to meet this goal, like the Eco-Paper Database, the world's largest database of environmentally friendly paper and paper-based packaging products, and ForestMapper, an interactive map to assist companies in transitioning to more sustainable fiber supply chains.There is also Nidhi Pant, the winner of the 2022 Global Citizen Prize Cisco Youth Leadership Award. Nidhi is a chemical engineer and co-founder of S4S Technologies, a platform that converts farm losses into value-added products through the intervention of sustainable solar-powered technology. The organization increases family incomes and empowers women to be climate champions and decision-makers by transforming women farmers into micro-entrepreneurs. S4S Technologies works with over 24,000 farmers and 800 female entrepreneurs to prevent 40,000 tons of produce from being wasted and saves 37,000 tons of CO2 annually.We can't have an inclusive and sustainable future without opportunities for everyoneThe way we learn, the way we stay connected with our friends and family, the way we share our ideas, and the way we work are rapidly changing. When we live during a time of transition, we need to ensure everyone can participate and contribute.Cisco Networking Academy plays a vital role in helping to prepare girls and women for the digital and low-carbon economy. Since its inception 25 years ago, the cumulative number of women participating in Cisco Networking Academy (calculated as a percent of the total number of students who identified their gender as male, female, or nonbinary) has grown over time and now stands at 26 percent.With diverse perspectives, we can tackle our biggest challenges. By empowering girls and women to pursue digital and green opportunities through role models, mentoring, and training, we can maximize innovation for social and environmental good.View original content hereView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/754832/Girls-in-ICT-Day-Preparing-the-Next-Generation-for-a-Digital-and-Low-Carbon-Economy]"
