COWN has received all regulatory approvals. The all-cash deal, expected to close on Mar 1, is valued at $1.3 billion.The transaction, announced in August 2022, will accelerate TD’s long-term growth strategy in the United States by acquiring a high-quality and rapidly growing investment bank with outstanding talent and highly complementary products and services. Further, TD Securities’ (Toronto-Dominion's subsidiary) existing depth and breadth in global market research capabilities will benefit from COWN’s complementary and highly diverse equity research franchise.Further, in relation to the deal, Toronto-Dominion had sold 28.4 million non-voting common shares of Charles Schwab SCHW for $1.9 billion. This lowered its ownership interest in Schwab from 13.4% to 12%.Notably, TD’s strategy with respect to its investment in SCHW has not changed, and it has no current intention to divest additional shares.At the time of announcing the deal, Toronto-Dominion expected it to be modestly accretive to the 2023 adjusted earnings on a fully-synergized basis. It will generate approximately 14% adjusted return on invested capital on a fully-synergized run-rate basis. The company expects to achieve $300-$350 million in revenue synergies by year three. Total pre-tax integration and retention costs of $450 million are anticipated to be incurred over three years.Our TakeOf late, TD is on an expansion spree. The company, in March 2022, announced a definitive agreement to acquire First Horizon Corporation FHN in an all-cash transaction valued at $13.4 billion. The transaction is yet to get regulatory approvals, and this has resulted in the extension of the closure to May 2023 from February 2023.The deal will foster TD’s footprint expansion in South Carolina and Florida while providing entry into Tennessee, Louisiana, Texas, Alabama and Georgia.  Collectively, the population in First Horizon's markets is expected to advance 50% faster than the U.S. national average. This offers significant growth opportunities for Toronto-Dominion.Driven by these expansion initiatives, Toronto-Dominion will continue to record solid revenues across diverse footprints and businesses. Also, higher interest rates will offer support.Over the past six months, shares of TD have gained 1.1% and that of COWN has rallied 1.2%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCurrently, Toronto-Dominion carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Cowen has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

This compares to earnings of $0.96 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 16.07%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this independent oil and gas company would post earnings of $1.36 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.37, delivering a surprise of 0.74%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Range Resources , which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, posted revenues of $997.57 million for the quarter ended December 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.07%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.57 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Range Resources shares have added about 13% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 3.4%.What's Next for Range Resources?While Range Resources has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Range Resources: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.94 on $909.08 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.22 on $3.5 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States is currently in the bottom 4% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Ranger Oil (ROCC), has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2022.This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.82 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +11.5%.

As we enter 2023, the progress made during the past year both financially and operationally puts Range in the strongest position in Company history. We are excited about the opportunity to develop Range’s world-class inventory over the coming decades into a growing market for natural gas and natural gas liquids.”Financial DiscussionExcept for generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) reported amounts, specific expense categories exclude non-cash impairments, unrealized mark-to-market adjustment on derivatives, non-cash stock compensation and other items shown separately on the attached tables. “Unit costs” as used in this release are composed of direct operating, transportation, gathering, processing and compression, taxes other than income, general and administrative, interest and depletion, depreciation and amortization costs divided by production.

As of year-end, Range had approximately 238.9 million shares outstanding and $1.1 billion of availability on the current share repurchase program.During 2022, Range reduced debt by a total of $1.08 billion, representing the Company’s fifth consecutive year of debt reduction. At year-end, Range’s net debt was approximately $1.87 billion, consisting of $1.85 billion of senior notes and $19 million bank facility borrowings.

Regional markets experienced wide basis pricing during the quarter, primarily related to the month of October, but have subsequently improved. Range’s 2023 natural gas differential is expected to be ($0.35) to ($0.45) relative to NYMEX.Crude oil and condensate price realizations, before realized hedges, averaged $75.66 per barrel, or $7.08 below WTI (West Texas Intermediate).

Beyond the five-year reserve calculation window, Range has thousands of high-quality well locations in the Marcellus and further upside in the Utica and Upper Devonian horizons. Range also has a network of more than 250 existing well pads that provide Range the opportunity to develop thousands of future wells while utilizing existing roads, pads and infrastructure. Consistent with recent years more than half of Range’s wells expected to turn to sales in 2023 are from pad sites with existing production.2023 Capital Program and Production GuidanceRange’s 2023 all-in capital budget is expected to be $570 to $615 million. The capital budget includes approximately $540 million to $565 million for drilling and completion costs and $30 - $50 million for acreage, leasehold and other investments.Consistent with recent years, Range’s development plan for 2023 will target a maintenance program that holds production approximately flat. Due to efficiencies gained through second half 2022 and into early 2023, Range expects to have a slight build of in-process well inventory during 2023 that will provide optionality into the 2024 and 2025 planning process. There is approximately $30 million included in the 2023 capital plan for this increased inventory. Range’s 2023 plan is expected to deliver an all-in maintenance capital cost of approximately $0.76 per mcfe, which is expected to be the lowest-cost program in Appalachia.The table below summarizes expected 2023 activity and 2022 regarding the number of wells to sales in each area.  Planned WellsTIL in 2023 Wells TIL in2022SW PA Super-Rich 3 4SW PA Wet 31 21SW PA Dry 24 23NE PA Dry 3 7Total Appalachia 61 55Guidance – 2023Capital &amp; Production GuidanceRange is targeting a maintenance program in 2023, holding production approximately flat at 2.12 – 2.16 Bcfe per day, with ~30% attributed to liquids production.

We believe adjusted net income comparable to analysts’ estimates is calculated on the same basis as analysts’ estimates and that many investors use this published research in making investment decisions and evaluating operational trends of the Company and its performance relative to other oil and gas producing companies. Diluted earnings per share (adjusted) as set forth in this release represents adjusted net income comparable to analysts’ estimates on a diluted per share basis. A table is included which reconciles income or loss from operations to adjusted net income comparable to analysts’ estimates and diluted earnings per share (adjusted). On its website, the Company provides additional comparative information on prior periods along with non-GAAP revenue disclosures.Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital (sometimes referred to as “adjusted cash flow”) as defined in this release represents net cash provided by operations before changes in working capital and exploration expense adjusted for certain non-cash compensation items. Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital is widely accepted by the investment community as a financial indicator of an oil and gas company’s ability to generate cash to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service debt. Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital is also useful because it is widely used by professional research analysts in valuing, comparing, rating and providing investment recommendations of companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry. In turn, many investors use this published research in making investment decisions. Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operations, investing, or financing activities as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity. A table is included which reconciles net cash provided by operations to cash flow from operations before changes in working capital as used in this release. On its website, the Company provides additional comparative information on prior periods for cash flow, cash margins and non-GAAP earnings as used in this release.The cash prices realized for oil and natural gas production, including the amounts realized on cash-settled derivatives and net of transportation, gathering, processing and compression expense, is a critical component in the Company’s performance tracked by investors and professional research analysts in valuing, comparing, rating and providing investment recommendations and forecasts of companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry. In turn, many investors use this published research in making investment decisions. Due to the GAAP disclosures of various derivative transactions and third-party transportation, gathering, processing and compression expense, such information is now reported in various lines of the income statement. The Company believes that it is important to furnish a table reflecting the details of the various components of each income statement line to better inform the reader of the details of each amount and provide a summary of the realized cash-settled amounts and third-party transportation, gathering, processing and compression expense, which were historically reported as natural gas, NGLs and oil sales. This information is intended to bridge the gap between various readers’ understanding and fully disclose the information needed.The Company discloses in this release the detailed components of many of the single line items shown in the GAAP financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company believes that it is important to furnish this detail of the various components comprising each line of the Statements of Operations to better inform the reader of the details of each amount, the changes between periods and the effect on its financial results.   We believe that the presentation of PV10 is relevant and useful to our investors as supplemental disclosure to the standardized measure, or after-tax amount, because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our proved reserves before taking into account future corporate income taxes and our current tax structure. While the standardized measure is dependent on the unique tax situation of each company, PV10 is based on prices and discount factors that are consistent for all companies. Because of this, PV10 can be used within the industry and by creditors and security analysts to evaluate estimated net cash flows from proved reserves on a more comparable basis.RANGE RESOURCES CORPORATION (NYSE: RRC) is a leading U.S. independent natural gas and NGL producer with operations focused on stacked-pay projects in the Appalachian Basin. The Company is headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas.  More information about Range can be found at www.rangeresources.com.Included within this release are certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that are not limited to historical facts, but reflect Range’s current beliefs, expectations or intentions regarding future events.  Words such as “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “project,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “outlook”, “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “pursue,” “target,” “continue,” and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. All statements, except for statements of historical fact, made within regarding activities, events or developments the Company expects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future, such as those regarding future well costs, expected asset sales, well productivity, future liquidity and financial resilience, anticipated exports and related financial impact, NGL market supply and demand, improving commodity fundamentals and pricing, future capital efficiencies, future shareholder value, emerging plays, capital spending, anticipated drilling and completion activity, acreage prospectivity, expected pipeline utilization and future guidance information, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements are based on assumptions and estimates that management believes are reasonable based on currently available information; however, management's assumptions and Range's future performance are subject to a wide range of business risks and uncertainties and there is no assurance that these goals and projections can or will be met. Any number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Further information on risks and uncertainties is available in Range's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. Unless required by law, Range undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events after the date they are made. The SEC permits oil and gas companies, in filings made with the SEC, to disclose proved reserves, which are estimates that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions as well as the option to disclose probable and possible reserves. Range has elected not to disclose its probable and possible reserves in its filings with the SEC. Range uses certain broader terms such as ""resource potential,” “unrisked resource potential,” ""unproved resource potential"" or ""upside"" or other descriptions of volumes of resources potentially recoverable through additional drilling or recovery techniques that may include probable and possible reserves as defined by the SEC's guidelines. Range has not attempted to distinguish probable and possible reserves from these broader classifications. The SEC’s rules prohibit us from including in filings with the SEC these broader classifications of reserves. These estimates are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of actually being realized. Unproved resource potential refers to Range's internal estimates of hydrocarbon quantities that may be potentially discovered through exploratory drilling or recovered with additional drilling or recovery techniques and have not been reviewed by independent engineers. Unproved resource potential does not constitute reserves within the meaning of the Society of Petroleum Engineer's Petroleum Resource Management System and does not include proved reserves. Area wide unproven resource potential has not been fully risked by Range's management. “EUR”, or estimated ultimate recovery, refers to our management’s estimates of hydrocarbon quantities that may be recovered from a well completed as a producer in the area. These quantities may not necessarily constitute or represent reserves within the meaning of the Society of Petroleum Engineer’s Petroleum Resource Management System or the SEC’s oil and natural gas disclosure rules. Actual quantities that may be recovered from Range's interests could differ substantially. Factors affecting ultimate recovery include the scope of Range's drilling program, which will be directly affected by the availability of capital, drilling and production costs, commodity prices, availability of drilling services and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, transportation constraints, regulatory approvals, field spacing rules, recoveries of gas in place, length of horizontal laterals, actual drilling results, including geological and mechanical factors affecting recovery rates and other factors. Estimates of resource potential may change significantly as development of our resource plays provides additional data. In addition, our production forecasts and expectations for future periods are dependent upon many assumptions, including estimates of production decline rates from existing wells and the undertaking and outcome of future drilling activity, which may be affected by significant commodity price declines or drilling cost increases. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, available from our website at www.rangeresources.com or by written request to 100 Throckmorton Street, Suite 1200, Fort Worth, Texas 76102. You can also obtain this Form 10-K on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov or by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.SOURCE: Range Resources CorporationRange Investor Contacts:Laith Sando, Vice President – Investor Relations817-869-4267lsando@rangeresources.comRange Media Contacts:Mark Windle, Director of Corporate Communications724-873-3223mwindle@rangeresources.comRANGE RESOURCES CORPORATIONSTATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS                       Based on GAAP reported earnings with additional                       details of items included in each line in Form 10-K                       (Unaudited, in thousands, except per share data)                                                Three Months Ended December 31, Twelve Months Ended December 31,  2022   2021   %   2022   2021   %                         Revenues and other income:                       Natural gas, NGLs and oil sales (a)$1,086,697  $1,140,520      $4,911,092  $3,215,027     Derivative fair value gain (loss) 448,181   309,566       (1,188,506)  (650,216)    Brokered natural gas, marketing and other (b) 93,335   116,692       419,776   364,029     ARO settlement gain (loss) (b) —   —       8   (3)    Other (b) 2,166   52       4,433   1,386     Total revenues and other income 1,630,379   1,566,830   4%  4,146,803   2,930,223   42%                        Costs and expenses:                       Direct operating 22,282   17,310       82,827   73,977     Direct operating – stock-based compensation (c) 376   324       1,459   1,310     Transportation, gathering, processing and compression 294,228   320,785       1,235,441   1,174,469     Transportation, gathering, processing and compression – settlements —   —       7,500   —     Taxes other than income 11,178   9,515       35,367   30,648     Brokered natural gas and marketing 95,960   119,656       424,609   365,494     Brokered natural gas and marketing – stock-based compensation (c) 571   455       2,439   1,794     Exploration 6,654   6,717       25,194   22,048     Exploration – non-cash stock-based compensation (c) 415   391       1,578   1,507     Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties 16,289   —       28,608   7,206     General and administrative 31,290   30,331       124,282   119,677     General and administrative – stock-based compensation (c) 9,778   11,041       42,023   39,673     General and administrative – lawsuit settlements 722   510       1,498   8,885     General and administrative – rig release penalty 532   —       532   —     General and administrative – bad debt expense (250)  200       (250)  200     Exit costs 12,088   12,104       70,337   21,661     Deferred compensation plan (d) 1,963   (21,200)      61,880   68,351     Interest expense 35,725   54,004       156,862   218,043     Interest expense – amortization of deferred financing costs (e) 1,508   2,358       8,283   9,293     Loss on early extinguishment of debt 261   —       69,493   98     Depletion, depreciation and amortization 90,847   92,427       353,420   364,555     Loss (gain) on sale of assets 139   23       (409)  (701)    Total costs and expenses 632,556   656,951   -4%  2,732,973   2,528,188   8%                        Income before income taxes 997,823   909,879   10%  1,413,830   402,035   252%                        Income tax (benefit) expense:                       Current (6,044)  763       14,688   7,984     Deferred 189,631   17,750       215,772   (17,727)      183,587   18,513       230,460   (9,743)                            Net income$814,236  $891,366   -9% $1,183,370  $411,778   187%                        Net Income Per Common Share:                       Basic$3.38  $3.57      $4.79  $1.65     Diluted$3.31  $3.47      $4.69  $1.61                       ]"

(NYSE: ARE), the first, preeminent, longest-tenured and pioneering owner, operator and developer of collaborative life science, agtech and technology campuses in AAA innovation cluster locations with approximately 1,000 tenants, is profoundly committed to driving forward innovative solutions to address the rapidly growing mental health crisis through its multifaceted business platform built on the foundation of its four key verticals of real estate, venture investments, corporate responsibility and thought leadership. With an unmatched asset base in North America of nearly 75 million SF, Alexandria's state-of-the-art R&amp;D facilities, coupled with its deeply experienced Labspace® management and operations, enable its tenants to develop new, novel therapies, medicines and cures across a range of diseases and disorders, including psychiatric and neurological diseases such as depression, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. It has also been identifying and investing in life science companies that are making a significant positive impact on people living with mental health-related disorders through Alexandria Venture Investments, the company's strategic venture capital platform, for over 25 years.""Our country is in the midst of a devastating and pervasive mental health crisis that we need to meaningfully address,"" said Jenna Foger, senior vice president of science and technology at Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. and Alexandria Venture Investments. ""Mental health is essential not only to the vitality of each individual human but also to the health and safety of our communities overall. Since my time as a former bench scientist at The Rockefeller University researching the biomolecular underpinnings of a range of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, I have always been motivated by the immense potential to transform the way we treat and ultimately cure these serious health challenges. Building upon Alexandria's nearly three decades of dedication to its deeply impactful social responsibility pillars and thought leadership initiatives, we are steadfast in identifying and partnering with leading-edge life science companies across our ecosystems to help address the nation's mental health epidemic.""Story continuesAlexandria's eighth social responsibility pillar, established in 2021, aims to address the country's rapidly growing mental health and suicide crisis. Due to the ongoing burden of mental illnesses, severe complications, most notably addiction and suicide, have been increasing among adults. Amid a crisis that affects all Americans, military personnel and veterans experience mental health concerns at higher rates. Nearly 1 in 4 active-duty members showed signs of a mental health condition, according to a 2014 study in JAMA Psychiatry, and veterans faced a suicide rate nearly 60% higher than non-veteran adults, according to the 2022 National Veteran Suicide Prevention Annual Report issued by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Committed to ensuring that our national heroes, along with their families, receive the tools they need to live productive and happy lives, Alexandria has been an active supporter of the Navy SEAL Foundation (NSF) for over a decade, and its executive chairman and founder, Joel S. Marcus, has served on the foundation's board since 2018. The foundation provides specialized programs aimed at addressing the unique physical and mental health concerns of the SEAL community and their families. NSF also maintains connections to clinical psychologists and access to cutting-edge treatment modalities, and it openly addresses suicide prevention through its Whole Warrior Health Forums.Alexandria continues to strengthen its strategic relationships with non-profit organizations and convene key stakeholders from its world-class network to help advance groundbreaking medical innovation to transform the lives of the over 50 million people living with a mental illness in the United States. As part of Alexandria's highly impactful thought leadership platform, the company recently presented a timely conversation on the state of mental health in America with former congressman Patrick J. Kennedy, one of the world's leading voices and policymakers on mental health, at the Galien Forum USA 2022. Tomorrow, on February 28, 2023, Alexandria will hold a mission-critical Healthcare Policy Forum on Mental Health, in partnership with Patrick Kennedy and The Kennedy Forum, to explore critical issues aimed at accelerating new and innovative solutions to combat this unprecedented crisis while further normalizing conversations around mental health and addiction so that the stigma no longer prevents individuals from seeking help.About Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (NYSE: ARE), an S&amp;P 500® company, is a best-in-class, mission-driven life science REIT making a positive and lasting impact on the world.

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.State Street Corporation in FocusBased in Boston, State Street Corporation (STT) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 12.38%. Currently paying a dividend of $0.63 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 2.89%. In comparison, the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield is 3.1%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.63%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $2.52 is up 5% from last year. Over the last 5 years, State Street Corporation has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 7.44%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, State Street Corporation's payout ratio is 34%, which means it paid out 34% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for STT for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $8.61 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 16.19%.Bottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that STT is not only an attractive dividend play, but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

BBY is likely to register a decline in both top and bottom lines from the respective prior-year quarter’s reported numbers in its fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Mar 2, before the opening bell.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $14,752 million, indicating a 9.9% decrease from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings has decreased 1 cent in the past 30 days to $2.09 per share, suggesting an above 23.4% plunge from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s tally.We expect revenues to be down 10.8% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s level to $14,600.3 million and adjusted earnings to plunge 31.5% to $1.79 per share. Enterprise same-storesales are likely to decrease 9.8% in the quarter under review.BBY delivered an earnings surprise of 34% in the last reported quarter. This specialty retailer of consumer products has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 13.8%, on average.Key Aspects to NoteBest Buy’s quarterly performance is likely to have been affected by a challenging operating environment including higher promotional activity, inflationary pressures and supply-chain issues. Also, any deleverage in SG&amp;A expenses remains a headwind.Investments in the Totaltech initiatives and increased supply-chain costs are likely to continue putting pressure on BBY’s margins. It has been witnessing lower sales across both its Domestic and International segments for a while.On its last earnings call, management had projected comparable sales to decline roughly 10% in fiscal fourth quarter. It also forecast the year-over-year sales decline to remain similar to the third quarter levels.This outlook reflected a major deceleration compared with the pre-pandemic level. It highlighted that the gross margin will be under pressure due to higher promotional activity.On the positive front, BBY’s focus on boosting its omni-channel services, such as buy online, pickup in-store services, curbside pickup or ship-from-store delivering products to customers, is encouraging.

BURL to register an increase in its top and the bottom lines from the respective year-ago quarter’s actuals when it releases fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results on Mar 2, before the market open. The consensus estimate for quarterly revenues is currently pegged at $2,621 million, indicating an improvement of about 0.5% from the year-ago period’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly earnings currently stands at $2.72 per share, indicating a rise of 7.5% from $2.53 recorded in the year-ago quarter. The consensus mark has increased a penny in the past seven days.A glance at its performance in the trailing four quarters shows that it delivered a negative earnings surprise of 0.6%, on average.Key Factors to NoteBurlington Stores’ performance for the fiscal fourth quarter is most likely to have benefited from the solid execution of its 2.0 strategy, which aims at improving the off-price model. This initiative focuses on three aspects, such as marketing, merchandising and store prototypes to drive overall growth. Management has also been boosting assortments and merchandising capabilities for a while.Burlington Stores is steadily strengthening its vendor counts and making technological advancements. All the aforesaid tailwinds are most likely to have boosted its performance in the quarter under review. On its third-quarter earnings call, management projected an adjusted EBIT margin of flat to up 70 basis points from the last fiscal year’s quarterly reading and adjusted earnings per share of $2.45-$2.75.On the flip side, a challenging and competitive environment remains a concern. Higher inflationary pressures, and deleveraged supply chain and buying costs are deterrents. On its last quarter earnings call, management had projected comp sales to decrease 6-9% for the fiscal fourth quarter.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Burlington Stores this time around.

HUM recently made an exit from the Employer Group Commercial Medical Products business. The decision was taken owing to the incapability of the business to effectively address HUM’s commercial members’ needs in the long term or aid its future strategic plans.The departure from the business, comprising all fully insured, self-funded and Federal Employee Health Benefit medical plans coupled with the linked wellness and rewards programs, will take place over the successive 18-24 months.The latest move of Humana won’t likely inflict any effect on the overall adjusted earnings per share (EPS) and the benefit ratio outlook of its Insurance segment for 2023. However, owing to the seasonal nature of the Employer Group Commercial Medical Products earnings, HUM presently anticipates first-quarter 2023 earnings to account for around 33% of full-year adjusted EPS guidance.The earlier outlook released with fourth-quarter 2022 results, which did not consider the non-GAAP treatment of the Employer Group Commercial Medical business, estimated first-quarter earnings to make up for roughly 35% of full-year guidance.The Insurance segment’s benefit ratio is also expected to bear the impact of the business exit in the first quarter of 2023. The metric is projected to witness an uptick of around 30 basis points in the first quarter.Humana seems to be prudent in deciding to depart from the underperforming Employer Group Commercial Medical Products business. Membership of fully-insured commercial plans declined 17.5% year over year as of Dec 31, 2022.Another notable fact inevitably highlighted by the recent move is Humana’s intensified focus and intent to invest higher resources to better serve its core business lines within the Insurance segment.

This has been bolstering HUM’s partner networks and strengthening its U.S. footprint.

(NYSE: CF), the world’s largest producer of ammonia, today announced that it has entered into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with LOTTE CHEMICAL Corporation (011170.KS) (""LOTTE""), South Korea’s leading chemical company, that will guide the companies in a joint exploration of clean ammonia production and long-term clean ammonia offtake into South Korea.The MOU establishes a framework for the companies to assess the joint development of and investment in a greenfield clean ammonia production facility in the U.S., including at CF Industries’ Blue Point Complex in Louisiana. The companies believe that the U.S. offers considerable advantages for clean ammonia production, including access to plentiful and low-cost natural gas, the regulatory and legal framework in place, and the geology suitable for permanent carbon sequestration. The prospective ammonia facility would leverage carbon capture and sequestration technologies to reduce CO2 emissions from the ammonia production process to a level that meets or exceeds South Korea’s clean ammonia requirements.Additionally, the companies will quantify expected clean ammonia demand in South Korea for power generation, bunkering and other sectors, taking into account regulatory and policy requirements, as well as safety and environmental considerations. This workstream will confirm the scale of long-term offtake volume expectations for a potential clean ammonia facility.""We are pleased to advance our relationship with LOTTE and leverage the world class expertise of both companies to meet the substantial emerging demand for clean ammonia in South Korea,"" said Tony Will, president and chief executive officer, CF Industries Holdings, Inc. ""We look forward to helping LOTTE and South Korea meet their clean ammonia requirements as we continue to accelerate the world’s transition to clean energy.""Story continuesThe MOU is part of LOTTE’s efforts to develop a global clean ammonia supply chain to support its hydrogen energy business for global clean energy supply and carbon reduction growth. LOTTE has established a plan to produce and sell 1.2 million tons of clean hydrogen by investing a total of 6 trillion won by 2030. Clean ammonia (NH3) is seen as a safe and efficient hydrogen carrier and storage mechanism.Jin-koo Hwang, head of hydrogen energy business at LOTTE CHEMICAL, said, ""In order to bolster the domestic hydrogen economy, it is important to secure a stable supply of clean hydrogen and ammonia, especially in overseas regions with abundant energy and low geopolitical risks. Through strategic collaboration with CF Industries, which has a long history and business experience, we will secure a production base in the USA and lead the global distribution channel.""Since 2020, CF Industries has advanced industry-leading projects to decarbonize its ammonia production network and position the Company to supply a substantial volume of clean ammonia within the next few years. This includes leveraging carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technologies at its Donaldsonville Complex where CF Industries is constructing a CO2 dehydration and compression facility to enable the capture and permanent sequestration of up to 2 million tons of CO2 per year, starting in 2025. The Company has also commenced a front-end engineering and design study to construct a greenfield clean ammonia facility utilizing CCS at its Blue Point Complex in Louisiana. Additionally, CF Industries is constructing North America’s first commercial scale green ammonia capacity at its Donaldsonville Complex, enabling up to 20,000 tons of green ammonia production beginning in 2024.About CF Industries Holdings, Inc.At CF Industries, our mission is to provide clean energy to feed and fuel the world sustainably. With our employees focused on safe and reliable operations, environmental stewardship, and disciplined capital and corporate management, we are on a path to decarbonize our ammonia production network – the world’s largest – to enable green and blue hydrogen and nitrogen products for energy, fertilizer, emissions abatement and other industrial activities. Our manufacturing complexes in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, an unparalleled storage, transportation and distribution network in North America, and logistics capabilities enabling a global reach underpin our strategy to leverage our unique capabilities to accelerate the world’s transition to clean energy.

19,acaa6b7f-29ce-31f6-b26f-2ff010749718,WMT,2023-02-28,Target issues tepid outlook after a 43% profit drop in 4Q,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-issues-tepid-outlook-43-114414164.html,1677584654,STORY,"['TGT', 'WMT']","[NEW YORK (AP) — Target plans to invest as much as $5 billion this year expanding services for customers, including a drive up service for returns, renovations at 175 stores and improvements in online shopping.The Minneapolis retailer announced the investments Tuesday during its annual investor meeting as it reported a 43% tumble in profits for the holiday quarter, reflecting the ongoing challenges of balancing more cautious consumer spending and rising costs.Target issued a cautious outlook for the year as inflation squeezes household budgets, but it topped Wall Street expectations for the fourth quarter and shares rose nearly 3% in mid-day trading, reversing an earlier sell-off.“We recognize that the landscape is unpredictable, and there are plenty of challenges in the near-term horizon,” Target's CEO Brian Cornell told analysts at the meeting on Tuesday.Target's more modest expectations for 2023 follow weaker outlooks from Walmart and Home Depot last week. Higher costs for everything from food to gas is weighing on Americans, though there has been some easing of inflation in recent months.Part of the reason inflationary pressures have eased, at least for some things, is a campaign by the Federal Reserve to cool spending, and the economy. Those efforts make using credit cards more expensive, which can negatively impact retailers.But how Americans spend is changing, too. More people are spending money on travel or going out for dinner than they were during the pandemic, which can mean they are spending less at stores.Walmart said it expects sales at stores opened at least a year for its U.S. business to rise 2% or 2.5% for the year, while Home Depot forecasts growth for that metric to be roughly flat this year compared with a year ago.For the full year, Target expects comparable sales — those from stores open at least a year and online channels — will range from a low single-digit decline to a low single-digit increase.Story continues“We're planning our business cautiously in the near term to ensure we remain agile and responsive to the current operating environment,"" Cornell said in a statement.Target's total comparable sales inched up 0.7% in the fiscal fourth quarter compared with a year ago. That was fueled by increased customer traffic, but customers are shifting their spending to necessities like food and paper towels over discretionary items like fashion. Groceries typically have a much smaller profit margin. Still, Target said that shoppers are attracted to new and trendy clothing, and that's a key reason for increased store visits.Cornell noted that the company entered the year in a “very healthy inventory position,” reflecting its conservative approach in discretionary items. Inventory in categories like fashion was roughly 13% lower in the fourth quarter than a year ago.Target has taken a bigger hit to its business compared to other big box retailers likely because it relies more on discretionary items like clothing and home furnishings. More than 50% of Walmart’s U.S. business comes from groceries; that number is 20% at Target.It was the fourth consecutive quarter that retailer's profit has slipped. Target reported a 52% drop in third quarter profits, 90% in the second quarter and a 52% decline in the first.In early June, Target warned that it was canceling orders from suppliers and aggressively cutting prices because of a pronounced spending shift by Americans.Last November, Target said it was slashing expenses with a goal of saving $2 billion to $3 billion over the next three years. At that time, it said shoppers were waiting to buy on sale, purchasing smaller packages and trading down to store brands instead of national labels, which tend to be more expensive.But even as Target projects lower sales, the retailer is pushing ahead to accelerate its e-commerce strategy. It announced last week that it will spend $100 million to develop a larger network of package sorting centers that cut the cost of delivering online orders while increasing the speed of delivery.Target said that its drive up service for returns will be rolled out to all stores by the end of this summer. Customers will be able to return most new, unopened items within 90 days of purchases without leaving their car.Target also plans to open about 20 new stores in addition to renovating 175 of them. One of the big attractions has been its partnership with Ulta Beauty to have shops at the store. Last year, its sales from Ulta Beauty at Target were more than four times higher than in 2021, the company said.Target also aims to launch or expand more than 10 owned brands. In addition, the retailer will appeal to price sensitive shoppers with more items starting at $3, $5, $10 and $15.Fourth-quarter profits fell to $876 million, or $1.89 per share, for the quarter that ended Jan. 23. That compares with $1.54 billion, or $3.21 per share, in the year-ago period.Sales rose 1.3%, to $31.4 billion. Analysts were expecting earnings of $1.40 a share on sales of $30.7 billion, according to FactSet.Fourth-quarter gross margin rate was 22.7% compared with 25.7% in 2021, reflecting pressure from higher markdowns, net merchandise costs, and so-called shrink, which reflects inventory losses related to such factors as theft, fraud or damage.The company expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $7.75 to $8.75 for the year. Analysts were expecting $9.18, according to FactSet.Target said that over the next three years, it expects its operating income margin rate will reach, and begin to move beyond, its pre-pandemic rate of 6% as early as fiscal 2024, depending on the economic recovery and consumer demand.Shares rose $4.42 to $171.23 Tuesday.___Follow Anne D’Innocenzio on Twitter ]"

Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.50 to $1.90. For fiscal-year 2023, the company expects same-store sales to be the same, from low-single digit to a low-single increase, along with an operating income of more than $1 billion and adjusted EPS to range from $7.75 to $8.75.In the next 3 years, the company aims to move beyond its pre-pandemic operating income margin rate of 6%, and says it could possibly reach that goal as early as fiscal 2024, ""depending on the speed of recovery for the economy and consumer demand.""We're Hiring banner, starting wage $17 per hour, Target Store, Boston, Massachusetts.

Yahoo Finance reported that even the wealthiest earners are now shopping at Walmart to take in these savings.That all comes as great news to shareholders. As of the last quarter of 2022, it resulted in “earnings per share of $1.71 compared with the $1.51 analysts expected,” per CNBC.If Walmart stock sounds appealing, there is good reason to believe in its long-term returns. CNBC put together a mini graph showing just how much you’d be worth now if you invested in Walmart stock 10 years ago in 2013, five years after in 2018 and just last year in 2022. If you would have invested $1,000 in 2013, you’d have more than doubled your initial investment, according to the article, with the value sitting at $2,390.Even a five-year investment would have earned more than $700 with a current value of $1,728. And that same investment last year would have earned $84 with a current value of $1,084.However, recently Walmart CFO John David Rainey said during a earnings call with shareholders that 2023 is still going to be hard to predict, even after December’s profits marked a 60-year high for the chain due in large part to grocery sales. But it’s the other items that Walmart sells such as electronics, clothing and toys that may be seeing declines as customers tighten their purse strings and therefore may offset some of Walmart’s gains.“The consumer is still very pressured,” Rainey said on the call. “And if you look at economic indicators, balance sheets are running thinner, and savings rates are declining relative to previous periods.

Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”15. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)Average Net Income: $10.83 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 56Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) has managed to generate remarkable profits over the past 20 years.

(NYSE:VZ) and owns over 6.7 million shares of the company.Here is what Matrix Asset Advisors had to say about Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“We sold the entire position in Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), which was a disappointing investment, on concerns that the company is losing market share in a very competitive business and because we believed we had better use for the funds elsewhere.”14. TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE)Average Net Income: $11.53 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 21At the end of Q4 2022, 21 hedge funds held positions in TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE). The total value of these positions was $1.93 billion. This is compared to 22 hedge funds in the previous quarter with stakes worth $1.56 billion.In fiscal 2022, TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) generated an annual net income of $20.53 billion. The company has generated an annual net income of $11.53 billion, on average, over the last 20 years. TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) is ranked fourteenth on our list of the most profitable stocks of the last 20 years.As of December 31, Alyeska Investment Group is the top investor in TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) and has disclosed a position worth $60.5 million in the company.Here is what Artisan Partners had to say about TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“We added one new position this quarter, TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE). TTE is one of the world’s largest energy companies. It develops and produces oil and gas, produces and sells refined products, is one of the largest producers and traders of LNG, and owns a large portfolio of renewable power generating assets. TTE has one of the lowest cost portfolios of oil and gas assets and therefore one of the lowest breakeven points in the industry. It also has one of the best balance sheets in the industry. We estimate it will reach a net cash position sometime in 2023.The valuation of TTE—and that of Shell—is fascinating. TTE sells at approximately 4X earnings and has a 5% dividend yield. With its current buyback program and a recently announced special dividend, the owners yield is more than 10%. The valuation and owners yield are not dissimilar to those of Shell, which we also own and which trades at just under 5X earnings. To say that a discount is attached to European oil companies relative to US peers is an understatement. Exxon Mobil sells at 8X earnings, Chevron 9X and Conoco 8X. If TTE and Shell redomiciled to the US, their share prices would probably double.We have a few theories for the valuation anomaly. First, as mentioned above, Europe generally trades at a big discount to the US. In the case of TTE and Shell, this makes no economic sense. The oil and gas business is a global one, and TTE and Shell have attractive assets. The main explanation, we believe, is that large sections of the European asset management industry will not invest in oil and gas because of ESG restrictions. Yet if the recent war in Ukraine and the current energy crisis have shown us nothing else, the supply of energy is an enormous social good. Indeed, it is an existential good. Moreover, it is companies such as TTE that will invest billions to supply the LNG that Europe desperately needs to restore its economy and reduce the crushing cost burden on families who must now choose between heating their homes and eating. Finally, TTE is also investing billions per year in renewable power generating assets such as wind and solar. Such assets will likely never replace clean burning natural gas and nuclear as base power suppliers, but they are a valuable and clean adjunct to modern grids. We believe TTE’s renewable portfolio is worth between $25 billion and $35 billion and is moving from almost no profit contribution toward meaningful levels of profit over the next few years. We wonder how it makes sense for investors to disinvest from these kinds of assets on ethical grounds.”13. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Average Net Income: $12.67 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 84On January 24, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) posted earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022.

(NYSE:PFE) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Labs, global pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG). Although Pfizer continues to report strong performance of its core drugs, sales of its COVID vaccine and treatment have likely peaked and sales are expected to decline going forward. We remain optimistic about the company long term as we believe management is taking the company in the right direction, focusing R&amp;D, and making strategic acquisitions with profits generated from COVID vaccine sales.”11. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Average Net Income: $12.93 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Walmart Inc.

(NYSE:WMT) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”10.

Despite the positives of higher interest rates and the company making good progress on reducing expenses and regulatory consent orders, Wells Fargo shares have fallen one-third from their highs earlier this year to roughly 6.5x our estimate of normalized earnings power, and the stock ended the quarter at ~1x next year’s tangible book value. We find this is far too cheap for a strong banking franchise capable of tangible returns in the low-to-mid teens across business cycles.”8.

We added leading financial institution Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) which serves individual consumers, small and middle-market businesses, and large corporations with a full range of banking, investing, asset management, and other financial and risk management products and services. The current company was formed through various mergers including NationsBank, FleetBoston, US Trust, Countrywide Financial, and Merrill Lynch with the legacy commercial bank to form a national banking powerhouse and bulge bracket investment firm. As one of the ‘Big Four’ U.S. banks it enjoys scale driven cost advantages and economies of scale which provide meaningful competitive advantages and potential for strong returns in the largely commoditized banking industry. A survivor of the financial crisis, BAC has emerged with a solid capital base and stands to benefit from a rising interest rate environment.”7. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)Average Net Income: $15.51 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 57At the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) was a part of 57 investors' portfolios.

The stock is the seventh most profitable stock of the last 20 years.Here is what Diamond Hill Capital had to say about Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Most recently in Q4, we increased our energy exposure by reinitiating a position in a company we know well and have owned in the past, integrated oil and gas company Chevron Corporation(NYSE:CVX).We previously owned Chevron as recently as February 2022. We sold our position at that time due to heightened risk associated with operations in Kazakhstan, which sends oil through a pipeline that runs through Russia out to the Black Sea. When Russia invaded Ukraine, we believed there was real risk that something would happen to inhibit Chevron’s ability to get that oil to the market. We didn’t believe that risk was reflected in the stock price, so we sold our position. Today, 10+ months into the Ukraine crisis, more information has become available regarding the Kazakhstan operations, and the associated risks are now well-known. We believe those risks are fully priced into the current stock valuation. Chevron is one of the best operators in its field, with a diversified portfolio and strong management, and we took the opportunity to reinvest when the stock was trading below our estimate of intrinsic value.”6. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL)Average Net Income: $18.00 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 40On February 2, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) posted strong earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022.

In January 2023, visits were up 4.0% compared to last January per foot traffic platform Placer.ai, higher than that of Walmart (down 4.5%), Costco (down 5.2%), BJ's Wholesale Club (down 6.2%) and Sam's Club (down 3.3%).This comes as consumers are ""becoming a little bit more intentional with their dollar,"" Corey Tarlowe, Jefferies equity analyst told Yahoo Finance. In Tarlowe's latest note, he told investors to expect results similar to those of Walmart's (WMT) latest earnings.""We expect TGT's results will look similar to WMT's, with better-than-expected sales, more gross margin pressure than predicted, and solid operational expenditure leverage in the store.""Jefferies has a Buy rating and $191.00 price target.A possible risk is that not all shoppers see Target as a go-to discount retailer, Bank of America analyst Robert Ohmes said in a note. While favorable in terms of price, ""it may not have the same consumer perception of being a low-price retailer that is afforded to others,"" he said.Bank of America reiterated its Neutral rating, noting the retailer's ""strong omni-channel positioning and discount store decade exposure will likely be overshadowed by discretionary pressures.""Story continuesBofA says ""sticky food inflation"" could cause consumers to spend more money on food and less on items like electronics, home, and apparel. The firm has a $180.00 price target.Inventory is top of mind as well. Bank of America expects $850 million of year-over-year gross margin pressures this quarter, ""predominantly driven by higher clearance and promotional markdown rates (as TGT works to clear through excess inventory by year end) as well as higher merchandising costs and continued freight headwinds.""Labor is also in focus. Ongoing wage pressures, as other retailers increase their minimum wage, is one item that could cause full margin recovery to be a ""bit more elongated,"" said Credit Suisse, which has a $160.00 price target and Neutral rating on the stock, in a note to investors.Target (TGT) announced a new starting wage range of $15 to $24 last February.Other items that could risk from full margin recovery, Credit Suisse said, include a shift in consumer behavior, continued markdowns as consumer seek value, recession risk, a shift in spending to food, an ongoing theft problem which accounted for $400 million in extra profit loss last year, and ""the structural nature of some supply chain pressures.""""Headwinds certainly seem to offset tailwinds, so we hope TGT strikes a cautious tone, so we would become much more constructive on TGT as the company guides conservatively on operating margin trajectory,"" the note said.Year-to-date shares of Target are up nearly 14% and down 15 percent from a year ago.

On the topline, the analyst forecasts net revenues to decline 3.5% YoY to $4.328 billion.The analyst expects retail gross margin contraction of 380 basis points to 34.6% and over 200 basis points of operating margin contraction to 4.5% versus 6.8% last year.The analyst added that net sales for the nine-week period ending December fell 3.5% YoY as consumers remained selective with spending.Management noted they continued to see greater resilience in its higher income cohorts, however, all consumers are being more selective in their purchasing given the broader macro environment, said the analyst.Looking ahead to FY23, the analyst anticipates sales growth to moderate to 2.2% YoY to $15.878 billion, but with profitability to expand relative to FY22.The analyst is encouraged that JWN took the necessary measures to achieve cleaner inventory heading into FY23, a still choppy retail environment and challenging macro-operating environment in 1H23 cloud visibility to stabilization and, ultimately, improved performance.With peers' recent results emphasizing continued caution for FY23, the analyst remains cautious about the limited near-term visibility.Price Action: JWN shares are trading higher by 1.59% at $19.50 on the last check Monday.Latest Ratings for JWNDateFirmActionFromToMar 2022JP MorganMaintainsUnderweightMar 2022Credit SuisseMaintainsNeutralMar 2022Telsey Advisory GroupMaintainsMarket PerformView More Analyst Ratings for JWNView the Latest Analyst RatingsStory continuesDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Linde plc (LIN) and Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc. (MMC). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Apple have roughly matched the broader market over the past year (-10.4% for Apple vs. -10.9% for the S&amp;P 500 index), but handily outperformed the Zacks Tech sector (down - 19.8%). The Zacks analyst covering Apple expects year-over-year revenue growth to decelerate in the fiscal first quarter compared with the fiscal fourth quarter due to unfavorable forex. Mac revenues are expected to be negatively impacted by forex. Apple expects Mac revenues to decline substantially year over year during the December quarter.Services revenue growth is expected to be negatively impacted by challenging macroeconomic conditions, unfavorable forex, as well as weakness in digital advertising and gaming. Nevertheless, a growing subscriber base in the Services business and a strong liquidity position are key catalysts.(You can read the full research report on Apple here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Linde shares have outperformed the Zacks Chemical - Diversified industry over the past year (+18.6% vs. +10.3%). The company’s wide range of applications for its industrial gases, Linde is making the world more productive by the day. The company’s primary products in industrial gases include oxygen, which is used as life support in hospitals.Its process gas, like hydrogen, is being utilized for clean fuels, while its high-purity and specialty gases are employed to manufacture electronics. Linde has long-term contracts with on-site customers backed by minimum purchase requirements, thereby securing stable cashflows. In the profitable industrial gas market, the merger of Praxair and Linde has created an efficient player with considerable size advantages.However, the cost of sales continues to increase, hurting the firm’s bottom line. The firm has mostly been paying a lower dividend yield than the industry’s composite stocks over the past two years.(You can read the full research report on Linde here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Marsh &amp; McLennan shares have outperformed the Zacks Insurance - Brokerage industry over the past year (+4.3% vs. +3.6%). The company is well-poised to grow on the back of significant investments and acquisitions made within its operating units, the launch of new products and branching out into new businesses.Its increased stake in Marsh India will further buoy growth. Revenues have been increasing thanks to a wide geographic presence and strong client retention. The Risk and Insurance Services unit has been contributing to revenue growth for a while. MMC had around $4.3 billion left under authorization as of Dec 31, 2022.However, high operating costs might weigh on the margins. A debt-laden balance sheet is a concern.

Providing evidence of that assertion, in 2021, JPMorgan found that “institutional investors account for around 90% of the daily trading volume on the Russell 3000 index, which is the broadest major U.S. stock index,” Seeking Alpha reported. Consequently, intuitional investors still play a huge role in determining the fate of stocks. So when retail investors are looking for stocks to buy, they should remember that names that institutional investors favor have a much higher chance of succeeding than the stocks with which the “big money” is not very enamored.As a result, it’s quite valuable to know which stocks institutional investors are rushing to buy. Here are three surging stocks that big money loves.TickerCompanyPriceMGMMGM Resorts$43.15FCXFreeport McMoran$40.59CROXCrocs$125.47InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsStocks to Buy: MGM Resorts (MGM)A photo of the MGM logo on the MGM casino building.Source: Michael Neil Thomas / Shutterstock.comMGM (NYSE:MGM) stock is up nearly 30% so far in 2023, and two huge investors with sterling track records have bought its stock.Most impressively, Barry Diller’s IAC (NASDAQ:IAC) has accumulated a 12% stake in MGM, which owns many casinos in Las Vegas and has launched a joint venture specializing in online sports betting. Diller first became involved with MGM in 2020, when IAC invested almost $1 billion in the casino owner.Diller, whose net worth is reportedly about $3.9 billion, launched many successful TV shows as a television network executive in the 1980s. Among the highly successful internet companies he built or helped build are IAC, Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), and Tinder.Meanwhile, Michael Burry, who became famous for correctly predicting the financial system crash in 2008 and has recently become well-known as an uber-bear on the stock market, nonetheless bought 100,000 shares of MGM stock last quarter.Story continuesAccording to Nasdaq.com, in recent months, 91 institutions have started new positions in MGM stock, buying 7.14 million shares of the company. Conversely, 64 institutions have dropped MGM, selling 6.1 million shares of the name.Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)Freeport-McMoRan Stock's Long List of Catalysts Boosts Its Buy StatusSource: 360b / Shutterstock.comSince bottoming in September, Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX), which specializes in mining copper, has jumped 58%, closing at $41.79 on Feb. 22.And not coincidentally, FCX has become very popular with institutional investors during the stock’s rally. Specifically, according to Nasdaq.com, 696 institutional investors have bought 76.35 million shares of the name, while 504 have sold 58 million shares, and 163 have held nearly 1 billion shares.When it comes to buying shares for the first time, 253 institutions purchased 21.18 million shares. Meanwhile, only 102 organizations liquidated their ownership of FCX completely, selling 9.62 million shares.Speaking on FCX’s fourth-quarter earnings conference call, held on Jan. 25, FCX’s President, Kathleen Quirk, said, “The facts are that the physical markets for copper have remained tight even during a period of weaker economic data coming out of China, and that’s evidenced by the low levels of available copper inventories throughout the year.”Quirk added, “At the same time, copper’s importance in the economy continues to grow as a result of the intensity of use in clean energy applications and the global acceleration of electrification.”I agree that the rapid proliferation of renewable energy and the electrification of transportation should be very positive for copper prices, FCX, and FCX stock.Crocs (CROX)The front of a Crocs (CROX) store in Chiang Mai, Thailand.Source: Wannee_photographer / Shutterstock.comAccording to Investor’s Business Daily, Crocs (NASDAQ:CROX) has a Relative Strength score of 98 out of a possible 99. That means that CROX has outperformed nearly all other stocks over the last year. The company has an Accumulation/Distribution grade of B+, showing that many institutions have been buying the shares in the last 13 weeks.Nasdaq.com’s data is much more impressive, showing that, in recent months, 243 institutions bought 8.23 million shares of CROX, while 172 organizations sold only 4.64 million shares. Meanwhile, 104 institutions purchased its shares for the first time, buying 2.53 million, while only 48 institutions liquidated their positions in CROX completely, unloading 1.07 million shares.In the last three months, CROX stock has rocketed 30% higher, but its price-earnings ratio is still a reasonable 14.4.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in FCX and MGM.

Achieved positive Adjusted Free Cash Flow of approximately $71 million, reaching another key post-pandemic financial milestone.2023 OutlookEntered the year with a record booked position and at higher pricing.WAVE season demand has been very strong with the Company’s brands experiencing record launches for WAVE offers and highest-ever booking months in November 2022 and January 2023.Occupancy is expected to average approximately 100% for the first quarter and is on track to reach historical levels for the second quarter.Capacity is expected to increase approximately 19% compared to 2019 including the delivery of three newbuilds in 2023: Oceania Cruises’ Vista, Norwegian Viva and Regent’s Seven Seas Grandeur.Net Per Diem is expected to increase in the range of 8.75 to 10.25% as-reported and 9.00 to 10.50% in Constant Currency versus 2019. Net Yield is expected to increase in the range of 4.75 to 6.25% as-reported and 5.00 to 6.50% in Constant Currency versus 2019.The Company is undertaking a broad and ongoing margin enhancement initiative and took several steps in recent months to improve operating efficiencies, reduce costs, and maximize revenue generation opportunities while continuing to provide value to its guests.

We continue to pursue all opportunities to capitalize on the healthy demand we are experiencing, especially during this important WAVE season,” continued Del Rio. Business and Operations UpdateThe Company continued its phased ramp-up in the fourth quarter achieving Occupancy of approximately 87%, consistent with previously outlined expectations and with the gap versus 2019 levels continuing to narrow sequentially. Occupancy is expected to average approximately 100% for the first quarter of 2023 and reach historical Occupancy levels for the second quarter of 2023. Full year 2023 Occupancy is expected to reach approximately 103.5%, partially impacted by a lower first quarter due to the phased voyage ramp up.Strong ticket pricing and onboard revenue generation resulted in better-than-expected total revenue per Passenger Cruise Day which was up approximately 23% as-reported and approximately 24% in Constant Currency in the fourth quarter of 2022 versus 2019.Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $237 million and the Company reached another significant financial inflection point by generating positive Adjusted Free Cash Flow of approximately $71 million for the fourth quarter of 2022.With the phased Occupancy ramp up now nearly complete, the Company is undertaking a broad and ongoing margin enhancement initiative, focused on both maximizing revenue opportunities and right sizing its cost base, in order to strengthen the foundation for sustained, profitable growth.Booking Environment and OutlookThe Company entered the year with a record cumulative booked position of approximately 62% for full year 2023, in line with previously outlined expectations and within the Company’s optimal 60 to 65% range, and at higher prices than 2019 at a similar point in time.Booking volumes have accelerated in recent months buoyed by strong WAVE season demand. The Company’s brands achieved several booking records in recent months including at Norwegian Cruise Line which reached an all-time record booking month in November, boosted by Black Friday and Cyber Monday, which was subsequently exceeded in January 2023. As a result, full year 2023 cumulative booked position is ahead of 2019 levels inclusive of the Company’s approximately 19% increase in capacity, at continued higher pricing. Net booking volumes continue to be at the pace needed to reach historical Occupancy levels for the second quarter of 2023 and beyond. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s advance ticket sales balance, including the long-term portion, was $2.7 billion, approximately 9% higher than the prior quarter and approximately 30% greater than at year-end 2019. This includes approximately $144 million of FCCs or approximately 5% of the total deposit balance. Approximately 40% of the FCC balance outstanding has been applied to future sailings.Liquidity and Financial Recovery PlanThe Company continues to prioritize enhancing liquidity and financial flexibility in the current environment while seeking opportunities to optimize its balance sheet and reduce leverage. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s total debt position was $13.6 billion and the Company’s liquidity was approximately $1.9 billion, consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $947 million and a $1 billion undrawn commitment.The Company has taken the following additional actions to enhance its liquidity profile and financial flexibility since the end of the third quarter:In December 2022, the Company amended its Operating Credit Facility, consisting of its senior secured revolving credit facility and senior secured term loan facility, and extended $1.4 billion of it by one year to January 20252.In December 2022, the Company amended its export-credit backed loan facilities to amend, among other things, certain financial covenants related to net debt to capitalization, free liquidity and consolidated EBITDA to consolidated debt service.In February 2023, the Company issued $600 million of aggregate principal amount of 8.375% senior secured notes due 2028 in a refinancing transaction. The proceeds from this offering were used to fully repay the term loans outstanding under its Operating Credit Facility that would have otherwise become due in January 2024.In February 2023, the Company amended its $1 billion undrawn commitment. As part of the amendment and to provide the Company with the option to extend the commitment for a second year, the Company issued $250 million of 9.75% senior secured notes due 2028. At the same time, the Company revised the commitment to reduce the amount to $650 million, which will be available through February 2024 with an option, at the Company’s election, to extend through February 2025. The Company does not currently intend to draw the remaining $650 million under the commitment. In total, the combination of these two actions provides the Company with approximately $900 million of liquidity.In February 2023, the Company entered into a $300 million unsecured and undrawn backstop commitment with to further enhance its future liquidity profile. The facility will be available to draw beginning October 4, 2023 through January 2, 2024 and provides backstop committed financing to refinance up to $300 million of amounts outstanding under the Operating Credit Facility.“We continue to make progress towards resuming our historic track record of achieving consistently improving financial results year after year,” said Mark A. Kempa, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. “We remain steadfast in our commitment to deliver value for all of our stakeholders. We are focused on identifying new and incremental opportunities to reinforce our solid foundation and become an even stronger and more nimble organization, while continuing to provide unparalleled vacation experiences for our valued guests.”2 Subject to a springing maturity if certain liquidity conditions are not met.Fourth Quarter 2022 ResultsGAAP net loss was $(482.5) million or EPS of $(1.14) compared to net loss of $(1.6) billion or EPS of $(4.01) in the prior year. The Company reported Adjusted Net Loss of $(439.7) million or Adjusted EPS of $(1.04) in 2022. This compares to Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EPS of $(765.0) million and $(1.95), respectively, in 2021. Revenue increased to $1.5 billion compared to $487.4 million in fourth quarter 2021 due to the phased ramp up of cruise voyages.Total cruise operating expense increased in 2022 compared to 2021, due to the continued resumption of voyages, which resulted in higher payroll, fuel, and direct variable costs of fully operating ships, compared to the prior year when only 16 ships were returned to service. Costs were also impacted by inflationary pressures.Fuel price per metric ton, net of hedges, increased to $755 from $737 in 2021. The Company reported fuel expense of $183 million in the period.Interest expense, net was $177 million in 2022 compared to $950 million in 2021. Interest expense in the prior year included losses on extinguishment of debt and debt modification costs of $771.6 million related to the repurchase of certain exchangeable notes.Other income (expense), net was expense of $(24) million in 2022 compared to income of $66.5 million in 2021. In 2022, the expense primarily related to losses from foreign currency remeasurements.Full Year 2022 Results GAAP net loss was $(2.3) billion or EPS of $(5.41) compared to a net loss of $(4.5) billion or EPS of $(12.33) in the prior year. The Company reported Adjusted Net Loss of $(1.9) billion or Adjusted EPS of $(4.64) in 2022. This compares to Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EPS of $(2.9) billion and $(8.07), respectively, in 2021.Outlook and Guidance In addition to announcing the results for the fourth quarter and full year 2022, the Company also provided guidance for the first quarter and full year 2023, along with accompanying sensitivities. The Company does not provide certain estimated future results on a GAAP basis because the Company is unable to predict, with reasonable certainty, the future movement of foreign exchange rates or the future impact of certain gains and charges. These items are uncertain and will depend on several factors, including industry conditions, and could be material to the Company’s results computed in accordance with GAAP. The Company has not provided reconciliations between the Company’s 2023 guidance and the most directly comparable GAAP measures because it would be too difficult to prepare a reliable U.S. GAAP quantitative reconciliation without unreasonable effort. 2023 Guidance First Quarter 2023Full Year 2023 As ReportedConstant CurrencyAs ReportedConstant CurrencyNet Per Diem vs. 20196.25% to 7.25%6.75% to 7.75%8.75% to 10.25%9.00% to 10.50%Net Yield vs. 20190.75% to 1.75%1.25% to 2.25%4.75% to 6.25%5.00% to 6.50%Adjusted Net Cruise CostExcluding Fuel per Capacity DayApprox. $165Approx. $160Capacity DaysApprox. 5.45 millionApprox. 22.8 million (+19% vs. 2019)OccupancyApprox. 100%Approx. 103.5%Adjusted EBITDAApprox. $195 million$1.8 to $1.95 billionAdjusted EPS1Approx.

Anticipated non-newbuild capital expenditures for full year 2023 are expected to be approximately $450 million including approximately $115 million in the first quarter.Newbuild-related capital expenditures, net of export credit financing, are expected to be approximately $0.5 billion, $0.4 billion and $0.7 billion for the full years ending December 31, 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively. Net newbuild-related capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2023 are expected to be approximately $130 million.The Company has modified certain existing newbuild contracts which has resulted in an increase in ship contract costs of approximately €1.2 billion. These changes include the previously communicated modification and enlargement of the last four Prima Class vessels as well as additional modifications to the final two ships in this class to accommodate the use of green methanol as an alternative fuel source in the future. Compared to the first-generation Prima Class vessels, these changes will result in an approximately 10% increase in gross tonnage for the third and fourth ships and an approximately 20% increase in gross tonnage for the fifth and sixth ships. As a result, delivery dates for these ships have shifted and the Company now expects one next generation Prima Class ship to be delivered each year from 2025 through 2028. The majority of the increase in ship construction costs is not effective unless financing is secured. The Company is currently in the process of securing additional export-credit agency backed financing to cover the above costs.Company Updates and Other Business Highlights:Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Modified newbuild contracts for the final two Prima Plus Class ships to re-configure the ships to accommodate the use of green methanol as an alternative fuel source in the future. While additional modifications will be needed in the future to fully enable the use of methanol in addition to traditional marine fuel on these ships, this reinforces the Company’s commitment to decarbonization and represents an important step forward in the pursuit of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.Successfully completed tests of biofuel blends on three additional ships, Norwegian Star, Norwegian Sun and Norwegian Epic. All three ships were tested with a blend of approximately 30% biofuel and 70% MGO which was supplied in collaboration with World Fuel Services as well as GoodFuels for Norwegian Sun and PRIO for Norwegian Star and Norwegian Epic.Norwegian Cruise Line announced the launch of its first-ever Military Appreciation Program to recognize active and retired U.S. military members, and their spouses, with special onboard experiences, amenities and cruise fare discounts.

See “Terminology” for the definitions of these and other non-GAAP financial measures. We utilize Adjusted Gross Margin, Net Yield, and Net Per Diem to manage our business on a day-to-day basis and believe they are relevant measures of our revenue performance because they reflect revenue earned net of certain direct variable costs. We also utilize Net Cruise Cost and Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel to manage our business on a day-to-day basis. In measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income (loss), we believe changes in Adjusted Gross Margin, Net Cruise Cost and Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance.As our business includes the sourcing of passengers and deployment of vessels outside of the U.S., a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies, particularly British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro and Australian dollar which are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates versus our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar. In order to monitor results excluding these fluctuations, we calculate certain non-GAAP measures on a Constant Currency basis, whereby current period revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are converted to U.S. dollars using currency exchange rates of the comparable period. We believe that presenting these non-GAAP measures on both a reported and Constant Currency basis is useful in providing a more comprehensive view of trends in our business.We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate as a supplemental financial measure as it is used by management to assess operating performance. We also believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure in determining our performance as it reflects certain operating drivers of our business, such as sales growth, operating costs, marketing, general and administrative expense and other operating income and expense. Adjusted EBITDA is not a defined term under GAAP nor is it intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or a measure comparable to net income (loss), as it does not take into account certain requirements such as capital expenditures and related depreciation, principal and interest payments and tax payments and it includes other supplemental adjustments.In addition, Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain amounts and are used to supplement GAAP net loss and EPS. We use Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EPS as key performance measures of our earnings performance. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparison to our historical performance. In addition, management uses Adjusted EPS as a performance measure for our incentive compensation during normal operations. The amounts excluded in the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures may vary from period to period; accordingly, our presentation of Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EPS may not be indicative of future adjustments or results. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred $12.1 million related to restructuring costs or charges. We included this as an adjustment in the reconciliation of Adjusted Net Loss since the expenses are not representative of our day-to-day operations; however, this adjustment did not occur and is not included in the three months or year ended December 31, 2021.Management believes Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow provide investors with useful financial metrics to assess our ability to service and repay our debt and to pursue opportunities to enhance our growth after making the capital investments required to support ongoing business operations and long-term value creation. Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures as they exclude certain mandatory expenditures such as repayment of maturing debt. Management uses Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow as measures to assess both business performance and overall liquidity.You are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment used in calculating our non-GAAP financial measures and the reasons we consider our non-GAAP financial measures appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating our non-GAAP financial measures, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in our presentation. Our non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Our presentation of our non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other companies. Please see a historical reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure presented in our consolidated financial statements below.Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking StatementsSome of the statements, estimates or projections contained in this release are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Examples of these risks, uncertainties and other factors include, but are not limited to the impact of: adverse general economic factors, such as fluctuating or increasing levels of interest rates, inflation, unemployment, underemployment and the volatility of fuel prices, declines in the securities and real estate markets, and perceptions of these conditions that decrease the level of disposable income of consumers or consumer confidence; the spread of epidemics, pandemics and viral outbreaks, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and their effect on the ability or desire of people to travel (including on cruises), which is expected to continue to adversely impact our results, operations, outlook, plans, goals, growth, reputation, cash flows, liquidity, demand for voyages and share price; implementing precautions in coordination with regulators and global public health authorities to protect the health, safety and security of guests, crew and the communities we visit and to comply with regulatory restrictions related to the pandemic; our indebtedness and restrictions in the agreements governing our indebtedness that require us to maintain minimum levels of liquidity and be in compliance with maintenance covenants and otherwise limit our flexibility in operating our business, including the significant portion of assets that are collateral under these agreements; our ability to work with lenders and others or otherwise pursue options to defer, renegotiate, refinance or restructure our existing debt profile, near-term debt amortization, newbuild related payments and other obligations and to work with credit card processors to satisfy current or potential future demands for collateral on cash advanced from customers relating to future cruises; our need for additional financing or financing to optimize our balance sheet, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all, and our outstanding exchangeable notes and any future financing which may be dilutive to existing shareholders; the unavailability of ports of call; future increases in the price of, or major changes, disruptions or reduction in, commercial airline services; changes involving the tax and environmental regulatory regimes in which we operate, including new regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions; the accuracy of any appraisals of our assets as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise; our success in controlling operating expenses and capital expenditures; trends in, or changes to, future bookings and our ability to take future reservations and receive deposits related thereto; adverse events impacting the security of travel, or customer perceptions of the security of travel, such as terrorist acts, armed conflict, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and threats thereof, acts of piracy, and other international events; adverse incidents involving cruise ships; breaches in data security or other disturbances to our information technology and other networks or our actual or perceived failure to comply with requirements regarding data privacy and protection; changes in fuel prices and the type of fuel we are permitted to use and/or other cruise operating costs; mechanical malfunctions and repairs, delays in our shipbuilding program, maintenance and refurbishments and the consolidation of qualified shipyard facilities; the risks and increased costs associated with operating internationally; our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or the loss of key personnel or employee relations issues; our inability to obtain adequate insurance coverage; pending or threatened litigation, investigations and enforcement actions; volatility and disruptions in the global credit and financial markets, which may adversely affect our ability to borrow and could increase our counterparty credit risks, including those under our credit facilities, derivatives, contingent obligations, insurance contracts and new ship progress payment guarantees; any further impairment of our trademarks, trade names or goodwill; our reliance on third parties to provide hotel management services for certain ships and certain other services; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; our expansion into new markets and investments in new markets and land-based destination projects; overcapacity in key markets or globally; and other factors set forth under “Risk Factors” in our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Additionally, many of these risks and uncertainties are currently amplified by and will continue to be amplified by, or in the future may be amplified by, the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the impact of general macroeconomic conditions. It is not possible to predict or identify all such risks. There may be additional risks that we consider immaterial or which are unknown. The above examples are not exhaustive and new risks emerge from time to time. Such forward-looking statements are based on our current beliefs, assumptions, expectations, estimates and projections regarding our present and future business strategies and the environment in which we expect to operate in the future. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. We expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto or any change of events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement was based, except as required by law.Investor Relations &amp; Media Contact Jessica John (305)

NCLH is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 28, 2023, before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 9.9%.The Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter bottom line is pegged at a loss of 89 cents per share, indicating an improvement of 54.4% from a loss of $1.95 reported in the year-ago quarter.For revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $1,500 million. The projection suggests an increase of 207.8% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. Price and EPS SurpriseNorwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. price-eps-surprise | Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. Quote Let's look at how things have shaped up in the quarter.Factors at PlayNorwegian Cruise’s fourth-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from improved booking trends, relaxation in COVID-related protocols and fleet expansion efforts. This and the increased focus on the booking window are likely to have contributed to the company’s performance in the fourth quarter. During the previous quarter, the company emphasized on the removal of COVID testing requirements from countries like Canada, Bermuda, Greece and South America. Also, it reported sequential improvements in booking activities incorporating higher pricing and the dilutive impact of future cruise credits. As of Sep 30, 2022, the company’s advance ticket sales (including the long-term portion) were $2.5 billion compared with $2.2 billion reported in the previous quarter. Given the pent-up demand and the emphasis on reducing friction and travel-related hassles for its guests, the momentum is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2022, the company expects occupancy to be in the mid-to-high 80% range.Increased revenue generation from its onboard and passenger tickets is likely to have driven the fourth-quarter top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for passenger ticket revenues and onboard and other revenues is currently pegged at $998 million and $491 million, compared with $305 million and $183 million, respectively, reported in the prior-year quarter.The absence of premium-priced Baltic itineraries due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict is likely to have affected the company’s performance in the fourth quarter. This and inflationary pressures and global supply chain constraints are likely to have dented the company’s margins in the to-be-reported quarter.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not predict earnings beat for Norwegian Cruise this time around.

The company's shares saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at Microchip Technology’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Microchip Technology What Is Microchip Technology Worth?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 19.62% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Microchip Technology today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $66.61, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Microchip Technology’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What does the future of Microchip Technology look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 34% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Microchip Technology. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? MCHP’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on MCHP, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

Grainger, Las Vegas Sands, Microchip Technology and Arista Networks",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-analyst-blog-highlights-cadence-115011943.html,1677498611,STORY,"['MCHP', 'GWW', 'CDNS', 'LVS', 'ANET', '^GSPC']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – February 27, 2023 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Cadence Design Systems Inc. CDNS, W.W. Grainger Inc. GWW, Las Vegas Sands Corp. LVS, Microchip Technology Inc. MCHP and Arista Networks Inc. ANET.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Top 5 S&amp;P 500 Stocks with Double-Digit Returns Year-to-DateThe welcome rally of U.S. stocks that we have seen from the beginning of January to mid-February is fading out gradually. Market participants are concerned about a higher interest regime for a longer period and the possibility of a recession in 2023. Market participants' confidence in risky assets like equities has been dampened to some extent. Volatility is likely to continue in the near term.Year to date, the S&amp;P 500 Index is up 4.5%. However, the broad-market index was up nearly 8% in early February. The benchmark is currently down by 15.6% from its all-time high of 4,637.30. Despite these headwinds, a handful of S&amp;P 500 stocks are flying high with double-digit returns year to date.Strong Economic Data Bad for Wall StreetWall Street is currently in a “Catch 22 Situation.” Strong economic data will ensure solid fundamentals for the U.S. economy. On the other hand, it will give the Fed a reason to continue its aggressive rate hike and monetary tightening to combat inflation.Strong economic data for January has unnerved investors as a higher wage rate will raise aggregate demand, making inflation stubborn. The consumer price index and the producer price index of January were reported last week. These two key inflation measures were higher than the consensus mark, indicating that the Fed has to go a long way to tame inflation to near 2%.Fears of higher interest rate hikes flared up further following comments from St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard. He said that he had proposed a 50-basis point rate hike in the Fed’s last meeting and such a hike could be expected in the March meeting. Bullard’s sentiments were echoed by Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, saying that she also supports a steeper rate hike in the next meeting, which further weighed on stocks.Story continuesOn Feb 17, Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman said “I think there’s a long way to go before we reach our 2% inflation objective and I think we’ll have to continue to raise the federal funds rate until we see a lot more progress on that.”On Feb 22, in an interview with CNBC, Bullard said that going higher sooner would be more effective. Per Bullard, the terminal interest rate should be around 5.375% instead of 5.1% expected by the Fed earlier.Our Top PicksOn Feb 23, the S&amp;P 500 Index closed at 4,012.32. Despite the recent decline, the market’s benchmark stays well above its 50-days and 200-days moving averages of 3,980.89 and 3,940.23, respectively. Therefore, the index has a solid potential to bounce back.At this stage, we have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate giants (market capital &gt; $30 billion) from the S&amp;P 500 stable with year-to-date returns of more than 10%. These stocks have strong growth potential for 2023 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Finally, each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

A buildup in US stockpiles is also likely weighing on prices.Brent crude futures, the global benchmark, have fallen 2.2% to $83 a barrel in February so far, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures have dropped 3.2% to $77 a barrel. The declines put the benchmarks on track to fall for a fourth consecutive month.""Crude oil prices have remained volatile this year, with markets torn between fears of an extended Federal Reserve rate-hiking cycle due to a tight US labor market and optimism over a recovery in oil demand as China's economy reopens,"" UBS CIO Mark Haefele said in a research note.In February, investors returned to bracing for US interest rates to be higher for longer, after a string of positive economic data including a surge in job numbers. That offers the Fed the scope to raise borrowing costs above 5% and then hold them there, as it tries to rein in sticky high inflation.Higher interest rates in the US weigh on oil prices because they curb consumer demand and drag on economic activity. They also strengthen the dollar, which can pull down prices for Brent and WTI that are denominated in the US currency.""While better US economic data should mean better oil demand, the concern is that this forces the Fed to overtighten monetary policy to bring inflation under control,"" UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said earlier this month.Story continuesAnother factor is the growth in US crude inventories, which have logged nine weekly rises in a row. Supplies are now over 15% higher than they were last year, according to FXPro.Crude's losing streak comes even though China has started to rapidly reopen its economy after nearly three years of strict zero-COVID lockdowns. Some strategists expect it could boost global demand and fuel a price rally, and Vitol CEO Russell Hardy has said it could push oil demand to record highs later this year.But many analysts expect oil prices to rally again once Russia starts cutting its production levels. Moscow said earlier in February that it plans to cut its oil output by 500,000 barrels a day in March, as Ukraine sanctions hit its ability to find willing buyers.Those Russian output cuts would squeeze global supply tighter, and that would drive prices higher as long as demand continues to hold up.""We believe that the tightening of the oil market this year will eventually put prices on an upward trajectory,"" UBS CIO Haefele said. ""Russia's announcement last Friday of an output cut in March is a reminder of these dynamics.""Read more: The dollar stages a comeback, with the Fed's war on inflation putting it on course for its first monthly gain since SeptemberRead the original article on Business Insider]"

Today, I will share with you the fourth quarter and full year results of 2022 in which we have continued to deliver a strong operational and financial performance. First, I will present the fourth quarter results and then we later move on to full year results and 2023 guidance, and I will also comment on the transaction we closed and announced yesterday. During Q4, 2022, total production averaged BOE per day, a 33% increase year-over-year. Oil production was up 41% year-over-year driven by the tie-in of 1 4-well pad in Bajada del Palo Oeste and another in Aguada Federal. Total revenues were $308 million for the quarter, an interannual increase of 57% driven by higher production and stronger realized oil price.Story continuesLifting costs per BOE was $7.2 for the quarter, reflecting our success in containing cost pressure through a number of efficiency measures as well as dilution in the fixed costs through incremental production volumes. Capital expenditure was $145 million including the drilling of 8 wells and the completion of 7 wells during the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA during Q4 2022 was $202 million, a 73% increase year-over-year, driven by higher production and realization prices and lower lifting costs per BOE. During Q4 2022, we record positive free cash flow of $57 million, driven by robust adjusted EBITDA generation. Net leverage ratio at quarter end was 0.4x adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted net income was a solid $171 million including and not recurring positive adjusted of $98 million of income tax, implying a quarterly adjusted EPS of $2 per share.We will now deep dive into our main operation and financial metrics for the quarter. Total production during Q4 2022 was 54,700 BOEs per day, up 33% interannually and 8% sequentially. Oil production was up 41% year-over-year, mainly driven by the tie-in of pads Bajada del Palo Oeste-14 and Aguada Federal-3. Total shale oil production, which also includes Bajada del Palo Oeste increased to 36,200 barrels of oil per day, representing 79% of oil production. Moving to Slide 5. I will share some details on our projects in Vaca Muerta. In Bajada del Palo Oeste, we continued to report robust oil productivity. We have tie-in 60 wells today, from which 40 have exceeded 360 days of production and are producing on average 3% above our Bajada del Palo Oeste type curve.During Q4, we completed pad Bajada del Palo Oeste-15, which was tie-in late in the year. These pads has 5 wells, of which 3 were landed in La Cocina and 2 in the Organico. We are seeing very good productivity regions in these wells, which are performing above our type curve after 40 days on production. Also, we recently started to drill 4-well pad Bajada del Palo Oeste-16, which we plan to tie-in during Q2. In our Federal production increased to 5,800 BOE per day during Q4, 2022. The block contributed 14% of our total shale production boosted by pads Aguada Federal-2 and Aguada Federal-3. We have recently finished drilling 4-well pad Aguada Federal-4, landing 2 wells in La Cocina, 1 well in the Organico and 1 well in Middle Carbonate, which we have not tested in Aguada Federal so far.We plan to complete and tie-in this pad by the end of Q1. During Q4 2022, we made good progress in our pilot in Bajada del Palo Este. We drilled, complete and tie-in 1 well in Bajada del Palo Este-3, landed in La Cocina and eastern part of the block. We are currently drilling pad Bajada del Palo Este-2, which contains 2 wells La Cocina. We plan to tie-in these wells during April, after which we will have fulfilled our investment commitment in this block. In Aguila Mora, we completed our first 2-well pad in January. We landed 1 well in La Cocina and 1 well in Middle Carbonate. We are currently working on the temporary production facilities for the block, which is scheduled for completion in April. Our plan is to tie-in the wells after that event.Total revenues in Q4 2022 were $308.1 million, a 57% increase year-over-year driven by production growth and stronger registration prices. During the quarter we normalized our inventory with a buildup of 238,000 barrels. Realized oil price for the quarter averaged $68.9 per barrel and interannual increase of 14%. The average realized domestic price was $67.2 per barrel. This figure does not include trucking transportation cost from sales point to refinery, including such cost, the domestic realized oil prices was $63.3 per barrel. The average realized price of the export market was $74.1 per barrel, reflecting softer brands and higher shipping costs. For the second straight quarter more than 50% of our total revenue came from the export market.Sales to international market accounted for 52% of oil volumes and 56% of oil revenues. We exported 4.5 cargoes during the quarter or 2.2 million barrels of oil in total. We expect to maintain this level of export during the coming quarter as well. Realized gas prices were $4.5 per million BTU, an increase of 65% year-over-year, mainly boosted by sales to our industrial customers at $3 per million BTU applicable to 44% of our sales volumes, and export to Chile at $8.8 per million BTU applicable to 26% of our sales volumes. Total lifting cost for the quarter was $36.1 million. We have successfully implemented cost saving initiatives mainly the pipeline from Aguada Federal to Bajada del Palo Oeste, which reduced oil transportation costs. Additionally, the boost in production volume continues to dilute fixed costs, leading to an 11% reduction in lifting cost per BOE year-over-year.Adjusted EBITDA in Q4 2022 was $201.7 million, implying a 73% growth year-over-year. This reflects strong revenue growth and the reduction in lifting costs, I mentioned previously. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 65% during the quarter, an interannual improvement of 6 percentage points. Netback was $40.1 per BOE, a 30% increase year-over-year, driven by higher oil prices and lower lifting cost per BOE. During Q4 2022, we continue to generate positive free cash flow for a total of $57.2 million. Cash from operation activities during the quarter increased 55% interannually to $215.4 million. Cash flow used in investment activities was $158.2 million. Capital expenditure was $145.2 million on actual accrual basis, of which $98 million were invested in new wells in our Vaca Muerta project, USD31 million in facilities and USD16 million in other minor projects.Cash flow generated by financing activities stood at $8.8 million during the quarter. We successfully refinanced $108.5 million of 2023 maturity, of which USD45 million are now due in 2025 and USD63.5 million in 2026. We also refinanced $40.5 million of 2024 maturities, which due in 2025. This extended the average life of our debt from 2.4 years to 2.8 years and reduce average debt cost from 6% to 4.4%. Gross debt stood at $549.3 million at the end of Q4 2022. The slight increase compared with Q3 2022 was driven by debt issuance to repay $22.5 million installment of our term loan in January. After this payment, gross debt has stood at $526.8 million. After this debt repayment and due to our successful refinancing effort at the end of the last year, we only have $45 million debt maturities remaining in 2023.Net leverage ratio stood at a very healthy 0.4x adjusted EBITDA at quarter end. I will now move to our full year results. During 2022, we have continued to deliver on our superior shareholder return proposition. We also achieved robust performance vis-a-vis our 2022 guidance. We further expanded our external reserve base. Our P1 reserves increased to 251.6 million BOE year-end, implying reserve replacement ratio of 495%. The acquisition of Aguada Federal and Bandurria Norte led to the addition of 300 new wells to our inventory. Also our successful results in the first 2 wells in Bajada del Palo Este, led to an addition of 50 new wells, increasing our inventory in Vaca Muerta to 900 wells in total. In 2022, we delivered solid operational performance.Production for the year was 48,600 BOE per day, a 25% increase year-over-year and well above our 47,000 BOE per day guidance. Oil increased 32% year-over-year, driven by higher oil content in our shale oil. We exported 44% of our oil sales volumes, which generate 52% of total oil sales, driven by higher realization prices in the export market. We reduced lifting costs from $7.6 to $7.5 per BOE year-over-year, reflecting our export to control costs in a challenging FX environment and delivering on our guidance. During 2022, we also made good progress in our sustainability program. We continue to invest in decarbonizing our operations. This has led to a 2% drop in absolute emissions in the year during which production increased 25%, therefore, reducing emissions intensity from 24 to 18 kilos of CO2 equivalent per BOE.Concurrently, we have initiated the first 4 projects on our nature-based solution portfolio. I will deep dive into this matter later during the presentation. Regarding shareholder returns, we have a record year. We adjusted EBITDA at $765 million exceeding our guidance. Return on capital average employee came very strong at 40% for the year and so was our bottom line with an EPS of $4.2 per share, a free cash flow of $197 million. We have applied part of this cash to reduce gross debt by $84 million during the year. We have also repurchased 3.2 million shares for a total of $29 million, driven by execution of our strategic plan and in a contracted context for international commodity prices, our share price during 2022. Proved reserves increased 39% vis-a-vis 2021 for a total of 251.6 million BOE estimated at the year-end 2022.Oil and gas, Industry, EnergyPhoto by Jason Blackeye on UnsplashThis implies a total reserves replacement ratio of 495% and 515% for oil. Proved reserve life increased to 14.2 years. This growth reflects the quality of our quarterback commodity acreage and our ability to generate organic and profitable growth. Net additions were 87.8 million BOE, driven by activity in Aguada Federal where we added 40 new wells locations. Bajada del Palo Oeste, where we added 32 new well locations and Bajada del Palo Este where we added 4 well locations. This resulted in a total of 210 booked well locations in our P1 reserves. The certified present value at 10% discount rate attributable to Vista's interest in proved reserve of $3.2 billion, using a price assumption of $72 per barrel for oil and per million BTU for gas, according to SEC guidelines.During 2022, we made significant achievements on the operational front. The execution of our led to the tie-in of 28 new shale oil wells during the year. Therefore, total wells and production increased from 40 to 68 wells, driven an increase of 25% in total production and 49% in shale oil production year-over-year. 20 of the new wells were in Bajada del Palo Oeste. In addition, with tie-in sequels in Aguada Federal, which we incorporated into our core development area by connecting through a pipeline to Bajada del Palo cluster. We also initiated a pilot in Bajada del Palo Oeste, where we tie-in the first 2 wells in Q1 2022, showing robust productivity results. In July, we started operating our own sand mine and sand washing plant, improving sand logistics and cost.The plant is already supplying Vista wells and is designed to serve 100% of our sand needs at full capacity, which is forecasted to be reached by mid-year. We have also made good progress in expanding our oil treatment capacity. We finalized our upgrade of the oil treatment plant, where we flow they Bajada del Palo cluster production, increasing its capacity to 57,000 barrels per day. We are actively working on another upgrade, which will further increase the capacity of the plant to 69,000 barrels per day by the third quarter of this year. Finally, we achieved 2 major milestones related to oil evacuation projects. In OldelVal, the pipeline linking Vaca Muerta to Puerto Rosales we have been awarded 31,500 barrels of oil per day capacity in that expansion project.In addition to 42,700, we already have in the existing pipeline. We were also awarded 37,400 barrels of oil per day of throughput capacity in OTE port expansion in Puerto Rosales. Our capacity in these 2 projects will give us increased access to exporting through the . We have agreed to prepay 100% of our capacity in OldelVal and 50% of our capacity in OTE, which means an estimated investment in the form of prepayment to suppliers of USD77 million in 2023 and USD60 million in 2024 and USD11 million in 2025. The agreements we have signed for these 2 projects, constitute a major milestone for our growth plan. We combined secured term potential capacity, including our current capacity in OldelVal, we leased 74,300 barrels of oil per day, which is more than is needed to deliver our 2026 production target and has further upside, due to other ongoing process.We are currently working with other upstream player to develop an additional pipeline capacity from the core area of Vaca Muerta, where we can lean into our facilities to the north of the basin connecting with existing to Chile. We think this could also generate an evacuation route for . During 2022, we have made solid progress on all our ESG plants. As discussed earlier, the execution of our decarbonization projects drove a reduction of our carbon intensity from 24 to 18 kilos of CO2 equivalent per BOE year-over-year. Crucially, during Q4 2022, we have recorded an intensity of 14 kilos, as the impact of the project implemented during the year materializing full, leaving us at a very solid starting point for 2023. We also signed a long-term power purchase agreement with a leading provider of electricity from renewable sources.We plan to cover approximately 20% of our power needs from renewables in 2023 and gradually increase this year in coming years. This will contribute significantly to reducing our Scope 2 emissions. During 2022, we made headway in the development of our nature-based solution portfolio. We set up Aike, a Vista subsidiary to design, manage and execute our carbon offset projects. Aike a set up with leading local expert and focus on the development of a mixed forestry, forest conservation and soil capture through sustainable agriculture and livestock practices in Argentina. In its first year of operation, Aike purchased land in the where we planted 1,080 hectares, singed a binding commitment to purchase 5,000 hectares for the forest conservation projects in the province of Salta and signed sustainable farming and livestock agreement covering a total of hectares in the Province of Cordoba, Santa Fe, Buenos Aires and Rio Negro.Considering our solid progress in decarbonization and NBS projects, we are well on track to fulfill our Scope 1 &amp; 2 Net Zero ambition by 2026. On the social front, we achieved total safety results recording a total recordable incident rate below 1 for the third year in a row. We have made good progress in our gender initiatives through hiring and developing female talent, issuing new policies and running workshops to increase employee awareness. We also set up a Social Management System, a framework to support and develop social projects with our local communities, externally audited and following IFC standards. Finally, we have continued to strengthen our governance, issuing new policies related to business ethics and implementing a public grievance mechanism on our website.I believe this slide conveys how our stronger performance give way to a robust total shareholder return in 2022. Our strong profitable production cash generation and led to positive free cash flow, reaching almost $200 million in 2022. This has enabled us to further deleverage our company, reducing gross debt by $84 million. This translated in a very solid net leverage ratio of 0.4x EBITDA at year-end 2022. In terms of the quality of our results, return on average capital employee very quickly reached 40% and adjusted EPS increased by 4x year-over-year. We have also allocated $50 million to the first 2 stages of our share buyback program. These significant achievements were positively reflected by our share price performance was tripled in 2022.Moving to Slide 15, yesterday, we announced a transaction that will allow us to become fully focused on Vaca Muerta shale oil development. The transaction is structured as an innovative 2-phased agreement with Petrolera Aconcagua, covered the conventional concession shows engaged in grey on the map. As of March 1, 2023, Aconcagua will become the operator and pay 100% of the OpEx, CapEx, royalties and taxes of such assets. Vista will remain concession title holder until final closing date, which will be no later on February 28, 2027. At this time, 100% ownership will be transferred to Aconcagua subject to provisional approval. Vista will receive the consideration composed of 3 items: First, a payment of $26.5 million in installments. Second 40% of oil and gas produced by the block for the next 4 years; and 100% of the LPG and condensate clear of full cost, tax and royalties.The consideration payable in oil and gas volume has the minimum warranty volume of 4 million barrels of oil and 3 million cubic meters of gas. Third, the right to purchase Aconcagua's 60% share of gas production at $1 per million MBTU. For such gas, we will be making a margin of around $3.5 per million BTU at current price. Importantly, the oil treatment plant geographically located in Entre Lomas with a capacity of 57,000 barrels of oil per day is not included in this transaction. Also Vista retain the right to develop the Vaca Muerta play in all the concessions. According to our estimated and realized prices of USD65 per barrel of oil and USD4.5 per million BTU of gas, the total value to Vista with the transaction could reach a nominal value of approximately $400 million.This will allow Vista to fully focus on the development of Vaca Muerta, while streamlining our portfolio and boosting our financial and operating metrics. The transaction will have immediate benefit on our metrics. In 2023, we forecast reduction in lifting costs per BOE of 25% as well as an increase in adjusted EBITDA margin by 5 percentage points to 71%, despite the fact that we will be consolidating of the production from these conventional assets, estimated at 5,000 BOE per day. The EBITDA impact is neutralized by the operating expenses and royalties. When taking into consideration the CapEx carry and the working capital effect, these transactions generate $30 million in incremental free cash flow for Vista, which will be invested in expanding crude oil transport infrastructure to increase exports.That will also improve our ability to deliver on our 2026 target through additional free cash flow. We've forecast an additional net cash generated of approximately $100 million between 2023 and 2026 as a result of the transaction. Our portfolio will be stronger with investments direct to higher IRR shale oil project, leading to higher corporate return on capital employee, and adjusted EBITDA margins. I will now present our 2023 guidance, reflecting double-digit growth in production and adjusted EBITDA. This plan coupled with our robust delivery during 2022, leave us well on track to deliver on our 2026 target. Our development strategy is to fully focus on developing our core areas and finalize the pilot in Aguila Mora and Palo Este to reach such blocks.During 2023, we plan to tie-in 29 wells, 16 in Bajada del Palo Oeste, 8 in Aguada Federal, 3 in Bajada del Palo Este and 2 in Aguila Mora. These tie-ins are forecasted to deliver 55,000 BOE per day, a 13% increase year-over-year. Exit rate is forecast at around 60,000 BOE per day. This is planned to occur, even as we deconsolidate 50% of the production of our conventional assets as of March 1, which will remove approximately 5,000 BOE per day on our production base. Lifting cost is forecasted to drop 27% year-over-year to $5.5 per BOE, mainly driven by the deconsolidation of the conventional assets. Adjusted EBITDA is estimated in $850 million to $900 million range, based on a realization price between USD65 and USD68 per barrel. This implies an interannual growth of 11% to 18%.Our planned CapEx is $600 million, driven by slightly higher drilling and completion activities and upfront investment in treatment facilities to increase capacity for the hardware growth. Greenhouse gas emission intensity is forecasted to reduce from 18 to less than 10 kilos of CO2 equivalent per BOE. This reduction captures the full year impact of the projects executed in 2022 as well as partial impact of the 2023 projects. Overall, we are very confident that Vista is well on track to deliver on the long-term target percentage at our Investor Day in December 2021. Moreover, we see potential for overdeliver in our production, efficiency metrics and free cash flow targets. We will now go through the key takeaways of today's presentation. 2022 was a year of robust operational and financial performance.We have delivered our positively revised 2022 guidance and made good progress towards our 2023 target. We also delivered on our superior total shareholder proposition. We reduced gross debt, repurchased 3.2 million shares and approved the warrants exchange last October. This led to a peer-leading stock performing during 2022. We signed an innovative deal that will transform Vista into fully focused Vaca Muerta company, with improved operational and financial metrics. Finally, we have issued guidance for 2023 portraying double-digit growth in production and adjusted EBITDA with higher margins. Before we move to Q&amp;A, I would like to thank our investors for their continued support and all the team at Vista for their commitment and hard work, which were key in generating this on the standalone results.And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&amp;A.See also Top Investors' Stocks Portfolio: Mid-Cap Stocks and 12 High Growth Software Stocks that are Profitable.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

(NYSE: FE), has begun a significant project to install new underground electric cable to enhance service reliability for more than 5,000 residents and several businesses in Treasure Lake, a residential community just north of DuBois, Pa., in Clearfield County.Penelec Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)The upgrade is part of Penelec's Long Term Infrastructure Improvement Plan (LTIIP II), a $200 million initiative to accelerate capital investments to the company's electric distribution system over five years and help ensure continued electric service reliability for customers.""Over time, water and corrosive soil materials can penetrate underground wire through tiny cracks and fissures, which can cause power outages,"" said Scott Wyman, president of FirstEnergy's Pennsylvania operations. ""Our crews have repaired the underground cable in this development a number of times since its installation in the 1970s, and the time is right to replace it. We are encasing the new cable in plastic conduit to protect it from contact with the soil and to help ensure it provides reliable electric service to Treasure Lake for decades to come.""Crews are burying the new line and conduit adjacent to the original cable on the grassy traffic island that divides Coral Reef Road, the main thoroughfare into the community. Much of the work involves trenching, but crews will use horizontal boring technology to excavate beneath sensitive areas, such as paved areas around the Treasure Lake business plaza and spots where the golf cart path crosses the Coral Reef Road traffic divider.Split into two phases, the project includes the installation of underground electric cable for 1.6 miles. Crews will also install sectionalizing equipment that functions like fuses to isolate damage during service interruptions and add access boxes to quickly reach the wire if repairs are necessary.  Crews started work in mid-January on the northern half of the project, which consists of installing cable 4,200 feet from Treasure Lake Plaza on Coral Reef Road to Bay Road. Weather permitting, that section should be completed and energized in mid-March.Story continuesThe second phase to install cable 4,500 feet from the business plaza south on Coral Reef Road to the main entrance of the 2,200-home development will begin next and should be finished in early spring, contingent on favorable weather.

Shares of Union Pacific also spiking higher today following news of a change in the company's C-suite. Union Pacific announcing on Sunday that CEO Lance Fritz going to be stepping down by the end of the year. And that is thanks to pressure from hedge fund Soroban Capital Partners.Now this is just the latest example of activist investors pushing for change at some major companies with Starboard Value, Elliott Management, Third Point among the activist investors taking a stake in software giants in the recent months. And additionally, I would say, ValueAct CEO Mason Morfit has been appointed to the software giant's board, which is going to take effect on March 1, the same day Salesforce reports its fourth quarter earnings. So lots of shaking out in the M&amp;A space, Seana.SEANA SMITH: Yes, certainly. We have seen a rise in shareholder activism and investor activism, I should say. Certainly something that we have been talking about time and time again. When you take a look at some of these numbers, Lazard was out with recent data showing that the number of new overall campaigns last year hit 235. That's a rise of about 36%, comparing it to the number that we saw back in 2021.In terms of a Union Pacific, the reaction that we saw in the stock today, shares there jumping on this, just in terms of the fact that it looks like we will get a new CEO there, with Lance Fritz saying that he will be stepping down. Bank of America upgraded the railroad operator to a buy. They had a neutral rating. They cited that leadership change as a reason that they are more bullish on the stock.But certainly, we have seen more activism here in some of these larger blue chip industry names. Those have been targeted. You mentioned activity that we're seeing in Salesforce. You can really see it across the board. Technology, the most frequently targeted sector in 2022, represented about a fifth, 21% of the activist targets there. So as we saw the large decline in many of those tech stocks, certainly an opportunistic time for some of those activist investors to get involved.JARED BLIKRE: Yes, indeed.]"

And for a deeper dive, let's welcome in Yahoo Finance executive editor, Brian Sozzi, here on set. So Brian, walk us through the elements or the core thesis behind this ""Morning Brief.""BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, very much a defining moment for Salesforce when they report earnings middle of the week. I believe it's Wednesday. And of course, Marc Benioff, he's going to be the one that has his name on the earnings call, that has his name on the press release here. And this is really an unprecedented activist battle. Five of the biggest activist investors in the game, really, for decades, are now attacking Salesforce. What do they want? You see some of those names on the board-- Elliott, Starboard Value, and led by Jeff Smith, who got a win, Brad, as you noted this morning, over at Rogers there, Third Point, and then Jeff Ubben as well.What they essentially want is higher profit margins from Salesforce. And it is more than just laying off a next wave of workers. In January, Salesforce laid off 10% of their workforce. There is some speculation maybe more layoffs are coming. But they want a clear roadmap to this company, just operating better, not cutting costs to drive those higher profit margins. Also, a realistic 2023 guidance by-- right now, Salesforce does not have guidance out there for 2023.The Street would like to see that and a clear succession plan from CEO co-founder Marc Benioff. Now this is-- Mark is a top CEO in the game, a big presence, a big name, but he has lost two co-CEOs. That was Keith Block, and he also lost Bret Taylor as well a couple of months ago. I think the Street wants to see who is next in line for the full-time CEO job, whereby Marc maybe is just a chairman, and he doesn't have that co-CEO position.]"

We welcome in Rishi Jaluria. He is RBC Capital Market's software equity analyst. Rishi, thanks for being here. Obviously, you just heard Sozz talk about what investors want to hear now from Salesforce and from Marc Benioff.You wrote a really interesting note where you talked about the future of all of the things that have rolled up into Salesforce. And you say, Slack actually might not get sold but some of the other businesses could. Walk us through your thesis on that.RISHI JALURIA: Yeah, and thank you so much for having me. Look, you know, it's no secret that Salesforce has been a serial acquirer over the past 10, 15 years. And really, in my opinion, they haven't done the best job of integrating a lot of those assets.So I actually do think a lot of their recently acquired very large assets, including Slack, Tableau, MuleSoft, I think all three of those are potentially on the list of assets to divest or sell off. I actually think Slack is a higher probability one because Slack has underperformed. Remember, the architect of the Slack deal was actually Bret Taylor, who is no longer co-CEO of Salesforce. He's left and he's doing his own thing.And I would argue, it's not really core to what Salesforce is doing within sales service and marketing. So that's actually one that if I think about that, you're automatically improving margins by spinning it off and you're eliminating what has really been a big distraction of an asset that isn't performing well. But you know, I think Tableau has not been performing well, MuleSoft hasn't been performing well. And by no secret, all three of these are the biggest acquisitions in Salesforce history.Story continuesBRIAN SOZZI: Rishi, do you anticipate anything this week from Salesforce that would clear the deck in terms of all five of these activists? How does Salesforce get rid of them all at once?RISHI JALURIA: Yeah, I don't think there's anything they can do on earnings, right? I think that there's a lot of things that Salesforce needs to do to turn around the business. As you correctly pointed out, it's not just another round of layoffs, although that does seem to be increasingly a possibility at the company.It is, you know, turning around the culture. It is leadership changes and leadership stability. There's been a lot of executive churn over the past several months in Salesforce. I think it's more innovation and more at the product level. So really, you know, as much as I think they are gonna guide to like a high single-digit revenue growth number and call it 24% operating margins, which would be a nice expansion.I don't think that's gonna be enough to clear the deck. I think it needs to have-- the activist need to have board representation, they need to have more of a say. And we need to see that actual turnaround start to happen at Salesforce, not just, you know, cut heads and improve profitability.BRAD SMITH: What is Salesforce's kind of recession resistant product that they do have or one that they need to generate? Because if you look across the number of clients that they work with, they're looking to trim costs wherever they can right now.RISHI JALURIA: Yeah, I don't think they have-- I don't think any company, by the way, in software has a recession resistant product. But if I were to say within the stack rank of order, you know, look, the service cloud piece is really important, right? Even during times where customers are looking to cut back on their cost, service cloud helps you retain your existing customers, right? That's what they help Salesforce customers do.So that's something that you probably don't want to really unplug or dial back on. Even the core sales cloud, right? No one's gonna be unplugging it. It's just a matter that you might have fewer sales heads because you've seen the tech layoff numbers happening.Whereas I would say stuff like marketing cloud, Slack, maybe to a certain extent Tableau, Commerce Cloud, a lot of those are gonna be a lot more recession prone. So if we really kind of disaggregate Salesforce into all these different businesses, service is probably the most resilient. And then, you know, commerce, cloud, Slack, marketing probably on the least resilient side.BRIAN SOZZI: Rishi, a lot of sources that I've talked to were familiar with this situation. They say Marc Benioff has really dug in his heels here. And he takes these act-- he's taking these activist attacks pretty personally. To that end, does a successful resolution mean that Marc is just a chairman? And who do you see, internally, that can succeed him as CEO?RISHI JALURIA: Yeah, look, I actually don't think necessarily the only resolution is that Benioff kind of takes a step aside, and becomes the executive chairman, and you know, focuses on philanthropy and politics. Although, I wouldn't be surprised if that is in his future. But I don't know that there's anyone that I've seen internally at Salesforce that, you know, is ready to kind of step up to that. It might have to be an external hire to take over that mantle.Now, I'm not familiar with every single, you know, person at Salesforce. And it's definitely possible there are people who would be great to take over that mantle. But no one that I've seen so far. But again, I don't think that has to happen, right?If Benioff is willing to go along with some of the changes that the activists propose, especially if it's something that isn't draconian like cut 20% of the workforce and it is more about investing in integrating the product, which to me is one of the biggest things Salesforce needs to do to kind improve their competitiveness, to improve the products, to drive cross-sell, and that all shows up in margins over time.BRAD SMITH: Why-- and coming back to something that you mentioned earlier in them needing to-- or perhaps kicking the tires on whether or not they should or could sell Slack, or just spin it off rather I should say, I think is what you said. Why would they do that? When they acquired the company for $27 billion. It's a company that's a household name, essentially, for better or for worse. But at the end of the day, it is still a company that has so much brand equity within it that Salesforce is able to benefit from longer term, even through and past this next recession.RISHI JALURIA: Yeah, like from my vantage point, I think just Salesforce hasn't done much with Slack, right? The product is not integrated throughout the rest of the Salesforce's products. And then Slack itself is struggling. If you look at the numbers of Slack is putting up, they're not great.And more importantly, like you are going after Microsoft. And that's the only way Slack can succeed is you have to invest aggressively, you have to compete against Microsoft with Microsoft Teams. And it's been hard. Microsoft Teams has been, you know, competing incredibly well against Slack.And so if you think about all the time and effort that Salesforce would have to put into Slack to turn around the business, I think they're better off putting those efforts on the core sales service and marketing, and improving the products there, being more competitive, fending off the threats from upstarts like HubSpot, rather than spending all this time battling Microsoft because that's a tough battle. And realistically, over time, I think Salesforce will have to embrace more Microsoft services, especially as, you know, the ubiquity of generative AI and ChatGPT becomes more and more, you know, front and center.JULIE HYMAN: Really interesting stuff, Rishi. We'll check back in with you, of course, after we get the earnings report and as we get more from Salesforce. Appreciate your time, Rishi Jaluria, RBC Capital Market Software Equity Analyst, and our Brian Sozzi.]"

To skip our detailed analysis of the freest countries in the world, you can go directly to see the 5 Freest Countries In the World.Economists, including those working at the United Nations Development Programme, have established that it is not just economic indicators such as GDP per capita or the Consumer Price Index that are needed to be taken into account when judging the development and progression of a country. The UNDP's Human Development Report Office releases indices such as the Human Development Index and the Gender Inequality Index each year, where all nations of the world are ranked in factors that affect the everyday lives of the population. Some prominent companies that are working towards inclusivity and diversity include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).One of the most significant factors that influence an individual's quality of life is freedom, which is considered to be an inherent right for each individual. This freedom consists of personal freedom as well as economic freedom as individuals need the liberty to make choices along with the means to make choices. These choices will include freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of identity, freedom of movement, and many more.One way of judging freedom is by looking at the freedom of the press. According to a UNESCO report, 455 journalists were killed between 2016 and 2021 during their job. Another Reuters report in 2021 pointed out that violations of religious freedom and persecution are actively happening in more than 25 countries. North Korea has been given a  score of 3 out of 100 by the Freedom House based on the political rights and civil liberties provided to the citizens. Amnesty International has also called out Russia for restricting freedom of expression and assembly repeatedly. The country has passed a new law according to which using the term ""war"" for the Ukrainian invasion can lead to 15 years in jail.Story continuesOn the other hand, some countries have taken progressively larger steps to increase the rights and freedoms granted to people living within their territories. The World Press Freedom Index is a ranking established by Reporters Without Borders and highly ranks countries such as Norway, Sweden, Switzerland,  and Denmark for heavily protecting the right of free speech and allowing liberties to their journalists and press members.25 Freest Countries In the WorldAntonio Guillem/Shutterstock.comLet's now take a look at the 25 freest countries in the world. Our MethodologyThe Cato Institute in the United States and the Fraser Institute in Canada worked together to create the Human Freedom Index Report which takes 165 countries and territories into account and uses 82 metrics to use as indicators to judge human freedom. The two major categories it creates are personal freedom and economic freedom.In this article, we make use of the personal freedom scores given by this report which take into account 7 main criteria that consist of the rule of law, security and safety, movement, freedom of religion, freedom of expression, and metrics regarding civil society.We combine the personal freedom score with just the Business Freedom Index scores developed by The Heritage Foundation and take an average of the two scores according to which we have ranked the freest countries. Due to our use of this method, countries that have balanced high scores in both indexes have been ranked higher than countries that might have really high Personal Freedom Index scores but lower Business Freedom Index scores and vise versa.The reason for using business freedom scores and not the economic freedom scores that are a part of the Human Freedom Index report is that the economic freedom scores include metrics that are affected significantly by the macroeconomic conditions of the countries such as international relations and the size of the government. All these metrics are given equal weightage when this may not actually be the case in determining the freedom levels of a country.Freest Countries in the World25.

65,8e216d08-5dae-3110-a8e3-5bcd56d21683,MSFT,2023-02-28,A.I. is being ‘woven into the fabric’ of every tech company: Analyst,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/being-woven-fabric-every-tech-202956335.html,1677529796,VIDEO,"['MSFT', 'GOOG', 'GOOGL', 'SNAP']","[Jefferies Senior Analyst Brent Thill dissects the long-term A.I. trends being adopted by the tech industry, Snapchat's entrance into the A.I. race, and how competition between Microsoft and Google's A.I. investments continues to tighten.Video TranscriptJARED BLIKRE: All right, and let's get you up to speed on the AI arms race. Snap shares moving. Well, they were moving higher, and they're still moving higher but by just a little bit, about 73 basis points. That's after announcing today that they are entering the chat wars with a new OpenAI-powered bot for it's Snapchat Plus-- excuse me, Snapchat Plus subscribers.Joining us now with more on the AI hype is Brent Thill. He is a Jefferies senior analyst. Brent, always great to see you here. I want to direct everybody's attention to the YFi Interactive, which is an excerpt from the company's prospectus when they went public all these years ago. And it does say Snap is a camera company. That was a fad that they happened to jump on that bandwagon at the time. Not a lot came of that. Just wondering how deeply and how seriously are they taking the AI bandwagon this time.BRENT THILL: Yeah, I think-- look, every tech company is taking it serious, and it's being woven into the fabric of every major technology company we cover. So when you log on to Snap, you're going to be able to engage with a chat bot versus, you know, just seeing static news. When you log into your Microsoft PowerPoint, if you need a presentation built, it'll ask you how can I help you? and what can I do? To Google-- to every major tech company, Amazon, Apple.So, I mean, look, it's not a surprise. I don't think this changes the tone for them specifically, but I think ultimately everyone is trying to follow Microsoft's PR win, which they won the PR battle out of the gate with their announcements, and now everyone's playing catch up.So we expect the AI hype to continue. We do believe some of it's hype today. And we think ultimately, it is real, though. It's not total hype, but it's going to take time for this to produce revenue and profits for a lot of these tech companies.Story continuesBut make no mistake. Everyone in tech is chasing it, and if they don't have an AI strategy, they're going to be left on the side of the highway and get passed quickly. So again, I look at this, and I think a lot of this is initial hype, and the real meat of these announcements is still yet to come in many, many quarters, if not years, out from now.SEANA SMITH: Brent, you mentioned the hype here a couple of times. Do you think this excitement, though, around AI, is that justified up until this point? And you mentioned the fact that Microsoft now has this clear lead with the investment in OpenAI with ChatGPT. What about its competitors, Google, the ability there to catch up to Microsoft?BRENT THILL: Yeah, I look at the other way around. I mean, I really think that Microsoft is so far behind. I mean, look at the market share of Google versus Microsoft. And so when I say, you know, I think Microsoft won the PR battle, again, they have to prove the longevity of Bing.We ran a survey of a thousand consumers, and 4% said it was the default search. That means 96% were using Google. So I wouldn't call that catching up. I'd say that Microsoft's way behind, but ultimately that 4% is going into the low teens.And so again, this still has a long way to go. I do not believe Google is going to be left on the side of the highway on the AI race. We think that ultimately they have a great position.Remember, AI can't work unless you have a lot of users and a lot of content, and they have more users and content than Microsoft. And so if you think about ultimately their ability to play catch up and the PR side of this, I think they can do it. And I think from a technology perspective, they will do it.Right now, Wall Street is not giving Google credit. Everyone is saying Microsoft wins. Google loses. It's that simple. I think that's ridiculous. We've seen this in past hype waves when Steve Jobs was alive saying Adobe Flash is dead. Everyone thought Adobe was dead, and Adobe went from $30 to $700 in terms of the stock.So I like Google here. I think it's a great buy. I think the death to Google is greatly exaggerated by all this AI hype.And again, remember, you know, there are, like, many, many, many companies other than Microsoft that are using OpenAI to embed in the fabric of their own applications. So you have to say, well, is this Microsoft's technology or is it a partner's technology? And last time I checked, Google is building a lot of this organically.So I'm a huge fan of Google here. I think the reaction has been greatly overexaggerated where they're going to end up.SEANA SMITH: So then, Brent, maybe the better way to ask that question would have been how much will this help Microsoft then down the line? Because I was going through the results of your survey, and it was pretty fascinating. Just I know it was a small number of people who use Bing, but those who had tried the new Bing told you that they would make it their default search engine. Those who tried the new Bing, 86% said that they were very impressed. How much then do you see this potentially helping Microsoft on the search-engine front?BRENT THILL: No doubt this helps Microsoft, right? They have no share, so it puts them on the map on terms of the share. So you have to look at it from Microsoft, two angles, consumer and enterprise. On the consumer side, they badly need a kickstart. This will help them.Again, remember many of the consumer products that Microsoft has launched have been duds-- the Zune in music, their advertising business. They've written off many past acquisitions. What happened to Nokia on the handset side? Are they in the mobile-phone war? You know, they try, but they have not really had great success.On the enterprise side, I'm very bullish. And again, I was a Microsoft developer. That's how I got into this business. I am huge fan of what they can do in enterprise AI, which is company launches earnings like Workday tonight. We use the AI engine on Azure to basically take the key numbers out, compare and analyze, and we can do it quicker, faster, and make good decisions. I'm really bullish about that. That's still a long ways off.So I think ultimately you have to basically separate and say not all AI is created equal. Microsoft's going to have no doubt a win on the consumer side because they have no share, but I think the bigger win's going to come in the next several quarters if not years on the enterprise side where I'm more bullish. That's their fastball. That's what they're known for. And we are testing their products internally, and we are really excited about what it could do for us in our own jobs.And so, again, I separate it, and I think it's kind of a tale of two cities, if you will. I'm not negative on Microsoft. I think the consumer side will do well, again, just because they haven't really been, you know, on the map.But again, I think you have to go back to, do you need a five-day Tokyo trip planned by Bing? And I think the answer is no, I don't. Do I need basic weather? Do I need basic things? Google is giving that to you today.SEANA SMITH: Well, a five-day trip plan, it doesn't sound bad. It would save people a heck a lot of time. But, Brent, I definitely get what you were saying. Brent Thill, always great to have you. We'll look forward to having you back on the show again soon.]"

Here are a few candidates that you might consider discussing with your financial advisor.Walgreens Boots AllianceStock price as of Feb. 24, 2023: $35.80Walgreens Boots Alliance is a mouthful of a name, but it’s a great company for income investors. The pharmacy giant is better known to Americans through its Walgreens stores, but it also has a huge British presence under its Boots brand. The company has increased its dividend for 47 years in a row, making it a dividend aristocrat. Even with a quite high dividend yield of 5.31%, the company’s payout ratio is just 39.75%, leaving it ample room for future increases.In addition to its income potential, the stock has other factors to support it. Pharmacy companies are generally considered defensive, as consumers still need their products even during tough economic times.

Starbucks has accused the NLRB of misconduct and said the union failed to bargain in good faith by seeking to hold negotiations via video conference.ISS concluded that ""there seem to be credible reasons that may lend support to various accusations"" raised by Workers United, the NLRB and Starbucks.""Many allegations of wrongdoing and potential policychanges are ongoing and highly nuanced,"" ISS wrote. ""The proposed third-party assessment would benefit shareholders bycutting through some of the noise and helping them evaluate the company's management of any related risks.""The proposal, made by a group of investors including Trillium Asset Management and the New York City Public Pension Funds, asks the board to commission an independent assessment of Starbucks' ""adherence to its stated commitment to workers' freedom of association and collective bargaining rights"" for its corporate and licensed locations.Story continuesIn its proxy statement, the Starbucks board of directors recommended shareholders vote against the proposal because its minimum pay is already $15 an hour and it provides ""the highest-rated benefits in the country for full- and part-time hourly workers.""It is also expanding health insurance options, tuition coverage and other benefits, it said.Starbucks also said it ""commenced efforts to conduct a human rights impact assessment"" including labor rights, and that it expects to make the results available to shareholders.The ISS report does not recommend yes votes for any of the other shareholder proposals.(Reporting by Hilary Russ in New York; Additional reporting by Ananya Mariam Rajesh in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli and Angus MacSwan)]"

It's around $2 billion in the U.S. There's just a lot of noise in those numbers and I continue to think we're just getting started,"" said Peter McGuinness, who took the helm of the company last April.In 2022, Impossible Foods achieved record sales, including more than 50% dollar sales growth in retail. In 2022, though, it cut its workforce by 130 people to bring ""costs in line with revenue,"" McGuinness said.On Thursday, its top competitor Beyond Meat (BYND) reported a 21% decline in fourth-quarter revenue of $79.9 million, slighter higher than analyst expectations of $75.7 million.Many Wall Street analysts and experts call the rate of plant-based adoption an ""S-curve,"" one that slows down, picks up momentum quickly and then tapers off as growth slows. But McGuinness said, ""It's a little premature to talk about curves, or the end of a whole category, or call it a flop or fad.""Spicy Chicken Nuggets (COURTESY: Impossible Foods)Plant based meat doesn't work if it's just for 'upper income' Consumers' willingness to spend on plant-based protein is in question though.Historically, prices for plant-based options have been higher than those of animal meat. Amid infation, consumers have been opting for cheaper proteins like beef, poultry, and fish, which are now seeing a deceleration in inflation, though up 4.2% year-over-year in January.Impossible has been using this time to bring down its price tag to be in line with real meat.""We've gone down [in price] 21%"" over the past two years, McGuinness said, but ""we still have a gap to what I would call the private label cellophane...ground chuck, at the bottom of the well, but we've tightened that gap."" The average cost for ground chuck (100% beef) last month was $4.64, while a pound of Impossible at Target runs $6.29.Story continuesMcGuinness also hopes to change the perception plant-based proteins are for high-end consumers that have the capital to splurge.""Plant based meat doesn't work if it's an academic thing or it's a bi-coastal thing, or it's for upper income. It only works for maximum health benefit both people and planet, if it becomes mass and so that's part marketing, this part advertising, that's part awareness, it's part value proposition.""Innovation and partnerships are what the company considers gateways to meet new consumers.Its chicken nuggets are ""preferred three to one to the animal,"" he said making it a ""no brainer"" to add a spicier version this week.Restaurants provide ""great ways to introduce Impossible to more people,"" with partners like Burger King, Starbucks, Cheesecake Factory, and Cracker Barrel, among others, he said, and there are more on the way that the company ""just recently won.""In terms of outlook for 2023, growth is the name of the game for Impossible. It recently added a chief demand officer position, a new chief marketing &amp; creative officer, and a SVP of international.As far as if the company plans to go public anytime soon, McGuinness said probably not this year.""I wouldn't expect it, probably not.

But in three years the returns have been great. Indeed, the share price is up a very strong 110% in that time. So the recent fall in the share price should be viewed in that context. The thing to consider is whether the underlying business is doing well enough to support the current price.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. Check out our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During three years of share price growth, Archer-Daniels-Midland achieved compound earnings per share growth of 48% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 28% average annual increase in the share price. So one could reasonably conclude that the market has cooled on the stock. We'd venture the lowish P/E ratio of 10.28 also reflects the negative sentiment around the stock.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Archer-Daniels-Midland has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on how its financial position has changed over time.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Archer-Daniels-Midland the TSR over the last 3 years was 126%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Archer-Daniels-Midland has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 5.8% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 17% per year, is even more impressive. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Archer-Daniels-Midland better, we need to consider many other factors.

74,cf22eafe-120f-3e03-adfe-c5dae7e01b76,ADM,2023-02-28,Is Most-Watched Stock Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM) Worth Betting on Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/most-watched-stock-archer-daniels-140002635.html,1677506402,STORY,['ADM'],"[Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this agribusiness giant have returned -2.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1% change. During this period, the Zacks Agriculture - Operations industry, which ADM falls in, has lost 2.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, ADM is expected to post earnings of $1.71 per share, indicating a change of -10% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.74 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -14.1%. This estimate has changed +4.4% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.21 indicates a change of -7.9% from what ADM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +11.5%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for ADM.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for ADM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For ADM, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $23.69 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +0.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $99.88 billion and $100.7 billion estimates indicate -1.9% and +0.8% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryADM reported revenues of $26.23 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.6%. EPS of $1.93 for the same period compares with $1.50 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $26.22 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.03%. The EPS surprise was +17.68%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.ADM is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ADM. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

76,e7378c01-848f-3971-a680-96933ee9718c,LUV,2023-02-28,Bear of the Day: Southwest Airlines Co,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bear-day-southwest-airlines-co-090009464.html,1677574809,STORY,"['LUV', 'UAL']","[OverviewBased in Dallas, TX, Southwest Airlines LUV is a low-cost airline provider mainly servicing the United States and “ten near-international” markets. Southwest provides short-haul, high-frequency, point-to-point, low-fare services. The company’s point-to-point route structure includes services to and from many secondary or downtown airports such as Dallas Love Field, Houston Hobby, Chicago Midway, Baltimore-Washington International, and Ft-Lauderdale-Hollywood.Low Cost = Low PerformanceLow-cost carriers like Spirit Airlines SAVE and Southwest Airlines have been dramatically underperforming their larger peers such as United Airlines UAL.What is Behind the Underperformance?Unprofitable and moving in the wrong direction: In Q4, Southwest Airlines swung to a loss for the first time in three quarters. The 38-cent loss was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 3 cents. Adding to the disappointment, Southwest earned 14 cents a year ago.Operational Disruptions: Massive flight cancellations due to extreme winter weather conditions adversely impacted Southwest’s operations. Because Southwest is more focused on one part of the globe when compared to its larger counterparts, the company suffered more. Nearly 17,000 flights were cancelled in the last ten days of 2022 – equating to a pre-tax negative impact of approximately $800 million.In Fighting &amp; Bad Publicity: Southwest is known and loved by its customers because of the laid-back nature of its flight attendants and employees. This laissez faire attitude is that Southwest management has found that many customers appreciate a less stuffy environment. However, that may change soon. Southwest management and some 18,000 union workers have been in a contract dispute for months. In an era where workers are in high demand, this is not an encouraging sign for Southwest. Until management and the union come to an agreement, the stock is likely to be under pressure. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached, the low-cost carrier will likely face reputational damage and low employee morale.Story continuesMargins are Being Squeezed: Rising fuel and labor costs are causing Southwest’s financial efficiency to take a significant hit. In fact, LUV’s return-on-equity of 6.7% pales in comparison to the S&amp;P 500 Index’s 26.2%.Relative Weakness: When it comes to the stock market, price action = truth. Over the past six months, United Airlines is up 41.0%, while Southwest is down 10.4%Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConclusionProspective airline investors should avoid low-cost carriers, such as Southwest and instead opt for larger players such as United Airlines. Southwest has slower growth, shrinking margins, and notable reputational damage to contend with.

The S&amp;P 500, the Dow, and the Nasdaq posted their biggest weekly losses in 2023. For the week, the S&amp;P 500 slipped 2.7%, leading to its worst week since Dec 9.The Dow fell 3%, its fourth straight weekly loss, and registered its longest weekly losing streak since May 2022, added the Dow Jones Market Data. The blue-chip index also booked its worst weekly percentage drop since September 2022. The Nasdaq, too, finished 3.3% lower and registered weekly losses in two out of the last three weeks.So, what lead to a bloodbath on Wall Street? A hotter-than-expected Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge was primarily responsible for hurting the stock market. The personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index increased by 0.6% in January, way more than the 0.2% rise in December.Similarly, the PCE Index advanced 5.4% year over year last month from an increase of 5.3% in December. Excluding the volatile food and fuel prices, the PCE Index still increased and all the readings were higher than anticipated.Prices of gas, fuel, and shelter, to name a few, in reality, scaled upward, regrettably, at the beginning of 2023. The consumer price index (CPI) advanced by 0.5% in January and registered an annual gain of 6.4%, easily topping analysts’ expectations. The core CPI also increased by 0.4% last month and 5.6% year over year, more than what market pundits’ have forecast.Now, inflation remaining stubbornly higher this year despite showing some signs of ebbing in the latter half of last year has raised concerns that the Fed will continue to remain aggressive in its monetary policy stance. The central bank is expected to continue hiking interest rates to quell inflationary pressure.Most of the market participants at present expect the central bank to increase interest rates by 25 basis points in March as well as in May. Such a move will push the policy rate to reach 5.36% by mid-summer and could remain elevated at that level for the rest of 2023.Story continuesHowever, rate hikes increase the cost of borrowing, discourage consumers from spending, and deter economic growth, resulting in volatility in the stock market. Thus, currently, higher inflation leading to rate hike expectations eventually weighed on the markets.But investors shouldn’t panic! They should instead invest their hard-earned money in stocks that provide risk-adjusted returns, like NiSource Inc. NI, Spire Inc. SR, Conagra Brands, Inc. CAG and Philip Morris International Inc. PM.These stocks have a low beta (ranges from 0 to 1) and are dividend players. Hence, they have a solid business model and are less susceptible to market uncertainty. They are also non-cyclical in nature since they are part of the utility and consumer staples sectors. This makes them immune to market volatility. These stocks also boast a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.NiSource is an energy holding company and, together with its subsidiaries, provides natural gas, electricity, and other products and services in the United States.

79,10dbb48e-d1f0-3d97-b693-4821f64550df,PM,2023-02-28,7 Dynamite Dividend Stocks for Income and Growth in 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-dynamite-dividend-stocks-income-174609851.html,1677260769,STORY,"['CVX', 'LLY', 'AVGO', 'PM', 'MDLZ', 'V', 'RTX']","[Many long-term investors appreciate dividend stocks, for many reasons. Companies that pay back a portion of their profits to their shareholders via dividends are generally more reliable. Additionally, dividend stocks provide investors looking for income in retirement with a steady stream of passive income.Generally, dividends are typically issued by well-established, financially stable companies that are often household names. And the most dependable dividend stocks have long histories of distributing capital to their shareholders. That’s what many such investors focus on.With the market showing consistent improvement, dividend stocks are likely to provide growth and income in 2023. Investors can choose to reinvest their dividends back into a given stock, or can choose to receive the dividend payments as cash, which can provide a steady stream of income.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDividend-yielding companies tend to be financially healthy and stable over the long term. They tend to be wise investments anytime, especially in an upward-trending market.PMPhilip Morris$98.42LLYEli Lilly$323.35CVXChevron$161.00AVGOBroadcom$575.77RTXRaytheon$98.74VVisa$218.73MDLZMondelez$65.17Philip Morris (PM) An image of a cigarette and an e-cigarette side-by-side on a wood surface.Source: vfhnb12 / Shutterstock.comPhilip Morris (NYSE:PM) is a leading tobacco company known for the biggest cigarette brands. However, because Philip Morris operates in a highly-regulated industry and faces declining smoking rates, many investors could easily ignore it.That said, the company is pivoting into an evolving tobacco industry with a strategy that looks to give it a significant advantage over its competitors. That positioning and its substantial dividend make PM stock very potent.Let’s start with Philip Morris’ dividend. It yields around 5%, which is quite high. This dividend is also relatively stable, having last been reduced in 2008. In 2022, shareholders received $5.04 in dividend payments for each share of PM stock owned. Analysts expect PM stock to increase to $111 in the next 12-18 months, and it currently trades around $100 per share. So, there’s roughly a 15% upside baked into the stock, if analyst estimates are to be believed.Story continuesPhilip Morris is relying on growth from its smokeless tobacco brands, which have been profitable, while competitors rely more heavily on cigarettes for revenues even as smoking rates continue to decline.Eli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XISource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comInvestors should seriously consider Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) stock. The company develops and sells medications in various therapeutic areas, including diabetes, oncology, and immunology. Currently, its diabetes drug, Mounjaro, has investors excited.Overall, Eli Lilly appeals to investors seeking exposure to the pharmaceutical industry and a steady source of income. Those considering Eli Lilly note that this company is a highly-profitable, fast-growing, dependable dividend stock with a potent catalyst for future growth in Mounjaro.Eli Lilly boasts exceptionally high profitability metrics within a drug manufacturing industry known for increased profitability. Its gross, operating, and net margins exceed the 90th percentile of industry competitors. Further, the firm’s cost of capital is 3.5%, while it returns 21.55% on that capital.LLY stock provides a modest forward dividend yield around 1.4%. However, this distribution was last reduced in 1986, so it’s dependable. Lastly, Eli Lilly is seeking FDA approval to market the diabetes drug Mounjaro for weight loss. Sales of Mounjaro recently fell short of expectations, but the company still exceeded expectations and could take off when and if Mounjaro receives FDA approval.Chevron (CVX) Chevron logo on blue sign in front of skyscraper buildingSource: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comChevron (NYSE:CVX) is an American multinational energy corporation that has seen a very strong 2022. The company is among the world’s largest producers of oil and natural gas. Although Chevron had a strong 2022, challenges related to the volatility of commodity prices and environmental concerns make it somewhat volatile. But its dividend balances those concerns as a source of income. With its current lower price, Chevron looks like a buy.The energy sector was the strongest performer in 2022. Oil majors, including Chevron, Shell (NYSE:SHEL), and Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) profited more than $132 billion in 2022, returning $78 billion through buybacks and dividends. But investors have shied away from CVX, which has seen its stock price drop considerably of late. Concerns over environmental issues and an unclear situation in Ukraine are likely factors.That said, 2022 showed that oil demand will likely remain robust for a long time. That gives Chevron a potent catalyst moving forward as it continues to provide revenue for shareholders.Broadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office buildingSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.comBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock is a strong choice for investors seeking semiconductor exposure and dividends. The company designs, develop and sells semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. Its software is used across multiple industries, including telecommunications, data centers, and enterprise software.Broadcom offers investors growth and income. Currently, AVGO shares currently trade for $575 and carry an average target price of $665. AVGO’s dividend yielded 3.1% at last count, totaling $16.90 in dividends per share last year. Assuming Broadcom continues to pay $4.60 quarterly for all of 2023, it’ll reward investors with $18.40 of dividends in 2023. So, Broadcom’s value could grow to $683.40 per share, which equates to 14.86% growth.The company will re-release earnings on Mar. 2 after a strong 2022 in which revenues grew 21% to $33.2 billion. Broadcom’s net income growth was even more robust in 2022, growing by 70.65% and reaching $11.495 billion.Raytheon (RTX) Raytheon (RTX) defense company logo hanging from glass buildingSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comRaytheon (NYSE:RTX) stock represents a multinational aerospace and defense company that sells systems and services to commercial, military, and government customers worldwide. Its products include missile defense systems, radar, and communication systems.Raytheon has paid a dividend for several decades. However, it was reduced in 2021, so investors seeking rock-solid increases should beware. In any case, it provides reliable, if fluctuating, income to long-term investors.The company has strong growth prospects, including high demand for weapons orders tied to the Ukraine conflict. Additionally, with other geopolitical pressures coming out of China and other regions, there’s plenty to like about the company’s long-term prospects. Although revenues related to the war in Ukraine have been substantial, supply chain issues have hampered deliveries. That suggests Raytheon could move higher if and when those issues are sorted.Raytheon expects between $72 to $73 billion in sales for fiscal 2023. That would represent between 7.3% and 8.8% top-line growth over its 2022 results. Indeed, I think these numbers should entice investors as this growth rate would significantly outpace the company’s 4% growth seen between 2021 and 2022.Visa (V) several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comVisa (NYSE:V) is a multinational financial services corporation providing payment processing and digital payment solutions for individuals and businesses globally. The company is most notable for offering credit and debit cards but also provides payment gateway and risk management services.Visa shares include a dividend, yielding very modest 0.8%. So, it won’t provide substantial income or dividends that allow for any sort of significant share repurchases upon reinvestment. That said, the company’s dividend is highly-dependable, having last been reduced in 2008, and growing 17.4% over the last five years. In any case, Visa’s pricing upside is most attractive.The company’s Q1 revenue grew by 12%, with cross-border travel as a bright spot. Payments volume remained stable. Cross-border volume increased by 22%, suggesting that travel remains strong even as overall economic concerns remain substantial. Visa returned $4 billion to shareholders during the period as well.Mondelez (MDLZ) The Mondelez website magnified by a magnifying glassSource: ShutterstockLast on this list of dividend stocks to buy is Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ). This diversified consumer goods stock has impressive upside, a solid dividend, and ended 2022 on a strong note. Those factors should interest investors in the snack company that sells Oreos, Wheat Thins, Chips Ahoy!, and BelVita.Firstly, MDLZ stock has roughly a $10 upside above its current $66 price, according to analyst. This is among the dividend stocks I think is worth buying, despite its modest 2.3% yield. That’s because Mondelez has grown its revenue by 12.3% over the last five years. The math suggests plenty of appreciation for investors willing to buy now.Additionally, Mondelez’s performance leading into 2023 only strengthens that notion. Revenues increased 9.7% overall in 2022 and grew an even faster 13.5% rate in Q4.Mondelez’s organic revenue growth reached 12.3% in 2022 and 15.4% in Q4. Its core brands are performing well and should bolster investor confidence in MDLZ as an investment.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

81,0fdae087-9c44-37e4-89ff-f3fc0807be42,GS,2023-02-28,Goldman Sachs executives to rally investors in New York,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-executives-rally-investors-130517277.html,1677589517,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD']","[NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc's Chief Executive David Solomon and top executives will give investors an update on their strategy on Tuesday.Here are biographies of key leaders who will speak at the second investor day in the Wall Street firm's 154-year history. The speaker biographies are based on company documents, statements and Reuters sources.DAVID SOLOMON, CEO, 61Solomon has run the Wall Street powerhouse since October 2018. He succeeded Lloyd Blankfein, who steered the firm through the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath.Investors will assess Solomon's plan to broaden earnings growth beyond trading and dealmaking after the company lost billions on its foray into consumer banking.Goldman is pursuing a strategy that was first outlined to investors in 2020 to strengthen its core businesses and add to their market share.""We didn't get everything right,"" Solomon recently told investors at a conference. ""We didn't execute perfectly on everything, but we made a lot of progress.""Solomon, who DJs in his spare time, joined Goldman as a partner in 1999 from Bear Stearns. The CEO climbed the ranks in investment banking, in contrast with his predecessor, who rose through trading.JOHN WALDRON, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, 53John Waldron has been president and chief operating officer since October 2018. While the executive is seen as Solomon's closest lieutenant, market participants also view Waldron as a potential candidate for the top job when it comes up.Waldron oversees the heads of the bank's three main divisions. He previously served as co-head of investment banking, a role he assumed in 2014 after joining Goldman in 2000.Solomon and Waldron were among the executives whose pay was cut by millions in 2020 after a graft scandal at Malaysian state fund 1MDB prompted the bank to pay a record $2.9 billion in the U.S. to settle investigations.Solomon in a statement at the time said none of the past or current members of senior management were involved in, or aware of, the firm's participation in any illicit activity when Goldman arranged the Malaysian bond deals.Story continuesBut the company's board still reduced compensation for some senior executives in light of the findings of the government and regulatory investigations, as well as the magnitude of the total 1MDB settlement.DAN DEES, CO-HEAD OF GLOBAL BANKING &amp; MARKETS, 52Dan Dees is the co-head of Goldman's global banking and markets division. He relocated to San Francisco in early 2014 to become global co-head of the bank's technology, media and telecommunications group.In 2012, the executive was named co-head of investment banking for the Asia-Pacific region, excluding Japan. His tenure there coincided with the 1MDB bond sales.Dees joined Goldman in 1992 in New York and worked on its initial public offering from 1998 to 1999. He became a partner in 2004.MARC NACHMANN, GLOBAL HEAD OF ASSET AND WEALTH MANAGEMENT, 51Marc Nachmann heads the asset and wealth management unit, which oversees about $2.5 trillion in assets. He assumed the role in October after Goldman reorganized into three major units.Nachmann, who hails from Germany, previously served as co-head of markets and co-head of investment banking. He became a partner in 2004 after joining in 1994.The executive has appointed new leaders after Mike Koester, co-president of alternatives, and Sam Finkelstein, global head and chief investment officer of fixed income, said they would retire.STEPHANIE COHEN, GLOBAL HEAD OF PLATFORM SOLUTIONS, 45Stephanie Cohen is one the bank's highest-ranking female executives, heading its newly-formed Platform Solutions unit. She previously served as a co-head of the consumer and wealth management division.Cohen was formerly chief strategy officer, handling mergers, acquistions and partnerships. She was instrumental in Goldman's $1 billion pledge to invest in companies and money managers with diverse leadership.After joining as an analyst in 1999, Cohen became a partner in 2014.DENIS COLEMAN, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, 49Denis Coleman was promoted to finance chief last year after serving as co-head of the global financing group.The executive became a partner in 2008 and has worked across capital markets, investment banking and leveraged finance. Coleman joined Goldman Sachs in 1996 as an analyst.JULIAN SALISBURY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER OF ASSET AND WEALTH MANAGEMENT, 51Julian Salisbury is chief investment officer of Goldman's asset and wealth management unit. He was previously global co-head of Goldman Sachs Asset Management.Salisbury, who is British, has worked for the bank in London and Moscow. He joined Goldman Sachs in 1998, doing stints in research and product control. He became a partner in 2008.CAREY HALIO, CHIEF STRATEGY OFFICER AND HEAD OF INVESTOR RELATIONSCarey Halio is global head of investor relations. She has also served as the CEO of Goldman Sachs Bank USA and the company's deputy treasurer.Halio started at Goldman in 1999 as a summer associate. She was promoted to partner in 2016.KIM POSNETT, CO-HEAD OF ONE GOLDMAN SACHS, 45Kim Posnett is co-head of One Goldman Sachs, the company's program to unify its approach to clients across divisions. She is also global head of investment banking services.Posnett became a partner in 2016 after joining as an associate in 2005.(Reporting by Saeed Azhar; Editing by Lananh Nguyen and Sonali Paul)]"

The company had already halted unsecured lending as it stepped back from Main Street.Marcus was folded into the company's merged asset and wealth management arm last year. The newly-formed Platform Solutions unit houses transaction banking, credit cards and a fintech unit, GreenSky purchased for $2.2 billion in 2021.""We would like to see the sale or de-risking of the card and merchant point-of-sale units to a new buyer or majority-controlled partner,"" Kenneth Leon, research director at CFRA Research, wrote in a note.The consumer business that Solomon championed lost $3 billion in almost three years and its credit card business is being probed by regulators. Marcus's woes also weighed on fourth-quarter earnings, which fell well short of analyst expectations.""It makes sense that they would want to investigate all alternatives given the near-term drag on profitability these businesses are creating for the firm,"" said David Fanger, an analyst Moody’s Investors Service.Company president John Waldron and Stephanie Cohen, global head of the Platform Solutions unit, echoed Solomon's comments about the bank's consumer business, signalling a further retreat from its Main Street ambitions.Cohen said she expected Platform Solutions to break even on a pre-tax basis by 2025 after it lost $3 billion in nearly three years.The bank will aim to grow fees from asset and wealth management and drive better performance in its fintech unit, while taking more market share in its traditional powerhouses of trading and investment banking.Story continues""Sometimes we fall short,"" Solomon told investors at the company's New York headquarters. ""Sometimes we don't execute. But we always learn and adapt.""SHARES FALLGoldman shares fell 3.8% on Tuesday, trailing rivals. Some analysts blamed the lack of specificity about the bank's plans for the consumer business.After cutting 3,200 jobs this year, Goldman has stopped filling vacancies as employees leave, focusing instead on strategic hires, its finance chief Denis Coleman said. Those measures should reduce payroll costs by $600 million.Dan Dees, co-head of global banking and markets, said the division was targeting returns in the mid-teens and prioritizing financing across equities, fixed income, currency and commodities. The share of the financing had already grown to 22% of revenue last year from 12% in 2013.The bank also plans to slim down some alternative investments that weighed on profits last year.Goldman restated a longer-term target for return on tangible equity of 15% to 17% ""through the cycle"" and said it had ""significant"" room to grow market share for wealth management in the United States and globally.Separately, Solomon also warned in an interview with CNBC that operating in China will get tougher over the next couple of years, but added that the bank would continue to serve clients in the country.""It is a more 'cautious' time for investment in our own franchise,"" Solomon said.Looking ahead, Solomon said market sentiment had improved slightly, but clients were still concerned about persistent inflation weighing on the economy. Capital markets may improve in the second half of the year, but there are plenty of risks to the outlook, he said.Goldman has not said when it expects to complete its review of options for the consumer business.""We got a lot of questions on it in the room, and I know people are focused on it and quite interested in the next steps,"" Carey Halio, the company's chief strategy officer, told Reuters in an interview. ""We can't give any timeframe at this point, but obviously as soon as we have more information to share, we will.""(Reporting by Niket Nishant and Noor Zainab Hussain in Bengaluru and Saeed Azhar and Lananh Nguyen in New York; Additional reporting by Sinead Carew and Andrew Hofstetter; Editing by Arun Koyyur, Nick Zieminski and Anna Driver)]"

Its ROTE was 11% last year, missing analyst estimates, as rising interest rates prompted a sharp slowdown in dealmaking.Investors are awaiting a roadmap to profits for the bank's fintech unit, called Platform Solutions, formed after Goldman lost billions on its foray into consumer banking and reined in its ambitions. The pullback on costs could help the bank to meet its efficiency targets.Solomon's performance, and his plans for growth, will be scrutinized by investors and analysts. Observers will also focus on the CEO's plans to decrease Goldman's reliance on trading and investment banking, which can be whipsawed by market volatility.The bank has said it plans to slim down some alternative investments that weighed on profits last year.""Earnings could continue to be subdued for the next year or more, as the economic environment remains uncertain, which should pressure investment banking and asset management revenue,"" said Michael Wong, an analyst at Morningstar Inc.After a solid performance in recent years, Goldman's markets division could weaken in the short to medium term because ""trading is a wild card,"" he said.(Reporting by Saeed Azhar and Lananh Nguyen Editing by Nick Zieminski)]"

A Mattel executive said in a statement at the time that the company hoped to tap into the nostalgia surrounding the purple dinosaur, who graced TV screens from the '90s until the show went off the air in 2010.The cuts come about a month after competitor Hasbro said it would lay off 15% of its workforce, or about 1,000 employees. Hasbro posted a fourth-quarter loss of $129 million, with revenue down 17% compared with a year earlier.This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

Several key members of the Perrigo leadership team, including President and Chief Executive Officer, Murray S. Kessler, will share the Company's 2023 to 2025 Optimize and Accelerate strategic plan and corresponding financial objectives.Perrigo Company. (PRNewsfoto/Perrigo Company plc)Kessler commented, ""As a newly transformed consumer self-care company, our team is intensely focused on the next phase of our plan aimed at Optimizing our commercial operations through our Supply Chain Reinvention Program and Accelerating profitable growth through organic growth and successful integration of recent acquisitions. Collectively, these initiatives are expected to deliver returns that exceed our stated long-term growth algorithm of '3/5/7'1 through 2025, well above the average of our CPG peers. Concurrently, we intend to strengthen our balance sheet by reducing net leverage to less than 3x adjusted EBITDA2 by end of 2025, through a strong focus on earnings growth, cash conversion3 and further portfolio refinement as appropriate.  We believe these plans will build value for shareholders as we continue to Make Lives Better for those consumers who depend on Perrigo products.""In 2022, the Company completed its four-year transformation from a healthcare to a pure-play consumer self-care company through several major actions that can be summarized as:1. Reconfiguring Perrigo's product portfolio: Completed twelve transactions over the past four years, culminating with the acquisition of Héra SAS (""HRA Pharma"" or ""HRA"") in 2022. These actions transformed Perrigo into a pure-play consumer self-care company.2. Investing to restore growth and upgrade the Perrigo infrastructure: As a result, Perrigo delivered constant currency net sales compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2018 to 2022 of 7%, excluding divestitures, and organic net sales CAGR of 3%. This was achieved through the Company's strong new product pipeline that launched more than $600 million in innovation over the past four years. The Company also invested more than $130 million in information technology and global infrastructure, and built a strong eCommerce platform that achieved constant currency net sales CAGR, excluding divestitures, of 55% from 2018 to 2022.Story continues3. Reducing uncertainty: The Company successfully overcame and advanced several challenges, including a favorable settlement of the Irish Tax Notice of Assessment and by divesting the most volatile portions of its portfolio.Today, Perrigo is unveiling the details of its 3-year Optimize and Accelerate strategy at its Virtual Investor Day. Highlights include:1.  Why the Company firmly believes its self-care strategy is correct: Perrigo is extremely well positioned within this emerging sector as 1) national brands will continue to invest and build their brands, providing a long runway for store brand innovation, 2) consumer demographics remain favorable; as the global population ages there will be a greater need for OTC products, 3) further opportunities for Rx-to-OTC switches, and 4) the greater likelihood for increased Wall Street industry coverage that has the potential to add new investor interest to Perrigo.2.  How the Company plans to continue to grow organic net sales by 3% or more over the long-term: Perrigo has proven that it can consistently grow organic net sales by 3% and will share opportunities it has to refine its strategic growth pillars to continue driving growth through 1) adjacent market and product category penetration, 2) global expansion of key brands, 3) a robust pipeline of new products, especially in the high growth Women's Health and Skin Care categories, both new focus areas for the Company, and 4) making further investments in its high growth eCommerce business.3.  How Perrigo intends to build its adjusted gross margin to at least 40% over the next 3 years: The Company is utilizing a broad set of tools aimed at rebuilding and expanding adjusted gross margin through 1) its Global Supply Chain Reinvention Program that has the potential to deliver an annualized run-rate savings of $200 million to $300 million, excluding depreciation, by the end of 2028. Corresponding cash investments to achieve this run rate are expected in the range of $350 million to $570 million by the end of 2028, including $110 million for the 2022 acquisition of the Gateway infant formula plant and U.S. &amp; Canadian GoodStart® brand (""Gateway""), 2) successfully integrating the significantly margin accretive acquisition of HRA and achieving €50 million in synergies by the end of 2024 from, in part, shifting distribution of product from external third parties to Perrigo's in-house distribution and sales infrastructure, 3) successfully integrating the margin accretive acquisition of Gateway, and 4) benefits from the annualization of inflation-justified pricing actions taken in 2022 and partial normalization of the global supply chain, which is expected to reduce costs.4.  Perrigo's commitment to strong Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) &amp; Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) programs: The Company will continue to prioritize and set rigorous goals that the entire organization is committed to achieving, including 1) reducing the Company's impact on the environment, 2) increasing the use of inputs and packaging from recyclable and renewable sources, 3) ensuring all colleagues feel welcomed, valued, respected and heard, and 4) investing in health, education and the needs of the communities in which we work and live.5.  How the Company plans to reduce leverage while still growing its dividend and reinvesting in its business: The Company has a strong balance sheet, $601 million in cash as of December 31, 2022, and expects to generate $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion from operating cash flow and additional portfolio refinements through 2025. These proceeds are anticipated to fund dividend growth, reduce net leverage to less than 3.0x by the end of 2025, support investments to maintain asset reliability, and enable our Supply Chain Reinvention Program and business growth.6.  How the Optimize and Accelerate Strategic plan can translate into shareholder value creation: In addition to margin expansion, these collective actions should enable Perrigo to outperform its long-term 3/5/7 growth algorithm from 2023 to 2025, with: 7.  Issuing the Company's financial guidance for fiscal year 2023: (1) '3/5/7' – Perrigo's long-term growth algorithm annual target is to achieve 3% organic net sales growth, 5% adjusted operating income growth and 7% adjusted diluted earnings per share growth. (2) Net leverage is calculated using net estimated debt as of December 31, 2025, which assumes a $700M debt maturity in 2024 is paid off, divided by projected adjusted EBITDA for the 12 months ending December 31, 2025. As defined by the Company for this purpose, 'adjusted EBITDA' means earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, less restructuring charges, acquisition and integration-related charges, impairment charges, unusual litigation costs, gains and losses on divestitures and investment properties, and such other adjustments, if any, as may be made in accordance with the Company's policies and procedures then in effect relating to the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures. The Company cannot reconcile its expected adjusted EBITDA in 2025 to reported net income (loss) from continuing operations without unreasonable effort because certain items that impact net income (loss) cannot be reasonably predicted at this time.(3) Cash conversion defined as operating cash flow as a percentage of adjusted net income.Virtual Investor Day DetailsPerrigo's Virtual Investor Day 2023 will start today at 8:00 A.M.

All comparisons are against the prior year fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year, unless otherwise noted.President and CEO, Murray S. Kessler commented, ""Perrigo completed its transformation from a healthcare company to a pure play consumer self-care company early in 2022 with the closing of the HRA Pharma acquisition. And it was from the momentum that was created through this transformation that the Company was able to deliver constant currency double-digit top-line and adjusted bottom-line growth in 2022, including all-time net sales records for both our Americas and International businesses, a 500 basis point recovery in adjusted gross margin from the first quarter to the fourth, continued market share gains across the portfolio, and cash conversion of over 100%.""Kessler continued, ""Perrigo's strong year came behind an exceptionally strong fourth quarter that achieved 10% constant currency net sales growth and 33% constant currency adjusted diluted EPS growth along with adjusted gross margin up over 350 basis points versus year ago! I am so proud of how my Perrigo colleagues delivered these results, while at the same time navigating through unprecedented global supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, broad-based inflation, the Russia-Ukraine war, the infant formula shortage, and the continuing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. It's a testament to the resiliency and nimbleness of the new Perrigo Consumer Self-Care Company.""Kessler concluded, ""Equally impressive is the work our team did to advance the Company to the next phase of its long-term strategic plan, which we will share at our investor day tomorrow. At that virtual meeting, we will share our plan to Optimize and Accelerate the performance of the newly transformed Perrigo in order to deliver outsized profitable growth over the next 3 years.""Refer to Tables I - VI at the end of this press release for a reconciliation of non-GAAP adjustments to the current year and prior year periods and additional non-GAAP information.

Reported net sales were driven by 1) $72 million in constant currency net sales from the acquisition of HRA and $43 million from the acquisition of the U.S. &amp; Canadian GoodStart® infant formula brand, 2) $48 million in strategic pricing actions across both Consumer Self-Care segments, and 3) global category growth and U.S. brand and store brand share gains resulting in higher net sales across several Perrigo global product categories, including Upper Respiratory and Skin Care. These drivers also benefited from eCommerce growth and new product sales. Reported net sales growth was partially offset by 1) the impact of unfavorable currency translation of $55 million, 2) $25 million from the divestitures of the Latin American businesses and ScarAway® brand, 3) $16 million in lower net sales related to purposeful SKU prioritization to focus capacity on higher margin products as well as the exited distribution of product to Russia, and 4) lower year end inventories at certain U.S. retailers.Reported gross margin was 33.1%, a 30 basis points increase versus the prior year. Adjusted gross margin expanded 350 basis points versus the prior year quarter to 38.4% as benefits from higher margin acquisitions, strategic pricing actions, and positive mix driven in part by purposeful SKU prioritization to focus capacity on higher margin products in CSCA more than offset the impacts from inflation and productivity challenges.Fourth quarter reported operating income was $31 million, compared to $47 million in the prior year period, a decline of 34%. Adjusted operating income was $156 million, up $25 million, or 18.6% versus year ago. Constant currency adjusted operating income increased 24.9% driven by higher gross profit flow-through resulting from net sales growth and acquisitions. This positive impact from sales growth and acquisitions was partially offset by 1) a $33 million impact from inflation, including higher freight &amp; distribution expenses, and lower manufacturing productivity, 2) higher operating expenses, driven primarily by acquisitions, and 3) the unfavorable impacts from divested businesses and currency translation.Reported net loss was $13 million, or ($0.09) per diluted share, compared to reported net income of $32 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, in the prior year period. Excluding certain charges as outlined in Table I, fourth quarter 2022 adjusted net income was $102 million, or $0.75 per diluted share, compared to $82 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, in the prior year. Constant currency adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.80, an increase of 33.3% compared to prior year. Adjusted diluted EPS included a favorable tax benefit stemming from the release of reserves related to effectively settled positions or closed audit years, which was partially offset by a $0.02 negative impact from accelerating a portion of the estimated $0.18 - $0.20 one-time cost originally expected in 2023 to capture HRA distribution synergies that will benefit the Company in 2023 and beyond.Fourth Quarter 2022 Business Segment Results from Continuing OperationsConsumer Self-Care Americas SegmentFourth Quarter 2022 Net Sales Change Compared to Prior YearReported Net Sales Foreign ExchangeAdjustmentConstantCurrency NetSalesNet Acquisitions&amp; DivestituresAdjustmentOrganic Net SalesCSCA4.0 %0.1 %4.1 %(3.6) %0.5 %Reported net sales increased $30 million, or 4.0%, to a quarterly record of $766 million. Organic net sales increased 0.5%. Net sales growth was driven by acquisitions, strategic pricing actions, total category growth and market share gains versus national brands and other store brand competitors. This growth was partially offset by the impact from divested businesses and a 1.7 percentage point headwind from purposeful portfolio optimization to unlock capacity for higher margin products as part of the Company's Supply Chain Reinvention Program. Primary category drivers are provided below.Upper RespiratoryNet sales of $134 million decreased 2.6% due primarily to the launch of Nasonex®24HR and higher net sales of non-liquid cough/cold and allergy products, which were more than offset by the divested Latin American businesses, impacting growth by an unfavorable 3.6 percentage points in the quarter.NutritionNet sales of $144 million increased 32.3% due primarily to the acquisition of the U.S. &amp; Canadian GoodStart® infant formula brand and strong growth in contract infant formula and oral electrolytes.Digestive HealthNet sales of $132 million increased 0.8% due primarily to increased manufacturing capacity and demand for Polyethylene Glycol 3350, and new products, including Omeprazole Cool Mint and orange flavored Polyethylene Glycol 3350. Growth in the category was partially offset by an unfavorable 1.8 percentage points impact from the divested Latin American businesses.Pain &amp; Sleep-AidsNet sales of $103 million decreased 8.7% due primarily to lower net sales of adult pain products related to purposeful portfolio optimization to unlock capacity for higher margin products as part of the Company's Supply Chain Reinvention Program and the unfavorable impact of 5.7 percentage points from the divested Latin American businesses. These factors were partially offset by higher demand and shipments for children's analgesics products.Oral CareNet sales of $82 million decreased 2.6% due primarily to purposefully lost distribution of relatively lower margin products at a specific customer, partially offset by share gains resulting from broad strength in demand for the Company's offerings.Healthy LifestyleNet sales of $80 million decreased 2.2% due primarily to share gains in store brand smoking cessation products, which were more than offset by timing of shipments to customers.Skin CareNet sales of $49 million increased 10.8% due primarily to the addition of HRA brands, including Mederma® and Compeed®, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of 3.2 percentage points from divestitures of the Latin American businesses and ScarAway® brand.Women's HealthNet sales of $12 million increased 32.6% due primarily to the addition of HRA brands, including ella®. Vitamins, Minerals, and Supplements (VMS) and OtherNet sales of $29 million increased 11.2% due primarily to higher sales of science-based natural products.Reported gross margin was 30.3%, a 370 basis points increase versus the prior year quarter. Adjusted gross margin expanded 420 basis points versus the prior year quarter to 31.6% as strategic pricing actions, positive mix driven in part by purposeful SKU prioritization to focus capacity on higher margin products, and benefits from higher margin acquisitions more than offset the impacts from inflation and productivity challenges.Reported operating income was $126 million compared to operating income of $93 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted operating income increased $34 million to $144 million due primarily to record quarterly gross profit resulting from net sales growth and acquisitions. These factors were partially offset by 1) a $25 million unfavorable impact from inflation, including higher freight &amp; distribution expenses, and lower manufacturing productivity, 2) higher operating expenses, driven primarily by the inclusion of acquisitions, and 3) the impact of divested businesses.Consumer Self-Care International SegmentFourth Quarter 2022 Net Sales Change Compared to Prior YearReported Net Sales Foreign ExchangeAdjustmentConstantCurrency NetSalesNet Acquisitions&amp; DivestituresAdjustmentOrganic Net SalesCSCI5.7 %14.8 %20.5 %(17.2) %3.3 %CSCI reported net sales of $390 million increased $21 million, or 5.7%, constant currency net sales increased 20.5% and organic net sales increased 3.3%. Net sales growth was driven by the acquisition of HRA, strategic pricing actions and maintaining market share in growing categories. Growth was partially offset by unfavorable currency translation, lower sales volumes particularly in the Healthy Lifestyle category, and a 0.8 percentage point headwind from the exited distribution business in Russia. Primary category drivers are provided below.Skin CareNet sales of $90 million increased 21.8%, or 40.7% excluding the impact of currency, driven primarily by the addition of HRA brands, including Compeed®, new products in the ACO skincare line and higher net sales of anti-parasite offerings that are outpacing strong category growth.Upper RespiratoryNet sales of $74 million decreased 9.5%, or an increase of 2.3% excluding the impact of currency, led by increased demand for traditional cough/cold products, including Bronchostop, Coldrex and Bronchonolo, stemming from a strong cough/cold and flu season.Vitamins, Minerals, and Supplements (VMS)Net sales of $46 million decreased 16.3%, or 5.9% excluding the impact of currency, due primarily to strong performance of VMS products in 2021 stemming from a spike in demand related to the COVID pandemic. This was partially offset by solid performance of Abtei in Germany.Women's HealthNet sales of $32 million increased 155.6%, or 191.1% excluding the impact of currency, due primarily to the addition of HRA brands, including ellaOne® and NorLevo®.Pain &amp; Sleep-AidsNet sales of $52 million decreased 2.2%, or an increase of 11.0% excluding the impact of currency, due primarily to higher demand for Solpadeine, an analgesics product.Healthy LifestyleNet sales of $31 million decreased 20.1%, or 9.5% excluding the impact of currency, due primarily to lower category consumption in weight management and smoking cessation, impacting XLS Medical and NiQuitin, respectively.Oral CareNet sales of $24 million increased 0.4%, or 13.7% excluding the impact of currency, due primarily to  double-digit growth in store brand oral care products.Digestive Health and OtherNet sales of $41 million increased 36.4%, or 54.6% excluding the impact of currency, due primarily to the addition of the HRA Rare Diseases portfolio in the Other category.Reported gross margin was 38.6%, a 660 basis points decrease versus the prior year quarter. Adjusted gross margin expanded 210 basis points versus the prior year quarter to 51.8% as benefits from higher margin acquisitions, strategic pricing actions and higher margin new products more than offset the impacts from inflation and productivity challenges.Reported operating loss was $49 million for the quarter compared to reported operating income of  $13 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income decreased $6 million, or 10.5%, to $54 million. Constant currency adjusted operating income increased 2.3% as higher gross profit flow-through resulting from net sales growth and the addition of HRA were partially offset by higher operating expenses, primarily from the inclusion of HRA, and an unfavorable $8 million impact from inflation and lower manufacturing productivity.Fiscal Year 2022 Perrigo Results from Continuing OperationsFiscal Year 2022 Net Sales Change Compared to Prior YearReported Net Sales Foreign ExchangeAdjustmentConstantCurrency NetSalesNet Acquisitions&amp; DivestituresAdjustmentOrganic Net SalesCSCA8.6 %0.1 %8.7 %0.8 %9.5 %CSCI5.5 %15.0 %20.5 %(13.0) %7.5 %Total Perrigo7.6 %5.2 %12.8 %(4.2) %8.8 %Reported net sales of $4.5 billion increased $313 million, or 7.6%, constant currency net sales increased 12.8% and organic net sales increased 8.8%. Reported net sales were driven by 1) $217 million in constant currency net sales from the acquisition of HRA and $43 million from the acquisition of the U.S. &amp; Canadian GoodStart® infant formula brand, 2) $156 million in strategic pricing actions across both Consumer Self-Care segments, 3) global category growth and U.S. brand and store brand share gains resulting in higher net sales across several Perrigo product categories, including Upper Respiratory, Nutrition and Skin Care, and 4) $62 million from an incremental six months of contract manufacturing sales to the divested RX business, which closed on July 6, 2021. These drivers also benefited from eCommerce growth and new product sales. These increases were partially offset by 1) unfavorable impacts from currency translation of $217 million and $86 million from divestitures of the Latin American businesses and ScarAway® brand, and 3) lower net sales in the Healthy Lifestyle and VMS categories.Reported gross margin was 32.7%, a 150 basis points decrease versus the prior year. Adjusted gross margin of 36.2% decreased 30 basis points compared to the prior year as strategic pricing actions and benefits from higher margin acquisitions were more than offset by the impacts from inflation, productivity challenges and product mix.Fiscal year 2022 reported operating income decreased $332 million to $79 million, compared to $410 million in 2021, due primarily to the absence of $418 million from the Omega arbitration award received in the prior year partially offset by the absence of $173 million of prior year impairment charges primarily related to the divested Latin American businesses. Excluding certain charges as outlined in Table I, adjusted operating income increased $13 million to $492 million in 2022. This increase was driven by higher gross profit flow-through resulting from net sales growth and acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by 1) a $139 million impact from inflation, including higher freight &amp; distribution expenses, and lower productivity, 2) higher operating expenses, driven primarily by acquisitions and employee expenses, and 3) the unfavorable impacts from divested businesses and currency translation.Reported net loss was $131 million, or a loss of $0.97 per diluted share, versus reported net loss of $131 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, in the prior year.

These statements relate to future events or the Company's future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements of the Company or its industry to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as ""may,"" ""will,"" ""could,"" ""would,"" ""should,"" ""expect,"" ""forecast,"" ""plan,"" ""anticipate,"" ""intend,"" ""believe,"" ""estimate,"" ""predict,"" ""potential"" or the negative of those terms or other comparable terminology. The Company has based these forward-looking statements on its current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections. While the Company believes these expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections are reasonable, such forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company's control, including: the effect of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and its variants; supply chain impacts on the Company's business, including those caused or exacerbated by armed conflict, trade and other economic sanctions and/or disease; general economic, credit, and market conditions; the impact of war between Russia and Ukraine and any escalation thereof, including the effects of economic and political sanctions imposed by the United States, United Kingdom, European Union, and other countries related thereto; the outbreak or escalation of conflict in other regions where we do business; future impairment charges, if we determine that the carrying amount of specific assets may not be recoverable from the expected future cash flows of such assets; customer acceptance of new products; competition from other industry participants, some of whom have greater marketing resources or larger market shares in certain product categories than the Company does; pricing pressures from customers and consumers; resolution of uncertain tax positions, including the Company's appeal of the draft and final Notices of Proposed Assessment (""NOPAs"") issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or any litigation relating thereto, ongoing or future government investigations and regulatory initiatives; uncertainty regarding the timing of, and the Company's ability to obtain and maintain, certain regulatory approvals, including the sale of daily over-the-counter oral contraceptives; potential costs and reputational impact of product recalls or sales halts; potential adverse changes to U.S. and foreign tax, healthcare and other government policy; the timing, amount and cost of any share repurchases (or the absence thereof); fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates; the Company's ability to achieve the benefits expected from the sale of its Rx business and the risk that potential costs or liabilities incurred or retained in connection with that transaction may exceed the Company's estimates or adversely affect the Company's business or operations; the Company's ability to achieve the benefits expected from the acquisition of Héra SAS (""HRA Pharma"") and/or the risks that the Company's synergy estimates are inaccurate or that the Company faces higher than anticipated integration or other costs in connection with the acquisition; risks associated with the integration of HRA Pharma, including the risk that growth rates are adversely affected by any delay in the integration of sales and distribution networks; the consummation and success of other announced and unannounced acquisitions or dispositions, and the Company's ability to realize the desired benefits thereof; and the Company's ability to execute and achieve the desired benefits of announced cost-reduction efforts and other strategic initiatives and investments, including the Company's ability to achieve the expected benefits from its Supply Chain Reinvention Program. An adverse result with respect to the Company's appeal of any material outstanding tax assessments or pending litigation could have a material adverse impact on the Company's operating results, cash flows and liquidity, and could ultimately require the use of corporate assets to pay such assessments, damages from third-party claims, and related interest and/or penalties, and any such use of corporate assets would limit the assets available for other corporate purposes. There can be no assurance that the FDA will approve the sale of daily oral contraceptives without a prescription in the United States. These and other important factors, including those discussed under ""Risk Factors"" in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as well as the Company's subsequent filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this press release are made only as of the date hereof, and unless otherwise required by applicable securities laws, the Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.Non-GAAP MeasuresThis press release contains certain non-GAAP measures. A ""non-GAAP financial measure"" is defined as a numerical measure of a company's financial performance that excludes or includes amounts different from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the statements of operations, balance sheets or statements of cash flows of the Company. Pursuant to the requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company has provided reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures for the following non-GAAP financial measures referred to in this press release:net sales growth on an organic basis, which excludes acquisitions, divested businesses, and the impact of currency,adjusted gross profit,adjusted net income,adjusted operating income,adjusted diluted earnings per share,constant currency adjusted diluted earnings per share,adjusted gross margin,adjusted operating margin, andcash conversion ratioThese non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as supplements to the GAAP reported measures, should not be considered replacements for, or superior to the GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies.The Company provides non-GAAP financial measures as additional information that it believes is useful to investors and analysts in evaluating the performance of the Company's ongoing operating trends, facilitating comparability between periods and, where applicable, with companies in similar industries and assessing the Company's prospects for future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude items, such as impairment charges, restructuring charges, and acquisition and integration-related charges, that by their nature affect comparability of operational performance or that we believe obscure underlying business operational trends. The intangible asset amortization excluded from these non-GAAP financial measure represents the entire amount recorded within the Company's GAAP financial statements and is excluded because the amortization, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised. The revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure. The non-GAAP measures the Company provides are consistent with how management analyzes and assesses the operating performance of the Company, and disclosing them provides investor insight into management's view of the business. Management uses these adjusted financial measures for planning and forecasting in future periods, and evaluating segment and overall operating performance. In addition, management uses certain of the profit measures as factors in determining compensation.Non-GAAP measures related to profit measurements, which include adjusted gross profit, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted EPS, constant currency adjusted diluted EPS, adjusted operating income, adjusted gross margin and adjusted operating margin are useful to investors as they provide them with supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the Company's underlying business performance and trends, and enhance the ability of investors and analysts to compare the Company's period-to-period financial results. Management believes that adjusted gross margin and adjusted operating margin are useful to investors, in addition to the reasons discussed above, by allowing them to more easily compare and analyze trends in the Company's peer business group and assisting them in comparing the Company's overall performance to that of its competitors. As noted, for the first quarter of 2021, these adjusted profit measures exclude certain stranded costs, such as those related to corporate and shared service functions related to the RX business. Under GAAP, these stranded costs are reported within continuing operations, but were previously allocated to the RX business. We exclude these costs from all adjusted profit measures, as we do not believe they are representative of the future run-rate of expenses of our continuing operations. The Company also discloses net sales growth excluding the impact of currency on an organic basis. The Company believes these supplemental financial measures provide investors with consistency in financial reporting, enabling meaningful comparisons of past and present underlying operating results, and also facilitate analysis of the Company's operating performance and acquisition and divestiture trends.A copy of this press release, including the reconciliations, is available on the Company's website at www.perrigo.com. PERRIGO COMPANY PLCCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS(in millions, except per share amounts)(unaudited)Year EndedDecember 31,2022December 31,2021December 31,2020Net sales$             4,451.6$             4,138.7$             4,088.2Cost of sales2,996.22,722.52,593.3Gross profit1,455.41,416.21,494.9Operating expensesDistribution113.093.085.1Research and development123.1122.0121.7Selling584.8536.4545.5Administration512.3482.0478.5Impairment charges—173.1—Restructuring42.516.93.2Other operating expense (income), net0.8(417.6)(4.3) Total operating expenses1,376.51,005.81,229.7Operating income78.9410.4265.2Change in financial assets——95.3Interest expense, net156.0125.0127.7Other (income) expense, net53.126.716.3Loss on extinguishment of debt8.9—20.0 Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes(139.1)258.75.9Income tax expense (benefit)(8.2)389.6(38.3)Income (loss) from continuing operations(130.9)(130.9)44.2Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax(9.7)62.0(206.8) Net income (loss)$              (140.6)$                (68.9)$              (162.6)Earnings (loss) per shareBasic Continuing operations$                (0.97)$                (0.98)$                  0.32 Discontinued operations$                (0.07)$                  0.46$                (1.52) Basic earnings per share$                (1.04)$                (0.52)$                (1.20)Diluted Continuing operations$                (0.97)$                (0.98)$                  0.32 Discontinued operations$                (0.07)$                  0.46$                (1.51) Diluted earnings per share$                (1.04)$                (0.52)$                (1.19)Weighted-average shares outstandingBasic134.5133.6136.1Diluted134.5133.6137.2 PERRIGO COMPANY PLCCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS(in millions, except per share amounts)(unaudited)December 31,2022December 31,2021AssetsCash and cash equivalents$                600.7$             1,864.9Accounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses of $6.8 and $7.2, respectively697.1652.9Inventories1,150.31,020.2Prepaid expenses and other current assets271.8305.8Current assets held for sale—16.1Total current assets2,719.93,859.9Property, plant and equipment, net926.3864.1Operating lease assets217.1166.9Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets3,549.03,004.7Definite-lived intangible assets, net3,230.22,146.1Deferred income taxes7.16.5Other non-current assets367.7377.5Total non-current assets8,297.46,565.8Total assets$          11,017.3$          10,425.7Liabilities and Shareholders' EquityAccounts payable$                537.3$                411.2Payroll and related taxes136.4118.5Accrued customer programs139.1125.6Other accrued liabilities250.2279.4Accrued income taxes14.416.5Current indebtedness36.2603.8Current liabilities held for sale—32.9Total current liabilities1,113.61,587.9Long-term debt, less current portion4,070.42,916.7Deferred income taxes368.2239.3Other non-current liabilities623.0530.1Total non-current liabilities5,061.63,686.1Total liabilities6,175.25,274.0Contingencies -

97,f1dff30d-7300-33c9-966f-af46e8a1b898,HOLX,2023-02-28,BD's (BDX) New FDA Approval to Improve Cervical Cancer Testing,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bds-bdx-fda-approval-improve-154903133.html,1677512943,STORY,['HOLX'],"[Becton, Dickinson and Company BDX, popularly known as BD, recently received the FDA’s approval for the BD Onclarity HPV (human papillomavirus) Assay to be used with the ThinPrep Pap Test. The two most common Pap vials currently used by laboratories in the United States are the BD SurePath Liquid-based Pap Test vial and the Hologic ThinPrep Pap Test PreservCyt Solution vial.The ThinPrep Pap Test with the BD Onclarity HPV Assay can be used on the BD COR or BD Viper LT instrument platforms without the need to change current cytology equipment.The BD Onclarity HPV Assay has received the FDA’s approval for use in vaccinated women. As the previously vaccinated sub-population ages, the screening population will progressively include women with reduced prevalence of HPV 16 and 18. This is expected to increase the value of extended genotype reporting in a mixed population of vaccinated and unvaccinated women.The BD Onclarity HPV Assay detects and identifies 14 high-risk HPV types in a single analysis.The latest regulatory approval is expected to solidify BD’s foothold in the global Molecular Diagnostics business, thereby boosting its overall Life Sciences segment.Significance of the ApprovalThe inclusion of the ThinPrep Pap Test is expected to improve access to the benefits of the BD HPV assay, which is the only FDA-approved assay that tests for an extended set of HPV types individually and particularly for HPV31 (a specific type of HPV that poses a high risk for causing cervical cancer). Individual identification of HPV31 will likely help better determine risk for cervical pre-cancer, which may lead healthcare providers to different clinical decision-making, unlike when assessing risk when multiple genotypes are reported collectively.Per management, as most tests report multiple HPV types in a single pooled result, it may mask the true risk of developing cervical cancer. Hence, management believes that being able to identify high-risk HPV31 individually is critical to the detection and prevention of cervical cancer. Per estimates, HPV31 poses the second-highest risk for cervical pre-cancer, and the BD Onclarity HPV Assay is the only FDA-approved assay that screens for it individually.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global molecular diagnostics market is anticipated to reach $30.2 billion by 2027 from $23.2 billion in 2022 at a CAGR of 5.4%. Factors like the emergence of new viruses, technological advancements in molecular diagnostics and the growing awareness of early disease diagnosis are likely to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest regulatory clearance is expected to significantly strengthen BD’s business worldwide.Recent Developments in the Life Sciences ArmThis month, BD received the FDA’s Emergency Use Authorization for a new molecular diagnostic combination test for SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A + B and Respiratory Syncytial Virus — BD Respiratory Viral Panel assay for BD MAX System. The test, for use on the BD MAX Molecular Diagnostic System, is expected to aid in combatting illness in the current and future respiratory virus seasons.Also, this month, BD announced a new instrument for single-cell multiomics analysis that will enable scientists to run high-throughput studies without compromising sample integrity. This is expected to potentially accelerate time to discovery across a wide range of disciplines, including immunology, genetic disease research and cancer and chronic disease research.Again, in February, BD reported its first-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein it registered an improvement in the overall base revenues. BD Life Sciences segment saw the Integrated Diagnostic Solutions unit’s strong growth in the base business (driven by strong demand for BD’s respiratory testing portfolio, which was partly aided by the timing of dealer orders, strong BD Kiestra lab automation installations and leveraging its higher BD MAX installed base for molecular In Vitro Diagnostic assay growth) and strength in the Biosciences unit.Price PerformanceShares of BD have lost 12.3% in the past year compared with the industry’s 8.3% decline and the S&amp;P 500's 10.9% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Other Key PicksCurrently, BD carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

The eight-episode series will premiere May 25.Fubar will see Schwarzenegger star as a former CIA operative who learns his daughter has become one as well when the two are forced to join forces. The series will strive to reproduce the mix of action and humor that Schwarzenegger’s string of hits in the late 1980s and 1990s were known for.“Everywhere I go, people ask me when I’m going to do another big action comedy like True Lies. Well, here it is,” Schwarzenegger said in a statement. “Fubar will kick your ass and make you laugh—and not just for two hours. You get a whole season.”Schwarzenegger is far removed from his days as a leading actor, but with box office grosses of more than $4 billion over the course of his career and several franchises to his name, he’s still a major star.The Fubar trailer shows him in familiar territory, smoking cigars, firing weapons, skirting corners on a motorcycle, and walking away from an actual dumpster fire.In addition to leading the series, Schwarzenegger will serve as a producer on Fubar.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. International Game Technology (IGT) earns a Zacks Rank #1 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.40 a share, just one day from its upcoming earnings release on February 28, 2023.IGT has an Earnings ESP figure of 20%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.40 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.33.IGT is part of a big group of Consumer Discretionary stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Netflix (NFLX) as well.Netflix is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on April 18, 2023. NFLX's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.82 a share 50 days from its next earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Netflix is $2.81, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.24%.Story continuesIGT and NFLX's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.One company value investors might notice is Marathon Petroleum (MPC). MPC is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value.Investors should also note that MPC holds a PEG ratio of 0.28. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. MPC's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 0.58. Over the last 12 months, MPC's PEG has been as high as 1.23 and as low as 0.19, with a median of 0.33.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is MPC's P/B ratio of 1.79. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. MPC's current P/B looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/B of 2.03. MPC's P/B has been as high as 2.03 and as low as 1.21, with a median of 1.58, over the past year.Finally, our model also underscores that MPC has a P/CF ratio of 3.30. This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook. This company's current P/CF looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 4.26. Over the past 52 weeks, MPC's P/CF has been as high as 4.93 and as low as 2.91, with a median of 3.70.Story continuesAnother great Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing stock you could consider is Phillips 66 (PSX), which is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value Score of A.Phillips 66 is currently trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 6.74 while its PEG ratio sits at 0.34. Both of the company's metrics compare favorably to its industry's average P/E of 5.77 and average PEG ratio of 0.58.Over the last 12 months, PSX's P/E has been as high as 11.94, as low as 5.19, with a median of 7.43, and its PEG ratio has been as high as 1.06, as low as 0.30, with a median of 0.61.Additionally, Phillips 66 has a P/B ratio of 1.42 while its industry's price-to-book ratio sits at 2.03. For PSX, this valuation metric has been as high as 2.40, as low as 1.15, with a median of 1.62 over the past year.These are only a few of the key metrics included in Marathon Petroleum and Phillips 66 strong Value grade, but they help show that the stocks are likely undervalued right now.

107,52de7e91-5ad3-341b-a707-ab0bd994122f,AMGN,2023-02-28,Top 10 Drug Companies in USA and Their China Reliance,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-10-drug-companies-usa-211157534.html,1677532317,STORY,"['REGN', 'LLY', 'ABT', 'GILD', 'AMGN', 'JNJ', 'PFE', 'ABBV']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the top 10 drug companies in USA and their China reliance. To skip our detailed analysis of the pharmaceutical sector, you can go directly to see the Top 5 Drug Companies in USA and Their China Reliance.The US has long been reliant on China for the upkeep of several industries. The most notable of these industries are the semiconductor and healthcare sectors. With the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, America's widespread reliance on China became increasingly evident because of a sharper light being shed on US-Chinese manufacturing and supply chains. With the pandemic first breaking out in China and reducing exports from the Asian country to others, shortages of critical medical supplies in the US made the latter's heavy reliance on the former clearer than ever.Top US drug producers such as Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) were found to be just as heavily reliant on China as smaller medical companies. Many American drug companies have manufacturing and supply chain infrastructure set up in China, causing this reliance. According to a report published by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean in  2021, the US imported about $105.32 billion worth of medical products and equipment, including medical imaging, diagnostic, and oxygen therapy equipment, in 2019 alone. China was recorded as the second-largest supplier of these products and equipment. During the first nine months of 2020, pharmaceutical imports from China to the US increased by 46%, with 69% of the imports being active pharmaceutical ingredients and 27% of the imports being pharmaceutical preparation products.President Biden has been taking steps to curb the US reliance on China when it comes to the healthcare sector and elsewhere. In September 2022, Biden signed an executive order to boost domestic manufacturing in the biotech sector to increase American self-sufficiency in this area. However, it is unclear how this objective can be attained since China is a major manufacturer of active pharmaceutical ingredients to India, which is conversely a major supplier of generic drugs to the US. Ever since China acceded to the World Trade Organization in 2001, it began focusing on economic growth through the expansion of its pharmaceutical industry. As a result of this, the country devoted itself to producing basic chemicals and active pharmaceutical ingredients. Consequently, it is unsurprising that the country today is a lead supplier of these ingredients by volume in the global market. In some markets specifically, China has increased its share of the US import markets. For instance, the market for penicillin saw an increase in the Chinese share from 1% to 51%, while the antibiotics market saw an increase of the country's share from 15% to 37%. This increase occurred over the 10 years preceding 2021. As the situation currently stands, it will be difficult for the US to disengage itself from the Chinese manufacturing and supply chain infrastructure. Hence, many major American companies have a huge stake in the Chinese pharmaceutical market, leading to their increased presence in the country.Story continuesTop 10 Drug Companies in USA and Their China ReliancePhoto by Christina Victoria Craft on UnsplashLet's now take a look at the top 10 drug companies in USA and their China reliance.Our MethodologyWe have selected pharmaceutical companies in the US with the highest revenues in the sector as of 2021 and a strong reliance on China. They are ranked based on these revenues, from the lowest to the highest. These companies are heavily reliant on China since they source a variety of their raw materials from the country. They also have a large presence in the Chinese market, making China one of their most profitable consumer markets to date.

In our list below, we go over key business fundamentals for these companies as well, such as their latest profit margins.Top Drug Companies in USA and Their China Reliance10. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN)Total Revenue in 2021: $16.07 billionRegeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

(NASDAQ:REGN) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“There have been some bright spots in our long book. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN), a major position and a stock we wrote up in our June 2021 letter, has been one of the best performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 this year. Alas it has not been enough to offset some of our weaker stocks, let alone our overweight exposure to the UK (and Europe) which have suffered from both stock and currency weakness. We do not think we are bad at picking stocks on the long side and hope – reasonably we think – for better relative results in the future. Prior to COVID, our longs were markedly better than the index. Unfortunately, if you look at our long book this quarter and since the onset of the COVID pandemic, there is scant evidence that we have added any value by picking stocks to go long.”9. Amgen, Inc.

The detailed findings increased investor confidence the drug would receive incremental approvals for a broader range of breast cancer treatments. Shares also received a boost on news the TAF patent portfolio for HIV drugs will be extended from the middle of this decade through the early 2030s, thereby lengthening the company’s long-term opportunity in the virology market.”Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD), like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), is among the most successful American drug companies with high revenue generation.7.

This hurts the reported earnings of U.S. companies who sell their goods and services overseas. Foreign currency earnings translate into fewer dollars and thus lower earnings. Most of the companies in your portfolios gain a notable amount of earnings from their international operations. While the strength or weakness of a currency doesn’t change the quality of a business or its longer-term earnings power, it can change the reported earnings of a company over short periods of time. It is difficult to forecast this effect accurately because many of our companies manufacture where they sell, which to some extent dulls the sharp negative effect of a surging dollar. Abbott (NYSE:ABT), among others, is a good example.”Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this gold and copper miner have returned -18.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1% change. The Zacks Mining - Miscellaneous industry, to which Newmont belongs, has lost 12.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Newmont is expected to post earnings of $0.50 per share, indicating a change of -27.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.7% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.45 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +32.4%. This estimate has changed +3% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.60 indicates a change of +6.2% from what Newmont is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -8.5%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Newmont.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NEM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Newmont, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.94 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -2.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $12.2 billion and $12.41 billion estimates indicate +2.4% and +1.8% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNewmont reported revenues of $3.2 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -5.6%. EPS of $0.44 for the same period compares with $0.78 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.92 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +9.57%. The EPS surprise was -6.38%.The company could not beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Newmont is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Newmont. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Both instruments recovered from a two-month low on Monday.Focus this week is on U.S. Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) readings for February, which are expected to show some cooling in economic activity as the world’s largest economy struggles with high inflation and rising interest rates.But the Fed has signaled that it is seeking a further cooling in growth before it can consider pausing its pace of rate hikes. While a majority of traders are pricing in a 25 basis point hike by the central bank during its March meeting, a small group is positioning for a return to a 50 bps hike, given the recent stubbornness in inflation.Rising interest rates bode poorly for metal markets, given that they increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets. This trade had decimated metal prices in 2022, and is expected to weigh on the market in the near-term.Other precious metals moved in a flat-to-low range on Tuesday. Platinum futures rose 0.2% to $942.70 an ounce, while silver futures sank 0.4% to $20.715 an ounce.Among industrial metals, copper prices fell slightly but kept to a tight range as traders awaited key Chinese business activity data this week.Copper futures fell 0.2% to $4.0018 a pound, and were trading just above a near two-month low.Chinese PMI data is due on Wednesday, and is expected to show that an economic recovery in the world’s largest copper importer remained mixed through February.Story continuesWhile the service sector is expected to grow further from 2022 lows, the manufacturing sector is expected to remain in contraction territory.Related ArticlesGold prices hover above 2023 lows as Fed uncertainty persistsOil steadies after fall on fear of rate hikes, rising inventoriesNatural gas jumps 3rd day in row, on signs worst may be over]"

At this point, we could very well bounce a bit, but I think that bounce will probably end up being a bump along the road more than anything else.If we were to break down below the $20.60 level, then it’s possible that we could go down to the $20.50 level, which obviously has a little bit more in the way of psychological importance when it comes to trading. Breaking down below that level then opens up the possibility of a move to the $20 level, which will attract quite a bit of attention in and of itself. I think it is probably only a matter of time before we try to get down there, but that doesn’t mean we get there right away. A short-term rally from here could open up a move to the $21.25 level where we had seen quite a bit of selling pressure previously, and I do believe that is more likely than not.Keep in mind that silver is highly sensitive to the US dollar, so if the US dollar starts to take off and gain strength again, that will work against it. That being said, I also expect to see a lot of choppy volatility regardless, and quite frankly silver is known for that anyway. Because of this, you need to be very cautious with your position size but we have clearly seen a turnaround of shorts, and now it looks like we will have to determine whether or not the market can continue to find momentum in one direction or the other, but I suspect this is more of a “fade the rally” type of situation going forward.For a look at all of today’s economic events, check out our economic calendar.

PDCO is expected to release third-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Mar 2, before the opening bell.The company delivered an earnings surprise of 10.53% in the last reported quarter. Its earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same once, the average surprise being 7.88%.Q3 EstimatesFor the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s revenues is pegged at $1.62 billion, indicating a 1.4% increase from the year-ago reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted earnings per share (EPS) stands at 60 cents, indicating a 9.1% increase from the prior-year quarter.Patterson Companies, Inc. Price and ConsensusPatterson Companies, Inc. Price and ConsensusPatterson Companies, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Patterson Companies, Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteAs one of the leading distributors of consumable products and dental technology, Patterson Companies’ Dental arm has been one of the key contributors to its top line. However, COVID-19 might have impacted the company’s Dental business in third-quarter fiscal 2023.Per management, in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, sales at this segment increased 1.1% year over year. Improved demand for digital equipment portfolio and continued momentum in the core equipment category drove the segment’s top line. However, persistent deflationary impact of certain infection control products hurt sales during the second quarter. These trends are likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.In the fiscal second quarter of 2023, sales in the Animal Health segment declined 2.4% on a year-over-year basis. According to management, this was due to decline in production animal sales, staffing shortages and loss of sales due to products going off patent. These trends are likely to have continued in the fiscal third quarter, hurting segmental sales.The segment has been gaining from rise in pet adoptions and increased attention to pets. On the second-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call, the Companion Animal business continued to show signs of prosperity and expected to gain from the long-term tailwinds of higher pet ownership in the past two years. Consequently, this trend is likely to get reflected in the fiscal third-quarter results.Story continuesApart from this, the company expects that the Animal Health business is well poised to drive its top line and, thereby, margins in the near term.During the fiscal third quarter, the company closed acquisition of all assets of Dairy Tech, expanding Patterson Animal Health’s suite of offerings. Although this is unlikely to have any material impact during the fiscal third quarter, PDCO is likely to provide updated outlook for fiscal 2023 and beyond.However, intense competition across most of the product lines and inflationary pressures might have weighed on the company’s overall fiscal third-quarter performance.What the Zacks Model UnveilsPer our proven model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.

The S&amp;P GSCI Climate Aware is a broad-based commodity index which is intended to offer market participants with ongoing exposure to the global commodities sector that is in line with its parent benchmark, the S&amp;P GSCI.However, through the application of environmental factors in its rules-based methodology, the S&amp;P GSCI Climate Aware index is unique because it reallocates the weights of its constituents away from higher-intensity fossil fuels and shifts them to commodities that are crucial to the global energy transition while maintaining an allocation to the food commodities that sustain life.""As a pioneer in developing sustainability-oriented benchmarks for more than two decades, S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices is proud to offer this innovative index that reflects the growing market appetite and opportunity to incorporate environmental criteria in the global commodities sector,"" said Fiona Boal, Head of Commodities and Real Assets at S&amp;P DJI. ""For more than 30 years, the S&amp;P GSCI has been widely regarded as the leading measure of global commodity prices and source for unparalleled commodities insights. The S&amp;P GSCI Climate Aware index addresses the goals of our customers and market participants who continue to seek broad-based commodities market exposures to manage inflationary risks and for diversification purposes, while improving their environmental footprints,"" Boal added.With the S&amp;P GSCI as its starting index universe, the S&amp;P GSCI Climate Aware index uses index optimization, an approach whereby a mathematical model is used to select the best combination of constituents according to certain predefined objectives. Through this approach, the S&amp;P GSCI Climate Aware index seeks to achieve a similar level of diverse and broad exposure to the commodities market and maintain index replicability and liquidity.Story continuesThe S&amp;P GSCI Climate Aware index utilizes the S&amp;P Global Commodity Environmental dataset developed by S&amp;P Global Sustainable1.The dataset provides commodity-level physical and financial impact data on greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption and land use for all the constituents of the S&amp;P GSCI.More specifically, the S&amp;P GSCI Climate Aware index seeks to achieve a 25% reduction in environmental impact per dollar invested compared to the S&amp;P GSCI, along with a 5% year-on-year decarbonization target, while maintaining total food production and ensuring land and water environmental impacts are no higher than the S&amp;P GSCI.""S&amp;P Global Sustainable1 has developed the S&amp;P Global Commodity Environmental dataset covering a range of agricultural, energy, precious metal, and industrial metal commodities to support the need for increased transparency on environmental factors across commodity value chains. The dataset enables investors and corporates to understand and quantify the environmental risks and opportunities of specific commodities, as well as across portfolios, indices, and benchmarks,"" said Steve Bullock, Managing Director, Global Head of Research and Methodology, S&amp;P Global Sustainable1.S&amp;P DJI collaborated with J.P. Morgan to publish a research report to study the application of environmental criteria on commodities benchmarks. The research is available here.With the launch of this climate aware commodity index, S&amp;P DJI adds to its wide range of broad market, thematic and targeted global sustainability and environmental, social and governance (ESG) indices such as the S&amp;P 500 ESG Index, as well as more specific environmental and climate-focused benchmarks such as the S&amp;P Paris-Aligned and Climate Transition (PACT) indices.The S&amp;P GSCI Climate Aware index's methodology is published and available at S&amp;P DJI's website here and more information on the S&amp;P Global Commodity Environmental dataset can be found here.ABOUT S&amp;P DOW JONES INDICESS&amp;P Dow Jones Indices is the largest global resource for essential index-based concepts, data and research, and home to iconic financial market indicators, such as the S&amp;P 500® and the Dow Jones Industrial Average®.

Both instruments recovered from a two-month low on Monday.Focus this week is on U.S. Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) readings for February, which are expected to show some cooling in economic activity as the world’s largest economy struggles with high inflation and rising interest rates.But the Fed has signaled that it is seeking a further cooling in growth before it can consider pausing its pace of rate hikes. While a majority of traders are pricing in a 25 basis point hike by the central bank during its March meeting, a small group is positioning for a return to a 50 bps hike, given the recent stubbornness in inflation.Rising interest rates bode poorly for metal markets, given that they increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets. This trade had decimated metal prices in 2022, and is expected to weigh on the market in the near-term.Other precious metals moved in a flat-to-low range on Tuesday.

At this point, we could very well bounce a bit, but I think that bounce will probably end up being a bump along the road more than anything else.If we were to break down below the $20.60 level, then it’s possible that we could go down to the $20.50 level, which obviously has a little bit more in the way of psychological importance when it comes to trading. Breaking down below that level then opens up the possibility of a move to the $20 level, which will attract quite a bit of attention in and of itself. I think it is probably only a matter of time before we try to get down there, but that doesn’t mean we get there right away. A short-term rally from here could open up a move to the $21.25 level where we had seen quite a bit of selling pressure previously, and I do believe that is more likely than not.Keep in mind that silver is highly sensitive to the US dollar, so if the US dollar starts to take off and gain strength again, that will work against it. That being said, I also expect to see a lot of choppy volatility regardless, and quite frankly silver is known for that anyway. Because of this, you need to be very cautious with your position size but we have clearly seen a turnaround of shorts, and now it looks like we will have to determine whether or not the market can continue to find momentum in one direction or the other, but I suspect this is more of a “fade the rally” type of situation going forward.For a look at all of today’s economic events, check out our economic calendar.

There are a million pixels on Prophesee's latest chips.Manufacturing of the chip will be outsourced to Sony Group Corp.

Investor Warren Buffet has a different view on share repurchases.But beyond the share repurchases, Booking Holdings, Airbnb, Trip.com Group and Expedia Group, among other online travel companies, have substantial monies on the books for merger and acquisition activity, and other investments in growth and technology.Booking Holdings had the largest rainy day fund at $12.2 billion at the end of last year, and added $1.4 billion to the stockpile this month by completing the sale of its shares in China’s delivery app and hotel aggregator Meituan. Airbnb was cash rich with $9.6 billion, Trip.com Group had $8.7 billion when it last reported its cash trove as of September 30, and Expedia Group coveted $4.1 billion.

In November 2021, the company announced its intent to acquire its flight technology partner, Sweden’s Etraveli Group, for around $1.7 billion, but the European Commission is still mulling the deal. By all accounts, subsidiary Booking.com’s several years old flights business, which is available in more than 50 countries, is going strong, and the acquisition would further its so-called connected trip strategy.Share repurchases are a Booking priority. It has $3.9 billion left on a $15 billion share repurchase authorization, and after that intends to get started on a new $20 billion go-ahead from its board of directors.“We expect to complete the share repurchases under a cumulative $24 billion authorization within the next four years, assuming that travel continues to recover and grow from here,” Chief Financial Officer David Goulden told analysts last week.That leaves plenty of room for additional acquisitions, which of course can be financed, as well, in a combination of cash and stock. Booking has made plenty of smallish tech acquisitions over the years so these types of deals, as well as paying down debt, always have potential.With Booking is seemingly making strides in its bid to take market share in the U.S., a potential deal to acquire app-only and flights-oriented Hopper, with its youngish customer set and $5 billion valuation from a year ago, wouldn’t be an original idea for Booking’s leadership. But Booking is already poised to bolster its flights business with the pending acquisition of eTraveli Group so it has enough on its plate.CEO Glenn Fogel knows that sometimes the best deal is no deal as mergers and acquisitions tend to be complicated and risky business.Airbnb Will Do Share Repurchases and Eye Acquisition OpportunitiesAirbnb co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky said in February that the company is “beginning to really ramp up” its experiences business, which it downplayed during the height of the pandemic. But don’t expect a big acquisition of a company like Viator, owned by Tripadvisor, or GetYourGuide because their approach conflicts with Airbnb’s host-run tours scenario.Airbnb could also up its stake in Tiqets after leading a $60 million round in 2019 and taking a minority stake, although this sort of move wouldn’t be game-changing.With nearly $10 billion in cash hanging around, a smaller tech-oriented tours and activities transaction, or perhaps something in the luxury sector could be a possibility. There are several property management companies that could be for sale, but Airbnb, as chiefly a booking site, is in a much more lucrative business than the labor-intensive property management sector.“Acquisition of tours, activities and experiences companies such as GetYourGuide or Klook are unlikley for Airbnb,” said Skift Research’s Pranavi Agarwal. “Airbnb Experiences, unlike its competitors, is more focused on unique locally hosted peer-to-peer local experiences versus the more commercialized business of selling tickets to major attractions. The focus will be on incorporating experiences into their existing rental stay product with all being host orientated.”Airbnb Chief Financial Officer David Stephenson told analysts during the company’s fourth quarter earnings call in mid-February that the company will likely be buying back more of its shares early in 2023, but mentioned the potential for acquisitions.“Buybacks are likley to be the main use of cash this year, with half a billion dollars of their $2 billion share repurchase program (which was announced in August 2022) left to be executed,” Agarwal said. “However, Airbnb is still very much a growth company, with vision to expand into new verticals outside short term rentals, such as experiences, hotels and long-term stays. Whilst investors can expect future buyback programs, I think we can certainly expect management to pursue M&amp;A opportunities in these new segments, particulalry experiences.”Airbnb, which recorded its first full-year of positive net income ($1.9 billion) in 2022, has been disciplined about focusing on its core short-term rental business since early 2020, when it ceased investing in its experiences and hotels businesses, for example. It may exercise caution about casting a much wider wider net in 2023.“We have $500 million left on the existing repurchase approval, and we anticipate that will be executing early in the year,” Stephenson said. “But clearly, we’re also in — still in growth mode — like we are using this balance sheet to make sure that we can invest in growth for the business in the future. Clearly keep enough cash for potential M&amp;A opportunities, which could exist. And then to the extent that we can return stock and cash to shareholders through share repurchases that will be our primary vehicle that you would anticipate this year.”Trip.com Group Had $8.7 Billion in CashLike its peers, Trip.com Group could execute some share buybacks in 2023, and look at potential acquisitions given its $8.7 billion in cash on hand at the end of September.Trip.com Group touted opportunities in the Middle East during Skift Global Forum East in Dubai in December, and has ample ambitions in the region. It could conceivably snap up a local player in the Middle East to spearhead growth, but will undoubtably be heavily focused on reviving existing operations as China rebounds from Covid-19 in 2023.Will Expedia Group Be Too Preoccupied For Deal-Making?Expedia Group has been busy eliminating or downplaying brands in its portfolio over the last few years as it tries to simplify its operations, so major merger and acquisition activity would probably not be a high priority this year. But never say never, as the saying goes.In addition, the company has two big initiatives in the works for 2023: It needs to transition its Vrbo vacation rental unit onto the Expedia tech platform, and it plans to launch a new loyalty program encompassing its major brands later this year. Why muck up the works with a big-time acquisition?Expedia Group Chief Financial Officer Julie Whalen told analysts last week that the company plans to continue “opportunistically” repurchasing its stock in 2023.Expedia Group had $4.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand at the end of 2022. It was the sole company of the four we looked at that had less cash on hand at the end of 2023 than in 2019.“This liquidity, combined with our strong free cash flow levels enabled us to maximize our return of capital to shareholders during the quarter by further accelerating our share buybacks to approximately $350 million or 3.7 million shares in the fourth quarter,” Whalen said. “This resulted in approximately $500 million and 5.2 million shares being repurchased since the end of September 2022. Even after these buybacks, we enter 2023 with ample levels of shares remaining under our existing authorization for future repurchases at approximately 18 million shares.”Tripadvisor As An Under the Radar Acquirer?Tripadvisor laid plans in early 2022 to potentially spin off its tours and activities brand, Viator, but those plans were seemingly shelved when market conditions deteriorated, and in the interim the company hired a new CEO, Matt Goldberg, who started there in July.Goldberg hasn’t fully articulated his plans, but one veteran investor said he wouldn’t rule out Tripadvisor pursuing a roll-up strategy and trying to acquire Berlin’s GetYourGuide to spearhead Tripadvisor’s tours and activities business.Viator was the fastest-growing entity in Tripadvisor’s business last year, having generated 171 percent more revenue in 2022 than it did in 2019. While GetYourGuide has raised $886 million in funding, according to Crunchbase, it is likely a smaller business than Viator, and would be affordable for Tripadvisor, especially if GetYourGuide shareholders retained shares in the post-merger business, the investor maintained. Tripadvisor had $1 billion in cash and equivalents on hand at the end of 2022.He conceded that it would likely have to be a down round for GetYourGuide to make that happen.

139,8d22f7ef-15f7-343c-97c0-48b150dde2c8,EXPE,2023-02-28,3 Undervalued Consumer Stocks to Buy in February,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-undervalued-consumer-stocks-buy-134753967.html,1677246473,STORY,['EXPE'],"[There’s little doubt, in my mind, that most middle-class and upper-class U.S. consumers are in fairly good shape, making February a great time to find undervalued consumer stocks to buy. For evidence of that assertion, look at the recently reported fourth-quarter results of two major automakers: Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Stellantis (NYSE:STLA). The latter company’s major brands include Fiat and Chrysler. Then, consider the most recently reported results of the large hotel chain Mariott (NASDAQ:MAR) and the fast-casual dining chain Darden (NYSE:DRI).Tesla’s top line jumped 37% year-over-year, and its net income climbed 59% YOY. Stellantis’ top line jumped 18% in 2022, while its net profit jumped 26%. As for Marriott, its Q4 revenue rocketed 33% higher, and its bottom line jumped 44% YOY.Meanwhile, the bears have recently focused on emphasizing the supposedly high debt load of American consumers. But according to the St. Louis Fed, as of the third quarter of 2022, the ratio of U.S. household debt to GDP was 76.82%, slightly lower than in the fourth quarter of 2018, when the same ratio was 77.94%. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the ratio was over 80%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith all that in mind, here are three undervalued consumer stocks to buy in February.TickerCompanyPriceEXPEExpedia$106.91QSRRestaurant Brands International$65.71FUNCedar Fair$46.36Expedia (EXPE)Expedia app logo on a smartphone screenSource: NYC Russ / Shutterstock.comOne of America and Europe’s two leading online travel agencies, Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), reported very strong fourth-quarter results on Feb. 9. [Booking.com (NASDAQ:BKNG) is the other leading OTA].Specifically, EXPE’s Q4 top line climbed 15% year-over-year last quarter, while its net income, excluding certain items, jumped 17% YOY. Moreover, its booked room nights increased by 19% to 70.8 million. For all of 2022, Expedia’s revenue climbed 36%, and its operating income soared an incredible 484% to $1.085 billion. In fact, EXPE reported record profits last year.Story continuesAnd importantly, the company reported that its business had improved in January versus Q4, as severe weather in several parts of the U.S. had hurt its Q4 results.Despite those positive metrics and my belief that the travel surge appears set to go on indefinitely, EXPE’s forward price-earnings ratio is a rather low 12.56, making it one of the most undervalued consumer stocks to buy in February.Restaurant Brands International (QSR)A photo of a Burger King light-up sign outside a Burger King restaurant representing QSR stock.Source: Savvapanf Photo / Shutterstock.comThe owner of Burger King, Canada-based coffee chain Tim Hortons, and the Popeye fried chicken restaurants, Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR), also reported impressive Q4 results.Specifically, its revenue climbed 10% year-over-year to $1.69 billion, while the comp sales of Burger King rose 8.4% and Tim Hortons’ comp sales jumped 9.4%. The company’s Q4 earnings per share came in at $3.14, up from $2.82 during the same period a year earlier.Also noteworthy is that QSR hired former Domino’s (NYSE:DPZ) CEO Patrick Doyle as its executive chairman in November. In eight years with Doyle as Domino’s CEO, the pizza chain delivered “29 straight quarters of same-store sales increases, systemwide sales growth of $5.6 billion to $13 billion, and more than a 2x bump in home market franchisee profitability.” Further, during his tenure, DPZ stock surged “from $12 in March 2010 to $271 in June 2018.”Doyle recently told Yahoo Finance that “We have got the best burger in the category [in the Whopper] and that’s a lot to work with. ” But he added that the chain has to improve itself in a few areas, including “speed of service” and “franchisee profitability.”Doyle has personally invested $30 million in QSR stock. Moreover, he received “stock and options that vest over at least five years that are worth $200 million based on the closing price” of the shares on Nov. 15.But he will receive those funds only if QSR stock increases ” by about 10% per year over the next five years,” according to the website Restaurant Business. So Doyle is tremendously incentivized to boost QSR’s share price in the medium term and the long term.Cedar Fair (FUN)A close-up shot of a roller coaster with the blue sky in the background.Source: ShutterstockIn line with my theory, which I’ve written about for several months, that many amusement parks will benefit from the travel rebound and the hefty price hikes that Disney (NYSE:DIS) has undertaken at its parks, Cedar Fair (NYSE:FUN) reported very good fourth-quarter results on Feb. 16.The 4% year-over-year increase in net revenue was good but nothing to write home about. However, it generated a net income of $12 million, compared with a $27 million loss in the same period of 2021. Moreover, its EBITDA, excluding certain items, soared 20% YOY to $88 million. And its attendance rose 5% versus Q4 of 2019 to 235,000 guests. Finally, its “out-of-park revenues” soared 27% YOY.“We achieved the highest levels of revenues, net income and Adjusted EBITDA in Cedar Fair’s history, and returned approximately $220 million of capital to unitholders in 2022, through the reinstatement of our quarterly cash distributions and the implementation of a new unit buyback program,” noted CEO Richard Zimmerman, adding that the company had reduced its debt-adjusted EBITDA level to the same level as in 2019.Analysts, on average, irrationally predict that the company’s EPS will tumble to $3.31 this year from $5.06 last year. If we assume that the company’s 2023 EPS, after its strong Q4 performance, will come in at $5.50, then the shares’ forward price-earnings ratio is a very attractive 8.2. Moreover, FUN has a dividend yield of 2.7%.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

To skip our detailed analysis of the pharmaceutical sector, you can go directly to see the Top 5 Drug Companies in USA and Their China Reliance.The US has long been reliant on China for the upkeep of several industries. The most notable of these industries are the semiconductor and healthcare sectors. With the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, America's widespread reliance on China became increasingly evident because of a sharper light being shed on US-Chinese manufacturing and supply chains. With the pandemic first breaking out in China and reducing exports from the Asian country to others, shortages of critical medical supplies in the US made the latter's heavy reliance on the former clearer than ever.Top US drug producers such as Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) were found to be just as heavily reliant on China as smaller medical companies. Many American drug companies have manufacturing and supply chain infrastructure set up in China, causing this reliance. According to a report published by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean in  2021, the US imported about $105.32 billion worth of medical products and equipment, including medical imaging, diagnostic, and oxygen therapy equipment, in 2019 alone. China was recorded as the second-largest supplier of these products and equipment. During the first nine months of 2020, pharmaceutical imports from China to the US increased by 46%, with 69% of the imports being active pharmaceutical ingredients and 27% of the imports being pharmaceutical preparation products.President Biden has been taking steps to curb the US reliance on China when it comes to the healthcare sector and elsewhere. In September 2022, Biden signed an executive order to boost domestic manufacturing in the biotech sector to increase American self-sufficiency in this area. However, it is unclear how this objective can be attained since China is a major manufacturer of active pharmaceutical ingredients to India, which is conversely a major supplier of generic drugs to the US. Ever since China acceded to the World Trade Organization in 2001, it began focusing on economic growth through the expansion of its pharmaceutical industry. As a result of this, the country devoted itself to producing basic chemicals and active pharmaceutical ingredients. Consequently, it is unsurprising that the country today is a lead supplier of these ingredients by volume in the global market. In some markets specifically, China has increased its share of the US import markets. For instance, the market for penicillin saw an increase in the Chinese share from 1% to 51%, while the antibiotics market saw an increase of the country's share from 15% to 37%. This increase occurred over the 10 years preceding 2021. As the situation currently stands, it will be difficult for the US to disengage itself from the Chinese manufacturing and supply chain infrastructure. Hence, many major American companies have a huge stake in the Chinese pharmaceutical market, leading to their increased presence in the country.Story continuesTop 10 Drug Companies in USA and Their China ReliancePhoto by Christina Victoria Craft on UnsplashLet's now take a look at the top 10 drug companies in USA and their China reliance.Our MethodologyWe have selected pharmaceutical companies in the US with the highest revenues in the sector as of 2021 and a strong reliance on China. They are ranked based on these revenues, from the lowest to the highest. These companies are heavily reliant on China since they source a variety of their raw materials from the country. They also have a large presence in the Chinese market, making China one of their most profitable consumer markets to date. We have also mentioned analyst price targets and ratings for the stocks of these companies. In our list below, we go over key business fundamentals for these companies as well, such as their latest profit margins.Top Drug Companies in USA and Their China Reliance10. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN)Total Revenue in 2021: $16.07 billionRegeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) specializes in developing and commercializing drugs for the treatment of medical conditions such as cancer, eye diseases, and inflammatory disorders. Its top-selling drugs include Dupixent and Eylea.On January 31, Tyler Van Buren at Cowen upgraded Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) shares from Market Perform to Outperform. The analyst also placed an $875 price target on the stock.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) expects its Dupixent sales to reach almost $11 billion in 2023, representing an increase of about 30% compared to 2022 numbers. Dupixent is one of the company's top products recently approved in China for adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. This approval will likely increase Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:REGN) Dupixent sales significantly, making the company heavily reliant on continued Chinese use and approval.Bronte Capital, an investment management company, mentioned Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“There have been some bright spots in our long book. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN), a major position and a stock we wrote up in our June 2021 letter, has been one of the best performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 this year. Alas it has not been enough to offset some of our weaker stocks, let alone our overweight exposure to the UK (and Europe) which have suffered from both stock and currency weakness. We do not think we are bad at picking stocks on the long side and hope – reasonably we think – for better relative results in the future. Prior to COVID, our longs were markedly better than the index. Unfortunately, if you look at our long book this quarter and since the onset of the COVID pandemic, there is scant evidence that we have added any value by picking stocks to go long.”9. Amgen, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN)Total Revenue in 2021: $25.98 billionAmgen, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) is a biopharmaceutical company based in Thousand Oaks, California. Its top-selling drugs include Neulasta, Enbrel, and Prolia.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) is heavily reliant on its manufacturing facilities in China, where some of its top-selling drugs are produced. These include Enbrel, a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, and Prolia, a treatment for osteoporosis.8. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD)Total Revenue in 2021: $27.31 billionGilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) is a biopharmaceutical company that specializes in the development and commercialization of medicines for various diseases. It was founded in 1987 and is headquartered in Foster City, California.

This hurts the reported earnings of U.S. companies who sell their goods and services overseas. Foreign currency earnings translate into fewer dollars and thus lower earnings. Most of the companies in your portfolios gain a notable amount of earnings from their international operations. While the strength or weakness of a currency doesn’t change the quality of a business or its longer-term earnings power, it can change the reported earnings of a company over short periods of time. It is difficult to forecast this effect accurately because many of our companies manufacture where they sell, which to some extent dulls the sharp negative effect of a surging dollar. Abbott (NYSE:ABT), among others, is a good example.”Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc.

To skip our detailed analysis of the freest countries in the world, you can go directly to see the 5 Freest Countries In the World.Economists, including those working at the United Nations Development Programme, have established that it is not just economic indicators such as GDP per capita or the Consumer Price Index that are needed to be taken into account when judging the development and progression of a country. The UNDP's Human Development Report Office releases indices such as the Human Development Index and the Gender Inequality Index each year, where all nations of the world are ranked in factors that affect the everyday lives of the population. Some prominent companies that are working towards inclusivity and diversity include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).One of the most significant factors that influence an individual's quality of life is freedom, which is considered to be an inherent right for each individual. This freedom consists of personal freedom as well as economic freedom as individuals need the liberty to make choices along with the means to make choices. These choices will include freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of identity, freedom of movement, and many more.One way of judging freedom is by looking at the freedom of the press. According to a UNESCO report, 455 journalists were killed between 2016 and 2021 during their job. Another Reuters report in 2021 pointed out that violations of religious freedom and persecution are actively happening in more than 25 countries. North Korea has been given a  score of 3 out of 100 by the Freedom House based on the political rights and civil liberties provided to the citizens. Amnesty International has also called out Russia for restricting freedom of expression and assembly repeatedly. The country has passed a new law according to which using the term ""war"" for the Ukrainian invasion can lead to 15 years in jail.Story continuesOn the other hand, some countries have taken progressively larger steps to increase the rights and freedoms granted to people living within their territories. The World Press Freedom Index is a ranking established by Reporters Without Borders and highly ranks countries such as Norway, Sweden, Switzerland,  and Denmark for heavily protecting the right of free speech and allowing liberties to their journalists and press members.25 Freest Countries In the WorldAntonio Guillem/Shutterstock.comLet's now take a look at the 25 freest countries in the world. Our MethodologyThe Cato Institute in the United States and the Fraser Institute in Canada worked together to create the Human Freedom Index Report which takes 165 countries and territories into account and uses 82 metrics to use as indicators to judge human freedom. The two major categories it creates are personal freedom and economic freedom.In this article, we make use of the personal freedom scores given by this report which take into account 7 main criteria that consist of the rule of law, security and safety, movement, freedom of religion, freedom of expression, and metrics regarding civil society.We combine the personal freedom score with just the Business Freedom Index scores developed by The Heritage Foundation and take an average of the two scores according to which we have ranked the freest countries. Due to our use of this method, countries that have balanced high scores in both indexes have been ranked higher than countries that might have really high Personal Freedom Index scores but lower Business Freedom Index scores and vise versa.The reason for using business freedom scores and not the economic freedom scores that are a part of the Human Freedom Index report is that the economic freedom scores include metrics that are affected significantly by the macroeconomic conditions of the countries such as international relations and the size of the government. All these metrics are given equal weightage when this may not actually be the case in determining the freedom levels of a country.Freest Countries in the World25.

Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”15. Verizon Communications Inc.

(NYSE:VZ) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“We sold the entire position in Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), which was a disappointing investment, on concerns that the company is losing market share in a very competitive business and because we believed we had better use for the funds elsewhere.”14. TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE)Average Net Income: $11.53 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 21At the end of Q4 2022, 21 hedge funds held positions in TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE). The total value of these positions was $1.93 billion. This is compared to 22 hedge funds in the previous quarter with stakes worth $1.56 billion.In fiscal 2022, TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) generated an annual net income of $20.53 billion. The company has generated an annual net income of $11.53 billion, on average, over the last 20 years.

TTE is one of the world’s largest energy companies. It develops and produces oil and gas, produces and sells refined products, is one of the largest producers and traders of LNG, and owns a large portfolio of renewable power generating assets. TTE has one of the lowest cost portfolios of oil and gas assets and therefore one of the lowest breakeven points in the industry. It also has one of the best balance sheets in the industry. We estimate it will reach a net cash position sometime in 2023.The valuation of TTE—and that of Shell—is fascinating. TTE sells at approximately 4X earnings and has a 5% dividend yield. With its current buyback program and a recently announced special dividend, the owners yield is more than 10%. The valuation and owners yield are not dissimilar to those of Shell, which we also own and which trades at just under 5X earnings. To say that a discount is attached to European oil companies relative to US peers is an understatement. Exxon Mobil sells at 8X earnings, Chevron 9X and Conoco 8X. If TTE and Shell redomiciled to the US, their share prices would probably double.We have a few theories for the valuation anomaly. First, as mentioned above, Europe generally trades at a big discount to the US. In the case of TTE and Shell, this makes no economic sense. The oil and gas business is a global one, and TTE and Shell have attractive assets. The main explanation, we believe, is that large sections of the European asset management industry will not invest in oil and gas because of ESG restrictions. Yet if the recent war in Ukraine and the current energy crisis have shown us nothing else, the supply of energy is an enormous social good. Indeed, it is an existential good. Moreover, it is companies such as TTE that will invest billions to supply the LNG that Europe desperately needs to restore its economy and reduce the crushing cost burden on families who must now choose between heating their homes and eating. Finally, TTE is also investing billions per year in renewable power generating assets such as wind and solar. Such assets will likely never replace clean burning natural gas and nuclear as base power suppliers, but they are a valuable and clean adjunct to modern grids. We believe TTE’s renewable portfolio is worth between $25 billion and $35 billion and is moving from almost no profit contribution toward meaningful levels of profit over the next few years. We wonder how it makes sense for investors to disinvest from these kinds of assets on ethical grounds.”13. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Average Net Income: $12.67 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 84On January 24, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) posted earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022.

(NYSE:PFE) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Labs, global pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG). Although Pfizer continues to report strong performance of its core drugs, sales of its COVID vaccine and treatment have likely peaked and sales are expected to decline going forward. We remain optimistic about the company long term as we believe management is taking the company in the right direction, focusing R&amp;D, and making strategic acquisitions with profits generated from COVID vaccine sales.”11.

(NYSE:WMT) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”10.

Despite the positives of higher interest rates and the company making good progress on reducing expenses and regulatory consent orders, Wells Fargo shares have fallen one-third from their highs earlier this year to roughly 6.5x our estimate of normalized earnings power, and the stock ended the quarter at ~1x next year’s tangible book value. We find this is far too cheap for a strong banking franchise capable of tangible returns in the low-to-mid teens across business cycles.”8.

The current company was formed through various mergers including NationsBank, FleetBoston, US Trust, Countrywide Financial, and Merrill Lynch with the legacy commercial bank to form a national banking powerhouse and bulge bracket investment firm. As one of the ‘Big Four’ U.S. banks it enjoys scale driven cost advantages and economies of scale which provide meaningful competitive advantages and potential for strong returns in the largely commoditized banking industry. A survivor of the financial crisis, BAC has emerged with a solid capital base and stands to benefit from a rising interest rate environment.”7.

The stock is the seventh most profitable stock of the last 20 years.Here is what Diamond Hill Capital had to say about Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Most recently in Q4, we increased our energy exposure by reinitiating a position in a company we know well and have owned in the past, integrated oil and gas company Chevron Corporation(NYSE:CVX).We previously owned Chevron as recently as February 2022. We sold our position at that time due to heightened risk associated with operations in Kazakhstan, which sends oil through a pipeline that runs through Russia out to the Black Sea. When Russia invaded Ukraine, we believed there was real risk that something would happen to inhibit Chevron’s ability to get that oil to the market. We didn’t believe that risk was reflected in the stock price, so we sold our position. Today, 10+ months into the Ukraine crisis, more information has become available regarding the Kazakhstan operations, and the associated risks are now well-known. We believe those risks are fully priced into the current stock valuation. Chevron is one of the best operators in its field, with a diversified portfolio and strong management, and we took the opportunity to reinvest when the stock was trading below our estimate of intrinsic value.”6.

However, some stocks offer the potential for both capital gains and ongoing income via their dividends.Find Out: How Much Americans Have in Their Savings Accounts in 2023  Advice: 3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000Most stocks that pay reliable dividends are also less volatile than the stock market as a whole, which can make them good choices for more conservative investors.When looking for a stock with major passive income potential, you’ll want to invest in a company with a track record of consistent payouts in an industry that generates reliable cash flow. Here are a few candidates that you might consider discussing with your financial advisor.Walgreens Boots AllianceStock price as of Feb. 24, 2023: $35.80Walgreens Boots Alliance is a mouthful of a name, but it’s a great company for income investors. The pharmacy giant is better known to Americans through its Walgreens stores, but it also has a huge British presence under its Boots brand. The company has increased its dividend for 47 years in a row, making it a dividend aristocrat. Even with a quite high dividend yield of 5.31%, the company’s payout ratio is just 39.75%, leaving it ample room for future increases.In addition to its income potential, the stock has other factors to support it. Pharmacy companies are generally considered defensive, as consumers still need their products even during tough economic times. The stock is trading near its 52-week low and analysts have a consensus “buy” rating on it.Live Richer Podcast: How To Leverage Your InvestmentsVerizon CommunicationsStock price as of Feb. 24, 2023: $38.74Verizon Communications isn’t quite a dividend aristocrat yet, but it’s only because the company hasn’t existed long enough. Formed in 2000 by a merger between Bell Atlantic Corp. and GTE, the company has existed for just 23 years but already has increased its dividends for 18 consecutive years.Story continuesAs one of the largest wireless carriers in the country, Verizon generates a considerable amount of recurring cash flow that can support a large and growing dividend. Currently, the company sports a whopping 6.64% yield.While not the most exciting stock on the capital appreciation side, the company has a consensus “buy” rating, with an average 12-month price target of $46.50.3MStock price as of Feb. 24, 2023: $107.803M is a global conglomerate probably best known for its Post-It and Scotch Tape brands. But it produces a wide range of products for both consumers and businesses, from automotive parts and hardware to cleaning supplies, films and sheeting, electrical supplies, insulation and countless others.If you’re looking for a reliable long-term dividend payer, it’s hard to do better than 3M. The company has paid a dividend for more than 100 years, and it has raised that dividend for more than 60 years in a row.Currently, the stock yields a hefty 5.51% and trades near the bottom of its 52-week range, perhaps offering an attractive entry point for long-term investors.Johnson &amp; JohnsonStock price as of Feb. 24, 2023: $155.97Johnson &amp; Johnson is not just a dividend aristocrat but a dividend king, an appellation assigned to companies that have raised their dividends for at least 50 years in a row — or 60 in the case of J&amp;J. The well-known healthcare company produces medical devices, pharmaceuticals and consumer packaged goods, and its products are likely in the homes of nearly every American. Some of its most well-known brands include Band-Aid, Neutrogena and Tylenol.Johnson &amp; Johnson has an above-average yield of 2.90%, and analysts have a consensus “buy” rating on the stock, with an average 12-month price target about 20% above current levels.Crown Castle InternationalStock price as of Feb. 24, 2023: $131.16Crown Castle International may not be the most well-known name on the list, but it’s a reliable dividend payer in a growing industry.

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Johnson &amp; Johnson in FocusJohnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) is headquartered in New Brunswick, and is in the Medical sector. The stock has seen a price change of -11.71% since the start of the year. The world's biggest maker of health care products is paying out a dividend of $1.13 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.9% compared to the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry's yield of 2.34% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.63%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $4.52 is up 1.6% from last year. In the past five-year period, Johnson &amp; Johnson has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 5.91%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Johnson &amp; Johnson's current payout ratio is 44%. This means it paid out 44% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, JNJ expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $10.50 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 3.45%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Story continuesHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, JNJ is a compelling investment opportunity.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Most Promising Psychedelic Stocks According To Analysts. Psychedelic drugs encompass a range of chemicals, including lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and plant-derived compounds. Psychedelics can be divided into two categories – empathogens and dissociative drugs, and serotonergic agents such as LSD. Both types of drugs can induce hallucinations and altered sensations, but dissociative drugs can also cause feelings of detachment from one's body or surroundings. Psychedelics are typically classified as either natural or synthetic, depending on their origin.Psychedelic Industry OutlookAccording to Mordor Intelligence, it is anticipated that the market for psychedelic drugs will experience a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7% during the forecast period of 2019 to 2027. The psychedelic drugs market was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Governments around the world implemented sudden lockdown measures, leading to an uptick in demand for psychedelic drugs as people experienced heightened levels of depression and stress. The World Health Organization reported a 25% increase in anxiety and depression cases globally in March 2022, which was attributed to the pandemic. Many individuals lost their jobs and were forced to remain at home, exacerbating mental health issues and driving market demand. While mental health concerns have eased as restrictions have lifted, the market is predicted to expand due to growing awareness of the need for treatment with psychedelic drugs for mental health issues and increased research and development of these drugs.The progress of the psychedelics industry heavily depends on the outcome of clinical trials, which could either make or break its viability and potentially boost publicly traded companies. However, there is uncertainty regarding the legality of these medicines, and regulatory bodies like the US FDA are currently evaluating some drugs, which could lead to limited access to these substances. There are also ongoing efforts in the United States and Canada to better understand the psychedelics industry, and recent political adjustments have been made, such as Colorado's decision to decriminalize psychedelic mushrooms in drug centers for those aged 21 and above starting in 2024. An advisory board may also add more psychedelic drugs to the legal system in 2026. Oregon is currently the only other state that allows the medical use of psychedelic substances.Story continuesThe growth of the psychedelic drug market is being fueled by the rising number of cases of mental illness. In 2020, NAMI reported that 52.9 million people in the United States - equivalent to 21% of adults - were struggling with mental illness. This increase in mental health cases is a primary contributor to the expansion of the psychedelic drug market. Major players in the psychedelic drug market are Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK). However, we focus on pure play psychedelic stocks in this article. Our Methodology For this article, we selected psychedelic stocks whose average price target estimated by analysts for one year is at least 50% above their current stock price as of February 24.

The initial 6-month results demonstrated AHCL system users experienced a 27.6% absolute increase in Time in Range and a 1.4% reduction in HbA1C without increased time in hypoglycemia. The study evaluating simplified meal announcement approaches with the MiniMed 780G system confirmed that it could handle unannounced meals of up to 80 grams of carbohydrates and that there was no deterioration in glycemic control when small amounts (up to 20 grams) of carbs were unannounced.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchA second randomized controlled trial sponsored by JDRF also demonstrated that in youth (7 to 17 years old) with newly-diagnosed type 1 diabetes, early intensive management, including use of an automated insulin delivery system, resulted in better Time in Range of 78% compared to 64% Time in Range in the standard-care group (real-time CGM without automated insulin delivery) at one year.Benefits of MiniMed 780G SystemPer Medtronic’s management, there is a growing body of clinical evidence demonstrating the superiority of using automated insulin delivery systems as first-line treatment for type 1 diabetes. These results demonstrate patient success earlier in the course of their disease and across the age spectrum. Considering this compelling evidence, the company is committed to expanding access to the MiniMed 780G system to provide people living with diabetes an opportunity to improve short- and long-term health outcomes.Story continuesFurther, these results will help Medtronic to go beyond the CGM-first paradigm to ensure patients experience well-established clinical benefits of automated insulin delivery earlier at diagnosis.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Research and Market, the Global Automated Insulin Delivery System Market size was estimated at $749.21 million in 2022 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 9.77% by 2030.Considering the market growth, Medtronic’s latest development is well-timed.Recent DevelopmentsIn February 2023, Medtronic announced the receipt of the CE mark for the Aurora EV-ICD MRI SureScan (Extravascular Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator) and Epsila EV MRI SureScan defibrillation lead to treating abnormal heart rhythms. The Aurora EV-ICD system is investigational in the United States.In December 2022, Medtronic announced the enrolment of the first patient in the Expand URO U.S. clinical trial for the Hugo robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) system. The robotic prostatectomy was performed at Duke University Hospital in Durham, N.C. The Hugo RAS system and Touch Surgery Enterprise provide a smart, digitally-enabled surgical experience.

157,c6e11d49-5fc1-3e84-881b-b6822998c958,MRK,2023-02-28,Merck Provides Update on Phase 3 Trials KEYNOTE-641 and KEYNOTE-789,Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/merck-provides-phase-3-trials-114500104.html,1677584700,STORY,['MRK'],"[RAHWAY, N.J., February 28, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, today provided updates on two Phase 3 trials, KEYNOTE-641 and KEYNOTE-789. Merck is discontinuing the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-641 trial evaluating KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, in combination with enzalutamide and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) based on the recommendation of an independent Data Monitoring Committee. At an interim analysis, KEYTRUDA in combination with enzalutamide and ADT did not demonstrate an improvement in radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) or overall survival (OS), the trial’s dual primary endpoints, compared to placebo plus enzalutamide and ADT, and crossed a pre-specified futility boundary for OS. Merck is informing study investigators of the decision and advises patients in the study to speak to their physician regarding treatment.Merck also announced that the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-789 trial evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed plus platinum-based chemotherapy did not meet its dual primary endpoint of OS for the treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-genomic tumor mutations, who have previously progressed on a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), including osimertinib. At the final analysis of the study, there was an improvement in OS for patients who received KEYTRUDA plus pemetrexed with platinum-based chemotherapy compared to pemetrexed with platinum-based chemotherapy; however, these results did not meet statistical significance per the pre-specified statistical plan. At an earlier interim analysis, the trial’s other dual primary endpoint, progression-free survival (PFS) was tested and showed an improvement in the KEYTRUDA arm compared to chemotherapy alone, but these results did not reach statistical significance.Story continuesIn KEYNOTE-641 and KEYNOTE-789, the safety profile of KEYTRUDA was consistent with that observed in previously reported studies and no new safety signals were identified. In KEYNOTE-641, the combination was associated with a higher incidence of Grade 3-5 adverse events and serious adverse events compared to the control arm. Results will be shared at future scientific congresses.""Throughout the clinical development of KEYTRUDA, we have asked the tough questions in an effort to fully explore the potential of this breakthrough immunotherapy and determine how we could help as many patients as possible,"" said Dr. Eliav Barr, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. ""Science is rarely a straight line, and while we are disappointed in these study results, our research to investigate KEYTRUDA in many difficult-to-treat types of cancer continues in earnest. We are extremely grateful to all the investigators and patients for their participation in these studies.""About KEYNOTE-641KEYNOTE-641 is a randomized, double-blind Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03834493) evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with enzalutamide and ADT versus placebo in combination with enzalutamide and ADT in patients with mCRPC who have not received chemotherapy for mCRPC, are abiraterone-naïve or are intolerant to or progressed on abiraterone acetate. The primary endpoints are OS and rPFS per Prostate Cancer Working Group-modified RECIST v1.1 as assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints include objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR) and safety. The trial enrolled an estimated 1,240 patients who were randomized to receive KEYTRUDA (200 mg intravenously every three weeks for up to two years) plus enzalutamide (160 mg daily) or placebo plus enzalutamide.About metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancerProstate cancer is the second most common cancer in male patients globally and is associated with a significant mortality rate. Development of prostate cancer is often driven by male sex hormones called androgens, including testosterone. In patients with mCRPC, their prostate cancer grows and spreads to other parts of the body, despite the use of ADT to block the action of male sex hormones. Approximately 10-20% of patients with prostate cancer are estimated to develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) within five years, with at least 84% of these patients presenting with metastases at the time of CRPC diagnosis. Of patients with no metastases at CRPC diagnosis, 33% are likely to develop metastases within two years.About KEYNOTE-789KEYNOTE-789 (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03515837) is a randomized, double-blind Phase 3 trial investigating KEYTRUDA with pemetrexed plus platinum-based chemotherapy compared with pemetrexed plus platinum-based chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with TKI-resistant, EGFR-mutated metastatic, nonsquamous NSCLC. These patients experienced disease progression per RECIST v1.1 criteria following treatment with TKI therapy and either had: a) T790M-negative mutation tumors; b) T790M-positive mutation tumors with prior exposure to osimertinib; or c) first-line osimertinib failure regardless of T790M mutation status. The primary endpoints are OS and PFS. Secondary endpoints include ORR, DOR and safety. The study enrolled 492 patients who were randomized to receive either:KEYTRUDA (200 mg intravenously [IV] on Day 1 of each three-week cycle for up to 35 cycles) plus pemetrexed (500 mg/m2 by IV every three weeks with no restrictions on the number of cycles) plus platinum chemotherapy (either carboplatin [Area Under the Curve [AUC] 5 by IV every three weeks for four cycles] or cisplatin [75 mg/m2 by IV every three weeks for four cycles]); orPlacebo (saline by IV on Day 1 of each three-week cycle for up to 35 cycles) plus pemetrexed (500 mg/m2 by IV every three weeks with no restrictions on the number of cycles) plus platinum chemotherapy (either carboplatin [AUC 5 by IV every three weeks for four cycles] or cisplatin [75 mg/m2 by IV every three weeks for four cycles]).About lung cancerLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. In 2020 alone, there were more than 2.2 million new cases and 1.8 million deaths from lung cancer globally. Non-small cell lung cancer is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for about 81% of all cases. Among people with nonsquamous NSCLC, approximately 10-15% have EGFR mutations in the U.S. and Europe and up to 40-50% in Asia. In the U.S., the overall five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with lung cancer is 25%, which is a 21% improvement over the last five years. Improved survival rates are due, in part, to earlier detection and screening, reduction in smoking, advances in diagnostic and surgical procedures, as well as the introduction of new therapies. Early detection and screening remain an important unmet need, as 44% of lung cancer cases are not found until they are advanced. Only 5.8% of people in the U.S. who are eligible were screened for lung cancer in 2021.About Merck’s research in lung cancerMerck is advancing research aimed at transforming the way lung cancer is treated, with a goal of improving outcomes for patients affected by this deadly disease. Through nearly 200 clinical trials evaluating more than 36,000 patients around the world, Merck is at the forefront of lung cancer research. In NSCLC, KEYTRUDA has five approved U.S. indications (see indications below) and is approved for advanced disease in more than 95 countries. Among Merck’s research efforts are trials focused on evaluating KEYTRUDA in earlier stages of lung cancer as well as identifying new combinations and coformulations with KEYTRUDA.About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD- L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.Non-Small Cell Lung CancerKEYTRUDA, in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.KEYTRUDA, in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein-bound, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC expressing PD-L1 [tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥1%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations, and is:stage III where patients are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation, ormetastatic.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated as adjuvant treatment following resection and platinum-based chemotherapy for adult patients with stage IB (T2a ≥4 cm), II, or IIIA NSCLC.See additional selected indications for KEYTRUDA in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety InformationSelected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDASevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.Pneumonitis occurred in 41 (7%) patients, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. In adult patients who received adjuvant therapy for NSCLC, patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution.Immune-Mediated ColitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated HepatitisKEYTRUDA as a Single AgentKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.KEYTRUDA With AxitinibKEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT ≥3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event.Immune-Mediated EndocrinopathiesAdrenal InsufficiencyKEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 77% (17/22) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.3% (8) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.HypophysitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.2%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 94% (16/17) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Hypophysitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (4) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.Thyroid DisordersKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone replacement for hypothyroidism or institute medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%). None discontinued, but KEYTRUDA was withheld in &lt;0.1% (1) of patients.Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.8%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (2) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Hypothyroidism occurred in 8% (237/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (6.2%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.5% (14) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. The majority of patients with hypothyroidism required long-term thyroid hormone replacement. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC, occurring in 16% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 389 adult patients with cHL (17%) receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grade 1 (6.2%) and Grade 2 (10.8%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hyperthyroidism was higher in 580 patients with resected NSCLC, occurring in 11% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent as adjuvant treatment, including Grade 3 (0.2%) hyperthyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 580 patients with resected NSCLC, occurring in 22% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent as adjuvant treatment (KEYNOTE-091), including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism.Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Which Can Present With Diabetic KetoacidosisMonitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Type 1 DM occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. It led to permanent discontinuation in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.Immune-Mediated Nephritis With Renal DysfunctionKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Immune-mediated nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.1%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 89% (8/9) of patients. Nephritis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (3) and withholding in 0.1% (3) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Nephritis resolved in 56% of the 9 patients.Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, has occurred with anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate nonexfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% (38/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (1%) and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 40% (15/38) of patients. These reactions led to permanent discontinuation in 0.1% (2) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.6% (16) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 6% had recurrence. The reactions resolved in 79% of the 38 patients.Other Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsThe following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of &lt;1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received KEYTRUDA or were reported with the use of other anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection.Infusion-Related ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple MyelomaIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.Embryofetal ToxicityBased on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.Adverse ReactionsIn KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%). The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) with KEYTRUDA were fatigue (28%), diarrhea (26%), rash (24%), and nausea (21%).In KEYNOTE-054, when KEYTRUDA was administered as a single agent to patients with stage III melanoma, KEYTRUDA was permanently discontinued due to adverse reactions in 14% of 509 patients; the most common (≥1%) were pneumonitis (1.4%), colitis (1.2%), and diarrhea (1%). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 25% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. The most common adverse reaction (≥20%) with KEYTRUDA was diarrhea (28%). In KEYNOTE-716, when KEYTRUDA was administered as a single agent to patients with stage IIB or IIC melanoma, adverse reactions occurring in patients with stage IIB or IIC melanoma were similar to those occurring in 1011 patients with stage III melanoma from KEYNOTE-054.In KEYNOTE-189, when KEYTRUDA was administered with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy in metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 20% of 405 patients.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Most Promising Psychedelic Stocks According To Analysts. Psychedelic drugs encompass a range of chemicals, including lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and plant-derived compounds. Psychedelics can be divided into two categories – empathogens and dissociative drugs, and serotonergic agents such as LSD. Both types of drugs can induce hallucinations and altered sensations, but dissociative drugs can also cause feelings of detachment from one's body or surroundings. Psychedelics are typically classified as either natural or synthetic, depending on their origin.Psychedelic Industry OutlookAccording to Mordor Intelligence, it is anticipated that the market for psychedelic drugs will experience a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7% during the forecast period of 2019 to 2027. The psychedelic drugs market was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Governments around the world implemented sudden lockdown measures, leading to an uptick in demand for psychedelic drugs as people experienced heightened levels of depression and stress. The World Health Organization reported a 25% increase in anxiety and depression cases globally in March 2022, which was attributed to the pandemic. Many individuals lost their jobs and were forced to remain at home, exacerbating mental health issues and driving market demand. While mental health concerns have eased as restrictions have lifted, the market is predicted to expand due to growing awareness of the need for treatment with psychedelic drugs for mental health issues and increased research and development of these drugs.The progress of the psychedelics industry heavily depends on the outcome of clinical trials, which could either make or break its viability and potentially boost publicly traded companies. However, there is uncertainty regarding the legality of these medicines, and regulatory bodies like the US FDA are currently evaluating some drugs, which could lead to limited access to these substances. There are also ongoing efforts in the United States and Canada to better understand the psychedelics industry, and recent political adjustments have been made, such as Colorado's decision to decriminalize psychedelic mushrooms in drug centers for those aged 21 and above starting in 2024. An advisory board may also add more psychedelic drugs to the legal system in 2026. Oregon is currently the only other state that allows the medical use of psychedelic substances.Story continuesThe growth of the psychedelic drug market is being fueled by the rising number of cases of mental illness. In 2020, NAMI reported that 52.9 million people in the United States - equivalent to 21% of adults - were struggling with mental illness. This increase in mental health cases is a primary contributor to the expansion of the psychedelic drug market. Major players in the psychedelic drug market are Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK).

SGEN may be acquired by the large-cap pharma company Pfizer, Inc. PFE at a mind-numbing valuation of more than $30 billion, according to a Wall Street Journal (WSJ) article.Per the article, both companies have just initiated their rounds of negotiations and there is no guarantee of a deal at the moment. The follow-through of the deal banks on overcoming several hurdles which potentially include a strict antitrust review of any proposal.Seagen’s stock rallied 17% in pre-market hours in response to the news. In the past year, shares of Seagen have risen 25.2% against the industry’s fall of 11.8%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIf a deal is at all likely to happen, it would boost Pfizer’s portfolio of cancer drugs by adding a class of agents which have proven to be effective in working with immunotherapies against some of the most notorious tumors.The deal could also help Pfizer recover about $17 billion in sales, which the company expects to lose due to the expirations of some of its patents by 2030. The rumored acquisition aligns with Pfizer’s strategic goal of adding $25 billion in revenues by the end of 2030 by developing its business.Last year, Seagen was in advanced talks to be acquired by Merck &amp; Co., Inc. MRK at a valuation of $40 billion or more, per a WSJ article at the time. However, the deal did not follow through as the companies failed to reach an agreement.Seagen boasts a strong portfolio of cancer drugs as well.The company currently markets four cancer drugs — Adcetris, Padcev, Tukysa and the newly approved Tivdak.In 2022, Seagen recorded total revenues of approximately $2 billion, portraying an almost 25% increase from 2021 results.All these drugs have witnessed strong uptake so far, with Adcetris being the majority contributor to Seagen’s top line. The drug has been approved by the FDA for six cancer indications.Several label expansion studies on Adcetris, Padcev, Tukysa and Tivdak are currently underway, wherein a potential approval is likely to drive sales, rolling into 2023. A potential deal is likely to ensure a diversified and broader customer base for the company as it would include Pfizer’s market expertise and superior global presence.Story continuesSeagen is collaborating with Merck, wherein the latter is co-funding the Tukysa global development plan. A regulatory filing seeking approval of Seagen’s Padcev, in combination with Merck’s Keytruda, has been granted a priority tag and is currently under review by the FDA for treating muscle-invasive bladder cancer.Adecision from the FDA is expected on Apr 21, 2023.Also, Seagen and Merck are jointly developing ladiratuzumab vedotin, which is also currently being evaluated in early-to-mid-stage studies both as monotherapy and in combination with other agents for treating metastatic breast cancer and other LIV-1-expressing solid tumors.Seagen’s diversification into the treatment of a form of breast cancer could be of particular interest to Pfizer, the latter already having a top-selling drug, named Ibrance, treating the condition.We would also like to remind the investors that Pfizer acquired sickle cell drug maker, Global Blood Therapeutics, for more than $5 billion and the rest of Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holdings for more than $10 billion in 2022. This stands as proof of the strong cash position that Pfizer enjoys having made about $22.7 billion from sales of its COVID-19 vaccines, drugs and other products, last year.Seagen Inc.

WMB reported fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share of 53 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents. It also surpassed the year-ago period’s profit of 39 cents per share.

(The) Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseWilliams Companies, Inc. (The) price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Williams Companies, Inc. (The) QuoteSegmental AnalysisTransmission &amp; Gulf of Mexico: Comprising WMB’s massive Transco pipeline system and Northwest Pipeline, the segment generated adjusted EBITDA of $700 million, up 2.2% from the year-ago quarter. Overall, the growth of Transmission &amp; Gulf of Mexico was driven by the acquisition of NorTex, Transco's Leidy South project, and improved resilience to natural disasters.West: This segment focuses on the gathering and processing of assets in the Western region of the United States. It delivered an adjusted EBITDA of $326 million, 25.9% higher than $259 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.The better outcomes were mainly due to higher net realized commodity-based rates and greater Haynesville gathering volumes comprising contributions from Trace Midstream acquired in April.Northeast G&amp;P: The unit generated adjusted EBITDA of $464 million, up almost 1% from the prior-year quarter’s $459 million.The slight positive comparison was mainly because of Ohio Valley Midstream and gathering rate hikes. This was partly offset by lower Susquehanna volumes, higher operating and administrative costs, and lower net equity-investee contributions due to lower cost-of-service rates, lower volumes, and the impact of winter weather.Story continuesGas &amp; NGL Marketing Services: This unit generated adjusted EBITDA of $149 million, up significantly from the prior-year quarter’s $11 million.This segment's performance improved on the back of steady commodity margins, which involved reducing inventory values to reflect lower market prices at the quarter’s end.Costs, Capex &amp; Balance SheetIn the reported quarter, total costs and expenses of $1.85 billion were reduced by almost 20% compared with the year-ago quarter’s figure of $2.32 billion.Williams’ total capital investment was $876 million, up from $371 million a year ago.As of Dec 31, 2022, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $152 million and long-term debt of $21.9 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization of almost 61%.2023 GuidanceWMB anticipates its 2023 adjusted EBITDA in the $6.4-$6.8 billion range, and growth capital spending in the $1.4-$1.7 billion range.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 20 Years.On February 24, the Bureau of Economic Analysis released the Personal Income and Outlays for January 2023 which revealed that the PCE price index recorded a 0.6% increase in January. The PCE price index has gone up by 5.4% over the 12-month period from January 2022 to January 2023. Stocks went down after the announcement, with the S&amp;P 500 closing below 4,000, the Nasdaq Composite closing below 11,500, and the Dow closing below 33,000.Shortly after the BEA released the PCE numbers for January 2023, Fitz-Gerald Group Principal Keith Fitz-Gerald appeared on Yahoo Finance to discuss what this means for the Fed and how investors should position themselves. The sell-off on Friday was not a result of inflation, and was instead a result of ""the amount of leverage that's being carried"", noted Fitz-Gerald. According to Keith Fitz-Gerald, ""if the Fed wants to raise more aggressively, all of these huge traders that are leveraged up to their eyeballs are not gonna want to carry that because it costs them more money"".Keith Fitz-Gerald sees pressure into the second quarter of 2023 and he thinks that ""the Fed might have to admit that it was wrong about rates and labor as it was about transitory"". Here are some comments from Keith Fitz-Gerald:""I think, right now, the markets will correct themselves as investors figure out that their best friends are going to be companies. (Companies) that are still putting up great numbers, that still got great dividends, that are still moving forward into this market, because those are the kind of plays that you want to go for.""We have compiled a list of 22 most profitable stocks of the last 20 years that have managed to weather economic downturns and generate huge profits.

We like the company’s track record of innovation, and its diversified portfolio of drugs. However, we’ve become increasingly concerned about the outlook for some of its recently launched therapeutics, as well as some generic competition in a few of its mature drugs. If pressed, we still like the odds that Novartis will do well, but the outlook is a little cloudier than it’s been in a while. As noted above, we’ve been big fans of its Alcon unit for many years, and now that Alcon is independent, we decided to concentrate our investment there.”17.

Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”15. Verizon Communications Inc.

(NYSE:VZ), which was a disappointing investment, on concerns that the company is losing market share in a very competitive business and because we believed we had better use for the funds elsewhere.”14. TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE)Average Net Income: $11.53 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 21At the end of Q4 2022, 21 hedge funds held positions in TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE). The total value of these positions was $1.93 billion. This is compared to 22 hedge funds in the previous quarter with stakes worth $1.56 billion.In fiscal 2022, TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) generated an annual net income of $20.53 billion. The company has generated an annual net income of $11.53 billion, on average, over the last 20 years. TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) is ranked fourteenth on our list of the most profitable stocks of the last 20 years.As of December 31, Alyeska Investment Group is the top investor in TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) and has disclosed a position worth $60.5 million in the company.Here is what Artisan Partners had to say about TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“We added one new position this quarter, TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE). TTE is one of the world’s largest energy companies. It develops and produces oil and gas, produces and sells refined products, is one of the largest producers and traders of LNG, and owns a large portfolio of renewable power generating assets. TTE has one of the lowest cost portfolios of oil and gas assets and therefore one of the lowest breakeven points in the industry. It also has one of the best balance sheets in the industry. We estimate it will reach a net cash position sometime in 2023.The valuation of TTE—and that of Shell—is fascinating. TTE sells at approximately 4X earnings and has a 5% dividend yield. With its current buyback program and a recently announced special dividend, the owners yield is more than 10%. The valuation and owners yield are not dissimilar to those of Shell, which we also own and which trades at just under 5X earnings. To say that a discount is attached to European oil companies relative to US peers is an understatement. Exxon Mobil sells at 8X earnings, Chevron 9X and Conoco 8X. If TTE and Shell redomiciled to the US, their share prices would probably double.We have a few theories for the valuation anomaly. First, as mentioned above, Europe generally trades at a big discount to the US. In the case of TTE and Shell, this makes no economic sense. The oil and gas business is a global one, and TTE and Shell have attractive assets. The main explanation, we believe, is that large sections of the European asset management industry will not invest in oil and gas because of ESG restrictions. Yet if the recent war in Ukraine and the current energy crisis have shown us nothing else, the supply of energy is an enormous social good. Indeed, it is an existential good. Moreover, it is companies such as TTE that will invest billions to supply the LNG that Europe desperately needs to restore its economy and reduce the crushing cost burden on families who must now choose between heating their homes and eating. Finally, TTE is also investing billions per year in renewable power generating assets such as wind and solar. Such assets will likely never replace clean burning natural gas and nuclear as base power suppliers, but they are a valuable and clean adjunct to modern grids. We believe TTE’s renewable portfolio is worth between $25 billion and $35 billion and is moving from almost no profit contribution toward meaningful levels of profit over the next few years. We wonder how it makes sense for investors to disinvest from these kinds of assets on ethical grounds.”13. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Average Net Income: $12.67 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 84On January 24, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) posted earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022.

(NYSE:PFE) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Labs, global pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG). Although Pfizer continues to report strong performance of its core drugs, sales of its COVID vaccine and treatment have likely peaked and sales are expected to decline going forward. We remain optimistic about the company long term as we believe management is taking the company in the right direction, focusing R&amp;D, and making strategic acquisitions with profits generated from COVID vaccine sales.”11. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Average Net Income: $12.93 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Walmart Inc.

As of December 31, GQG Partners is the top investor in Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and has a position worth $993.2 million in the company.Here is what Leaven Partners had to say about Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”10.

Despite the positives of higher interest rates and the company making good progress on reducing expenses and regulatory consent orders, Wells Fargo shares have fallen one-third from their highs earlier this year to roughly 6.5x our estimate of normalized earnings power, and the stock ended the quarter at ~1x next year’s tangible book value. We find this is far too cheap for a strong banking franchise capable of tangible returns in the low-to-mid teens across business cycles.”8.

We added leading financial institution Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) which serves individual consumers, small and middle-market businesses, and large corporations with a full range of banking, investing, asset management, and other financial and risk management products and services. The current company was formed through various mergers including NationsBank, FleetBoston, US Trust, Countrywide Financial, and Merrill Lynch with the legacy commercial bank to form a national banking powerhouse and bulge bracket investment firm. As one of the ‘Big Four’ U.S. banks it enjoys scale driven cost advantages and economies of scale which provide meaningful competitive advantages and potential for strong returns in the largely commoditized banking industry.

We sold our position at that time due to heightened risk associated with operations in Kazakhstan, which sends oil through a pipeline that runs through Russia out to the Black Sea. When Russia invaded Ukraine, we believed there was real risk that something would happen to inhibit Chevron’s ability to get that oil to the market. We didn’t believe that risk was reflected in the stock price, so we sold our position. Today, 10+ months into the Ukraine crisis, more information has become available regarding the Kazakhstan operations, and the associated risks are now well-known. We believe those risks are fully priced into the current stock valuation. Chevron is one of the best operators in its field, with a diversified portfolio and strong management, and we took the opportunity to reinvest when the stock was trading below our estimate of intrinsic value.”6.

(Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Mills of ICR. Please go ahead.John MillsGood afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss ICU Medical's financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2022. On the call today representing ICU Medical is Vivek Jain, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman; and Brian Bonnell, Chief Financial Officer. We have a presentation accompanying today's prepared remarks. To view the presentation please go to our Investor page and click on Events Calendar, and it will be under the fourth quarter 2022 events. Before we start our prepared remarks, I want to touch upon any forward-looking statements made during the call, including beliefs and expectations about the company's future results. Please be aware they are based on the best available information to management and assumptions that are reasonable. Such statements are not intended to be a representation of future results and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Future results may differ materially from management's current expectations. We refer you to the company's SEC filings for more detailed information on the risks and uncertainties that have a direct bearing on operating results and financial position. Please note, during today's call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including results on an adjusted basis. We believe these financial measures can facilitate a more complete analysis and grander transparency into ICU Medical's ongoing results of operations, particularly when comparing underlying results from period to period. We've also included a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures in today's release and provided as much detail as possible on any addendums that are added back. And with that, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Vivek.Story continuesVivek JainThanks, John. Good afternoon, everybody, and we hope you're well. We could not be happier that 2022 is over. We are operationally running better and getting back to serving hospitals with at least an equal balance of time between internal self-help versus external customer focus. At a high level, the macro environment is easing a bit with finally some relief in the economic volatility in the supply chain that we've been talking about for 6 straight quarters. Freight, fuel and foreign exchange started to trend in a better direction at the end of Q4. And while raw material and rollover labor inflation is real, at least some of the global surge pricing has retreated albeit above historical levels. U.S. and international demand was stable in Q4 with the U.S. having the same trends as Q3 in admissions with lower acuity. Like everyone in our industry, we want to start first by thanking all of our customers and their frontline workers for trusting us to serve you during these times. We cut a lot of the boilerplate out of the script today, and we'll use the time to address the following: the results for legacy ICU and compare the full year results to our original expectations at the beginning of last year, explain Smiths Medical's revenues for Q4, confirm our reporting alignment starting in 2023, which was foreshadowed on the last call and shown in the recent investor conference now with our view of revenue growth by business unit, reflecting our substantial earnings miss in 2022 with a recap of the main drivers, discuss what comes back in the short term of this year, what's still available in the medium term and what is permanent, update on the normal housekeeping items, including quality remediation and integration and separation status, outline our key short-term priorities and close with a few thoughts on self-help and value creation before Brian takes us through the financials in more detail. I'll summarize Q4 2022 whole company results and then discuss each of the businesses. We finished the quarter with $565 million in adjusted revenue. Adjusted EBITDA came in at $96 million, and adjusted EPS was $1.60. We had a comparable quarter of investment into the business, and again, it was largely about inventory build that Brian will describe. Gross margins were influenced by a high rate of spend to improve the service levels of Smiths Medical and we had restructuring and integration costs that will reduce in 2023 as we focus on working capital and free cash flow like we did relentlessly for many years. Currency was a net headwind for the quarter but did improve towards the end of the quarter. So let me start with legacy ICU Medical, where we had $313 million in revenue which was down 2% on a constant currency basis and down 5% reported. Now with the minimal COVID impact in Q4, U.S. demand across all the product lines was good. The quarter started out a bit softer in October, but was very healthy in the last 2 months, but a little more explanation is required here on 2 items. First, like a few other companies, we did have an accrual related to certain historical potential Italian tax liabilities for IV consumables and IV systems, which was somewhere between 2% to 3% of revenue. Second, we had a shortfall in IV solutions, mostly due to Pfizer being down on the one remaining product format that they provide to us. As Brian will explain, neither of these had any material impact on earnings as we had some offsets on the first issue, and IV Solutions margin contribution is limited currently. Starting as usual with Infusion Consumables, which is our largest business. Infusion Consumables had revenues of $141 million, which was flat sequentially and down 2% constant currency, down 5% reported year-over-year, again impacted by the previous comments. Going a bit deeper, our U.S. results were very solid in Q4 with our best quarter in the last 2 years. For the full year, we finished at $567 million in revenues, in which we had minimal oncology growth as we were capacity constrained until very recently. Final annual results showed growth of 5% constant currency, in line with our comments on this call last year of mid-single digits. That is the largest our business has ever been and essentially all the supply chain and product constraints that hit us after a strong operational 2021 are reaching resolution for the legacy ICU portfolio. We have just gotten back to stability, good focus on our clinical impact, and some of our customers were talking about their clinical improvements in our mutual areas of focus on their earnings calls last week. Moving to Infusion Systems, which is primarily our LVP pumps and associated dedicated sets. This business united $89 million in adjusted revenue, which was an increase of 1% on a constant currency basis or minus 4% on a reported basis. Dedicated disposables were average, we would say, in Q4 with the lower acuity in hospitals, but we had a good hard work quarter. We continue to believe, as we said on the previous few calls, the customer attention is back with bandwidth have real discussions as some of the fatigue from COVID is passing and the acceptance of inflation and the cost of nursing, et cetera, have been internalized. Yes, the stresses of the current environment do make it a bit bumpier for decision-making, but we don't believe over the medium term, relative to our size, there's any change to our competitive opportunity, and we are focused on commercial execution here. For the year, the business unit finished at $351 million with over $10 million in currency headwinds, which aligns with our comments of $360 million or so on this call last year with the largest base of LVP pumps in the market we've ever had. Our Plum platform did win the best-in-class ranking for multiple years in a row now, we had the best year of competitive installations, and we look forward to a more action-oriented market. Finishing the business unit discussion with Infusion Solutions. We had $71 million in adjusted revenues, down 7% on a year-over-year basis. This was primarily due to a single product family that we are in the last year or so sourcing from Pfizer Rocky Mount, where we had a supply interruption and to a much lesser degree, a few product shortfalls in our own operations. These results had minimal impact on company earnings as this business unit has disproportionately absorbed the majority of inflation at legacy ICU. We'll skip the whole boilerplate today on rational markets, et cetera. The short story for IV solutions, where we're the global #4 player ex Japan is essentially the value of the product and its pricing are out of line. Investors can review the situation of the larger public players on their own. Okay. Let me move to the Smiths businesses. The Smiths Medical revenues came in at $252 million, with Infusion Systems at $99 million, Vascular Access at $75 million and Vital Care at $77 million. We had productivity gains on a per day basis shipping again. The message here is Infusion Systems and Vital Care had the best quarter since we've owned the business, and Vascular Access continues to be a work in progress, as we've mentioned. I'll come back to tie out the whole revenue picture on Smiths versus history momentarily, but just to comment on how the fulfillment of these products feels to customers is much better. Back orders, as defined by improved service and clearing out of panic ordering have decreased more than 65% since the misery of last Q2. That has enabled us to be more reliable for customers and to finally engage on rebuilding the trust and service as the products have always been well linked. From a big picture perspective on Smiths revenues, in our recent investor deck, we've tried to simply lay out the revenue variances for Smiths as compared to historical results. Smiths 2022 was about $150 million below normalized historical results ex COVID. $50 million of that was currency FX and the balance was roughly down $30 million in infusion systems down $20 million in tracheostomy and patient warming, both of which we would call self-inflicted challenges and down $40 million in Vascular Access, which is more a combination of self-inflicted and competitive challenges. It's worth noting that the Vascular Access products are the most synergistic with our core legacy ICU consumables business, and so we do believe we have a right to win here over time. In terms of this year, we foreshadowed on the last call and showed at the January IR conference how we would expect to realign our reporting business units. Our largest business will be consumables, which would contain legacy ICU IV consumables, most of legacy Smiths Medical vascular access and tracheostomy. We would expect this business to be a mid-single-digit grower in 2022, like ICU consumables has been with some puts and takes, intra-business unit. Consistent with the last call, production and operations for this pillar has improved with work needed on the Vascular Access commercial execution. The second business will be an Infusion Systems unit containing all legacy ICU IV pumps combined with most of the legacy Smiths Medical Infusion Systems business unit and the associated dedicated disposables. We think service levels and quality for most of this pillar should be improved in 2023 and would expect it to be a mid-single-digit grower also. This business went up almost all the capital sales of the company and a reminder that that's less than 15% of total company sales and includes software service accessories, et cetera. The third business will be Vital Care combining legacy ICU IV solutions, Critical Care and the remainder of what is in the legacy Smiths Medical Vital Care business unit. We would expect that business to be flat plus -- to potentially plus or minus a little. These revenue estimates assume no deterioration in the current level of health care utilization and the adoption of the recent EU MDR legislation allowing for MDD certificate extensions. These are our expected growth rates even when not adjusting for our exit from the Indian market and from China pumps, which equaled about $15 million in revenues or another point of growth in the first 2 pillars. So that's our view of revenues and now let's move to earnings. Our miss in 2022 on earnings was painful to say the least and on the order of $100 million EBITDA from our original expectations. While painful, I did want to spend a moment walking through that bridge, and it sets the stage for the comparison to this year's expectation and the value discussion on which of these are solvable over the medium term via normalizing to historical revenue levels, share recapture, price and which are permanent hits to value. The 2 largest drivers of variance to earnings in 2022 were freight and logistics costs and foreign exchange currency at over $50 million of EBITDA combined. Those were followed by Smiths revenue shortfalls, which cost at least another $30 million in EBITDA and then surge pricing and inflation, which was also a $30 million-plus hit to EBITDA. Those were collectively offset by the achievement of more synergies, which brought the net back to $100 million. A good portion of this is reflected in our gross margin rate, which Brian will go through in more detail. A number of these items do start to improve in 2023, but continuing and rollover inflation is real, and we don't want to make a mistake given what we went through last year. Our current midpoint of the guidance range for EBITDA in 2023 is $400 million with EPS generally in line with 2022 due to increased interest costs, as we talked about in last month's investor meetings. We believe revenue growth will be acceptable for our 2 highly differentiated businesses, but we still have work to do to offset inflationary effects and smooth out the production operations. We spared no expense last year in the supply chain, raw material procurement, et cetera, and that shows in inventories, which positions us well to the customer, but there are some knock-on impacts of smoothing out the production environment. Just a few notes on the housekeeping front, then I'll come back to priorities and value. On quality, nothing new on the pump decisions we explained in the last 2 calls. We have been going through our normal scheduled series of notified body inspections. What is new is an FDA inspection, probably a bit earlier than we've anticipated. We've made progress in addressing the root causes of the Smiths Medical warning letter received in late 2021, but we still have more work to do. So hopefully, these inspections serve as a good checkpoint to the state of progress we've made after only owning the business for 13 months. This part feels very similar to Hospira and our collective previous experiences, and we have the right people who have been through the exact same experiences, and our team is fully embedded into the operation. Same speech on the warning letter, the existence of a warning letter while undesirable is the regulatory agency trying to move the ball forward, and we talked about how these regulations give us the right to participate. We believe we're making progress in solidifying the foundation and hope to be in a position where we can demonstrate further progress as soon as possible. Again, regardless of where it appears on the P&amp;L, we're spending heavily here, so making progress is extremely important. On the operational issues, I think we can stop talking about this now. We just need to focus on running a predictable production network. Given that there is a new topic, we will start talking about this year as we're more stable and that is separation and integration. Unlike the Hospira transaction, where a lot of this was a one huge step activity, simultaneously separating and integrating systems, the work here will happen in 2 steps. Over the next few months, we'll separate IT systems from Smiths, giving us full control of the support and specs and then later in the year and into next year, undertake the actual integration of the business. These are important steps because like Hospira, they allow for next level synergy capture across the manufacturing network, supply chain and functional support areas. We did these well for Hospira, and we'll try to make system separation or cutover activities happened at the beginning of quarters in case of any knock-on impacts, but we wanted to mark that they were happening. We have a clear sense of our priorities for 2023. I'd summarize those as: Deliver revenue growth as expected in our differentiated business units while progressing the key product platforms; progress and potentially resolve items and ensure quality for patients and high compliance for regulatory authorities, respectively; focus on cash flow again, by improving working capital and addressing all the available items on the P&amp;L, whether above or below the line. We have the groundwork via separation and then integration for capture of the remaining synergies and rationalize the portfolio, which becomes easier after separation and stability. To bring it back to some of the self-help and thoughts on value creation before Brian takes us through the financials in more detail. There are a number of self-help items that are available to us over the medium term to improve our earnings performance outside of revenue growth. I'll highlight the top 3 that are on our mind again, and they are largely all about longer-term gross margin improvement. The first is reducing the $240 million we spent in 2022 on freight and logistics. We've assumed some improvements for 2023, but medium term, these costs need to continue to be reduced. The second is capturing the next wave of synergies in manufacturing, supply chain procurement, real estate and functional support over time. That's why moving our separation forward from Smiths and away from Smiths and beginning our integration is so important. The third may be the smallest of the list, but it's getting to be a level-loaded -- to run a level-loaded smoother manufacturing operation. We do believe there's $1 to $2 in earnings per share by getting these items right over the medium term. If we reflect on what we did with legacy ICU by profitizing our core business, even after taking on substantial inflation since early 2021 with a lot less margin from IV solutions, we believe we can execute on this list. In terms of revenue and portfolio fit and how that comes together with value creation, clearly, whether it's a return to historical levels due to consistent supply, or share recapture, the NPV of revenue increases is high as these are very sticky categories if one can avoid the self-inflicted harm that led to losses. There are a number of important U.S. contracts that do come up for renewal and repricing in 2024. On the portfolio, we continue to believe that we have strong individual assets in the specific underlying categories. We believe there are a number of Smiths businesses that have similar growth and economic traits to the legacy ICU consumables businesses. And while we don't want to give a hot average to earnings, we fully acknowledge we lost time. We did want to at least make it clear that there are a number of items over time that get us beyond our original expectations. Interest rates hurt us $1 a share right now but all the items we just ran through do help build value back and get our profitability levels closer to our expectations. We're getting back to the aggregate positioning of the combined portfolio and its relevance for customers and their reactions. Yes, the situation is harder than we expected, but the customer logic continues to make sense. Like with the Hospira transaction, we need to change the conversation from the historical perception to demonstrating our value through innovation and service. These portfolios make sense together, and we are working how to integrate them either literally or economically when sensible. And we do believe more doors are being opened as a result of having a broader set of items that are mandatory for care. We get that this needs to show up on the P&amp;L to prove that value. For legacy ICU, our most differentiated businesses ended 2022 larger than ever with appropriate profitability levels. That core premise of the Smiths transaction is to enhance the product offerings for these exact categories that drive our returns as well as add logical adjacencies predicated on the same characteristics of sticky categories, low capital intensity single-use disposables, opportunities to innovate and participate in a logical industry structure that can deliver that revenue and value growth we want to. The construction of the Smiths portfolio was logical and frankly, why it survived over all the years. While the pandemic introduced substantial volatility, strategically, we do think the weaknesses it exposed in the health care supply chain add to the argument for all participants to be healthy and stable, which has been our commentary since we became a full-line supplier. Smiths Medical also produces essential items that require significant clinical training, hold manufacturing barriers and in general, are items that customers do not want to switch unless they have to. The market needs Smiths Medical to be a reliable supplier and the combination positions us better. Our company has emerged stronger from all the events of the last few years. We've gotten knocked down a bit, but we see the hill to run up again together with our new colleagues to drive value out of the combination. Thank you to all the customers, suppliers and frontline health care workers as we improve each day. Our company appreciates the role each of us has to play. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian.Brian Michael BonnellThanks, Vivek, and good afternoon, everyone. To begin, I'll first walk down the P&amp;L and discuss our results for the fourth quarter and then move on to cash flow and the balance sheet before wrapping up the discussion with our guidance for 2023. So starting with the revenue line. Our fourth quarter 2022 GAAP revenue was $578 million, compared to $341 million last year, which is up 70% on a reported basis, reflecting the impact of the Smiths Medical acquisition. For your reference, the 2021 and 2022 adjusted revenue figures by business unit can be found on Slide #3 of the presentation. For the legacy ICU business, adjusted revenue for the quarter was $313 million compared to $330 million last year, which is down 2% on a constant currency basis and down 5% on a reported basis. Infusion Consumables was down 2% constant currency and down 5% reported. Infusion Systems was up 1% constant currency and down 4% reported and IV Solutions was down 7% on both a constant currency and reported basis. Note that the Q4 revenues for legacy ICU consumables and infusion systems were negatively impacted by a onetime revenue reserve related to the Italian government payback provision. This legislation, which was originally passed back in 2015, but only recently implemented, requires companies who have supplied medical devices to public hospitals in Italy to reimburse a portion of any budget overruns each year. Although we, along with others in the industry, plan to appeal the enforceability of the law and the underlying reimbursement calculations, we established a reserve during the quarter for amounts we could be required to pay going back to 2015. While this reduced our legacy ICU consumables and Infusion Systems' Q4 growth rates by 2 to 3 percentage points, the impact to revenues and earnings at a consolidated company level was minimal as it was mostly offset by onetime revenues within the legacy Smiths Medical business. After considering the Italian government payback provision, we were pleased with the results for the legacy ICU Consumables and Infusion Systems businesses as compared to a very strong Q4 '21 that benefited from the Omicron/COVID surge. For the fourth quarter, the Smiths Medical business contributed $252 million in revenue. Compared to the third quarter, this represents a sequential quarter decline of $10 million. However, as we noted on our last earnings call, the Smiths Medical historical financial reporting calendar resulted in 5 additional business days during the third quarter and we estimated that those 5 additional business days accounted for approximately $20 million of additional revenue. Adjusting for the additional days would imply a sequential revenue increase of approximately $10 million from Q3 to Q4. This underlying increase was the result of continued operational improvements, plus the previously mentioned benefit of certain onetime revenues, mostly within the Infusion Systems business. Note that the legacy Smiths Medical results were not impacted by the Italian payback provision. As we've previously discussed, for the first year after the acquisition, we maintained the legacy ICU and Smiths Medical business unit reporting structure to provide transparency and insight into underlying performance of the individual legacy businesses. But now that we have a full year of operating as a combined business, in 2023, we will migrate to our new 3 business unit reporting structure of Consumables, Infusion Systems and Vital Care. Slide #4 of the presentation highlights the key product lines that comprise these 3 business units and provides the 2022 revenues for each, which will serve as our baseline as we move forward. As you can see from the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in the press release, for the fourth quarter, our adjusted gross margin was 36%. Relative to the third quarter, gross margin of 35%. This represents a sequential improvement of 1 percentage point, driven by a combination of price increases, along with modest benefits from lower logistics costs. But during the quarter, we continued to be impacted by the same items that have pressured margins all year. For the full year, our adjusted gross margin was 36%, whereas heading into 2022, we originally expected it to be 40% or 4 percentage points higher. While we've previously discussed the drivers of this difference, which fall into a few distinct categories, it's worth recapping. The first category was increased manufacturing costs driven by raw material cost increases and labor rate inflation, which negatively impacted adjusted gross margin by approximately 2 percentage points. The second category was increased logistics expenses related to higher market prices for freight and diesel as well as air freight and other forms of expedited shipping to customers incurred primarily to address legacy Smiths Medical operational challenges, which combined was worth an additional 2 percentage points. In the final category is foreign exchange, which had a 1 percentage point negative impact to adjusted gross margin for the year as a result of the strengthening U.S. dollar. These negative margin drivers were partially offset by improved pricing later in the year and some benefit from product mix. While we expect to meaningfully reduce our spending on expedited freight during 2023, and we could see some benefit from lower diesel prices, we believe the majority of the manufacturing cost increases and about half of the logistics increases are permanent in the short term, and we will have to offset these through a combination of operational synergies and price increases over the next few years. Adjusted SG&amp;A expense was $107 million in Q4 and adjusted R&amp;D was $23 million. Both of these were the same level as the third quarter and benefited from deferred spending and lower incentive compensation expense. Restructuring, integration and strategic transaction expenses were $10 million in the fourth quarter and related primarily to integration of the Smiths Medical acquisition. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.60 compared to $1.82 last year. The current quarter results reflect net interest expense of $20 million, an adjusted effective tax rate of 22.1% and diluted shares outstanding of 24.3 million. And finally, EBITDA for Q4 increased 50% to $96 million compared to $64 million last year. Now moving on to cash flow and the balance sheet. For the quarter, free cash flow with a net outflow of $23 million, which was in line with our expectations as we continue to invest heavily into the 3 key areas of the business that we highlighted for the past several calls. The first is higher levels of inventory to bolster safety stock and allow for onboarding of new customers. Here, we invested almost $50 million in additional raw materials and finished goods inventory during the quarter, most of which was related to the Smiths Medical product lines in order to protect our manufacturing operations from supply disruptions and to replenish our distribution channels to better serve customers. The second was quality improvement initiatives for Smiths Medical, and during the quarter, we spent $21 million on quality system and product-related remediation. And the third area was the integration of the Smiths Medical business, where as previously mentioned, we spent $10 million on restructuring and integration. Additionally, we spent $22 million on CapEx for general maintenance and capacity expansion at our facilities as well as placement of revenue-generating infusion pumps with customers outside the U.S., which brought our total CapEx spending for 2022 to $90 million. And just to wrap up on the balance sheet, we finished the quarter with $1.7 billion of debt and $214 million of cash and investments. Moving forward to 2023, Vivek already provided some guidance related to our revenue expectations for each of the businesses, so I'll cover the rest of the P&amp;L and cash flow. Starting with adjusted EBITDA, we expect 2023 adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $375 million to $425 million. The majority of the earnings improvement relative to 2022 is expected to come from revenue growth within the Consumables and Infusion Systems business units plus the benefit of some gross margin expansion. This is offset somewhat by incremental spending most notably in the areas of temporary IT expenses as we move off the TSA during the year as well as higher compensation expense as we reset incentive compensation. While this guidance range is a bit wider than our typical approach, we believe it is warranted given the uncertainty in the current economic climate and the reality that the legacy Smiths Medical business isn't yet a stable and predictable as legacy ICU. For 2023 EPS, we expect to be in the range of $5.75 to $7.25 per share. The midpoint of this range is in line with our full year 2022 EPS of $6.51, and reflects the following year-over-year puts and takes. The first is approximately $1.25 of increase from $40 million of additional EBITDA based on the midpoint of our EBITDA guidance range. This is offset by approximately $1 impact from $30 million of higher interest expense on the unhedged portion of our debt, and a $0.25 impact from a more normalized tax rate in 2023. Moving along to the rest of the P&amp;L. We expect 2023 adjusted gross margin to be around 37%, which is an improvement relative to 2022 by 1 percentage point, driven by a combination of the impact of price increases and a reduction in freight expediting and diesel costs offset somewhat by continuing labor inflation at the plants. We are planning for operating expenses to increase mid- to high single digits reflecting the previously mentioned temporary IT investments needed to separate from the Smith TSA, the impact of resetting incentive compensation plans and general inflationary increases. Net interest expense is expected to be almost $100 million. The adjusted tax rate should be around 23%, reflecting our normalized tax rate. And finally, diluted shares outstanding are estimated to average 24.5 million during the year. Now on to cash flow. As mentioned earlier, during 2022, we invested heavily in additional inventory, quality system and product remediation and restructuring and integration. During 2023, we expect to spend at similar levels for quality system and product remediation, and we should see a step-down in restructuring and integration spend. But the most significant year-over-year improvement to cash flow is expected to come from slowing the build of inventory levels over the early part of the year and then maintaining or even slightly reducing those levels during the second half. This will allow us to get back to generating positive free cash flow in 2023. And finally, we expect our CapEx requirements in 2023 to be in the range of $100 million to $120 million. In summary, while 2022 was a very difficult year, the fourth quarter provided a glimpse of what getting back to normal can feel like. A lot of hard work and sizable financial investments have been made to stabilize the operations of the legacy Smiths Medical business. And while this work is not yet complete, our progress here allows us to shift some focus during 2023 to recapturing lost business and the deeper operational synergy opportunities. Our progress to date also allows us to remain convinced of the longer-term opportunity, financial returns and our ability to tackle the remaining issues. We look forward to providing updates on our progress. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over for any questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James..Jayson Tyler BedfordCan you hear me okay?Brian Michael BonnellPerfectly.Jayson Tyler BedfordThat was dense. There's a lot there. And I appreciate that.Vivek JainSo we were trying for thorough.Jayson Tyler BedfordYes. My head is exploding here with all of that. Just I guess maybe on the fourth quarter revenue, I get the, what, roughly $8 million decremental. But I think Brian mentioned this was offset by onetime revenue tied to Smith. Do I have this right? And then just as maybe a related question, what are you carrying in terms of Smiths backlog into '23? And is there any kind of backlog captured in what looks to be about 4% revenue growth in '23?Brian Michael BonnellYes, Jayson. Jayson, on the first question, yes, that's correct. On the Italy reserves, the amount you referred to was within the range. And we would say most of that impact was offset by some onetime revenues on the legacy Smiths Medical business, specifically within the Infusion Systems business of legacy Smiths Medical.Vivek JainOn the backlog question, it's been hard to triangulate, Jayson, how much of the backlog was real. It was a huge number. But even though we've worked it down, it's not like revenues went back up above historical levels, right? I think what was embedded in there was also, unfortunately, a lot of panic ordering, et cetera. And a lot of those have fizzled out now that we've been supplying more regularly so we're going get a truer sense of what the real run rate is with -- with recent losses, et cetera. At the current moment, probably on the order of $40 million or so of backlog into next year. That's kind of where it is right now. But I don't know that means additional revenue beyond what the normal rate is.Jayson Tyler BedfordOkay. So sorry, the $40 million, is that incremental on top of what would be a normalized backlog?Vivek JainNo. I think backlog for us has just been like a proxy for customer service levels at this point. I don't think that I would say it's additional revenue. It didn't work that way this year as we worked on the backlog, right? I think for me, it's much more that people are satisfied with our service and delivery levels.Jayson Tyler BedfordOkay. Okay. I think it was mentioned that price increases helped the gross margin in the fourth quarter, and that will continue into '23. Is there any way to kind of frame the size of the price increases and the impact that may have on topline in '23 as well?Vivek JainI don't think we want to get too specific, there's a lot of moving parts. I just think we've been doing what we should do given the inflation that we've taken and what other industry participants clearly have been doing, and I'd probably just leave it at that. We think we have good growth rates for Consumables and Infusion Systems for '23. A portion of that is priced.Jayson Tyler BedfordOkay. And then maybe I'll ask one more and I'll let others jump in. But Vivek, you did mention the FDA inspection, and I appreciate the transparency there, but just what is the kind of the scope and what are they looking at? I assume this is more of a scheduled, every couple of year inspection, but is there anything kind of specific that you're looking at?Vivek JainI think this is a follow-up to the items that got Smiths the warning letter in the fall of '21. And we had kind of instinctively thought it was going to be a little bit later. And so every day later, it's just more time to prepare and execute. It's happening sooner. So it will be a good checkpoint to how much progress we've made over the last year certainly but it was sooner than we thought it was going to be. And so I'd rather be transparent about that.Jayson Tyler BedfordYes. Our next question comes from Larry Solow with CJS Securities.Lawrence Scott SolowJust a couple of follow-ups, Vivek, maybe just on Smiths. The quality control issues, putting those aside because some of those I realize are somewhat out of your control and hard to probably guesstimate in terms of time. But just in terms of service, order fulfillment and all that other stuff that obviously had some issues and you've been sort of chasing the ball for several quarters now. Where do you -- I'm certainly seeing a lot of improvement in the last couple of quarters. Where do you think you stand there? Like are you -- if we use a baseball analogy, are we in the middle of the inning. So where are we there before you, just on fulfillment and stuff that I feel like is probably in your control, it just may take a little longer than you originally thought.Vivek JainI think we're -- and I know what team you like, I think we are halfway, I think we're halfway there. So middle innings because it is running better. You don't hear us talking about the physical logistics very much. Inventory is up $200 million. That means we're unable to produce. Now it's a different issue, how do we get the inventory down to the right level. But the other judgment is, is it all running at the right cost. So we sort of invested like crazy to buffer the supply chain and to overserve the customer to not lose more market share. That's the truth of what happened last year. But we did that at any expense and that's what pressured the P&amp;L so much in a broad-based inflationary environment. So part of that doesn't go away, right? There's labor embedded in logistics costs. There's labor embedded in production costs. But the things that are addressable, we need to get those back before we say it's running, right. It's not just the service levels, are we running ourselves efficiently. Our operating margin sticks, right, relative to the categories we purchased.Lawrence Scott SolowSo there is extra dollars that eventually will -- you probably can't quantify today, but forgetting the freight and all the other -- the impediments to your earnings. But just there are excess expense -- like you said, you're spending at all costs. It sounds like not only a capital operating...Vivek JainI mean that's why we wait -- we try to go through all that minutia in the script there because that's exactly the point we were trying to...Lawrence Scott SolowAnd is that -- in that big range of earnings, you basically said it to our guidance a little bit, like you said, wider than normal. Is that just -- is that strictly -- I mean it sounds like you said basically Smiths, right about that...Vivek JainIt is basically Smiths' results and then inflation on the solutions portion of legacy ICU to get that back under control. We don't want to go through what we went through last year, Larry, right? And the world has not settled yet. A lot of these currencies still move in international, they are still moving. We don't want to do that.Lawrence Scott SolowOkay. I know on price, for competitive reasons, you can't talk too much about it. But -- and it sounds like you said, your business, there's a disproportionate business that's being impacted the most. And like you said, you're not even solutions business, you said a couple of times on today's call, essentially not even profitable, right, which is not sustainable, right? So I'm curious like -- I don't know what you could say to that, but you mentioned you're the third or fourth largest provider. Are the other guys -- or is there anything movement from the other -- everyone else just sitting there and waiting? I feel like even across all these other health care industries, contracts are being renegotiated? Or in its case, it just seems dramatic, like that you can't get in there for another 1.5 years. But is there any movement...Vivek JainI think this is a very -- it's a topic we should not be talking about here, right? We've got our own business to run, and we're going to do it for...Lawrence Scott SolowThat's fair. Okay. Great. Last question, just on free cash flow, Brian. Can you give us some idea? It sounds like it's going to be -- we certainly improved last year from a big usage. Is it going to be just modestly positive? Is there any more color on that? And -- just kind of -- and the second question is -- last question on just debt reduction. I know originally, when the acquisition closed, we thought a couple of years you can get yourself down. Do you have any more -- any updated target on when you can reduce leverage?Brian Michael BonnellYes. I mean on free cash flow, I think the potential range for '23 is a bit wide, just given the fact that we invested so heavily in '22. And I think that's going to be largely dependent on how quickly we can get to the right inventory levels and moderate or even reduce them. And so you'll probably see most of that benefit come in the second half of the year. And then as it relates to debt paydown, I think what we just outlined in terms of guidance assumes no debt paydown this year. But I think, of course, depending on how quickly we get back to positive free cash flow generation will ultimately determine when we can begin to pay down debt. Not sure if it's this year, but we just need to get to positive free cash flow first.OperatorOur next question comes from Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc.Matthew Ian MishanKind of a follow-up to that previous question. I guess, when is the IT implementation scheduled to occur? And how are you thinking about portfolio rationalization and potential asset sales ahead of that IT implementation?Vivek JainSure, Matt. This is a little bit different than our other deals where we had to literally integrate, cut over and integrate on day 1. Here, we take control of the system and we can run it on our own and support it, which is good because it still is even shaky a little bit in the fourth quarter. That will happen most likely if everything stays on schedule in the April, May time frame. Once we separate, then we have control of it, and it's our choice of how quickly to pursue the next action, which is the integration, that integration is valuable to us because it leads to all these next level synergies that we were outlining on the call. So we would like to do that sooner rather than later. It doesn't come for free. There's a cost to doing that. Let's remember what we went through with Hospira. But certainly, being separate allows more degrees of freedom of what we want to do on pieces of the portfolio because we actually have a system that we can make choices about what can go or stay with a given business. I don't want to -- I would say, big picture, systems are secondary in terms of creating value in that discussion versus business performance, returns, et cetera, and having everything going in the right direction. So it's a component. It's not the sole driver in the line you're going down.Matthew Ian MishanOkay. I think that's fair. And then I think you answered this question in a different way -- I'll ask it a little bit differently. You have a wide range. I get that you want to be conservative and the macro is still fairly uncertain. Just can you point to 2 or 3 of the major swing factors that would get you from the low end to the high end, as you kind of look at like the big moving pieces?Brian Michael BonnellI think if you were to start with kind of the more macroeconomic items, certainly, FX, we saw in '22 what an impact that can have in a negative direction. And so certainly, that's something that can have a meaningful impact to our results. And then on the commercial side, I think that there's probably some opportunities there, especially within the legacy Vascular Access business, that could probably -- where we probably have some upside if we are able to get back some of that business that could...Vivek JainWe tried to give the exact bridge the missing 100, right, the missing 100 -- the $100 million variance, Brian, there's examples in gross margin, right? Some of the gross margins up is permanent, right? Labor is permanent -- labor is staying permanent for 2 years. Some of the raw material increases are absolutely permanent. And then there's some surge stuff that is going to go away. There is the macro on FX and fuel but it always comes back to revenues, right? And we have $100 million less of high-margin revenues that went away. We've got to figure out how to get those back. That's how we get the overall return to where we want it. And we kind of say, what were those buckets of what was missing? You can make your own call and the individual components there and the market structures of those categories. The ones that we feel are self-inflicted, there's no reason we shouldn't be out there trying to take those market shares back. The ones that have competitive challenges, we have to execute and go win.Matthew Ian MishanIs that separate -- I think I caught a comment where you said you were going to maintain a higher level of inventory that could help on -- for onboarding new customers. I guess I'm just -- when I hear that, it seems like you guys are going to go after revenue growth incremental to customers you already have. But I guess it's also to a point, I mean, by having that higher inventory, do you think you can get back some of the customers -- some of the sales that you may have lost with existing customers? Is that completely two separate items or a single item with the inventory?Vivek JainWell, it's a little bit of what we experienced with Hospira, right? We bought a situation that was challenged, and we went on a global apology tour. And if you want to get some pieces of business back, you do have to make commitments about your reliability and your ability to supply because people only left because they couldn't get the product from Smiths. And so we do have to show better levels of inventory, and we do have to make some commitments around it. So that's just called putting more money into the transaction, right? That's what I was saying we lost time and we cost a little bit more capital, but we have to get a return on that by getting the business back.Matthew Ian MishanAnd then last one. I hate to ask a near-term question like this, but it just -- it does seem like you had a good November, December and then January and February what it seems like from an outside perspective, it seems relatively steady. Is this kind of the steadiest environment you guys have seen in a very long time? And is that translating to more confidence in the business?Vivek JainI don't know if that's a short-term question. That is a question about how does this feel versus 2021, '22. I think on the legacy ICU business, the Consumables business is the biggest it's ever been. And so that has compounded nicely. We feel okay. The LVP business, it's the biggest it's been since we've had it. We're still disappointed we didn't kind of get as much as we would have liked over the last few years. I would say both those businesses has been reasonably predictable for the last 3 or 4 or 5 quarters and the issues that made them even slightly unpredictable there, the lack of supply in oncology, et cetera, are all being improved. I don't want to say it's exactly they're smooth with the Smiths portfolio yet. But it's like anything. We've had our control on it for 3 or 4 quarters. So yes, it is getting better each day, but there's still a lot of work to do on the Smiths portfolios, right? We'll judge that if we can get those lost revenues back.OperatorThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Vivek Jain for any closing remarks.Vivek JainThanks for your continued interest in ICU Medical. We're glad '22 is over. We look forward to '23, and we look forward to updating you very soon because Q1 call will be here before we know it. Thanks, everyone. Appreciate it.OperatorThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.]"

To skip our detailed analysis of the pharmaceutical sector, you can go directly to see the Top 5 Drug Companies in USA and Their China Reliance.The US has long been reliant on China for the upkeep of several industries. The most notable of these industries are the semiconductor and healthcare sectors. With the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, America's widespread reliance on China became increasingly evident because of a sharper light being shed on US-Chinese manufacturing and supply chains. With the pandemic first breaking out in China and reducing exports from the Asian country to others, shortages of critical medical supplies in the US made the latter's heavy reliance on the former clearer than ever.Top US drug producers such as Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) were found to be just as heavily reliant on China as smaller medical companies. Many American drug companies have manufacturing and supply chain infrastructure set up in China, causing this reliance. According to a report published by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean in  2021, the US imported about $105.32 billion worth of medical products and equipment, including medical imaging, diagnostic, and oxygen therapy equipment, in 2019 alone. China was recorded as the second-largest supplier of these products and equipment. During the first nine months of 2020, pharmaceutical imports from China to the US increased by 46%, with 69% of the imports being active pharmaceutical ingredients and 27% of the imports being pharmaceutical preparation products.President Biden has been taking steps to curb the US reliance on China when it comes to the healthcare sector and elsewhere. In September 2022, Biden signed an executive order to boost domestic manufacturing in the biotech sector to increase American self-sufficiency in this area. However, it is unclear how this objective can be attained since China is a major manufacturer of active pharmaceutical ingredients to India, which is conversely a major supplier of generic drugs to the US. Ever since China acceded to the World Trade Organization in 2001, it began focusing on economic growth through the expansion of its pharmaceutical industry. As a result of this, the country devoted itself to producing basic chemicals and active pharmaceutical ingredients. Consequently, it is unsurprising that the country today is a lead supplier of these ingredients by volume in the global market. In some markets specifically, China has increased its share of the US import markets. For instance, the market for penicillin saw an increase in the Chinese share from 1% to 51%, while the antibiotics market saw an increase of the country's share from 15% to 37%. This increase occurred over the 10 years preceding 2021. As the situation currently stands, it will be difficult for the US to disengage itself from the Chinese manufacturing and supply chain infrastructure. Hence, many major American companies have a huge stake in the Chinese pharmaceutical market, leading to their increased presence in the country.Story continuesTop 10 Drug Companies in USA and Their China ReliancePhoto by Christina Victoria Craft on UnsplashLet's now take a look at the top 10 drug companies in USA and their China reliance.Our MethodologyWe have selected pharmaceutical companies in the US with the highest revenues in the sector as of 2021 and a strong reliance on China. They are ranked based on these revenues, from the lowest to the highest. These companies are heavily reliant on China since they source a variety of their raw materials from the country. They also have a large presence in the Chinese market, making China one of their most profitable consumer markets to date. We have also mentioned analyst price targets and ratings for the stocks of these companies. In our list below, we go over key business fundamentals for these companies as well, such as their latest profit margins.Top Drug Companies in USA and Their China Reliance10. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN)Total Revenue in 2021: $16.07 billionRegeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) specializes in developing and commercializing drugs for the treatment of medical conditions such as cancer, eye diseases, and inflammatory disorders. Its top-selling drugs include Dupixent and Eylea.On January 31, Tyler Van Buren at Cowen upgraded Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) shares from Market Perform to Outperform. The analyst also placed an $875 price target on the stock.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) expects its Dupixent sales to reach almost $11 billion in 2023, representing an increase of about 30% compared to 2022 numbers. Dupixent is one of the company's top products recently approved in China for adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. This approval will likely increase Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:REGN) Dupixent sales significantly, making the company heavily reliant on continued Chinese use and approval.Bronte Capital, an investment management company, mentioned Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“There have been some bright spots in our long book. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN), a major position and a stock we wrote up in our June 2021 letter, has been one of the best performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 this year. Alas it has not been enough to offset some of our weaker stocks, let alone our overweight exposure to the UK (and Europe) which have suffered from both stock and currency weakness. We do not think we are bad at picking stocks on the long side and hope – reasonably we think – for better relative results in the future. Prior to COVID, our longs were markedly better than the index. Unfortunately, if you look at our long book this quarter and since the onset of the COVID pandemic, there is scant evidence that we have added any value by picking stocks to go long.”9. Amgen, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN)Total Revenue in 2021: $25.98 billionAmgen, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) is a biopharmaceutical company based in Thousand Oaks, California. Its top-selling drugs include Neulasta, Enbrel, and Prolia. These are used to treat a variety of medical conditions, such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoporosis.An Overweight rating was reiterated on Amgen, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) shares on January 19 by Piper Sandler's Christopher Raymond. The analyst also holds a $293 price target on the stock.Amgen, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) is considered a top drug company due to its consistent earnings growth and positive cash flows. The company generated a net total of $2.1 billion in cash flows during the third quarter. As of January 17, the company's stock also outperformed the SPDR S&amp;P 500 Trust ETF by 18.75% during the past 52 weeks. Amgen, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) is heavily reliant on its manufacturing facilities in China, where some of its top-selling drugs are produced. These include Enbrel, a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, and Prolia, a treatment for osteoporosis.8. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD)Total Revenue in 2021: $27.31 billionGilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) is a biopharmaceutical company that specializes in the development and commercialization of medicines for various diseases. It was founded in 1987 and is headquartered in Foster City, California.

(NASDAQ:GILD). The analyst also raised the firm's price target on the stock from $104 to $111.In the fourth quarter, Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) beat analyst revenue estimates by $900 million, or 15%. Its revenue for the quarter stood at $7.04 billion. The company has been a stable dividend payer for seven years now, and its yield currently stands at 3.5%. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) also has a significant presence in China, where a growing market for its drugs exists. As such, it is reliant on the country for a significant portion of its sales. The company also has a manufacturing and supply chain infrastructure established in the country for efficient production and distribution of its drugs.Ariel Investments, an investment management company, mentioned Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“At the stock level, biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) was the top contributor in the quarter based on positive data released in a study evaluating Trodelvy versus comparative chemotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer. The detailed findings increased investor confidence the drug would receive incremental approvals for a broader range of breast cancer treatments. Shares also received a boost on news the TAF patent portfolio for HIV drugs will be extended from the middle of this decade through the early 2030s, thereby lengthening the company’s long-term opportunity in the virology market.”Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD), like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), is among the most successful American drug companies with high revenue generation.7. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)Total Revenue in 2021: $28.3 billionEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is among the largest global healthcare companies. It is based in Indianapolis, Indiana. Some of its products include Alimta for non-small cell lung cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma, and Cyramza for metastatic gastric cancer.An Overweight rating was reiterated on Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) shares on January 3 by Carter Gould at Barclays.

The company has established an R&amp;D center in China for the development of new drugs for the Chinese market. Since it has a significant presence in the country, it also relies on Chinese patients for its clinical trials which help bring new medicines into the market quickly.Baron Funds, an investment management company, mentioned Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a large-cap pharmaceutical company. Shares increased on investor optimism about Lilly’s new product pipeline, which includes Mounjaro for diabetes and obesity and Donanemab for Alzheimer’s disease. We continue to think Lilly has a healthy base business with limited near-term patent expirations, a strong pipeline, and potential for significant margin expansion, which should translate to strong revenue and earnings growth over at least the next five years.”6. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Total Revenue in 2021: $43.08 billionAbbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is a healthcare company based in North Chicago, Illinois. It operates through its Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices segments.Matt Miksic at Barclays holds an Overweight rating on Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) shares as of January 27, alongside a $125 price target.Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) generated huge revenues during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Its revenues are further aided by its existing infant formula manufacturing facility in Jiaxing, China. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is also reliant on China for its medical device sales. In the fourth quarter of 2021, the company's medical devices sales came in at $3.75 billion, missing analyst estimates of $.84 billion because of China's COVID-19 curbs at the time.Stewart Asset Management, an investment management firm, mentioned Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“We also need to point out one global consequence of the rapid rise in interest rates: an irrepressibly strong dollar. This hurts the reported earnings of U.S. companies who sell their goods and services overseas. Foreign currency earnings translate into fewer dollars and thus lower earnings. Most of the companies in your portfolios gain a notable amount of earnings from their international operations. While the strength or weakness of a currency doesn’t change the quality of a business or its longer-term earnings power, it can change the reported earnings of a company over short periods of time. It is difficult to forecast this effect accurately because many of our companies manufacture where they sell, which to some extent dulls the sharp negative effect of a surging dollar. Abbott (NYSE:ABT), among others, is a good example.”Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), is a medical company with significant earnings and profitability today. Click to continue reading and see the Top 5 Drug Companies in USA and Their China Reliance. Suggested articles:15 Best Drug Stocks To BuyTop Drug Companies In the World in 202215 Most Advanced Countries in MedicineDisclosure: None.

The PCE price index has gone up by 5.4% over the 12-month period from January 2022 to January 2023. Stocks went down after the announcement, with the S&amp;P 500 closing below 4,000, the Nasdaq Composite closing below 11,500, and the Dow closing below 33,000.Shortly after the BEA released the PCE numbers for January 2023, Fitz-Gerald Group Principal Keith Fitz-Gerald appeared on Yahoo Finance to discuss what this means for the Fed and how investors should position themselves. The sell-off on Friday was not a result of inflation, and was instead a result of ""the amount of leverage that's being carried"", noted Fitz-Gerald. According to Keith Fitz-Gerald, ""if the Fed wants to raise more aggressively, all of these huge traders that are leveraged up to their eyeballs are not gonna want to carry that because it costs them more money"".Keith Fitz-Gerald sees pressure into the second quarter of 2023 and he thinks that ""the Fed might have to admit that it was wrong about rates and labor as it was about transitory"". Here are some comments from Keith Fitz-Gerald:""I think, right now, the markets will correct themselves as investors figure out that their best friends are going to be companies. (Companies) that are still putting up great numbers, that still got great dividends, that are still moving forward into this market, because those are the kind of plays that you want to go for.""We have compiled a list of 22 most profitable stocks of the last 20 years that have managed to weather economic downturns and generate huge profits.

We like the company’s track record of innovation, and its diversified portfolio of drugs. However, we’ve become increasingly concerned about the outlook for some of its recently launched therapeutics, as well as some generic competition in a few of its mature drugs. If pressed, we still like the odds that Novartis will do well, but the outlook is a little cloudier than it’s been in a while. As noted above, we’ve been big fans of its Alcon unit for many years, and now that Alcon is independent, we decided to concentrate our investment there.”17.

Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”15. Verizon Communications Inc.

(NYSE:VZ) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“We sold the entire position in Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), which was a disappointing investment, on concerns that the company is losing market share in a very competitive business and because we believed we had better use for the funds elsewhere.”14. TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE)Average Net Income: $11.53 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 21At the end of Q4 2022, 21 hedge funds held positions in TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE). The total value of these positions was $1.93 billion. This is compared to 22 hedge funds in the previous quarter with stakes worth $1.56 billion.In fiscal 2022, TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) generated an annual net income of $20.53 billion. The company has generated an annual net income of $11.53 billion, on average, over the last 20 years.

TTE is one of the world’s largest energy companies. It develops and produces oil and gas, produces and sells refined products, is one of the largest producers and traders of LNG, and owns a large portfolio of renewable power generating assets. TTE has one of the lowest cost portfolios of oil and gas assets and therefore one of the lowest breakeven points in the industry. It also has one of the best balance sheets in the industry. We estimate it will reach a net cash position sometime in 2023.The valuation of TTE—and that of Shell—is fascinating. TTE sells at approximately 4X earnings and has a 5% dividend yield. With its current buyback program and a recently announced special dividend, the owners yield is more than 10%. The valuation and owners yield are not dissimilar to those of Shell, which we also own and which trades at just under 5X earnings. To say that a discount is attached to European oil companies relative to US peers is an understatement. Exxon Mobil sells at 8X earnings, Chevron 9X and Conoco 8X. If TTE and Shell redomiciled to the US, their share prices would probably double.We have a few theories for the valuation anomaly. First, as mentioned above, Europe generally trades at a big discount to the US. In the case of TTE and Shell, this makes no economic sense. The oil and gas business is a global one, and TTE and Shell have attractive assets. The main explanation, we believe, is that large sections of the European asset management industry will not invest in oil and gas because of ESG restrictions. Yet if the recent war in Ukraine and the current energy crisis have shown us nothing else, the supply of energy is an enormous social good. Indeed, it is an existential good. Moreover, it is companies such as TTE that will invest billions to supply the LNG that Europe desperately needs to restore its economy and reduce the crushing cost burden on families who must now choose between heating their homes and eating. Finally, TTE is also investing billions per year in renewable power generating assets such as wind and solar. Such assets will likely never replace clean burning natural gas and nuclear as base power suppliers, but they are a valuable and clean adjunct to modern grids. We believe TTE’s renewable portfolio is worth between $25 billion and $35 billion and is moving from almost no profit contribution toward meaningful levels of profit over the next few years. We wonder how it makes sense for investors to disinvest from these kinds of assets on ethical grounds.”13. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Average Net Income: $12.67 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 84On January 24, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) posted earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022.

(NYSE:PFE) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Labs, global pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG). Although Pfizer continues to report strong performance of its core drugs, sales of its COVID vaccine and treatment have likely peaked and sales are expected to decline going forward. We remain optimistic about the company long term as we believe management is taking the company in the right direction, focusing R&amp;D, and making strategic acquisitions with profits generated from COVID vaccine sales.”11. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Average Net Income: $12.93 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Walmart Inc.

(NYSE:WMT) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”10.

Despite the positives of higher interest rates and the company making good progress on reducing expenses and regulatory consent orders, Wells Fargo shares have fallen one-third from their highs earlier this year to roughly 6.5x our estimate of normalized earnings power, and the stock ended the quarter at ~1x next year’s tangible book value. We find this is far too cheap for a strong banking franchise capable of tangible returns in the low-to-mid teens across business cycles.”8. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Average Net Income: $14.64 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 100Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) reported an annual net income of $27.53 billion in fiscal 2022.

We added leading financial institution Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) which serves individual consumers, small and middle-market businesses, and large corporations with a full range of banking, investing, asset management, and other financial and risk management products and services. The current company was formed through various mergers including NationsBank, FleetBoston, US Trust, Countrywide Financial, and Merrill Lynch with the legacy commercial bank to form a national banking powerhouse and bulge bracket investment firm. As one of the ‘Big Four’ U.S. banks it enjoys scale driven cost advantages and economies of scale which provide meaningful competitive advantages and potential for strong returns in the largely commoditized banking industry. A survivor of the financial crisis, BAC has emerged with a solid capital base and stands to benefit from a rising interest rate environment.”7. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)Average Net Income: $15.51 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 57At the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) was a part of 57 investors' portfolios.

The stock is the seventh most profitable stock of the last 20 years.Here is what Diamond Hill Capital had to say about Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Most recently in Q4, we increased our energy exposure by reinitiating a position in a company we know well and have owned in the past, integrated oil and gas company Chevron Corporation(NYSE:CVX).We previously owned Chevron as recently as February 2022. We sold our position at that time due to heightened risk associated with operations in Kazakhstan, which sends oil through a pipeline that runs through Russia out to the Black Sea. When Russia invaded Ukraine, we believed there was real risk that something would happen to inhibit Chevron’s ability to get that oil to the market. We didn’t believe that risk was reflected in the stock price, so we sold our position. Today, 10+ months into the Ukraine crisis, more information has become available regarding the Kazakhstan operations, and the associated risks are now well-known. We believe those risks are fully priced into the current stock valuation.

(AP) — Fox Corp. chairman Rupert Murdoch acknowledged that some Fox News commentators endorsed the false allegations by former President Donald Trump and his allies that the 2020 presidential election was stolen and that he didn't step in to stop them from promoting the claims, according to excerpts of a deposition unsealed Monday.The claims and the company's handling of them are at the heart of a defamation lawsuit against the cable news giant by Dominion Voting Systems.The recently unsealed documents include excerpts from a deposition in which Murdoch was asked about whether he was aware that some of the network’s commentators — Lou Dobbs, Maria Bartiromo, Jeanine Pirro and Sean Hannity — at times endorsed the false election claims. Murdoch replied, “Yes. They endorsed.""The Murdoch deposition is the latest filing in the defamation case to reveal concerns at the top-rated network over how it was handling Trump’s claims as its ratings plummeted after the network called Arizona for Joe Biden, angering Trump and his supporters.An earlier filing showed a gulf between the stolen election narrative the network was airing in primetime and doubts about the claims raised by its stars behind the scenes. In one text, from Nov. 16, 2020, Fox News host Tucker Carlson said ""Sidney Powell is lying” about having evidence for election fraud, referring to one of Trump's lawyers.The Dominion case is the latest example showing that those who were spreading false information about the 2020 election knew there was no evidence to support it. The now-disbanded House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol disclosed that many of Trump’s top advisers repeatedly warned him that the allegations he was making about fraud were false — and yet the president continued making the claims.Murdoch urged in September 2020, weeks before the election, that Dobbs be fired because he was “an extremist,” according to Dominion's court filing. Murdoch also said he thought it was “really bad” for former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani to be advising Trump because Giuliani’s “judgment was bad” and he was “an extreme partisan,” according to a deposition excerpt.Story continuesMurdoch was asked whether he could have requested that Powell and Giuliani not be put on the air: “I could have. But I didn't,” he replied.Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems, which sells electronic voting hardware and software, is suing both Fox News Network and parent company Fox Corp. for defamation. Dominion contends that some Fox News employees deliberately amplified false claims by supporters of Trump that Dominion machines had changed votes in the 2020 election, and that Fox provided a platform for guests to make false and defamatory statements about the company.Dominion attorneys contend that executives in the “chain of command” at both Fox News and Fox Corp. knew the network was broadcasting “known lies, had the power to stop it, but chose to let it continue. That was wrong, and for that, FC and FNN are both liable.”Attorneys for Fox Corp. note in their filing that Murdoch also testified that he never discussed Dominion or voter fraud with any of the accused Fox News hosts. They say Dominion has produced “zero evidentiary support” for the claim that high-level executives at Fox Corp. had any role in creating or publishing the statements at issue.Dominion’s contention that the company should be held liable because Murdoch might have had the power to step in and prevent the challenged statements from being aired, they said, “has no basis in defamation law, would obliterate the distinction between corporate parents and subsidiaries, and finds no support in the evidence.”The “handful of selective quotes” cited by Dominion have nothing to do with the statements that Dominion has challenged as defamatory, according to Fox Corp. attorneys. “Dominion repeatedly asked Fox News executives, hosts, and staff whether Fox Corporation employees played a role in the publication of the statements it challenges,” they wrote. “The answer — every single time, for every single witness — was no.”Meanwhile, Fox News attorneys note that when voting-technology companies denied the allegations being made by Trump and his surrogates, Fox News aired those denials, while some Fox News hosts offered protected opinion commentary about Trump’s allegations.]"

But I didn't,"" according to Dominion's filing.Dominion's filing opposes Fox's motion for summary judgment, which seeks a ruling in the media company's favor that would preempt the need for a trial on certain legal issues.In its own filing made public Monday, Fox argued that its coverage of statements by Trump and his lawyers were inherently newsworthy and that Dominion’s “extreme” interpretation of defamation law would “stop the media in its tracks.”“Under Dominion’s approach, if the President falsely accused the Vice President of plotting to assassinate him, the press would be liable for reporting the newsworthy allegation so long as someone in the newsroom thought it was ludicrous,” Fox said.Dominion sued Fox News Networks and parent company Fox Corp in March 2021 and November 2021 in Delaware Superior Court, alleging the cable TV network amplified false claims that Dominion voting machines were used to rig the 2020 election against Trump, a Republican who lost to Democratic rival Biden.In a statement Monday, a Fox spokesperson said Dominion's view of defamation law ""would prevent journalists from basic reporting and their efforts to publicly smear Fox for covering and commenting on allegations by a sitting President of the United States should be recognized for what it is: a blatant violation of the First Amendment.”Dominion’s motion for summary judgment, filed this month, was replete with emails and statements in which Rupert Murdoch and other top Fox executives say the claims made about Dominion on-air were false – part of the voting machine company’s effort to prove the network either knew the statements it aired were false or recklessly disregarded their accuracy.

187,b72df4ff-2be7-41d8-b041-081812ff2ad3,IBM,2023-02-28,CHIPS Act: What companies need to do to get their share,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chips-act-what-companies-need-to-do-to-get-their-share-100023033.html,1677578423,STORY,"['MU', 'TSM', 'IBM', 'INTC']","[In a long-awaited announcement, the Commerce Department outlined Tuesday what semiconductor companies will need to hand over to get their share of the billions in government money that will come their way soon.Bottom line: no blank check.“We'll run them through the paces and then we'll make our decisions,” Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told Yahoo Finance Live in an interview. She said the application will be intentionally complicated and that's a part of her mission to make sure taxpayer funds are protected.“It's a very detailed, extensive, comprehensive application,” she added in comments to reporters Monday, promising “we're gonna make companies open their books.”What lies ahead for companies like Intel (INTC), Micron (MU) and others is a five-part process in which the firms will be asked to make a series of promises. Pledges include a pause on any expansion plans in countries like China, detailed plans for how they’ll recruit workers, and a vow that the money won’t go to stock buybacks.At stake is a Biden administration promise to reverse a sharp downward decline for the semiconductor industry in the U.S. over recent decades. American semiconductor manufacturing has fallen from nearly 40% of world production in 1990 to only 12% in recent years, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. The situation is even worse for the world’s most advanced semiconductors, 100% of which were manufactured overseas in 2019.‘This is fundamentally a national security initiative’Tuesday’s announcement is the latest phase in Raimondo’s oversight of $50 billion in government funds going to companies to spur both semiconductor manufacturing and research in the years ahead. The money was approved in 2022 when President Biden signed the CHIPs and Science Act into law as a centerpiece of his economic agenda and focus on bringing back manufacturing to the U.S.President Biden signs the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 into law on August 9. (REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein)The application released this week is for $39 billion in the law that is earmarked for semiconductor manufacturing. Another application will be coming later this year and will begin to give out an additional $11 billion for chip research and design. The law also includes an investment tax credit of up to 25% towards a manufacturer’s capital expenditures.Story continuesIn the coming months, Raimondo and her team will also select sites for the centerpiece of the Biden team’s CHIPS vision: at least two new semiconductor manufacturing and research hubs built around producing the most advanced chips in the world.“The reality is there are only a few companies in the world that can do leading-edge chip manufacturing,” Raimondo said in this week’s interview.Companies like Intel and Micron — as well as IBM (IBM), Samsung (SSNLF), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) — have been engaged in intensive jockeying for months around the law with some already announcing U.S. expansion plans (and scoring presidential visits) to try and position themselves at the front of the line for the windfall.What Raimondo has repeatedly pledged in recent days is that no company is a shoo-in. She said that a proposal from a company will get funded only if it has a strong national security angle, is impossible to achieve without government assistance, and would be a good deal for taxpayers.But she noted that “a facility that's already been announced would be eligible for these incentives, and I expect that some companies that have already announced projects will receive incentives.” But at the end of the day, she added, the primary lens through which she will view applications is national security.President Joe Biden attended the groundbreaking of the new Intel semiconductor manufacturing facility in New Albany, Ohio in September. (REUTERS/Joshua Roberts)Meanwhile. companies have been publicly enthusiastic about the rollout so far. Allen Thompson, Intel vice president of U.S. government relations, told Yahoo Finance in a statement last week that, ""We strongly support the Department’s efforts to build U.S. manufacturing and promote new clusters of semiconductor ecosystems,” adding that they are in the middle of an expansion already in places like Arizona, New Mexico, and Ohio. The Semiconductor Industry Association recently added their own enthusiastic statement saying, “We must now ensure the CHIPS Act is implemented efficiently, effectively, and expeditiously.”Officials have compared the effort to big moments in American history from President Lincoln’s creation of the land-grant university system to John F. Kennedy’s famous call to put a man on the moon.“This is a program without recent precedent,” Raimondo told reporters on Monday. “And with that tremendous responsibility, we are committed to being good stewards of every dime of taxpayer money.”A focus on buybacksIn the coming years, the program is also set to be inextricably tied to the politically explosive topic of stock buybacks.Officials have repeatedly pledged that — backed by auditing mechanisms and access to the company records — they will ensure that no taxpayer money is used for buybacks.More challenging is what happens if a company receives government money and then separately announces a buyback plan. A Commerce Department official said this week that the department would ask companies to lay out all their overall buyback plans as part of the application process and then will give preference to ""companies that do make long-term investments in the United States as opposed to prioritizing buybacks.”A recent letter from prominent lawmakers like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) called on the administration to go further, calling for a ban on all buybacks for companies that take money for 10 years.Raimondo and her team promised to cut off the funds if they catch wind of any broken buyback promises— they also said they also have measures to claw back money that has already gone out the door. “I hope we never have to do that, but there are a lot of tools that we have to keep these companies honest,” she said in this week’s interview.Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo speaks about semiconductor chips at the White House in September (REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque)Companies will also be required as part of the application process to make additional promises that could impact the eventual payouts. For example, officials said companies must comply with U.S. export controls and will be required to restrict their ability to expand manufacturing in non-U.S. allies for the coming decade.Companies will also be required to submit detailed workforce provisions for how they plan to find, train, and retain workers to both build these extensive complexes and then eventually staff them. The provisions also include a requirement to outline how they will provide affordable childcare to workers.Raimondo said that at the end of the day “if we do our job right” the government money will encourage much more money from private sources. The goal: the $50 billion in government money will spur at least ten times that - half a trillion dollars - from these companies.Ben Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.Click here for politics news related to business and moneyRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.One company value investors might notice is Marathon Petroleum (MPC). MPC is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value.Investors should also note that MPC holds a PEG ratio of 0.28. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. MPC's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 0.58. Over the last 12 months, MPC's PEG has been as high as 1.23 and as low as 0.19, with a median of 0.33.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is MPC's P/B ratio of 1.79. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. MPC's current P/B looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/B of 2.03. MPC's P/B has been as high as 2.03 and as low as 1.21, with a median of 1.58, over the past year.Finally, our model also underscores that MPC has a P/CF ratio of 3.30. This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook. This company's current P/CF looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 4.26. Over the past 52 weeks, MPC's P/CF has been as high as 4.93 and as low as 2.91, with a median of 3.70.Story continuesAnother great Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing stock you could consider is Phillips 66 (PSX), which is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value Score of A.Phillips 66 is currently trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 6.74 while its PEG ratio sits at 0.34. Both of the company's metrics compare favorably to its industry's average P/E of 5.77 and average PEG ratio of 0.58.Over the last 12 months, PSX's P/E has been as high as 11.94, as low as 5.19, with a median of 7.43, and its PEG ratio has been as high as 1.06, as low as 0.30, with a median of 0.61.Additionally, Phillips 66 has a P/B ratio of 1.42 while its industry's price-to-book ratio sits at 2.03. For PSX, this valuation metric has been as high as 2.40, as low as 1.15, with a median of 1.62 over the past year.These are only a few of the key metrics included in Marathon Petroleum and Phillips 66 strong Value grade, but they help show that the stocks are likely undervalued right now.

With that, I will turn the call over to Andres.Story continuesAndres Ricardo Gluski WeilertGood morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial review call. Today, I will discuss our 2022 financial results and strategic accomplishments as well as our 2023 guidance. Steve Coughlin, our CFO, will discuss our financial results and outlook in more detail shortly. Beginning with our 2022 results and accomplishments on Slide 3. I am very pleased with our performance in 2022, which was our best year ever. Adjusted EPS came in at $1.67, above our guidance range of $1.55 to $1.65. This accomplishment is primarily the result of 3 factors: strong performance across our portfolio, growth in renewables particularly from solar and energy storage in the U.S. and the benefit of embedded optionality in our LNG contracts. Turning to Slide 4. I would like to highlight an area in which we are particularly proud of our performance. Our success in bringing our construction projects online. In 2022, despite numerous market-wide challenges throughout the year, we added approximately 2 gigawatts of new projects to our portfolio, which was consistent with our expectations at the beginning of the year. Our success was the result of the extensive work we have done to develop the people, processes and solid supplier relationships to rapidly expand our portfolio of renewables. We see our ability to execute as the source of competitive advantage that is highly valued in the marketplace. Not only does it support our strong global customer relationships, but it also contributes to our confidence in our long-term forecast. In addition to our execution, 2022 was a year where we focused on taking actions that will position us well for future growth. These actions included: signing a record number of new PPAs for projects that we will complete in the coming years, investing in our pipeline of future projects, creating a leading position in green hydrogen, establishing strong regulatory foundations to support future utility growth and achieving significant coal phaseout milestones in Hawaii and Chile. As you can see on Slide 5. 2022 was a record year for PPA signings for AES. We signed 5.2 gigawatts of renewables under long-term contracts, increasing our backlog to 12.2 gigawatts. In fact, for the second year in a row, BNEF reported that AES signed more renewable deals with corporate customers than anyone else in the world. This included an expansion of our 24/7 structured projects. Moving to Slide 6. We also worked hard throughout the year to grow our pipeline of future projects, which increased by 25% to 64 gigawatts, including 51 gigawatts in the U.S. We see extensive and growing demand for renewables worldwide and expect that in the future, a key limitation to growth will be the availability of projects. We have been preparing by investing in land, interconnections and permitting work to advance the projects that will be used for future PPA signings. Turning to Slide 7. We also established ourselves as a leader in green hydrogen. In December, we announced a partnership with Air Products to develop, build and own and operate the largest green hydrogen production facility in the U.S. This project will have the capacity to produce more than 200 metric tons per day of green hydrogen and will include approximately 1.4 gigawatts of wind and solar generation. It builds upon the expertise we have developed in combining renewables to create around-the-clock carbon-free energy. This project has the potential to serve approximately 4,000 trucks, which, while significant, represents less than 0.1% of the current market for long-haul trucking. As such, we see a massive total addressable market for decarbonizing the transportation sector. Turning to Slide 8. Another focus of our 2022 work was to develop strong regulatory foundations for future growth at our U.S. utilities, where we expect to grow the combined rate basis 9% annually through 2025. Specifically, at AES Ohio, we filed a new Electric Security Plan or ESP 4, to enhance and upgrade the network and improve service reliability. With the lowest T&amp;D rates in the states across all customer categories, AES Ohio is well positioned to make the much-needed customer-centric investments. A ruling by the Ohio Commission on ESP 4 is expected this summer. Finally, we're pleased with the constructive outcome of AES Ohio's distribution rate case in which the Ohio Commission approved an annual revenue increase of $75.6 million. At AES Indiana, we filed our Integrated Resource Plan, or IRP, with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission in December. AES Indiana's near-term plan includes the conversion of the utility's last 2 coal units to natural gas in 2025 using an existing on-site gas pipeline. It also includes the addition of up to 1.3 gigawatts of new wind, solar and energy storage by 2027 and should reduce AES Indiana's carbon intensity by 2/3 from 2018 to 2030. This plan is an important step to fully transition away from coal and provides the opportunity for substantial additional investments at AES Indiana. Now turning to our outlook for 2023 on Slide 9. Today, we are initiating adjusted EPS guidance of $1.65 to $1.75 and reaffirming our long-term growth rate of 7% to 9% through 2025 for both adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow off a base year of 2020. Our focus this year will remain on execution. As you can see on Slide 10, we expect to complete approximately 3.4 gigawatts of new projects, including 2.1 gigawatts in the U.S. I will note that our 2023 guidance range does not include a potential upside from 600 megawatts of projects currently scheduled to be completed in December 2023, but which are likely to come online in 2024. Looking at our growth through 2025 on Slide 11. We expect to maintain the pace of PPA signings we have established with an estimated 14 to 17 gigawatts expected to be signed over the next 3 years. We see strong demand for renewables across all of our key markets, particularly the U.S., where the benefits of the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, are becoming even clear. Thus, given the strength of our backlog and our visibility into future PPA signings and project completions, we are confident in reaffirming our long-term guidance through 2025. Finally, today, we're announcing that we will hold an Investor Day this spring. We will be sharing our strategic long-term view of the company, introducing new business segments and extending our long-term growth rate. We will provide additional details at a later date. With that, I now would like to turn the call over to our CFO, Steve Coughlin.Stephen CoughlinThank you, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover the following key topics: our financial performance during 2022, our parent capital allocation and our 2023 guidance and expectations through 2025. As Andres mentioned, our results for 2022 demonstrate the strength, resiliency and flexibility of our portfolio as we surpassed our guidance range of $1.55 to $1.65. Overall, our portfolio is well structured to perform in the current market environment and is well positioned for growth as AES continues to lead the global energy transition. Turning to Slide 13. Full year 2022 adjusted EPS was $1.67 versus $1.52 in 2021, driven primarily by a significant volume of LNG sales and our increased ownership of AES Andes. These positive drivers were partially offset by unplanned outages, several onetime expenses we recorded at our U.S. in utilities and South America SBUs, a higher share count as a result of the 2021 accounting adjustment for our equity units and higher parent interest stemming from higher debt balances. The $1.67 per share also includes approximately $0.12 of losses from AES Next, primarily from our ownership in Fluence, which served as an additional drag year-over-year. We expect Fluence's results to significantly improve beginning this year, as they discussed on their recent earnings call. Turning to Slide 14. Adjusted pretax contribution or PTC was $1.6 billion for the year, an increase of $149 million and 11% growth over 2021. I'll cover our results in more detail over the next 4 slides beginning with the U.S. and Utilities SBU on Slide 15. Lower PTC in the U.S. was primarily driven by the recognition of one-time expenses from previously deferred purchased fuel and energy costs at our utilities. Outages at Southland Energy and AES Indiana in the second quarter and lower contributions from Clean Energy and the retirement of our coal plant in Hawaii, partially offset by higher contributions from our Southland legacy assets in the third quarter. Higher PTC at our South America SBU was primarily driven by our increased ownership of AES Andes and higher margins at both AES Andes and AES Brasil, but partially offset by a prior year gain related to an arbitration at Alto Maipo. Outages at AES Andes and a one-time regulatory provision in Argentina. Higher PTC at our MCAC SBU reflects to benefit from a large volume of LNG sales redirected to the international market. As I'll discuss later, we do not expect an opportunity of the same scale to recur this year and anticipate lower PTC from MCAC in 2023. The LNG sales were partially offset by the full year impact from the sale of our coal plant in the Dominican Republic in 2021. Finally, in Eurasia, adjusted PTC was relatively flat year-over-year with an overall net decline driven by higher interest expense, but partially offset by higher energy prices earned at our wind plant in Bulgaria. Now let's turn to how we allocated our capital in 2022 on Slide 19. Beginning on the left-hand side, sources reflect $1.3 billion of total discretionary cash. This includes parent free cash flow of $906 million, which was near the top end of our guidance expectations. Asset sales were below our expectations for the year, but we still expect to achieve our goal of $1 billion in proceeds by 2025. Given the delay in asset sales, we accelerated the issuance of some parent debt which is within our long-term expectations. Moving to uses on the right-hand side. We invested more than $700 million in growth at our subsidiaries, of which approximately 2/3 were in the U.S. We also allocated nearly $500 million of our discretionary cash to our dividend. Turning to our guidance and expectations, beginning on Slide 20. Today, we are initiating 2023 adjusted EPS guidance of $1.65 to $1.75. This year, we expect to commission approximately 3.4 gigawatts of new renewables, which is the largest year-over-year increase in AES history. This growth further validates AES position as a leader in renewables and highlights the outstanding efforts of our commercial and operations teams in our markets. Roughly 65% of this new renewable capacity is located in the U.S. More than half our total 2023 adjusted PTC will come from the U.S. this year as we execute on the transformation of our portfolio. As I discussed last quarter, our U.S. renewables projects benefit from both investment tax credits and production tax credits. Our 2023 guidance includes approximately $500 million of adjusted PTC from tax credits generated and recognized by new U.S. renewable projects coming online this year, which is approximately double the amount from 2022. Tax credits are an important component of our renewables business earnings and cash flow, and we intend to provide updates on our 2023 tax credit expectations throughout the year. While the midpoint of our 2023 guidance range is below our long-term annual growth target. We are reaffirming the 7% to 9% growth rate through 2025. 2023 growth is lower than the long-term trend for a few reasons. First, we've taken a conservative approach to modeling renewables projects expected to come online in 2023. Our renewables construction is typically concentrated in the fourth quarter, and this year will be no exception. As a result, construction delays of only a few days could cause a project to shift from 2023 to 2024 and negatively impact this year's results. This is particularly relevant for our U.S. renewables projects, where we recognized significant earnings from investment tax credits in the year, a project is placed into service. Of the 2.1 gigawatts we plan to complete in 2023, 2/3 are expected to come online in the fourth quarter. Our guidance assumes that an additional 600 megawatts of projects currently scheduled to come online in December, slip into 2024. If some or all of these projects are completed on schedule, this will create up to $0.10 of upside to our 2023 guidance. It's also important to note that even if there are delays to next year, this is only a timing issue with no material value impact and would support higher growth in 2024 with no impact on our long-term growth rate expectations. Second, we expect to see lower contributions from our MCAC SBU on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by more than $200 million of adjusted PTC from LNG sales we executed in 2022. Our commercial team was able to leverage the optionality embedded in our LNG supply contracts to capitalize on high international gas prices by redirecting Henry Hub-linked LNG cargoes to the international market. Although LNG sales will continue in 2023, we do not expect the same magnitude of opportunity as the spreads between Henry Hub and international gas prices have compressed and more of our gas supply this year is linked to TTF international prices rather than Henry Hub. Third, we expect to see lower margins at our Chile business this year, particularly in the first half of the year, which is a temporary impact of our Green Blend and Extend strategy to transition our customers from coal power to renewables. Several coal PPAs have or will expire this year, as we proceed with our intent to fully exit coal by 2025, and others have been restructured to be priced off renewables that are still under construction. We view this as a short-term cost of decarbonizing our portfolio and do not expect any impact to our 7% to 9% long-term growth rate. Looking ahead, our teams are working on commercial solutions to mitigate the dilution as the portion of our earnings from coal continues to decline. Based on the drivers discussed, we expect our 2023 earnings to be significantly second half weighted with approximately 3 quarters recognized in the second half of the year. While we typically have had about 2/3 of our earnings in the second half, the increase in seasonality this year is driven by the significant volume of new U.S. renewable projects coming online in the fourth quarter. Now turning to our 2023 parent capital allocation plan on Slide 21, beginning with approximately $2.2 billion of sources on the left-hand side. Parent free cash flow for 2023, is expected to be $950 million to $1 billion, in line with our annualized growth target. In addition to parent free cash flow, we expect to generate $400 million to $600 million in asset sale proceeds this year. This includes our previously announced sale in Jordan as well as the pending sell-down of some of our operating renewables in the U.S.I also want to point out that we intend to relaunch the sale process for our Mong Duong coal plant in Vietnam to better align with the approval requirements that became clear during the initial sale. The remaining portion of our 2023 asset sales is expected to come from additional sell-downs and sales supporting our decarbonization goals. Now to the Uses on the right-hand side. We plan to invest approximately $1.7 billion toward new growth, of which about 2/3 will be allocated in the U.S. to renewables and to increase our utility rate base. We expect to allocate approximately $500 million to our shareholder dividend, which reflects the previously announced 5% increase. In summary, we exceeded our financial commitments for 2022 and are confident in this year's guidance and the long-term outlook for AES. The energy transition provides tremendous investment and innovation opportunities, and I believe no company is better positioned than AES to lead this transition. As we execute on our strategy, we will continue to deliver on our financial commitments to maximize per share value for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andres.Andres Ricardo Gluski WeilertThank you, Steve. In summary, 2022 was our best year ever. Not only did we meet or exceed our targets for adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow, but we signed more PPAs and added more renewables to our portfolio than ever before. Once again, we were recognized by BNEF as the top developer worldwide, selling clean energy to corporations through PPAs. We also launched the first mega scale green hydrogen project in the U.S. and developed a regulatory foundation that will enable us to grow our U.S. utilities by 9% annually through 2025. Looking forward, we are very well positioned for the future. Our leadership in corporate PPAs and green hydrogen gives a line of sight into our continued success. We remain focused on executing on our construction program and further developing our pipeline of potential future projects. And we are on track to exit coal by the end of 2025. With that, I would like to open up the call for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) So our first question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski.Agnieszka Anna StorozynskiGood morning, guys. So first, maybe about the disclosure that you guys have in the -- in your presentation. I understand that there's an Analyst Day coming, but there are a number of slides that are missing, especially the segmental earnings contributions for '23. I mean, is there any reason for that?Stephen CoughlinYes, it's Steve. So yes, and that's because, as Andres shared in his remarks, we are intending to update you on our new business segments. And so when we issue that level of guidance, it will come in the Investor Day.Agnieszka Anna StorozynskiOkay. I understand. Okay. Just moving on, just looking at the year-over-year bridge between '22 and '23 EPS, there is no benefit from lower losses of AES Next. And I'm just wondering, I mean, it's not even mentioned as a driver. Can you comment about your expectations for that business?Stephen CoughlinYes. So Next, in total. Angie, it was roughly at $0.12 drag last year. We have to be careful because Fluence is a separate public company, and we can't get ahead of their disclosures. They haven't specifically guided to earnings, but on their last call, they did guide to a significant improvement in margins this year. So Next is a positive driver this year, and I would say, to a material extent, but I can't say specifically because I can't get ahead of them on their earnings disclosures. But we are expecting it to be much better. They've made a ton of progress on all of the operational and commercial improvements that they've been outlining. And as I've said previously, the Next portfolio we expect to be neutral to earnings by 2024, and I still expect that.Agnieszka Anna StorozynskiOkay. But I'm just -- so again, not to be picky, but so which bucket would this be included in? I mean on that Slide 20, I mean, I understand that it's lumped with some other drivers. So would it be basically upside to the guidance?Stephen CoughlinNo, it would be lumped into that second column with the negative -- it would be an offset in that negative $0.15, basically.Agnieszka Anna StorozynskiOkay. Okay. I understand. Okay. And then just one other question about '22. So when I'm looking at the actual results versus what you were guiding to, the corporate drag as more than $100 million higher than expected. And I'm just wondering, I understand some of it is interest expense, but any other driver?Stephen CoughlinThe corporate does include AES Next, under our current segments. And so we'll be talking more at Investor Day about the future, but I can say it's largely parent interest on the revolver, where we've had higher balances and of course, higher rates going into the revolver as well as the incremental drag from AES Next.Agnieszka Anna StorozynskiOkay. And then the core question. So based on the IRA, I mean, there's this discussion about shifting from solar ITC to solar PTC, there's obviously the bonus ITC. And I'm just wondering how are you positioned to benefit from those additional tax credits in the U.S.? And also, I mean, it's a very competitive market, as I understand. So can you actually retain some of this benefit, i.e., boost the profitability of future solar projects in the U.S.? Or is it more a function of basically securing more contracts by trading away that benefit?Stephen CoughlinSure. So look, first of all, we're very happy to have the optionality from the IRA on choosing ITC or PTC newly for solar as well as having the ITC for storage. So typically, we're going to choose the tax credit structure that yields the highest return in the project. So it's great to have that optionality. I would say going forward, the ITC -- there is a difference in the earnings profile. There's an upfront recognition of the ITC versus the PTC is spread out over 10 years. But other than that, you'd expect that the lifetime earnings roughly to be the same, if the credit structure yielded roughly the same returns. So in this case, we have about -- in AES's case, about 1/3 of our pipeline, we believe, will qualify for the energy community adder. And so we feel that we're going to be very competitively positioned to get at least the 40% level for about 1/3 of our pipeline. So that's a good thing. I would say in terms of where the credit accrues, I think it's going to be a mix of things. Certainly, there's been higher costs that the industry has absorbed on the order of 30%. I think part of it goes to absorbing that impact of higher costs in renewables. I would say some will go to competitiveness in terms of bidding for the PPAs. And largely, as Andres has talked about before, we see this -- there being more of a constraint on the supply side in the renewables market. So we do see that continued strong demand but that there's going to be constraints on the supply side of projects being ready to meet that demand and that will have some upward pressure on returns.Andres Ricardo Gluski WeilertYes. Angie, the way I'd put it is, that the cost increases have largely been absorbed by the market. So we're seeing constant margins. What you saw the last year, there was less commissioning of new projects in renewables than it was expected by a big factor, like 40%. So what a lot of the clients have done is postponed some of their renewable goals. But eventually, what you're going to see is a shortage in the market. So we feel confident about that, and that's why we're continuing to invest to build that pipeline to be able to respond to that demand. So those are the dynamics. This is a market that, yes, while it's very competitive, the dynamics are positive. And then we are also selling a lot of our projects or differentiated projects. So they're structured projects. They bring something to the table other just than your plain vanilla busbar PPA.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Nick Campanella of Credit Suisse.Fei SheThis is Fei for Nick today. First, a quick question on the Analyst Day. Can we just get some colors on your thoughts on the timing? I know you mentioned spring, but what are some of the specific drivers to determine the timing of the Analyst Day?Stephen CoughlinYes. I mean -- so first of all, Andres mentioned, we will be discussing new business segments. So we are closing out 2022 under our current segments. We will then move over to new segments very shortly. And so part of the timing is to fully make that transition internally and then to be able to come out in the spring time frame with that look at the new segments, the new way of looking at AES going forward as well as discussion about guidance beyond 2025.Fei SheOkay. That's helpful. And just maybe -- just on the asset sales proceeds. I know you're filling some of the asset sales proceeds with the parent debt issuance. But as we think about the 7% to 9% CAGR currently, can you just -- are you able to continue to bridge this growth rate without any additional common equity? Just want to check in on that.Andres Ricardo Gluski WeilertYes. Look, we feel confident in terms of what we've said in the past that to grow through 2025, we don't need additional equity for that period of time. So we also feel confident in our ability to raise $1 billion through asset sales.Stephen CoughlinYes. Yes. And with regard to the debt, it's really just -- it's somewhat fungible. We look at both our sales program as well as our debt capacity, always holding to our investment-grade metric plus a cushion as a minimum but it's really just timing. So there's just flex between when we determine to issue the debt within our expectations and when those asset sales come in. So it's just executing somewhat of a flexibility on the timing of the asset sales and the debt kind of flex back and forth.OperatorOur next question comes from Durgesh Chopra of Evercore.Durgesh ChopraJust kind of -- I want to focus on the plan for this year 2023, that is, what's the level of confidence? I mean maybe you can share some details with us in terms of what you already have in terms of material secured, et cetera, et cetera, in getting the sort of the 3.4 gigawatts online and getting the $0.27 earnings accretion year-over-year.Andres Ricardo Gluski WeilertOkay. Durgesh. Listen, we feel good about the numbers that we're giving out there. We have all the equipment basically secured. And we're very -- I'd say about what we have about 5.5 gigawatts under construction as we speak. Okay. Not all of them are going to come in line in '23. But just to give you an idea, we feel very good about it. Now the 600 megawatts that we said might slip into 2024. What are the issues? Well, for some of that, there could be equipment delivery. There could be interconnect timing, easement issues, final [file] permits, the usual stuff that when you're doing construction. So we're going to try very hard to get it done this year. But we feel it's prudent to say that these are going to slip, most likely slip into 2024. Now what I would like to reiterate is that this really isn't a business issue. This is just an accounting issue from my perspective because we -- all of those 600 megawatts, I feel very confident would get done, for example, by -- certainly by March. So -- and the -- there aren't any penalties involved and there isn't any significant change to the return of those projects. So unfortunately, what you really have is given that we run on a calendar year. We have so much happening in the last quarter. But I want to really emphasize this is not a -- we have -- of all the renewable developers, we have not abandoned any project because of equipment delays or permit delays. We have delivered on [a low]. So we feel very good. But there is a timing issue, and we thought it's prudent to say, look, these 600 megawatts, we think are most likely to fall into next year. But it's a matter of -- it could be weeks. And we will nonetheless try very hard to get them done this year.Durgesh ChopraThank you, Andres. That's very helpful. And just in terms of milestones for us to watch, as to whether you can get them done this year or are they going to push next year? When are you going to have that clarity? Is that sort of kind of a summer type of event? Or will you have more clarity by your Investor Day?Andres Ricardo Gluski WeilertI really don't think we'd have it honestly, by our Investor Day, to be frank. I think it'd be more by the summer that we would have more indications on particularly the project. This gets quite granular. X projects got a permit or something that was missing. But I don't really -- don't see that before that.Stephen CoughlinYes, Durgesh. Our plan is (inaudible) just on each call, we will give updates to the extent we have updates on the construction program as well as the tax credit expectations throughout the year on the calls as well.Durgesh ChopraGot it. And thanks, Steve. And just one last one. I noticed the '23 to '25 PPA finding is, again, very healthy 14 to 17 gigawatts, but you're not sort of giving us an annual number this year like you did in 2022, which was 4.5 to 5.5 gigawatts and you came in right in that range. Are you expecting that '23 to '25 signings to be lumpy or should we still expect right, the new PPAs in the [5 gigawatts] in a handle range each year?Andres Ricardo Gluski WeilertI would expect, honestly, them to be right around that sort of 4.5 megawatts, 5.5 megawatts every year. But we decided to give a multiyear range because there is some lumpiness. I mean, we do have some projects, which are like 1 gigawatt. And it's the same thing. The signing could happen in January instead of December. So we wanted to give a -- basically, think of it more as sort of a rolling number. But again, we feel good about being able to reach that range.Durgesh ChopraGot it. And congrats on the BNEF recognition again this year. I appreciate the time.Andres Ricardo Gluski WeilertThanks a lot.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America.Cameron James LochridgeThis is actually Cameron Lochridge on for Julien. I wanted to maybe come back real quick to the idea of the renewal with backlog and how maybe that influences 7% to 9% growth CAGR that you guys have laid out. I appreciate that you have reaffirmed that through 2025. But given where the backlog is and where the growth is expected to come from over the next several years, is there any reason we should not be perhaps rolling that forward out beyond 2025 and continuing to underwrite to that? Or is there something else that may be driving that either higher or lower beyond '25?Andres Ricardo Gluski WeilertYes. I mean, look, let's say, we have a 12.2 gigawatt backlog, of which about 5.5% are under construction now. And a good portion of that is going to come online between now in 2025. So there's no reason to think of a change. If anything, the market continues to grow, and we see a shortage. I don't know if -- Steve, you want to comment...Stephen CoughlinYes, I would say the backlog is at 12.2 gigawatts and we're delivering 3.4 gigawatts this year plus potentially some of that upside from the 600 megawatts. So that leaves still about 8.5 gigawatts to be delivered over the next few years. So we feel really good about the commissionings coming through '25 to support the growth. And then as Andres has covered, the pipeline in the U.S. is 51 gigawatts and it is continuing to mature. So we'll talk more at Investor Day about beyond 2025, but I feel really good about the growth expectations.Andres Ricardo Gluski WeilertYes. This is not a market if it is not growing very rapidly. And we do see pent-up demand. What we do see is that because a lot of people did not deliver in 2022, we see pent-up demand. So what we have to do is really make sure that we're getting the returns that we want and really going after the value-add on those projects. But it's not for dearth of projects by any means.Cameron James LochridgeUnderstood. Understood. Maybe just going back to 2023 and looking at guidance. I know you're looking at $0.27 a share from the new renewables in 2023. I kind of wanted to unpack that a little bit. In terms of how much, if you could quantify, how much of that $0.27 is we'll call it a roll forward from projects that were placed in service in 4Q '22? And is there any reason that was meaningfully different or will be meaningfully different this year thinking about the $0.10 a share that could potentially slip into 2024.Stephen CoughlinYes. So the primary portion of that relates to the increase in the tax credit. So a portion of the $0.27 is related to just that base of projects from '22 coming into 2023. So that's part of it. But I would say the largest component is the increase in the tax credit to the range of about $500 million recognized this year, which is a little more than double what we recognized that last year. So that's the largest component of the $0.27.Cameron James LochridgeOkay. Got it. I guess...Stephen CoughlinYes.Cameron James LochridgeI guess maybe what I'm more trying to get just...no, no, go ahead. I'm sorry.Stephen CoughlinYes. I was also just going to say, and that's partly why we're calling out this additional 600 megawatts because it's largely -- in fact, it's all investment tax credit-based projects. So as Andres described even -- in the most extreme, even if you just had a project that was commissioned on January 1 instead of December 31, you would move that tax recognition over a calendar year. So that's why we're calling out that as potential upside and the sensitivity to the tax credit, and it's just timing is all it is.Andres Ricardo Gluski WeilertYes. The other thing I'd point out is when we sell the tax credits, we also get the cash.Stephen CoughlinExactly.Andres Ricardo Gluski WeilertSo there is lumpiness in the cash as a result of this. So the cash and the earnings go together.Stephen CoughlinYes.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Richard Sunderland of JPMorgan.Richard Wallace SunderlandJust one last one on this '23 versus '24 in 600 megawatts. It sounds like if the $0.10 flips to '24, this clearly should be additive to the prior growth outlook meaning additive to the 7% to 9% CAGR. Is that the right frame of reference for whether the 600 megawatts [slides] in '23 and brings you kind of back to the original range or '24 pushes you above?Stephen CoughlinExactly. So that's exactly right. It doesn't change the 7% to 9% through '25, but all else being equal, '24 would go well above the 7% to 9%, as a result of these projects moving into next year. That's exactly right.Richard Wallace SunderlandOkay. Got it. Very clear. Turning to Ohio, ESP 4, any sense on the backdrop in conversations there after all the time and engagement around the AES Ohio rate case?Stephen CoughlinYes. So at this point, as Andres said in his remarks, the ESP 4, we're expecting to be decided this summer. So that was filed last fall. The PUC did issue the order on the distribution rate case back in December, which was very favorable to us. And so really, those rates are just pending the approval and finalization of the ESP 4. So -- and keep in mind, the ESP 4 has a couple of things that are very additive. So one is that it will catch up the investment that's occurred between the last rate case filing in 2020, up close to the point in which the ESP 4 was filed last year. So there's a catch up there. There's also a new framework for investment going forward, including a distribution investment rider as well as some additional riders that will result in faster recognition of investment going forward. So our expectation is that we'll see the new structure in place that sets Ohio in the course for new investment for the second half of this year, and then it becomes a growth driver going forward into the next several years. We see in total our net rate base increasing close to $1.5 billion across both utilities from now until 2025.Richard Wallace SunderlandUnderstood. Understood. And then you referenced changes around the Vietnam requirements for sale and relaunching that transaction. Could you just parse that a little bit more in terms of what you're expecting there now? Do you see a quicker path to divestment under a second go? Anything else would be helpful here.Andres Ricardo Gluski WeilertYes. Well, we hope so, and then it will be [fast] second time around. I mean, basically, the -- what happened here is that the government wanted more of an operator than a financial investor. They're very happy with us, and they want somebody equally good. So we feel there is, a number of people interested in the asset because they actually canceled the number of new coal plants that were going to be built. So there's an appetite, especially from Asian operators for this asset. So hopefully, it will be faster. It was somewhat of a surprise, but our intentions remain the same. So to be out of coal by the end of 2025.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research.Steven Isaac FleishmanAndres, maybe could you give us just some overall color on how things are proceeding on panel supplies and particularly you flip up implementation issues. And is that kind of a key variable in the timing of these projects? Or is it more other issues?Andres Ricardo Gluski WeilertLet's see. Well, we feel pretty -- we feel good about the panel issue. As you know, again, we got all the panels we could use in 2022. So in 2023, we have all the orders in. Our suppliers have been getting through. So again, we feel good about that. In terms of what would determine that was that last sort of 600 megawatts, it's really a combination of issues. It's not just solar panels. It runs the gamut from wind turbines, deliveries, et cetera, pyramids easing. Also there is interconnection timing, is the client ready to take that energy. That was one of the biggest issues we had in 2022. We were ready, but the client wasn't ready. So it's just a bag of different issues. I'd say an important issue going forward is, as you know, we're heading the solar panel buyers consortium. We want to have solar panels starting to be delivered late '24, '25 made in the U.S.A. And what we're seeing now is really one of the regulations may be issued by treasury, what constitutes domestic content to get those additional credits. So I'd say that's an item that we're watching very closely. But generally, we feel good about. And there are certainly people interested in locating that plant here to supply that contract.Steven Isaac FleishmanOkay. And then just -- I know this was discussed on the last call, but just how are you making the decision between on U.S. projects, ITC versus PTC. I guess, -- so PTC, I think you had talked about still having a lot of value in the tax equity and the depreciation, but just -- do you see that starting to shift at some point in -- as you execute on future projects?Stephen CoughlinYes, I do, Steve, now that we have the optionality for production tax credits on solar, I would see that option being exercised primarily in the sunniest places in the U.S. So in the Southwest U.S. projects where the production-based incentive is going to yield a higher value than necessarily the CapEx based or the capital investment based incentive. So we are modeling more production tax credit into our longer term. For this year, it's not -- I wouldn't say it's impacted us really at all this year because for the most part, we're locked into a tax credit structure election and a tax equity partnership that we've already agreed to. But going forward, we'll start to see more production-based incentive come into the mix. And that's something, again, for Investor Day, as we talk about beyond 2025 kind of how do we look at the business, how do you look at the metrics of the business, how do you look at tax credits distinct from earnings that don't include tax credits, things like that, that we'll be giving more guidance on to help people understand what that looks like going forward.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Gregg Orrill of UBS.Gregg Gillander OrrillI just wanted to sort of confirm where the credit goals are sort of with the guidance update and the segment -- the new segments that you're thinking about? Sorry, if I'm getting ahead of my...Stephen CoughlinNo, no, no. No problem. Are you referring to the tax credit?Andres Ricardo Gluski WeilertI think the credit rate, right?Gregg Gillander OrrillCredit rate.Stephen CoughlinOkay. We've been talking so much about tax. So yes, the credit rating, certainly the BBB- is a constant constraint. And then we see likely improvement going forward, particularly as our business mix evolves to more long-term contracted renewables and more investment in the U.S. utilities. So I would say that's going to be a driver of improvement to the overall profile and view on the source of where our cash is coming from going forward. The segments, there's no -- I can't say too much about that right now. As we've been operating under the current segments, we'll be moving to the new one soon and then talking about that on the call going forward. But the segments will make it very clear as to the sources of earnings and cash going forward and where the business is growing, frankly, much, much higher than 7% to 9% and where the business is shrinking, largely consistent with our decarbonization goals. So it will peel apart where that 7% to 9% has come from ['25] as well as go beyond '25 .Andres Ricardo Gluski WeilertYes. So Gregg, in terms of the credit rating, where already more than 50% of our earnings are coming from the U.S. and a higher and higher percentage is coming from renewables. So we already have a -- if we're growing 7% to 9%, that includes the dilution from getting out of coal. So actually, our renewables are growing at a much higher rate, more like 10% to 12%. And -- so to put that in context, all of those things point to an improvement, as Steve was saying, in terms of the quality of the numbers beyond the metrics. So again, we feel very confident in what we've said. This is a red line. We're not going to drop below investment grade, and we're going to continue to strengthen it.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Levine of Citi.Ryan Michael LevineHoping to follow up on the change -- in terms of the change in segmentation, maybe just to take a step back, what's prompting the rereview of how you're looking to disclose information. And is there anything that any review would signal strategically for the company?Andres Ricardo Gluski WeilertNo. I mean we really think this is a culmination of what we've been doing in terms of moving into renewables. And our business is long-term contracted. And what we're seeing is a lot of -- this would make our business we feel more transparent and more comparable to other people's businesses. So that's all I can say at this point, but it's something that I think you guys will welcome because it gives greater transparency. And I think it makes more and more sense as, again, we transition more to renewables.Ryan Michael LevineOkay. And in your guidance, you disclosed a step down from the LNG contribution for this calendar year. What are you assuming for like TTF, Henry Hub spreads or upside or contribution from that portion of your contract portfolio?Andres Ricardo Gluski WeilertWell, I'll say the two elements. One is that we have less gas available to take advantage of that opportunity because we had a step down in our Henry Hub-based gas contracts. The second, it has to do with the spread between Henry Hub plus and TTF. So those spreads have narrowed. It's been a very warm winter, especially in Europe. So we'll see. So that's an opportunity that exists there, but we're not -- it would be smaller, smaller quantity. And we're not counting on it this year because right now, the spreads are not such that between all the transportation and the sharing of the upside with oil traders, et cetera, look particularly attractive. But the option is there, should the situation change.Stephen CoughlinYes. So it's -- I mean, it's largely based on current outlook for the year on the commodities. But to the extent that spread were to increase, that would be an upside to the guidance we've given here.Ryan Michael LevineGreat. And then last question for me. In terms of the asset sale process, to the extent some of these deals don't happen or get delayed, what tools do you have to alter your financing plan in light of what it looks like a choppy M&amp;A market.Andres Ricardo Gluski WeilertWell, first, we have many assets that we can sell, and it's not only sell out, sell down. So we have, I think, a lot of levers there. And we don't like to talk a lot about any specific asset until we have a deal done. It doesn't help us. But we always also sell down, for example, some of our renewables because that increases our returns, sell down a portion of it, we continue to operate them. So if you have movements, say, in time that a specific asset sale gets delayed and you're not ready to do another one, that's where other kinds of financings come in, and we'll do the one that makes the most sense. But again, as I said before, maintaining our credit metrics and our investment grade, that's a red line in the sand.OperatorOur final question is a follow-up question from Angie Storozynski from Seaport.Agnieszka Anna StorozynskiJust one thing. So the 600 megawatts that might slip into '24, that's the growth number, right? What would it be adjusted by ownership?Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert[It's two thing], I mean we normally sell down after the commissioning.Stephen CoughlinYes. I mean, so we do have (inaudible) so this is the U.S. number. So we have our partnership with Alberta Investment Management. And so I would say, for the most part, it's about 75% AES is that number. And the -- up to $0.10 that I mentioned, Angie, is AES' share. So that's not the growth...OperatorThank you. As there are no additional questions waiting at this time, I'd like to pass the conference back over to Susan Harcourt for closing remarks.Susan Pasley Keppelman HarcourtWe thank everybody for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Thank you, and have a nice day.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call.

Southwest provides short-haul, high-frequency, point-to-point, low-fare services. The company’s point-to-point route structure includes services to and from many secondary or downtown airports such as Dallas Love Field, Houston Hobby, Chicago Midway, Baltimore-Washington International, and Ft-Lauderdale-Hollywood.Low Cost = Low PerformanceLow-cost carriers like Spirit Airlines SAVE and Southwest Airlines have been dramatically underperforming their larger peers such as United Airlines UAL.What is Behind the Underperformance?Unprofitable and moving in the wrong direction: In Q4, Southwest Airlines swung to a loss for the first time in three quarters. The 38-cent loss was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 3 cents. Adding to the disappointment, Southwest earned 14 cents a year ago.Operational Disruptions: Massive flight cancellations due to extreme winter weather conditions adversely impacted Southwest’s operations. Because Southwest is more focused on one part of the globe when compared to its larger counterparts, the company suffered more. Nearly 17,000 flights were cancelled in the last ten days of 2022 – equating to a pre-tax negative impact of approximately $800 million.In Fighting &amp; Bad Publicity: Southwest is known and loved by its customers because of the laid-back nature of its flight attendants and employees. This laissez faire attitude is that Southwest management has found that many customers appreciate a less stuffy environment. However, that may change soon. Southwest management and some 18,000 union workers have been in a contract dispute for months. In an era where workers are in high demand, this is not an encouraging sign for Southwest. Until management and the union come to an agreement, the stock is likely to be under pressure. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached, the low-cost carrier will likely face reputational damage and low employee morale.Story continuesMargins are Being Squeezed: Rising fuel and labor costs are causing Southwest’s financial efficiency to take a significant hit. In fact, LUV’s return-on-equity of 6.7% pales in comparison to the S&amp;P 500 Index’s 26.2%.Relative Weakness: When it comes to the stock market, price action = truth. Over the past six months, United Airlines is up 41.0%, while Southwest is down 10.4%Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConclusionProspective airline investors should avoid low-cost carriers, such as Southwest and instead opt for larger players such as United Airlines. Southwest has slower growth, shrinking margins, and notable reputational damage to contend with.

Through the fund, these and potentially additional corporate participants will invest alongside United in SAF technology and production start-ups identified by United. In the past two years alone, United Airlines Ventures has invested in start-ups such as Cemvita, Dimensional Energy, and NEXT Renewable Fuels.And in a first among U.S. airlines, anyone who buys a ticket on the United website or app now has the option to contribute to supplement United's investment in the fund. The first 10,000 people who choose to contribute will each receive 500 MileagePlus Miles as a thank-you.SAF is an alternative to conventional jet fuel that, on a lifecycle basis, reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with air travel compared to conventional jet fuel alone. SAF, which currently must be blended with conventional jet fuel to meet regulatory requirements for use within the aircraft, is being made from used cooking oil and agricultural waste, and, in the future, could be made from other feedstocks including household trash or forest waste. To date, United has invested in the future production of over three billion gallons of SAF - the most of any airline in the world.***Story continues""Solving climate change is doable but it requires hard work and real leadership,"" said United CEO Scott Kirby. ""This fund is unique. It's not about offsets or things that are just greenwashing. Instead, we're creating a system that drives investment to build a new industry around sustainable aviation fuel, essentially from scratch. That's the only way we can actually decarbonize aviation.""UAV Sustainable Flight FundThe UAV Sustainable Flight Fund is open to investment by corporations across industries and the fund will prioritize investment in new technology, advanced fuel sources and proven producers, all in an effort to scale the supply of SAF. Partners of the fund also have the potential to gain preferential access to environmental attributes associated with United's supply of SAF.Companies interested in joining the fund can visit united.com/ventures.United has already made investments in or signed purchase agreements with companies using a variety of ingredients and technologies to produce SAF, including feedstocks like ethanol, animal byproducts, forestry and crop waste, and municipal waste, as well as early-stage, promising technologies like synthetic biology and power to liquids. United Airlines Ventures will move selected existing SAF investments to establish the UAV Sustainable Flight Fund portfolio.Consumer Awareness and Call to ActionUnited is also educating consumers about their air travel carbon footprint and giving them the option to take action.Starting today on United.com and the United app, United becomes the first U.S. airline to show customers an estimate of each flight's carbon footprint in their search. Green shading will indicate a lower-carbon option on a per economy seat passenger basis in a customer's chosen itinerary. A flight's carbon footprint is measured in kg CO2e (kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent) and United's estimates, which could differ from actual flight emissions, are based on aircraft type, flying time, seat capacity and the number of people and cargo on a given flight.And consumers who book travel through United for travel within or from the U.S. will now see an option to contribute to supplement United's investment in the UAV Sustainable Flight Fund before check-out. Customers have the choice to contribute $1, $3.50 or $7.00.****The default option for customer contributions is set at $3.50 to illustrate the potential impact of customer action at scale: if the 152 million people who flew on United in 2022 each contributed just $3.50 to the UAV Sustainable Flight Fund, that would be enough to design and build a SAF refinery capable of producing as much as 40 million gallons of alternative fuel annually.*****The Federal Government Recognizes the Value of SAFThe 2022 Inflation Reduction Act includes the largest governmental climate change investments in U.S. history - a new blender's tax credit specifically for SAF along with other critical incentives for clean energy and carbon capture - that will help spur an increase in SAF infrastructure and supply while lowering costs for SAF consumers.The U.S. military currently uses nearly five billion gallons of jet fuel annually and the Department of Defense will use a jet fuel blend containing at least 10% SAF by 2028 because of the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act.And according to the U.S. Department of Energy, the country's vast feedstock resources are enough to meet the projected SAF demand of the entire U.S. aviation industry.United's Commitment to Net Zero Emissions by 2050United aims to be 100% green by reducing its GHG emissions 100% by 2050, without relying on traditional carbon offsets. In addition to the UAV Sustainable Flight Fund, United has launched a SAF purchasing program called the Eco-Skies Alliance and established a venture fund - United Airlines Ventures - to identify and invest in companies and technologies that can decarbonize air travel. These strategic investments include carbon capture, hydrogen-electric engines, electric regional aircraft and air taxis.About UnitedUnited's shared purpose is ""Connecting People.

In fact, business owner optimism about the outlook for their own businesses in the next six months has reached a 20-year survey high.Six in 10 business leaders feel highly optimistic about the prospects for their own company despite remaining cautious about the national and their local economies. The gap between optimism for their company versus the broader U.S. economy is now at a survey high of 34 percentage points, nearly double the historic survey average (18 percentage points).The survey, now in its 21st year, also revealed that leaders are expecting a better overall business environment with nearly two-thirds (63%) expressing belief that business conditions in the U.S. will improve in the next six months and a majority (58%) expecting to see sales increases in the same timeframe. ""Although we expect the Federal Reserve to continue to raise interest rates in the spring of 2023 and economic growth is slowing, businesses remain optimistic about their own near-term prospects. In particular, business owners are finding that strong market conditions are prompting decisions to raise prices for the goods and services they offer,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist of The PNC Financial Services Group.Business owners also see an easing in pricing pressures. Fewer businesses than in the last three waves of the semi-annual survey report that they plan to increase their own prices to customers by 5% or more in the next six months. In addition, fewer than half (47%) anticipate supplier prices to increase in the next six months, down from over half (53%) last fall and returning to a level similar to a year ago (46%). Fewer businesses (21%) expect consumer price increases of 5% or more in the U.S. economy, overall, compared to last fall (36%).Story continuesSupply chain concerns also are declining. More businesses expect supply chain timeliness to improve compared to six months ago, and fewer are experiencing inventory shortages. While supply chain disruptions remain the top worry for two in 10 (18%) owners, this area of concern no longer stands out significantly from others, and in fact, matches the proportion primarily concerned about the cost of materials (18%).""It is clear that inflationary pressures are easing. Businesses are finding it easier to obtain materials and supplies, inventory levels are returning to normal, and businesses are expecting inflation to slow. But with the tight job market, labor costs remain a concern,"" Faucher said.The portion of business owners expecting to increase their number of full-time employees declined from six months ago, while the difficulty in hiring remains constant. Specifically, a little more than one in 10 (13%) business owners expect to increase their number of full-time employees over the next six months, down from two in 10 (21%) last fall and a year ago (20%). A similar portion (15%) expect to increase the number of part-time employees over the same timeframe, unchanged from last fall and up from 8% a year ago.Among businesses actively hiring employees, more than one-third (36%) say it's become harder to hire qualified candidates over the past six months, similar to last fall (39%) and last spring (36%). The most common barrier among those having difficulty hiring is the lack of applicants (47%). Other challenges facing business leaders experiencing difficulty in hiring qualified employees include candidates' lack of job-related skills or experience (22%) and compensation requirements that are higher than the business can afford to pay (19%).Other findings in the survey include:Quest for Credit: Nearly two in 10 (17%) business owners expect to request a loan or line of credit in the next six months, up from last fall (6%) and a year ago (11%). Among the eight in 10 unlikely to request a loan or line of credit, more than three-quarters (77%) say they have no need for funds; one-quarter are hesitant to take on debt, less than two in 10 (16%) feel the cost of credit is too high and only a few (8%) have a concern about the loan process or the ability of the business to qualify.Preparing for Cash Flow Issues: Three-quarters (74%) of businesses are currently maintaining an emergency cash reserve fund, up sharply from 58% last fall. Among businesses with an emergency reserve, half consider the amount to be about average (50%), similar to last fall (54%), while four in 10 say their current reserves are higher than what is typical for the business (41%), an increase since last fall (28%). Construction businesses are among those most likely to report higher reserves than normal (56%), particularly compared to 35% of service and 38% of retail/wholesale industry businesses.Full national and regional survey results are available at pnc.mediaroom.com.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

(NYSE: PNW) today reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $483.6 million, or $4.26 per diluted share, for full-year 2022. This result compares with net income of $618.7 million, or $5.47 per diluted share, in 2021.For the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2022, Pinnacle West reported a consolidated net loss attributable to common shareholders of $24.0 million, or a loss of $0.21 per diluted share compared with net income of $27.6 million, or $0.24 per share, for the same period in 2021.The lower 2022 full-year results reflect the unfavorable outcome of the company’s prior rate case, which was implemented on Dec. 1, 2021. As a result of that rate decision, the Company is no longer deferring costs related to the Four Corners selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and Ocotillo modernization projects to a regulatory asset. These costs are now reflected in the income statement and result in a reduction in net income.Other factors negatively affecting 2022 results included lower revenue driven by the inability to continue using alternative revenue accounting treatment for the lost fixed cost recovery (LFCR) mechanism; higher depreciation and amortization expense due to increased plant assets and updated depreciation rates; higher operations and maintenance expense; and an impairment charge related to a non-utility equity investment held by subsidiary Bright Canyon Energy. These negative factors were partially offset by higher revenue driven by the effects of weather; strong customer growth; higher retail sales; increased transmission revenue and lower income taxes.Story continues""The past year was one of our most challenging years in recent memory as we faced major financial headwinds resulting from the outcome of our last rate case,"" said Pinnacle West Chairman, President and CEO Jeff Guldner. ""The effect of that decision by the Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC) required a financial reset and resulted in a 22% decline in year-over-year profitability.""Even so, Guldner said the full-year 2022 financial results came in above budgeted expectations as a direct outcome of favorable weather, robust customer growth, higher-than-expected sales growth and a resolute workforce. ""Our employees effectively responded to the challenges thrown their way. We met or exceeded nearly every target we set for ourselves – including delivering strong service reliability to our customers,"" he added. ""By executing on our comprehensive operational and financial strategies, we enter 2023 in a solid position to provide top-level service for our customers and energize Arizona’s economic expansion.""Arizona’s Economy: Opportunity Amidst ChallengesAs the nation faces a weakening economic climate, the Arizona economy is more diverse than ever. With a record number of people, businesses and advanced manufacturing giants moving to the state, the company’s service territory remains among the fastest growing in the nation.Arizona Public Service Co. (APS), the company’s principal subsidiary, experienced customer growth of 2.1% in 2022 and anticipates additional growth in the range of 1.5% to 2.5% through 2025.Annual retail electricity sales increased 2.4% in 2022 compared with the prior year and are expected to average an incredible 4.5% to 6.5% annually through 2025 after already averaging a solid 2.5% for the past three years.Making Customers Our PriorityEmployees remain committed to putting customers first and achieving an industry-leading best-in-class customer experience. As a result, extraordinary progress was made on that front in 2022. APS earned customer ratings making it one of the most improved utilities in the nation for both residential and business customer satisfaction as rated by J.D. Power (JDP).Compared to 2021, APS achieved quartile gains in every single driver of residential customer satisfaction, firmly lifting the company into the second quartile nationally. Consequently, overall residential satisfaction is now above industry benchmarks when compared to the company’s large investor-owned peers. APS’s strongest performing drivers for the year were Customer Care (phone and digital), Power Quality &amp; Reliability, Corporate Citizenship, and Billing &amp; Payment.Additionally, JDP’s Business 2022 full-year results place the company in the top – or first – quartile of utilities nationally for business customers.Advancing Arizona’s Clean Energy FutureFollowing the third anniversary of its Clean Energy Commitment, the company continues to advance its goal of providing customers with 100% clean, carbon-free electricity by 2050 – while taking the necessary steps to maintain reliability and affordable prices for customers over the long term.Since 2020, the company has procured 2,115 megawatts of energy resources, consisting primarily of carbon-free solar and energy storage facilities across our system. This year alone, the company expects to add 210 MWs of utility-scale solar energy, 238 MWs of wind energy, and 341 MWs of energy storage.According to Guldner, a balanced energy portfolio, including continued reliance on Palo Verde Generating Station; natural gas-fired generation as a transitional resource; a gradual, well-planned departure from coal; and expanded energy efficiency and demand-side management programs ""will help us maintain affordability and reliability for our customers during the clean energy transition.""""This approach, combined with ongoing investments in the grid, provides a modernized, resilient and hardened system,"" he stated.Financial OutlookFor 2023, the company estimates its consolidated earnings guidance will be in the range of $3.95 to $4.15 per diluted share on a weather-normalized basis.

Target also bucked projections for a decline in comparable sales, thanks to a slight increase in customer traffic.The results position Target for a rebound this year, albeit a modest one: The company said adjusted earnings would rise to no more than $8.75 a share from $6.02 in 2022, trailing the $9.25 average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The muted outlook echoed the message from Walmart Inc.’s earnings report last week, as US retailers ring up sales even as consumer sentiment flags amid a cloudy economic outlook.“The biggest variable is just, what is the path of the consumer?” Chief Financial Officer Michael Fiddelke said at a meeting of Target executives with investors and analysts in New York. “It’s an uncertain environment and we want to plan cautiously.”The shares rose 2.4% at 11:47 a.m. in New York. Target climbed 12% this year through Monday, in line with the gain in an S&amp;P index of US consumer-discretionary companies. The shares plunged 36% last year, Target’s worst annual decline since at least 1981.Target’s outlook underscores the mixed signals from US shoppers. Consumer confidence unexpectedly fell in February, as rising prices and deepening concerns about the outlook outweighed the benefits of a solid labor market.Story continues“Walmart and Target both easily beat expectations in Q4 but offered a gloomy outlook for 2023,” Stephen Stanley, an economist at Santander, said in a note. “Everyone is braced for the worst, but, as the January data on employment, consumer spending, etc. show, so far, the economy is holding up well.”Indeed, Target surprised analysts with the strength of its fourth-quarter results. Revenue climbed 1.3% to $31.4 billion, the company said in a statement. That surpassed Wall Street’s projections by almost $1 billion.The Minneapolis-based retailer posted a comparable-sales gain of 0.7%, while analysts had projected a decline of 1.7%. Inventory fell 2.9% to $13.5 billion, a welcome relief after a jump of more than 40% early last year as demand for discretionary items weakened and unwanted merchandise piled up.Surging inventory forced discounts on many goods and hammered profit margins earlier in 2022. In the fourth quarter, though, Target’s stockpile of discretionary merchandise fell about 13% — a sign the retailer is bringing the problem under control.Profitability OutlookA year ago, Target predicted that operating income would reach 8% of revenue in the fiscal year ending in early 2023, and Wall Street has homed in on that metric to assess the company’s profitability. But last year’s actual operating margin turned out to be 3.5%, while adjusted earnings were less than half of 2021’s total.Target is predicting a gain in operating income of more than $1 billion this year, which would lift the total to at least $4.8 billion. That implies an operating margin of a little more than 4%, based on analysts’ sales estimates.Over the next three years, Target said its operating margin would reach and then exceed its pre-pandemic rate of 6%. Indeed, the company said it could attain that level as soon as the fiscal year that ends in early 2025. That would depend “on the speed of recovery for the economy and consumer demand.”Last year, Target said it gained market share in all five of its merchandise categories in terms of units sold, as opposed to dollar sales. That’s a key gauge it’s watching this year as it seeks to engage customers and work its way back from last year’s woes.Target’s outlook was “better than feared,” Rupesh Parikh, an analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co., said in a note to clients. “We believe the elements are clearly now in place for a multiyear profit recovery.”--With assistance from Cécile Daurat.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekMicrosoft Expands Game Pass as Regulators Fret Over Activision DealThis Road Could Save the Planet—and Carve Up Alaskan WildernessThe NFL’s Top Talent Agency Bought by Venture InvestorsThe Fed-Up Copywriter Who Helped France Finally Embrace #MeTooHigher Interest Rates Slam Stocks and Profits But Spare Workers©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Higher costs for everything from food to gas is weighing on Americans, though there has been some easing of inflation in recent months.Part of the reason inflationary pressures have eased, at least for some things, is a campaign by the Federal Reserve to cool spending, and the economy. Those efforts make using credit cards more expensive, which can negatively impact retailers.But how Americans spend is changing, too. More people are spending money on travel or going out for dinner than they were during the pandemic, which can mean they are spending less at stores.Walmart said it expects sales at stores opened at least a year for its U.S. business to rise 2% or 2.5% for the year, while Home Depot forecasts growth for that metric to be roughly flat this year compared with a year ago.For the full year, Target expects comparable sales — those from stores open at least a year and online channels — will range from a low single-digit decline to a low single-digit increase.Story continues“We're planning our business cautiously in the near term to ensure we remain agile and responsive to the current operating environment,"" Cornell said in a statement.Target's total comparable sales inched up 0.7% in the fiscal fourth quarter compared with a year ago. That was fueled by increased customer traffic, but customers are shifting their spending to necessities like food and paper towels over discretionary items like fashion. Groceries typically have a much smaller profit margin. Still, Target said that shoppers are attracted to new and trendy clothing, and that's a key reason for increased store visits.Cornell noted that the company entered the year in a “very healthy inventory position,” reflecting its conservative approach in discretionary items. Inventory in categories like fashion was roughly 13% lower in the fourth quarter than a year ago.Target has taken a bigger hit to its business compared to other big box retailers likely because it relies more on discretionary items like clothing and home furnishings. More than 50% of Walmart’s U.S. business comes from groceries; that number is 20% at Target.It was the fourth consecutive quarter that retailer's profit has slipped. Target reported a 52% drop in third quarter profits, 90% in the second quarter and a 52% decline in the first.In early June, Target warned that it was canceling orders from suppliers and aggressively cutting prices because of a pronounced spending shift by Americans.Last November, Target said it was slashing expenses with a goal of saving $2 billion to $3 billion over the next three years. At that time, it said shoppers were waiting to buy on sale, purchasing smaller packages and trading down to store brands instead of national labels, which tend to be more expensive.But even as Target projects lower sales, the retailer is pushing ahead to accelerate its e-commerce strategy. It announced last week that it will spend $100 million to develop a larger network of package sorting centers that cut the cost of delivering online orders while increasing the speed of delivery.Target said that its drive up service for returns will be rolled out to all stores by the end of this summer. Customers will be able to return most new, unopened items within 90 days of purchases without leaving their car.Target also plans to open about 20 new stores in addition to renovating 175 of them. One of the big attractions has been its partnership with Ulta Beauty to have shops at the store. Last year, its sales from Ulta Beauty at Target were more than four times higher than in 2021, the company said.Target also aims to launch or expand more than 10 owned brands. In addition, the retailer will appeal to price sensitive shoppers with more items starting at $3, $5, $10 and $15.Fourth-quarter profits fell to $876 million, or $1.89 per share, for the quarter that ended Jan. 23. That compares with $1.54 billion, or $3.21 per share, in the year-ago period.Sales rose 1.3%, to $31.4 billion. Analysts were expecting earnings of $1.40 a share on sales of $30.7 billion, according to FactSet.Fourth-quarter gross margin rate was 22.7% compared with 25.7% in 2021, reflecting pressure from higher markdowns, net merchandise costs, and so-called shrink, which reflects inventory losses related to such factors as theft, fraud or damage.The company expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $7.75 to $8.75 for the year. Analysts were expecting $9.18, according to FactSet.Target said that over the next three years, it expects its operating income margin rate will reach, and begin to move beyond, its pre-pandemic rate of 6% as early as fiscal 2024, depending on the economic recovery and consumer demand.Shares rose $4.42 to $171.23 Tuesday.___Follow Anne D’Innocenzio on Twitter ]"

Price and EPS SurpriseRoss Stores, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseRoss Stores, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Ross Stores, Inc.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $55.64 billion, indicating growth of 7.2% from the prior-year reported figure.The bottom line of this Issaquah, WA-based company is anticipated to have improved year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings per share has risen by a penny to $3.21 over the past 30 days and suggests an increase of 9.9% from the year-ago period.We expect revenues to increase 5.4% year over year to $54,684.1 million and the bottom line to increase 5.3% to $3.07 per share.Costco has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 3.7%, on average. In the last reported quarter, the company’s bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.3%.Key Factors to ConsiderCostco’s growth strategies, better price management, decent membership trends and the increasing penetration of the e-commerce business have been contributing to its upbeat performance. The company’s strategy to sell products at discounted prices has helped attract customers who have been seeking both value and convenience amid the inflationary environment.Costco Wholesale Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseCostco Wholesale Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseCostco Wholesale Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Costco Wholesale Corporation QuoteThe abovementioned factors have been aiding this operator of membership warehouses in registering an impressive sales run. We estimate a 5.3% jump in net sales and a 7.8% rise in total membership fees for the quarter under discussion. No wonder, the company’s total paid members have been rising. Its growing customer base and high renewal rates have been fueling sales. We expect a 4.2% jump in comparable sales for the second quarter.Despite these tailwinds, margins remain an area to watch. Any deleverage in the SG&amp;A rate, higher labor and occupancy costs, and increased marketing and other store-related expenses might have weighed on margins.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Costco this time.

The Zacks analyst believes that the company’s near-term prospect looks gloomy due to weakening demand for its chips used in gaming and data center end markets. While the macroeconomic headwinds are impacting gaming and data center chip demand, higher channel inventory levels are hurting chip prices. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war is likely to continue negatively impacting NVIDIA’s near-term revenues.Nonetheless, solid uptake of artificial intelligence-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions is likely to aid NVIDIA’s growth. Additionally, collaboration with the likes of Mercedes-Benz and Audi is expected to further strengthen NVIDIA’s presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Visa have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year (+0.9% vs. -6.4%). The Zacks analyst believes that the company’s numerous buyouts and alliances paved the way for long-term growth and consistently drove its revenues. Constant investments in technology are solidifying its position in the payments market. A shift in payments to the digital mode is a boon for Visa.Story continuesA strong cash position enables it to boost shareholder value. However, high operating expenses stress the margins.

Supply-chain disruptions, logistical challenges, and manufacturing inefficiencies are playing spoilsports.Additionally, high inflation, rising interest rates, and an uncertain macro environment also raise concern for Toyota as the auto industry is highly cyclic.

218,10dbb48e-d1f0-3d97-b693-4821f64550df,V,2023-02-28,7 Dynamite Dividend Stocks for Income and Growth in 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-dynamite-dividend-stocks-income-174609851.html,1677260769,STORY,"['CVX', 'LLY', 'AVGO', 'PM', 'MDLZ', 'V', 'RTX']","[Many long-term investors appreciate dividend stocks, for many reasons. Companies that pay back a portion of their profits to their shareholders via dividends are generally more reliable. Additionally, dividend stocks provide investors looking for income in retirement with a steady stream of passive income.Generally, dividends are typically issued by well-established, financially stable companies that are often household names. And the most dependable dividend stocks have long histories of distributing capital to their shareholders. That’s what many such investors focus on.With the market showing consistent improvement, dividend stocks are likely to provide growth and income in 2023. Investors can choose to reinvest their dividends back into a given stock, or can choose to receive the dividend payments as cash, which can provide a steady stream of income.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDividend-yielding companies tend to be financially healthy and stable over the long term. They tend to be wise investments anytime, especially in an upward-trending market.PMPhilip Morris$98.42LLYEli Lilly$323.35CVXChevron$161.00AVGOBroadcom$575.77RTXRaytheon$98.74VVisa$218.73MDLZMondelez$65.17Philip Morris (PM) An image of a cigarette and an e-cigarette side-by-side on a wood surface.Source: vfhnb12 / Shutterstock.comPhilip Morris (NYSE:PM) is a leading tobacco company known for the biggest cigarette brands. However, because Philip Morris operates in a highly-regulated industry and faces declining smoking rates, many investors could easily ignore it.That said, the company is pivoting into an evolving tobacco industry with a strategy that looks to give it a significant advantage over its competitors. That positioning and its substantial dividend make PM stock very potent.Let’s start with Philip Morris’ dividend. It yields around 5%, which is quite high. This dividend is also relatively stable, having last been reduced in 2008. In 2022, shareholders received $5.04 in dividend payments for each share of PM stock owned. Analysts expect PM stock to increase to $111 in the next 12-18 months, and it currently trades around $100 per share. So, there’s roughly a 15% upside baked into the stock, if analyst estimates are to be believed.Story continuesPhilip Morris is relying on growth from its smokeless tobacco brands, which have been profitable, while competitors rely more heavily on cigarettes for revenues even as smoking rates continue to decline.Eli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XISource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comInvestors should seriously consider Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) stock. The company develops and sells medications in various therapeutic areas, including diabetes, oncology, and immunology. Currently, its diabetes drug, Mounjaro, has investors excited.Overall, Eli Lilly appeals to investors seeking exposure to the pharmaceutical industry and a steady source of income. Those considering Eli Lilly note that this company is a highly-profitable, fast-growing, dependable dividend stock with a potent catalyst for future growth in Mounjaro.Eli Lilly boasts exceptionally high profitability metrics within a drug manufacturing industry known for increased profitability. Its gross, operating, and net margins exceed the 90th percentile of industry competitors. Further, the firm’s cost of capital is 3.5%, while it returns 21.55% on that capital.LLY stock provides a modest forward dividend yield around 1.4%. However, this distribution was last reduced in 1986, so it’s dependable. Lastly, Eli Lilly is seeking FDA approval to market the diabetes drug Mounjaro for weight loss. Sales of Mounjaro recently fell short of expectations, but the company still exceeded expectations and could take off when and if Mounjaro receives FDA approval.Chevron (CVX) Chevron logo on blue sign in front of skyscraper buildingSource: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comChevron (NYSE:CVX) is an American multinational energy corporation that has seen a very strong 2022. The company is among the world’s largest producers of oil and natural gas. Although Chevron had a strong 2022, challenges related to the volatility of commodity prices and environmental concerns make it somewhat volatile. But its dividend balances those concerns as a source of income. With its current lower price, Chevron looks like a buy.The energy sector was the strongest performer in 2022. Oil majors, including Chevron, Shell (NYSE:SHEL), and Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) profited more than $132 billion in 2022, returning $78 billion through buybacks and dividends. But investors have shied away from CVX, which has seen its stock price drop considerably of late. Concerns over environmental issues and an unclear situation in Ukraine are likely factors.That said, 2022 showed that oil demand will likely remain robust for a long time. That gives Chevron a potent catalyst moving forward as it continues to provide revenue for shareholders.Broadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office buildingSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.comBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock is a strong choice for investors seeking semiconductor exposure and dividends. The company designs, develop and sells semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. Its software is used across multiple industries, including telecommunications, data centers, and enterprise software.Broadcom offers investors growth and income. Currently, AVGO shares currently trade for $575 and carry an average target price of $665. AVGO’s dividend yielded 3.1% at last count, totaling $16.90 in dividends per share last year. Assuming Broadcom continues to pay $4.60 quarterly for all of 2023, it’ll reward investors with $18.40 of dividends in 2023. So, Broadcom’s value could grow to $683.40 per share, which equates to 14.86% growth.The company will re-release earnings on Mar. 2 after a strong 2022 in which revenues grew 21% to $33.2 billion. Broadcom’s net income growth was even more robust in 2022, growing by 70.65% and reaching $11.495 billion.Raytheon (RTX) Raytheon (RTX) defense company logo hanging from glass buildingSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comRaytheon (NYSE:RTX) stock represents a multinational aerospace and defense company that sells systems and services to commercial, military, and government customers worldwide. Its products include missile defense systems, radar, and communication systems.Raytheon has paid a dividend for several decades. However, it was reduced in 2021, so investors seeking rock-solid increases should beware. In any case, it provides reliable, if fluctuating, income to long-term investors.The company has strong growth prospects, including high demand for weapons orders tied to the Ukraine conflict. Additionally, with other geopolitical pressures coming out of China and other regions, there’s plenty to like about the company’s long-term prospects. Although revenues related to the war in Ukraine have been substantial, supply chain issues have hampered deliveries. That suggests Raytheon could move higher if and when those issues are sorted.Raytheon expects between $72 to $73 billion in sales for fiscal 2023. That would represent between 7.3% and 8.8% top-line growth over its 2022 results. Indeed, I think these numbers should entice investors as this growth rate would significantly outpace the company’s 4% growth seen between 2021 and 2022.Visa (V) several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comVisa (NYSE:V) is a multinational financial services corporation providing payment processing and digital payment solutions for individuals and businesses globally. The company is most notable for offering credit and debit cards but also provides payment gateway and risk management services.Visa shares include a dividend, yielding very modest 0.8%. So, it won’t provide substantial income or dividends that allow for any sort of significant share repurchases upon reinvestment. That said, the company’s dividend is highly-dependable, having last been reduced in 2008, and growing 17.4% over the last five years. In any case, Visa’s pricing upside is most attractive.The company’s Q1 revenue grew by 12%, with cross-border travel as a bright spot. Payments volume remained stable. Cross-border volume increased by 22%, suggesting that travel remains strong even as overall economic concerns remain substantial. Visa returned $4 billion to shareholders during the period as well.Mondelez (MDLZ) The Mondelez website magnified by a magnifying glassSource: ShutterstockLast on this list of dividend stocks to buy is Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ). This diversified consumer goods stock has impressive upside, a solid dividend, and ended 2022 on a strong note. Those factors should interest investors in the snack company that sells Oreos, Wheat Thins, Chips Ahoy!, and BelVita.Firstly, MDLZ stock has roughly a $10 upside above its current $66 price, according to analyst. This is among the dividend stocks I think is worth buying, despite its modest 2.3% yield. That’s because Mondelez has grown its revenue by 12.3% over the last five years. The math suggests plenty of appreciation for investors willing to buy now.Additionally, Mondelez’s performance leading into 2023 only strengthens that notion. Revenues increased 9.7% overall in 2022 and grew an even faster 13.5% rate in Q4.Mondelez’s organic revenue growth reached 12.3% in 2022 and 15.4% in Q4. Its core brands are performing well and should bolster investor confidence in MDLZ as an investment.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

219,a4f30b57-a73e-39fe-8ceb-335fc7bbcaff,MAR,2023-02-28,"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Airbnb, Marriott International, New Relic, Meta Platforms and Snapchat",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-investment-ideas-feature-highlights-112011237.html,1677583211,STORY,"['MAR', 'NEWR', 'META', 'ABNB', 'SNAP']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – February 28, 2023 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Airbnb ABNB, Marriott International MAR, New Relic NEWR, Meta Platforms META and Snapchat SNAP.3 Key Elements of Winning Stocks -- This Trio Has Them“Simplicity Is the Ultimate Sophistication”Thousands of years ago, revered Chinese military general and strategist Sun Tzu once said, “I have just three things to teach: simplicity, patience and compassion.” Years later, Leonardo da Vinci came along and was a 16th-century “Renaissance Man,” known for his painting masterpieces, engineering, architecture, sculpting and more. Despite his many achievements and high praise, da Vinci equated his success to not overcomplicating things but simplifying them, explaining, “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.”With the advent of the internet, complex trading platforms, and tons of real-time information, traders can easily feel overwhelmed or suffer from “paralysis by analysis.”For this reason, it can be helpful for traders to focus on the most important building blocks of what makes a stock move higher:Supply and demand (price &amp; volume).Rising current earnings and estimates.An easy-to-understand catalyst.Today we will cover 3 stocks that have these qualities, including:AirbnbShort-term rental marketplace operator Airbnb holds the best possible Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and recently reported its most impressive quarter as a public company.Current Earnings &amp; Estimates: Airbnb smashed consensus estimates by 77.78%, while EPS jumped 500% on revenue growth of 24%, year-over-year. Zacks Consensus Estimates show that the blistering growth is likely to continue.Catalyst:The most significant driver of Airbnb’s growth is the unprecedented shift to remote work that is currently taking place. The COVID-19 pandemic forced a large portion of the workforce to move online. While the world has moved past lockdowns and has reopened, many employees and companies remain remote for two reasons:Story continuesFirst, from an employer perspective, studies are showing that remote workers tend to be more productive working from home versus when they are in the office. Also, employers can save money by allowing employees to continue to work remotely and can save money by downsizing or eliminating office space entirely. Second, employees appreciate the freedom to work remotely.Because remote workers only require a strong Wi-Fi connection and a laptop, many take advantage of their newfound freedom by combining leisure travel and work, driving demand for Airbnb. What’s even better for Airbnb’s prospects is that guests are staying longer at each destination recently. Airbnb’s last earnings report states, “Gross nights booked in Q4 2022 for more than a week are 40% higher than Q4 2019.”Price &amp; Volume Action Beyond its impressive fundamental picture and robust expected growth moving forward, ABNB will likely attract institutional investors. Why? Institutions look for the rare combination of high liquidity and strong growth. Airbnb has this rare combination. The hospitality giant has a $78 billion market cap to complement its double-digit revenue growth and triple-digit EPS growth.Demand for shares is showing up in the price and volume action. After reporting Q4 earnings on February 15th, shares vaulted by 13% on volume quadrupling the norm. Though shares pulled back with the market last week, the price action was uniform, and volume plummeted.Presently, the hospitality business is not a zero-sum game in which only Airbnb or traditional hotels can win. Hotel giants such as Marriott International are showing strong growth and price action. However, Airbnb is the current dominant player in the hospitality space due to its innovative product offering, newness as a public company, and strong growth.New RelicZacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock New Relic is a software analytics provider that empowers clients to develop applications, review real-time analytics, and monitor production.Current Earnings &amp; Estimates: After several unprofitable quarters, New Relic has swung to profitability in the past two. New Relic is also growing revenue at a double-digit clip. While the software provider is turning the corner and on the right track, the analyst community expects standout earnings over the next year.Catalyst: New Relic’s technology is aimed at helping engineering teams to organize themselves and make better decisions based on data. In a recent presentation, New Relic’s management team highlighted that the number of professional computer engineers is expected to rise from 25 million to 34 million by 2025. To put it simply, more engineers should equate to more growth.Price &amp; Volume Action Shares of New Relic spiked higher following its earnings report on February 8th. Volume turnover was heavy, coming in at six times the norm. Like ABNB, NEWR is digesting the big gains on miniscule volume. Look for shares to gain traction if they can break out above the trendline in the chart below.Meta PlatformsZacks Rank #2 stock Meta Platforms has taken investors on a wild ride over the past few years. At the direction of CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the parent company of WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram drastically changed its strategy and began to focus heavily on the metaverse.Current Earnings &amp; Estimates: During Meta’s restructuring efforts, earnings and sales have dropped off precipitously (EPS growth was -52% in the most recent quarter). Nevertheless, what’s important in the stock market is how the earnings compare to analyst estimates and what the road ahead looks like. From that standpoint, analysts expect EPS to 9.65 this year, up from 8.59 reported in 2022. In Q4, META also smashed consensus estimates by more than 40%.Catalyst: Meta has three main catalysts:Stock Buybacks: Meta is dramatically increasing its share buyback program. Buybacks increase demand for shares while decreasing supply.International Growth: While Meta is already the dominant social media player domestically, the company is experiencing steady growth in the Asia Pacific region.New Offerings: Meta’s “Reels” product is becoming very popular on Instagram. Reels allow users to view and share short-form videos – similar to Byte Dance’s Tik Tok or Snapchat. If Meta can monetize this part of the business successfully, advertising revenue should soar.Price &amp; Volume ActionMeta finally cleared its 200-day moving average after being stuck below it for a year. After announcing its recent earnings surprise and buyback, META shares rocketed higher by 23% on volume nearly four times the average. Such a big upside move in a mega-cap stock like Meta is both rare and bullish.ConclusionAirbnb, New Relic and Meta are three stocks with ingredients found in big winning stocks. With the market and the economy turning, these companies are showing considerable earnings potential and the strong price and volume action to go along with it. Furthermore, each has easy-to-understand catalysts that should act as a tailwind for years to come. Prospective investors should wait for a clear break above the trendlines pictured in the charts above to get involved.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

The more active May contract rose $1.41, or 1.7%, to $83.45.U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained $1.37, or 1.8%, to $77.05 a barrel.""We're getting to a point where we're seeing some short-covering because it's the end of the month,"" said Price Group analyst Phil Flynn.For the month of February, Brent fell about 0.7%, while WTI dropped about 2.5%.Expectations of demand recovery in China underpinned gains, with the market awaiting key data over the next two days. Economists polled by Reuters expected that factory activity in the world's second-largest economy grew in February.""China's economic recovery will drive its demand for commodities higher, with oil positioned to benefit the most,"" JPMorgan analysts said in a client note.Urals crude exports to China from Russia's Western ports rose in February from the previous month, on lower freight costs and rising demand, Reuters sources said.Oil prices are expected to rise above $90 a barrel toward the second half of 2023 as Chinese demand recovers and Russian output falls, a Reuters poll showed on Tuesday.Similarly, JPMorgan's oil analysts maintained their 2023 average price forecast on Brent at $90 a barrel.Gains were capped by the threat of more U.S. rate increases after stronger-than-expected new orders for core U.S. capital goods in January, with U.S. Federal Reserve Governor Philip Jefferson saying inflation for services remained ""stubbornly high"".The voices of those expecting a 0.5% increase in interest rates by the Fed next month are getting louder, said PVM Oil analyst Tamas Varga.Story continuesThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has pumped 28.97 million barrels per day (bpd) this month, a Reuters survey found, up by 150,000 bpd from January. Output is still down more than 700,000 bpd from September.Meanwhile in the U.S., crude production fell in December to 12.10 million bpd, its lowest since August 2022, Energy Information Administration (EIA) data showed.However, U.S. crude stockpiles have been growing and were forecast to post a 10th consecutive week of builds, with analysts in a Reuters poll expecting a rise of nearly half a million barrels last week.U.S. crude oil inventories rose by about 6.2 million barrels in the week ended Feb. 24, according to market sources citing American Petroleum Institute figures on Tuesday. [API/S]Official U.S. government data on stockpiles is due on Wednesday.(Reporting by Stephanie Kelly in New York; additional reporting by Ahmad Ghaddar in London and Trixie Yap in Singapore; Editing by Marguerita Choy and David Gregorio)]"

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Snap-On in FocusHeadquartered in Kenosha, Snap-On (SNA) is a Consumer Discretionary stock that has seen a price change of 8% so far this year. The tool and diagnostic equipment maker is paying out a dividend of $1.62 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.63% compared to the Tools - Handheld industry's yield of 0.19% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.63%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $6.48 is up 10.2% from last year. In the past five-year period, Snap-On has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 14.61%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Snap-On's current payout ratio is 39%, meaning it paid out 39% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for SNA for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $17.09 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 1.61%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that SNA is not only an attractive dividend play, but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 20 Years.On February 24, the Bureau of Economic Analysis released the Personal Income and Outlays for January 2023 which revealed that the PCE price index recorded a 0.6% increase in January. The PCE price index has gone up by 5.4% over the 12-month period from January 2022 to January 2023. Stocks went down after the announcement, with the S&amp;P 500 closing below 4,000, the Nasdaq Composite closing below 11,500, and the Dow closing below 33,000.Shortly after the BEA released the PCE numbers for January 2023, Fitz-Gerald Group Principal Keith Fitz-Gerald appeared on Yahoo Finance to discuss what this means for the Fed and how investors should position themselves. The sell-off on Friday was not a result of inflation, and was instead a result of ""the amount of leverage that's being carried"", noted Fitz-Gerald. According to Keith Fitz-Gerald, ""if the Fed wants to raise more aggressively, all of these huge traders that are leveraged up to their eyeballs are not gonna want to carry that because it costs them more money"".Keith Fitz-Gerald sees pressure into the second quarter of 2023 and he thinks that ""the Fed might have to admit that it was wrong about rates and labor as it was about transitory"". Here are some comments from Keith Fitz-Gerald:""I think, right now, the markets will correct themselves as investors figure out that their best friends are going to be companies. (Companies) that are still putting up great numbers, that still got great dividends, that are still moving forward into this market, because those are the kind of plays that you want to go for.""We have compiled a list of 22 most profitable stocks of the last 20 years that have managed to weather economic downturns and generate huge profits.

However, we’ve become increasingly concerned about the outlook for some of its recently launched therapeutics, as well as some generic competition in a few of its mature drugs. If pressed, we still like the odds that Novartis will do well, but the outlook is a little cloudier than it’s been in a while.

Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”15. Verizon Communications Inc.

(NYSE:VZ) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“We sold the entire position in Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), which was a disappointing investment, on concerns that the company is losing market share in a very competitive business and because we believed we had better use for the funds elsewhere.”14. TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE)Average Net Income: $11.53 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 21At the end of Q4 2022, 21 hedge funds held positions in TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE). The total value of these positions was $1.93 billion. This is compared to 22 hedge funds in the previous quarter with stakes worth $1.56 billion.In fiscal 2022, TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) generated an annual net income of $20.53 billion. The company has generated an annual net income of $11.53 billion, on average, over the last 20 years. TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) is ranked fourteenth on our list of the most profitable stocks of the last 20 years.As of December 31, Alyeska Investment Group is the top investor in TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) and has disclosed a position worth $60.5 million in the company.Here is what Artisan Partners had to say about TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“We added one new position this quarter, TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE). TTE is one of the world’s largest energy companies. It develops and produces oil and gas, produces and sells refined products, is one of the largest producers and traders of LNG, and owns a large portfolio of renewable power generating assets. TTE has one of the lowest cost portfolios of oil and gas assets and therefore one of the lowest breakeven points in the industry. It also has one of the best balance sheets in the industry. We estimate it will reach a net cash position sometime in 2023.The valuation of TTE—and that of Shell—is fascinating. TTE sells at approximately 4X earnings and has a 5% dividend yield. With its current buyback program and a recently announced special dividend, the owners yield is more than 10%. The valuation and owners yield are not dissimilar to those of Shell, which we also own and which trades at just under 5X earnings. To say that a discount is attached to European oil companies relative to US peers is an understatement. Exxon Mobil sells at 8X earnings, Chevron 9X and Conoco 8X. If TTE and Shell redomiciled to the US, their share prices would probably double.We have a few theories for the valuation anomaly. First, as mentioned above, Europe generally trades at a big discount to the US. In the case of TTE and Shell, this makes no economic sense. The oil and gas business is a global one, and TTE and Shell have attractive assets. The main explanation, we believe, is that large sections of the European asset management industry will not invest in oil and gas because of ESG restrictions. Yet if the recent war in Ukraine and the current energy crisis have shown us nothing else, the supply of energy is an enormous social good. Indeed, it is an existential good. Moreover, it is companies such as TTE that will invest billions to supply the LNG that Europe desperately needs to restore its economy and reduce the crushing cost burden on families who must now choose between heating their homes and eating. Finally, TTE is also investing billions per year in renewable power generating assets such as wind and solar. Such assets will likely never replace clean burning natural gas and nuclear as base power suppliers, but they are a valuable and clean adjunct to modern grids. We believe TTE’s renewable portfolio is worth between $25 billion and $35 billion and is moving from almost no profit contribution toward meaningful levels of profit over the next few years. We wonder how it makes sense for investors to disinvest from these kinds of assets on ethical grounds.”13. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Average Net Income: $12.67 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 84On January 24, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) posted earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022.

(NYSE:PFE) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Labs, global pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG). Although Pfizer continues to report strong performance of its core drugs, sales of its COVID vaccine and treatment have likely peaked and sales are expected to decline going forward. We remain optimistic about the company long term as we believe management is taking the company in the right direction, focusing R&amp;D, and making strategic acquisitions with profits generated from COVID vaccine sales.”11. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Average Net Income: $12.93 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Walmart Inc.

That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”10.

Despite the positives of higher interest rates and the company making good progress on reducing expenses and regulatory consent orders, Wells Fargo shares have fallen one-third from their highs earlier this year to roughly 6.5x our estimate of normalized earnings power, and the stock ended the quarter at ~1x next year’s tangible book value. We find this is far too cheap for a strong banking franchise capable of tangible returns in the low-to-mid teens across business cycles.”8.

The current company was formed through various mergers including NationsBank, FleetBoston, US Trust, Countrywide Financial, and Merrill Lynch with the legacy commercial bank to form a national banking powerhouse and bulge bracket investment firm. As one of the ‘Big Four’ U.S. banks it enjoys scale driven cost advantages and economies of scale which provide meaningful competitive advantages and potential for strong returns in the largely commoditized banking industry. A survivor of the financial crisis, BAC has emerged with a solid capital base and stands to benefit from a rising interest rate environment.”7.

We sold our position at that time due to heightened risk associated with operations in Kazakhstan, which sends oil through a pipeline that runs through Russia out to the Black Sea. When Russia invaded Ukraine, we believed there was real risk that something would happen to inhibit Chevron’s ability to get that oil to the market. We didn’t believe that risk was reflected in the stock price, so we sold our position. Today, 10+ months into the Ukraine crisis, more information has become available regarding the Kazakhstan operations, and the associated risks are now well-known. We believe those risks are fully priced into the current stock valuation. Chevron is one of the best operators in its field, with a diversified portfolio and strong management, and we took the opportunity to reinvest when the stock was trading below our estimate of intrinsic value.”6. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL)Average Net Income: $18.00 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 40On February 2, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) posted strong earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022.

However, some stocks offer the potential for both capital gains and ongoing income via their dividends.Find Out: How Much Americans Have in Their Savings Accounts in 2023  Advice: 3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000Most stocks that pay reliable dividends are also less volatile than the stock market as a whole, which can make them good choices for more conservative investors.When looking for a stock with major passive income potential, you’ll want to invest in a company with a track record of consistent payouts in an industry that generates reliable cash flow. Here are a few candidates that you might consider discussing with your financial advisor.Walgreens Boots AllianceStock price as of Feb. 24, 2023: $35.80Walgreens Boots Alliance is a mouthful of a name, but it’s a great company for income investors. The pharmacy giant is better known to Americans through its Walgreens stores, but it also has a huge British presence under its Boots brand. The company has increased its dividend for 47 years in a row, making it a dividend aristocrat. Even with a quite high dividend yield of 5.31%, the company’s payout ratio is just 39.75%, leaving it ample room for future increases.In addition to its income potential, the stock has other factors to support it. Pharmacy companies are generally considered defensive, as consumers still need their products even during tough economic times. The stock is trading near its 52-week low and analysts have a consensus “buy” rating on it.Live Richer Podcast: How To Leverage Your InvestmentsVerizon CommunicationsStock price as of Feb. 24, 2023: $38.74Verizon Communications isn’t quite a dividend aristocrat yet, but it’s only because the company hasn’t existed long enough. Formed in 2000 by a merger between Bell Atlantic Corp. and GTE, the company has existed for just 23 years but already has increased its dividends for 18 consecutive years.Story continuesAs one of the largest wireless carriers in the country, Verizon generates a considerable amount of recurring cash flow that can support a large and growing dividend. Currently, the company sports a whopping 6.64% yield.While not the most exciting stock on the capital appreciation side, the company has a consensus “buy” rating, with an average 12-month price target of $46.50.3MStock price as of Feb. 24, 2023: $107.803M is a global conglomerate probably best known for its Post-It and Scotch Tape brands. But it produces a wide range of products for both consumers and businesses, from automotive parts and hardware to cleaning supplies, films and sheeting, electrical supplies, insulation and countless others.If you’re looking for a reliable long-term dividend payer, it’s hard to do better than 3M. The company has paid a dividend for more than 100 years, and it has raised that dividend for more than 60 years in a row.Currently, the stock yields a hefty 5.51% and trades near the bottom of its 52-week range, perhaps offering an attractive entry point for long-term investors.Johnson &amp; JohnsonStock price as of Feb. 24, 2023: $155.97Johnson &amp; Johnson is not just a dividend aristocrat but a dividend king, an appellation assigned to companies that have raised their dividends for at least 50 years in a row — or 60 in the case of J&amp;J. The well-known healthcare company produces medical devices, pharmaceuticals and consumer packaged goods, and its products are likely in the homes of nearly every American. Some of its most well-known brands include Band-Aid, Neutrogena and Tylenol.Johnson &amp; Johnson has an above-average yield of 2.90%, and analysts have a consensus “buy” rating on the stock, with an average 12-month price target about 20% above current levels.Crown Castle InternationalStock price as of Feb. 24, 2023: $131.16Crown Castle International may not be the most well-known name on the list, but it’s a reliable dividend payer in a growing industry. Crown Castle International operates as a real estate investment trust providing communications infrastructure to the wireless industry via towers and fiber.Its REIT structure means it must pass the bulk of its income through to its shareholders, resulting in a generous 4.77% yield. Still, the company also offers significant capital appreciation potential.

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think Tapestry (NYSE:TPR) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Tapestry, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.19 = US$1.1b ÷ (US$7.3b - US$1.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Thus, Tapestry has an ROCE of 19%.  In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Luxury industry average of 18%. See our latest analysis for Tapestry roceIn the above chart we have measured Tapestry's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Can We Tell From Tapestry's ROCE Trend?Over the past five years, Tapestry's ROCE and capital employed have both remained mostly flat. It's not uncommon to see this when looking at a mature and stable business that isn't re-investing its earnings because it has likely passed that phase of the business cycle. With that in mind, unless investment picks up again in the future, we wouldn't expect Tapestry to be a multi-bagger going forward.What We Can Learn From Tapestry's ROCEIn summary, Tapestry isn't compounding its earnings but is generating stable returns on the same amount of capital employed. Additionally, the stock's total return to shareholders over the last five years has been flat, which isn't too surprising. On the whole, we aren't too inspired by the underlying trends and we think there may be better chances of finding a multi-bagger elsewhere.Story continuesTapestry does have some risks though, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Tapestry  that you might be interested in.While Tapestry isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

But a new report out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology says the investment isn’t enough to keep competing countries like China from overtaking America’s position as the leader in advanced technologies.“If we don't have [competitive advantage], then U.S. firms are gonna lose out on contracts, on bids, on other things that we really care about that make U.S. firms more prosperous and the people in the United States more prosperous as well,” Neil Thompson, director of the MIT FutureTech Research Project and study lead, told Yahoo Finance.Congress passed the CHIPS, or Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America, Act in July. The Commerce Department is getting set to announce how companies can apply for funds from the multi-billion project, which is aimed at bringing more semiconductor manufacturing back to the U.S. and incentivizing firms to research cutting edge technologies that will give American companies an edge over international rivals.U.S. President Joe Biden visits Viasat Inc., a technology company that will benefit from the passage of the CHIPS and Science Act, in Carlsbad, California, U.S., November 4, 2022. (Image: Reuters/Mike Blake)Thompson, however, says that while the CHIPS Act is certainly helpful, it doesn’t address the litany of other shortfalls that are hurting America’s competitiveness.“Computing is...about having those computers, it's about having…ever better algorithms that you can run on those chips,” Thompson said. “It's about having the best people working on those things, and for U.S. companies and U.S. universities making those discoveries. So we need to have a broader approach to making sure that we are at the forefront of all of those things, not just making sure that we are sort of at the frontier with chips.”US President Joe Biden, with Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger (L), arrives to speaks about rebuilding US manufacturing through the CHIPS and Science Act at the groundbreaking of the new Intel semiconductor manufacturing facility near New Albany, Ohio, on September 9, 2022. (Image: Saul Loeb / AFP)According to the MIT report, a 2019 survey of ​​120 U.S. organizations including universities, national labs, and federal agencies found that 79% of respondents believe China is improving its ability to compete at a better rate than America.Story continuesCommerce Secretary Gina Raimondo says the government hopes to use funding from the CHIPS Act to build two chip manufacturing clusters in the U.S. The idea is to ensure that the country is able to both research and develop its own semiconductors.America used to be the leader in chip manufacturing, or fabrication, as it’s known, but it now builds just 12% of the world’s semiconductors. The CHIPS Act could help turn that around, bringing more manufacturing capabilities back to the U.S.The government has also taken steps to limit China’s ability to access high-end American technologies, creating a list of Chinese companies that U.S. firms can’t ship their products to out of fear that it will be used to assist the Chinese military.But according to Thompson, the U.S. needs to do more than simply build chips and restrict China’s access to them. It also needs to ensure that the country has the capabilities necessary to develop new kinds of computer algorithms that help businesses improve their overall efficiency.So how does he suggest building on the promises of the CHIPS Act? Part of the solution, he says, is to ensure the U.S. has enough immigrants to help fill important roles in the tech industry.“We need to be graduating the best folks, we need to be giving them a pathway so that they can stay in the United States,” Thompson said. “That's an area where we're not doing very well right now, in terms of being restrictive. And so this is another example where the CHIPS Act is good, but it's only one piece of what we need if we want to be at the forefront of advanced computing.”If the government and American businesses manage to come together, the country should be able to hold on to its lead in the tech industry, Thompson said. If not, China will likely grab the lead and its businesses and military will supplant the U.S. as the top dog on the international stage.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's tech newsletter.More from DanNvidia is tying its future to AI at just the right timeThere's no going back on A.I.: 'The genie is out of the bottle'ChatGPT is less than a year old, but one expert says this A.I. model is 'peaking'Got a tip?

The two most common Pap vials currently used by laboratories in the United States are the BD SurePath Liquid-based Pap Test vial and the Hologic ThinPrep Pap Test PreservCyt Solution vial.The ThinPrep Pap Test with the BD Onclarity HPV Assay can be used on the BD COR or BD Viper LT instrument platforms without the need to change current cytology equipment.The BD Onclarity HPV Assay has received the FDA’s approval for use in vaccinated women. As the previously vaccinated sub-population ages, the screening population will progressively include women with reduced prevalence of HPV 16 and 18. This is expected to increase the value of extended genotype reporting in a mixed population of vaccinated and unvaccinated women.The BD Onclarity HPV Assay detects and identifies 14 high-risk HPV types in a single analysis.The latest regulatory approval is expected to solidify BD’s foothold in the global Molecular Diagnostics business, thereby boosting its overall Life Sciences segment.Significance of the ApprovalThe inclusion of the ThinPrep Pap Test is expected to improve access to the benefits of the BD HPV assay, which is the only FDA-approved assay that tests for an extended set of HPV types individually and particularly for HPV31 (a specific type of HPV that poses a high risk for causing cervical cancer). Individual identification of HPV31 will likely help better determine risk for cervical pre-cancer, which may lead healthcare providers to different clinical decision-making, unlike when assessing risk when multiple genotypes are reported collectively.Per management, as most tests report multiple HPV types in a single pooled result, it may mask the true risk of developing cervical cancer. Hence, management believes that being able to identify high-risk HPV31 individually is critical to the detection and prevention of cervical cancer. Per estimates, HPV31 poses the second-highest risk for cervical pre-cancer, and the BD Onclarity HPV Assay is the only FDA-approved assay that screens for it individually.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global molecular diagnostics market is anticipated to reach $30.2 billion by 2027 from $23.2 billion in 2022 at a CAGR of 5.4%. Factors like the emergence of new viruses, technological advancements in molecular diagnostics and the growing awareness of early disease diagnosis are likely to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest regulatory clearance is expected to significantly strengthen BD’s business worldwide.Recent Developments in the Life Sciences ArmThis month, BD received the FDA’s Emergency Use Authorization for a new molecular diagnostic combination test for SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A + B and Respiratory Syncytial Virus — BD Respiratory Viral Panel assay for BD MAX System. The test, for use on the BD MAX Molecular Diagnostic System, is expected to aid in combatting illness in the current and future respiratory virus seasons.Also, this month, BD announced a new instrument for single-cell multiomics analysis that will enable scientists to run high-throughput studies without compromising sample integrity. This is expected to potentially accelerate time to discovery across a wide range of disciplines, including immunology, genetic disease research and cancer and chronic disease research.Again, in February, BD reported its first-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein it registered an improvement in the overall base revenues. BD Life Sciences segment saw the Integrated Diagnostic Solutions unit’s strong growth in the base business (driven by strong demand for BD’s respiratory testing portfolio, which was partly aided by the timing of dealer orders, strong BD Kiestra lab automation installations and leveraging its higher BD MAX installed base for molecular In Vitro Diagnostic assay growth) and strength in the Biosciences unit.Price PerformanceShares of BD have lost 12.3% in the past year compared with the industry’s 8.3% decline and the S&amp;P 500's 10.9% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Other Key PicksCurrently, BD carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company to watch right now is AmerisourceBergen (ABC). ABC is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 13.31 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 17.78. Over the past 52 weeks, ABC's Forward P/E has been as high as 14.90 and as low as 11.77, with a median of 13.29.Investors should also note that ABC holds a PEG ratio of 1.52. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. ABC's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 1.58. Over the last 12 months, ABC's PEG has been as high as 1.82 and as low as 1.43, with a median of 1.59.Finally, investors will want to recognize that ABC has a P/CF ratio of 13.08. This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook. This stock's P/CF looks attractive against its industry's average P/CF of 18.77. Over the past 52 weeks, ABC's P/CF has been as high as 14.86 and as low as 10.91, with a median of 13.24.Story continuesAnother great Medical - Dental Supplies stock you could consider is McKesson (MCK), which is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value Score of A.McKesson is currently trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 13.73 while its PEG ratio sits at 1.33. Both of the company's metrics compare favorably to its industry's average P/E of 17.78 and average PEG ratio of 1.58.Over the last 12 months, MCK's P/E has been as high as 15.66, as low as 11.69, with a median of 14.02, and its PEG ratio has been as high as 1.56, as low as 0.99, with a median of 1.43.Additionally, McKesson has a P/B ratio of -23.62 while its industry's price-to-book ratio sits at 6.31. For MCK, this valuation metric has been as high as -23.48, as low as -59.10, with a median of -33.35 over the past year.These are only a few of the key metrics included in AmerisourceBergen and McKesson strong Value grade, but they help show that the stocks are likely undervalued right now.

(AP) — Fox Corp. chairman Rupert Murdoch acknowledged that some Fox News commentators endorsed the false allegations by former President Donald Trump and his allies that the 2020 presidential election was stolen and that he didn't step in to stop them from promoting the claims, according to excerpts of a deposition unsealed Monday.The claims and the company's handling of them are at the heart of a defamation lawsuit against the cable news giant by Dominion Voting Systems.The recently unsealed documents include excerpts from a deposition in which Murdoch was asked about whether he was aware that some of the network’s commentators — Lou Dobbs, Maria Bartiromo, Jeanine Pirro and Sean Hannity — at times endorsed the false election claims. Murdoch replied, “Yes. They endorsed.""The Murdoch deposition is the latest filing in the defamation case to reveal concerns at the top-rated network over how it was handling Trump’s claims as its ratings plummeted after the network called Arizona for Joe Biden, angering Trump and his supporters.An earlier filing showed a gulf between the stolen election narrative the network was airing in primetime and doubts about the claims raised by its stars behind the scenes. In one text, from Nov. 16, 2020, Fox News host Tucker Carlson said ""Sidney Powell is lying” about having evidence for election fraud, referring to one of Trump's lawyers.The Dominion case is the latest example showing that those who were spreading false information about the 2020 election knew there was no evidence to support it. The now-disbanded House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol disclosed that many of Trump’s top advisers repeatedly warned him that the allegations he was making about fraud were false — and yet the president continued making the claims.Murdoch urged in September 2020, weeks before the election, that Dobbs be fired because he was “an extremist,” according to Dominion's court filing. Murdoch also said he thought it was “really bad” for former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani to be advising Trump because Giuliani’s “judgment was bad” and he was “an extreme partisan,” according to a deposition excerpt.Story continuesMurdoch was asked whether he could have requested that Powell and Giuliani not be put on the air: “I could have. But I didn't,” he replied.Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems, which sells electronic voting hardware and software, is suing both Fox News Network and parent company Fox Corp. for defamation. Dominion contends that some Fox News employees deliberately amplified false claims by supporters of Trump that Dominion machines had changed votes in the 2020 election, and that Fox provided a platform for guests to make false and defamatory statements about the company.Dominion attorneys contend that executives in the “chain of command” at both Fox News and Fox Corp. knew the network was broadcasting “known lies, had the power to stop it, but chose to let it continue. That was wrong, and for that, FC and FNN are both liable.”Attorneys for Fox Corp. note in their filing that Murdoch also testified that he never discussed Dominion or voter fraud with any of the accused Fox News hosts. They say Dominion has produced “zero evidentiary support” for the claim that high-level executives at Fox Corp. had any role in creating or publishing the statements at issue.Dominion’s contention that the company should be held liable because Murdoch might have had the power to step in and prevent the challenged statements from being aired, they said, “has no basis in defamation law, would obliterate the distinction between corporate parents and subsidiaries, and finds no support in the evidence.”The “handful of selective quotes” cited by Dominion have nothing to do with the statements that Dominion has challenged as defamatory, according to Fox Corp. attorneys. “Dominion repeatedly asked Fox News executives, hosts, and staff whether Fox Corporation employees played a role in the publication of the statements it challenges,” they wrote. “The answer — every single time, for every single witness — was no.”Meanwhile, Fox News attorneys note that when voting-technology companies denied the allegations being made by Trump and his surrogates, Fox News aired those denials, while some Fox News hosts offered protected opinion commentary about Trump’s allegations.]"

(NASDAQ: GEVO) announced today that they have finalized a Hydrogen Development Services Agreement with Zero6 Energy (formerly Juhl Energy) for the development of a 20-megawatt hydrogen production facility in Lake Preston, South Dakota, using Cummins Inc. (NYSE: CMI) electrolyzer technology. The facility, known as the Dakota Renewable Hydrogen Project (DRH), will be an integral part of Gevo’s Net-Zero 1 renewable hydrocarbon plant (NZ1) that is under development.“We are excited to again be working with the Zero6 team on the development of a project that is crucial to the decarbonization of Gevo’s liquid transportation fuels and our long-term goal of developing net-zero emissions fuel and chemical products,” said Gevo’s President &amp; COO, Dr. Chris Ryan. “After our mutual success on the development of wind power for the defossilized electrification of our development facility in Luverne, Minnesota, we are confident that Zero6 will be an excellent partner for our Net-Zero 1 hydrocarbon production facility.”“This project is a great fit for the Zero6 team, and we are excited to highlight our capabilities as NZ1 comes online,” added Clay Norrbom, President of Zero6 Energy. “In addition to the utilization of the proven Cummins electrolyzer technology to produce green hydrogen, a portion of our electricity needs will be supplied by the Kingsbury County Wind Fuel wind farm. Gevo’s decarbonization efforts truly are the sum of many important initiatives.”Cummins will supply the project with an electrolyzer system comprised of four HyLYZER®-1000 proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers to produce hydrogen. Cummins’ HyLYZER®-1000 product is currently in operation at a similar facility in Becancour, Quebec, Canada. An electrolyzer splits water into oxygen and hydrogen. When powered by renewable electricity, the hydrogen produced is green and carbon free. This green hydrogen can be stored as a compressed gas or a liquid and used as an energy-dense, clean power source.Story continues“This project builds on Cummins’ hydrogen technology innovation and demonstrates the maturity and scalability of our products to meet customer needs. We are proud to partner with Gevo and Zero6 to provide zero-emission power to critical applications,” said Alex Savelli, Managing Director Electrolyzers – Americas for Cummins. “Cummins is committed to advancing the green hydrogen economy, and our electrolyzer system is a turn-key solution for projects like the Dakota Renewable Hydrogen Project.”Over 80% of the DRH hydrogen production capacity will be directly piped to the Gevo NZ1 plant to be used in the hydrocarbon refining process. The DRH will be located on the NZ1 plant property under a long-term lease agreement from Gevo.About GevoGevo’s mission is to transform renewable energy and carbon into energy-dense liquid hydrocarbons. These liquid hydrocarbons can be used for drop-in transportation fuels such as gasoline, jet fuel and diesel fuel, that when burned have potential to yield net-zero greenhouse gas emissions when measured across the full life cycle of the products. Gevo uses low-carbon renewable resource-based carbohydrates as raw materials, and is in an advanced state of developing renewable electricity and renewable natural gas for use in production processes, resulting in low-carbon fuels with substantially reduced carbon intensity (the level of greenhouse gas emissions compared to standard petroleum fossil-based fuels across their life cycle). Gevo’s products perform as well or better than traditional fossil-based fuels in infrastructure and engines, but with substantially reduced greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to addressing the problems of fuels, Gevo’s technology also enables certain plastics, such as polyester, to be made with more sustainable ingredients. Gevo’s ability to penetrate the growing low-carbon fuels market depends on the price of oil and the value of abating carbon emissions that would otherwise increase greenhouse gas emissions. Gevo believes that it possesses the technology and know-how to convert various carbohydrate feedstocks through a fermentation process into alcohols and then transform the alcohols into renewable fuels and materials, through a combination of its own technology, know-how, engineering, and licensing of technology and engineering from Axens North America, Inc., which yields the potential to generate project and corporate returns that justify the build-out of a multi-billion-dollar business.Gevo believes that the Argonne National Laboratory GREET model is the best available standard of scientific-based measurement for life cycle inventory or LCI.About Zero6 EnergyZero6 Energy is an established leader in the clean energy industry with 30 years of experience delivering clean energy projects to customers and investors.

DeSantis signed it into law yesterday (Feb. 27).Read moreHere's how 10 industries are experimenting with ChatGPTMillennials are just as wealthy as their parentsWhat can you do when your company reverses on remote work?The bill gives DeSantis the power to elect the district’s board of supervisors, subject to Senate approval, and rebrand it Central Florida Tourism Oversight District. However, it’ll keep the region’s key operational procedures, such as the district’s ability to raise taxes and issue bonds to build and maintain infrastructure serving the Walt Disney World Resort, separate.The Mouse House had, for more than five decades, enjoyed special privileges in the area, including making its own planning and zoning decisions. Since 1967, the arrangement has allowed Disney to levy taxes, administer its own police and fire departments, and run its water and sewage systems, among other things.“Disney works under a number of different models and jurisdictions around the world, and regardless of the outcome, we remain committed to providing the highest quality experience for the millions of guests who visit each year,” a company spokesman said earlier this month.DeSantis ends Disney’s free reign over Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” billDeSantis’s year-long quest to strip Disney of its self-rule came after the entertainment giant, and Florida’s largest employer, opposed legislation HB 1557, also known as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill, in March 2022.DeSantis called the defiance a “mild annoyance” and said it wasn’t the sole reason for his move, but he expanded on the standoff in his new book, The Courage to Be Free: Florida’s Blueprint for America’s Revival. DeSantis recalls he’d warned Disney against its resistance to the bill, which banned teachers from discussing sexual orientation and gender identity in classrooms from kindergarten through the third grade. The governor, who is considering a 2024 presidential run, writes former Disney CEO Bob Chapek “understood the risk that the company faced” and said he was facing unprecedented pressure from people including, his predecessor—and eventual successor—Bob Iger.Story continuesChapek hesitated to take a stand on the bill, drawing criticism from company employees. He eventually apologized for his response and paused all political donations in Florida while vowing to combat anti-LGBTQ legislations across the US.DeSantis calls Disney’s self-governance “bad policy”“Allowing a corporation to control its own government is bad policy, especially when the corporation makes decisions that impact an entire region. This legislation ends Disney’s self-governing status, makes Disney live under the same laws as everybody else, and ensures that Disney pays its debts and fair share of taxes.” —Ron DeSantisPersons of interest: Who’s who in the board of Central Florida Tourism Oversight DistrictDeSantis appointed five people to the board of the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District. Most of them have ties to the governor and/or to the state’s Republican party.👨 Tampa lawyer Martin Garcia has been elected the head of the board. He’s the chair of Pinehill capital, a private investment firm that donated $50,000 to the governor’s reelection campaign last year.👩 Bridget Ziegler, the wife of Florida GOP chair Christian Ziegler and co-founder of Moms for Liberty—a conservative activist group which is taking on school boards—joins the board. She called critical race theory “anti-American” and locked horns with Disney over the company asking a school marching band to cover up its Native American logo to perform at Magic Kingdom.👨 Mike Sasso, an attorney who donated over $9,000 to Florida Republican candidates, including DeSantis, during the previous election cycle.👨 Brian Aungst Jr., a Central Florida attorney who specializes in land use law.

The 39-square-mile area, which was exempted from most state rules and had special tax status, has been governed by the Reedy Creek Improvement District with a board appointed by local landowners, but in reality handpicked by Disney.Walt Disney World - REUTERS/Octavio JonesAll residents of Reedy Creek are Disney staff, who have little say over its running. The local authority has powers over police, fire, environmental rules and road safety. Disney employs 79,000 people in the state.Last year, the Disney-controlled region opposed Florida’s new “Don’t Say Gay” act, which blocks teaching on gender and sexual identity until children are in third grade, or about eight to nine years old, sparking a backlash from politicians.Mr DeSantis has championed an so-called anti-woke agenda and become a Republican figurehead in the culture wars in the US. He has campaigned against ESG policies and what he calls “woke capitalism”.Republican politicians had pushed to abolish the Disney region entirely, but this could have lumped the state with $2bn (£1.7bn) in debt.Story continuesInstead, the Florida leader will control its board appointments, with plans to appoint donors and friends.Mr DeSantis said: “Allowing a corporation to control its own government is bad policy, especially when the corporation makes decisions that impact an entire region.“This legislation ends Disney's self-governing status, makes Disney live under the same laws as everybody else, and ensures that Disney pays its debts and fair share of taxes.”Disney has said it will not fight the bill.]"

The legislation also removes some of the district’s sweeping powers but keeps in place its obligation to pay about $1 billion of outstanding bonds.The new board will “make sure the debt is retired properly, maybe even accelerating retiring the debt,” DeSantis said in a press conference in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, part of the 38.5 square miles (99.7 square kilometers) of land that houses Disney’s Florida theme parks.“It seems to me a contradiction to say that Disney, as a corporation is responsible for the debt, and than proposing some form of acceleration,” said Eric Kazatsky, senior US municipals strategist for Bloomberg Intelligence. Without the option of refundings, “this would perhaps leave cash defeasance, which would be a pure business decision on Disney’s part and not really an acceleration for bondholders,” he said.DeSantis, 44, said he would like to see the special district dissolved altogether at some point as long as there’s “no burden to taxpayers.”The district was also renamed by the law and will now be called the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District.DeSantis announced the makeup of the new five-person governing board that is expected to meet for the first time next week.

Senior Media &amp; Internet Analyst Laura Martin joins Yahoo Finance Live to examine fuboTV's latest earnings, Florida Governor Rob DeSantis' revocation of Disney's special tax district, and Warner Bros. Discovery's content rebranding.Video Transcript- Fubotv-- it's a top trending ticker on Yahoo Finance today and you can see why. Shares off just about 14% after the company's fourth quarter results. New subscribers, a narrower than expected loss initially helping the stock. But the shares certainly did reverse after Fubo disclosed that it did sell shares at, quote, ""negotiated discounts.""For more on this also where we stand in the streaming space at large, we want to bring in Laura Martin, Needham, a senior media and internet analyst. Laura, it's great to see you again. So let's start with what we heard this morning from Fubotv-- lots of questions about the direction of this company, what would be the best case scenario moving forward. What do you think?LAURA MARTIN: So, I thought, let's make a distinction between fundamentals and the money they raise this morning. So, shares were up, like, 5% before they announced that they've done a big block trade at a discount to Friday's close. So I really think the softness today, which started it down 19% as soon as they announced that they'd raised $70 million, round numbers, is now down, I don't know, 10% to 13%.But the fundamentals here are really very impressive-- 39% revenue growth, 39% subscriber growth, 30% advertising revenue growth. They hit 1.8 million subs, adding 270,000 subs, which is twice our estimate, which means they're acceleratingly adding subscribers at a time where Disney and Netflix are slowing their subscriber adds and guiding us to lower long term subscribers-- so, sort of bucking the trend fundamentally. They still lose money, which Wall Street has a big problem with, and they needed to raise the money today, which sort of puts a cap on how much appreciation I think Wall Street's worried. They worry that every time this company has good earnings, they're going to sell shares, which then puts a cap on the appreciation potential for Wall Street investors.Story continues- Yeah, two sides of that coin right there. But I want to move on to something related here. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, he just signed a bill into law this morning giving him greater control over Disney's special taxing. It's called the Reading Creek Improvement District. Now, what implications does this have for the parks business and the company's bottom line?LAURA MARTIN: OK, so, two things-- philosophically, I think DeSantis is making a run at the presidency, and I think a lot of people who don't really understand the issue very well, a lot of Republicans, he's doing this because Disney is too woke, and Disney has 75,000 employees in Florida, and it is their largest employer. And by the way, in a content company, you actually can't find employees unless you are woke.So you just don't have a business unless you have woke employees that create content and are in the parks doing service. So I'm not sure Disney has a choice. I also think it's on the right side of history is my opinion.But DeSantis is running for President. In two years, my opinion is, he'll be gone because I think it's-- you know, he just will be out of this seat. And then I will see.The problem with him taking away these-- which he didn't really do, actually. But there's $1 billion debt on that Disney-- that's Disney's. And they pick up $1 billion year costs and for the roads and all this stuff.All that would transfer to the communities locally that house the Walt Disney if they actually took away their benefits. So, he's doing it in name, but there's a lot of liabilities that would get put onto the Florida State budget if he actually did it. So he's basically taken a victory lap for actually not very much substantively.- So Laura, you don't see this at all complicating how Disney runs its parks at least in the near term.LAURA MARTIN: I do not. Mm-mm, I do not. I mean, in theory, it makes them get more approvals from local governments to build the next hotel. But their next hotel brings employment.So, what local government in Florida says, no, we don't want you to build it that way, we want you to build it this way? So no, I don't think so. I actually think nothing happens to Disney. And by the way, we have a much kinder, gentler CEO here who I do not think this would have happened if the CEO had had a different guy in the seat when this legislation that's the big fight over was happening.- Keeping the Disney theme here, you said in a recent note CEO David Zaslav for Warner Brothers is repositioning the company to be a storytelling company. This has some parallels to Disney. Just wondering where you can go from there.LAURA MARTIN: OK, OK, so Warner Brothers media has nothing to do with theme parks. So we're leaving companies. What it does-- what it is saying is what I think Disney has demonstrated very successfully over the last decade, which is what Warner Brothers-Discovery is now saying is we want to have film franchises, and we want to expand them into consumer products and into video games and into merchandise and into, like, into global streaming, and we want to bundle all that together and have all revenue streams from theatrical to streaming to linear TV.Like, that's all super smart, and we want to focus on our franchises, like DC Comics and Harry Potter. Like, they have some world class franchises. Superman-- they haven't had a Superman movie in 10 years.So, this is a long term standing, Disney under Iger, a long time-- where they only give money to their franchises because when you build a new Superman film, you basically generate traffic and viewing of your old Superman library. So this is a smart play. So they're following the Disney roadmap strategically. Now we have to see if they can implement it.- Laura, what are you going to be focused on first? Because I think there's lots of questions about implementing the plan going forward, what this mess currently looks like inside the walls of WBD at least today. What's your assessment just in terms of the changes that we have seen and kind of how they've done 180 on a couple of those initial changes?LAURA MARTIN: So, I think-- so let's go through. So on the cost side, we really have an outstanding chief financial officer here who has a track record of whenever he tells you he's going to cut costs, he's really going to cut costs two or three times more, which means we're going to see margin expansion. So I'm very highly confident-- like, 80% confident that the cost will overdeliver estimates so we'll get margin expansion.On the revenue side, I'm also highly confident that David Zaslav, the current CEO of Warner Brothers-Discovery who has been running Disney, has a-- I'm sorry-- has been running Discovery assets, he's going to continue to do a great job there. The big question mark is the big allocation of capital this year, which is allocate rebuilding up that film slate. Can DC films do a better job of closing the gap with Marvel?Revenue, fandom-- you know, the reason the Disney engine works is they have, like, Star Wars. They have the princesses. They have massive fan bases in these properties.Warner Brothers, never been able to do that. So let's see if, under David Zaslav and his management team, whether the film business can actually create these huge properties that Disney has, and it takes three years. So he will spend a ton of free cash flow this year of the Empire of Warner Brothers-Discovery, and you won't get a bucket of revenue until the film comes out three years from now. So you won't know how well they're executing for three years, but you will have invested round numbers $10 billion in films. So that's risky.- Yeah, Laura, so then that points to the fact that-- what do you make of the current valuation day with share price, what, right below $16 a share? Certainly has been off to a strong start for the year coming off what it was a very rough 2022, that jump that we've seen. Do you think it's fairly valued where it's trading today?LAURA MARTIN: So, we have a hold because we don't like being in front of this usage of free cash flow. So you're going to see income statement margin expansion. But we think they're going to be eating free cash flow in the background as we rebuild this film slate. So we'd rather stay on the sidelines in the near term and watch how they execute the integration, let's say.- Laura Martin, always great to have you. Thanks so much for joining us this afternoon.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $5.42 billion.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Oneok: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income adjusted for interest expense, depreciation and amortization, noncash impairment charges, income taxes, noncash compensation expense, allowance for equity funds used during construction (equity AFUDC), and other noncash items.Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it, and similar measures, is used by many companies in the industry as a measure of financial performance and is commonly employed by financial analysts and others to evaluate ONEOK's financial performance and to compare the company's financial performance with the performance of other companies within the industry. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP.This non-GAAP financial measure excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income. Additionally, this calculation may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. A reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA is included in the tables.ONEOK, Inc.

Higher interest rates will drive net interest income (NII) in the upcoming quarters, whereas growth and trust revenues should benefit from the recapture of money market fee waivers.However, persistently rising expenses will likely hurt the company’s bottom line. Deteriorating credit quality is another concern.Also, analysts are less optimistic regarding its earnings growth potential. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MTB’s 2023 earnings has been revised marginally downward over the past 30 days.Over the past year, shares of MTB have lost 14.3% compared with the industry’s 12.8% decline. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Thus, the company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In April 2022, M&amp;T Bank completed the acquisition of People's United for $8.3 billion, and expects to realize cost savings of $330 million by early 2023, with the deal to be accretive to earnings. The acquisition increased M&amp;T Bank’s loans by $36 billion and deposits by $53 billion.Looking at its fundamentals, the company’s NII witnessed a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9% over six years (2017-2022). It operates as a solid and sustainable regional bank franchise, with a footprint that spans six Mid-Atlantic States, as well as DC. This should allow it to continue generating a solid increase in NII in the upcoming quarters on the decent lending scenario and rising interest rates.Also, non-interest income saw a five-year CAGR of 4.9% (2017-2021), supported by growth in brokerage service income and trust income. Going forward, growth in trust revenues should benefit from the recapture of money market fee waivers.The company seems well-positioned in terms of its liquidity profile and is likely to be able to continue meeting debt obligations in the near term if the economic situation worsens. This liquidity strength also supports its impressive capital deployment activities.The company expects to buy back $600 million worth of shares quarterly.Story continuesHowever, with continuously rising non-interest operating expenses, M&amp;T Bank is exposed to operational risks. Though expenses decreased in 2020, the same witnessed a CAGR of 10% over the last six years (2017-2022). In the near term, the company’s cost base is expected to remain under pressure amid higher expenses incurred on elevated professional services, and advertising and promotion costs.Deteriorating credit quality remains a major headwind for M&amp;T Bank. Provision for credit losses has increased significantly over the past few years and in 2022, while the company recorded a recapture of provision for credit losses in 2021. Management expects credit costs this year to be higher than the 2022 level.Lastly, high exposure to commercial loans can be risky for the company amid a challenging economy and competitive markets.Stocks Worth a LookA couple of better-ranked stocks from the finance space are The Bank of New York Mellon BK and State Street STT.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BNY Mellon’s current-year earnings has moved 1.7% higher over the past 30 days.

260,7738df00-730c-340f-9af0-3d2eeb8d1cb6,JNPR,2023-02-28,Universal Display (OLED) Hikes Quarterly Dividend Payout,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/universal-display-oled-hikes-quarterly-112711943.html,1677583631,STORY,"['OLED', 'JNPR', 'ANET']","[Universal Display Corporation OLED recently hiked its quarterly dividend payout by about 16.7% to 35 cents per share or $1.40 on an annualized basis. The news seemed to have struck the right chords with investors as the firm’s share price gained post its release.Based on the closing price of $136.01 on Feb 27, 2023, the proposed dividend affirms a modest yield of 1.03%. A steady dividend payout is part of Universal Display’s long-term strategy to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to its stockholders. Additionally, healthy dividend increases at periodic intervals have been one of its key strengths.In concurrence with the dividend hike, Universal Display reported solid fourth-quarter 2022 results, with the bottom and the top lines beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Despite macroeconomic headwinds, the company's ongoing innovation efforts, investments in infrastructure development and capacity expansion resulted in top-line growth year over year.Net income during the reported quarter was $65.1 million or $1.36 per share compared with $45.9 million or 96 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 43 cents. Lower operating expenses and top-line expansion led to growth in net income year over year.Revenues were $169 million, up 16% from $146.2 million in the year-ago quarter. The figure surpassed the consensus estimate of $150 million. Backed by the company’s robust patent portfolio and strong demand for AR/VR display applications, the renewal of license agreements on a long-term basis boosted OLED’s fourth-quarter revenues.We believe strong end-market demand presents a significant growth opportunity for Universal Display over the long term. OLED is suitable for commercial usage in a number of industries, including smartphones, television, virtual reality devices and automotive markets. The increasing proliferation of smartphones, wearables and tablets is driving the adoption of small-area OLEDs. Large-area OLED displays are increasingly used in televisions. Further, unlike LEDs, OLEDs can be viewed directly and don’t need diffusers. It is also expected to be cost-effective when manufactured in high volumes, which makes it suitable for commercial application in the solid-state lighting market.Universal Display’s dominance in OLED technology is primarily driven by its strong portfolio of 5,000 patents worldwide. The strong patent portfolio also helps it to earn significant licensing revenues. The company’s UniversalPHOLED phosphorescent OLED technology produces OLEDs that are four times more efficient than fluorescent OLEDs and significantly more efficient than current LCDs. This provides Universal Display with a competitive advantage over other OLED makers.All these positives and sound financial management probably led to the quarterly dividend hike.Universal Display currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Story continuesKey PicksArista Networks, Inc.

263,2a16611c-6bf1-3d32-bd10-c0890767c926,CMCSA,2023-02-28,Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) shareholders have endured a 17% loss from investing in the stock a year ago,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/comcast-nasdaq-cmcsa-shareholders-endured-110049292.html,1677582049,STORY,['CMCSA'],"[Passive investing in an index fund is a good way to ensure your own returns roughly match the overall market. While individual stocks can be big winners, plenty more fail to generate satisfactory returns. For example, the Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) share price is down 19% in the last year. That's well below the market decline of 8.3%. At least the damage isn't so bad if you look at the last three years, since the stock is down 9.9% in that time.So let's have a look and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. See our latest analysis for Comcast While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Unfortunately Comcast reported an EPS drop of 61% for the last year. The share price fall of 19% isn't as bad as the reduction in earnings per share. So the market may not be too worried about the EPS figure, at the moment -- or it may have expected earnings to drop faster.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Comcast's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Comcast's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Comcast the TSR over the last 1 year was -17%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Comcast shareholders are down 17% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 8.3%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 3% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Comcast better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 4 warning signs  with Comcast , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

(PX) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on March 6, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.21 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +16.7%.Revenues are expected to be $53.59 million, up 17.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.52% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for P10, Inc.For P10, Inc.The Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that P10, Inc. Will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that P10, Inc. Would post earnings of $0.20 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.21, delivering a surprise of +5%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.P10, Inc. Doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In that report, analysts expect Oracle to post earnings of $1.19 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 5.31%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $12.39 billion, up 17.9% from the year-ago period.ORCL's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $4.90 per share and revenue of $49.74 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of 0% and +17.19%, respectively.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Oracle. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.03% lower. Oracle currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Investors should also note Oracle's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 18.08. This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 26.42.Story continuesIt is also worth noting that ORCL currently has a PEG ratio of 2.26. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. ORCL's industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.09 as of yesterday's close.The Computer - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector.

Interestingly enough, the company recently unveiled a massive $75 billion share purchase program. The surge in energy prices has amplified the company’s cash-generating abilities, with CVX reporting free cash flow of $8.6 billion in its latest quarter. This is further illustrated in the chart below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnd, of course, the company’s dividend has benefited as well, with CVX’s payout growing by 6% over the last year. The company’s annual dividend currently yields a solid 3.7%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAppleBuffett states that he loves the tech titan because of its customers’ brand loyalty; consumers are likely to trade in old Apple products for new ones.The company snapped a streak of positive surprises in its latest release, falling short of the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by roughly 2% and reporting sales 3% below expectations.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe market shook off the less-than-expected results, with AAPL shares climbing nearly 2% in the following trading session.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchApple shares presently trade at a 24.3X forward earnings multiple, a few ticks above the 23.6X five-year median and the Zacks Computer and Technology sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe stock currently has a Value Style Score of “D.”Bank of AmericaAnother one of the portfolio’s largest holdings, Bank of America, is one of the largest financial holding companies in the U.S.The company’s TTM price-to-book ratio presently works out to be 1.1X, precisely in line with the five-year median and below highs of 1.7X in 2022.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnd similar to CVX, Bank of America rewards its shareholders nicely; the company’s annual dividend yields 2.6%, modestly above the Zacks Finance sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBAC posted better-than-expected results in its latest release, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by more than 11% and posting revenue 2% above expectations.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineBuffett is a philanthropist and businessman. He’s the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), a diversified holding company whose subsidiaries engage in insurance, freight rail transportation, energy generation and distribution, manufacturing, and others.And recently, his comments regarding share buybacks in an annual shareholder letter have made headlines during a time when many have become critical of the practice.Although all may not agree with his statements, for those interested in looking past and structuring a portfolio similar to the Oracle of Omaha, all three stocks above – Apple AAPL, Bank of America BAC, and Chevron CVX – place you on the right track.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 20 Years.On February 24, the Bureau of Economic Analysis released the Personal Income and Outlays for January 2023 which revealed that the PCE price index recorded a 0.6% increase in January. The PCE price index has gone up by 5.4% over the 12-month period from January 2022 to January 2023. Stocks went down after the announcement, with the S&amp;P 500 closing below 4,000, the Nasdaq Composite closing below 11,500, and the Dow closing below 33,000.Shortly after the BEA released the PCE numbers for January 2023, Fitz-Gerald Group Principal Keith Fitz-Gerald appeared on Yahoo Finance to discuss what this means for the Fed and how investors should position themselves. The sell-off on Friday was not a result of inflation, and was instead a result of ""the amount of leverage that's being carried"", noted Fitz-Gerald. According to Keith Fitz-Gerald, ""if the Fed wants to raise more aggressively, all of these huge traders that are leveraged up to their eyeballs are not gonna want to carry that because it costs them more money"".Keith Fitz-Gerald sees pressure into the second quarter of 2023 and he thinks that ""the Fed might have to admit that it was wrong about rates and labor as it was about transitory"". Here are some comments from Keith Fitz-Gerald:""I think, right now, the markets will correct themselves as investors figure out that their best friends are going to be companies. (Companies) that are still putting up great numbers, that still got great dividends, that are still moving forward into this market, because those are the kind of plays that you want to go for.""We have compiled a list of 22 most profitable stocks of the last 20 years that have managed to weather economic downturns and generate huge profits.

We like the company’s track record of innovation, and its diversified portfolio of drugs. However, we’ve become increasingly concerned about the outlook for some of its recently launched therapeutics, as well as some generic competition in a few of its mature drugs. If pressed, we still like the odds that Novartis will do well, but the outlook is a little cloudier than it’s been in a while. As noted above, we’ve been big fans of its Alcon unit for many years, and now that Alcon is independent, we decided to concentrate our investment there.”17.

Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”15. Verizon Communications Inc.

(NYSE:VZ) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“We sold the entire position in Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), which was a disappointing investment, on concerns that the company is losing market share in a very competitive business and because we believed we had better use for the funds elsewhere.”14. TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE)Average Net Income: $11.53 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 21At the end of Q4 2022, 21 hedge funds held positions in TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE). The total value of these positions was $1.93 billion. This is compared to 22 hedge funds in the previous quarter with stakes worth $1.56 billion.In fiscal 2022, TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) generated an annual net income of $20.53 billion. The company has generated an annual net income of $11.53 billion, on average, over the last 20 years.

TTE is one of the world’s largest energy companies. It develops and produces oil and gas, produces and sells refined products, is one of the largest producers and traders of LNG, and owns a large portfolio of renewable power generating assets. TTE has one of the lowest cost portfolios of oil and gas assets and therefore one of the lowest breakeven points in the industry. It also has one of the best balance sheets in the industry. We estimate it will reach a net cash position sometime in 2023.The valuation of TTE—and that of Shell—is fascinating. TTE sells at approximately 4X earnings and has a 5% dividend yield. With its current buyback program and a recently announced special dividend, the owners yield is more than 10%. The valuation and owners yield are not dissimilar to those of Shell, which we also own and which trades at just under 5X earnings. To say that a discount is attached to European oil companies relative to US peers is an understatement. Exxon Mobil sells at 8X earnings, Chevron 9X and Conoco 8X. If TTE and Shell redomiciled to the US, their share prices would probably double.We have a few theories for the valuation anomaly. First, as mentioned above, Europe generally trades at a big discount to the US. In the case of TTE and Shell, this makes no economic sense. The oil and gas business is a global one, and TTE and Shell have attractive assets. The main explanation, we believe, is that large sections of the European asset management industry will not invest in oil and gas because of ESG restrictions. Yet if the recent war in Ukraine and the current energy crisis have shown us nothing else, the supply of energy is an enormous social good. Indeed, it is an existential good. Moreover, it is companies such as TTE that will invest billions to supply the LNG that Europe desperately needs to restore its economy and reduce the crushing cost burden on families who must now choose between heating their homes and eating. Finally, TTE is also investing billions per year in renewable power generating assets such as wind and solar. Such assets will likely never replace clean burning natural gas and nuclear as base power suppliers, but they are a valuable and clean adjunct to modern grids. We believe TTE’s renewable portfolio is worth between $25 billion and $35 billion and is moving from almost no profit contribution toward meaningful levels of profit over the next few years. We wonder how it makes sense for investors to disinvest from these kinds of assets on ethical grounds.”13. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Average Net Income: $12.67 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 84On January 24, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) posted earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022.

(NYSE:PFE) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Labs, global pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG). Although Pfizer continues to report strong performance of its core drugs, sales of its COVID vaccine and treatment have likely peaked and sales are expected to decline going forward. We remain optimistic about the company long term as we believe management is taking the company in the right direction, focusing R&amp;D, and making strategic acquisitions with profits generated from COVID vaccine sales.”11. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Average Net Income: $12.93 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Walmart Inc.

(NYSE:WMT) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”10.

Despite the positives of higher interest rates and the company making good progress on reducing expenses and regulatory consent orders, Wells Fargo shares have fallen one-third from their highs earlier this year to roughly 6.5x our estimate of normalized earnings power, and the stock ended the quarter at ~1x next year’s tangible book value. We find this is far too cheap for a strong banking franchise capable of tangible returns in the low-to-mid teens across business cycles.”8.

We added leading financial institution Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) which serves individual consumers, small and middle-market businesses, and large corporations with a full range of banking, investing, asset management, and other financial and risk management products and services. The current company was formed through various mergers including NationsBank, FleetBoston, US Trust, Countrywide Financial, and Merrill Lynch with the legacy commercial bank to form a national banking powerhouse and bulge bracket investment firm. As one of the ‘Big Four’ U.S. banks it enjoys scale driven cost advantages and economies of scale which provide meaningful competitive advantages and potential for strong returns in the largely commoditized banking industry. A survivor of the financial crisis, BAC has emerged with a solid capital base and stands to benefit from a rising interest rate environment.”7.

The stock is the seventh most profitable stock of the last 20 years.Here is what Diamond Hill Capital had to say about Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Most recently in Q4, we increased our energy exposure by reinitiating a position in a company we know well and have owned in the past, integrated oil and gas company Chevron Corporation(NYSE:CVX).We previously owned Chevron as recently as February 2022. We sold our position at that time due to heightened risk associated with operations in Kazakhstan, which sends oil through a pipeline that runs through Russia out to the Black Sea. When Russia invaded Ukraine, we believed there was real risk that something would happen to inhibit Chevron’s ability to get that oil to the market. We didn’t believe that risk was reflected in the stock price, so we sold our position. Today, 10+ months into the Ukraine crisis, more information has become available regarding the Kazakhstan operations, and the associated risks are now well-known. We believe those risks are fully priced into the current stock valuation. Chevron is one of the best operators in its field, with a diversified portfolio and strong management, and we took the opportunity to reinvest when the stock was trading below our estimate of intrinsic value.”6.

She said the application will be intentionally complicated and that's a part of her mission to make sure taxpayer funds are protected.“It's a very detailed, extensive, comprehensive application,” she added in comments to reporters Monday, promising “we're gonna make companies open their books.”What lies ahead for companies like Intel (INTC), Micron (MU) and others is a five-part process in which the firms will be asked to make a series of promises. Pledges include a pause on any expansion plans in countries like China, detailed plans for how they’ll recruit workers, and a vow that the money won’t go to stock buybacks.At stake is a Biden administration promise to reverse a sharp downward decline for the semiconductor industry in the U.S. over recent decades. American semiconductor manufacturing has fallen from nearly 40% of world production in 1990 to only 12% in recent years, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. The situation is even worse for the world’s most advanced semiconductors, 100% of which were manufactured overseas in 2019.‘This is fundamentally a national security initiative’Tuesday’s announcement is the latest phase in Raimondo’s oversight of $50 billion in government funds going to companies to spur both semiconductor manufacturing and research in the years ahead. The money was approved in 2022 when President Biden signed the CHIPs and Science Act into law as a centerpiece of his economic agenda and focus on bringing back manufacturing to the U.S.President Biden signs the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 into law on August 9. (REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein)The application released this week is for $39 billion in the law that is earmarked for semiconductor manufacturing. Another application will be coming later this year and will begin to give out an additional $11 billion for chip research and design. The law also includes an investment tax credit of up to 25% towards a manufacturer’s capital expenditures.Story continuesIn the coming months, Raimondo and her team will also select sites for the centerpiece of the Biden team’s CHIPS vision: at least two new semiconductor manufacturing and research hubs built around producing the most advanced chips in the world.“The reality is there are only a few companies in the world that can do leading-edge chip manufacturing,” Raimondo said in this week’s interview.Companies like Intel and Micron — as well as IBM (IBM), Samsung (SSNLF), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) — have been engaged in intensive jockeying for months around the law with some already announcing U.S. expansion plans (and scoring presidential visits) to try and position themselves at the front of the line for the windfall.What Raimondo has repeatedly pledged in recent days is that no company is a shoo-in. She said that a proposal from a company will get funded only if it has a strong national security angle, is impossible to achieve without government assistance, and would be a good deal for taxpayers.But she noted that “a facility that's already been announced would be eligible for these incentives, and I expect that some companies that have already announced projects will receive incentives.” But at the end of the day, she added, the primary lens through which she will view applications is national security.President Joe Biden attended the groundbreaking of the new Intel semiconductor manufacturing facility in New Albany, Ohio in September. (REUTERS/Joshua Roberts)Meanwhile. companies have been publicly enthusiastic about the rollout so far. Allen Thompson, Intel vice president of U.S. government relations, told Yahoo Finance in a statement last week that, ""We strongly support the Department’s efforts to build U.S. manufacturing and promote new clusters of semiconductor ecosystems,” adding that they are in the middle of an expansion already in places like Arizona, New Mexico, and Ohio. The Semiconductor Industry Association recently added their own enthusiastic statement saying, “We must now ensure the CHIPS Act is implemented efficiently, effectively, and expeditiously.”Officials have compared the effort to big moments in American history from President Lincoln’s creation of the land-grant university system to John F. Kennedy’s famous call to put a man on the moon.“This is a program without recent precedent,” Raimondo told reporters on Monday. “And with that tremendous responsibility, we are committed to being good stewards of every dime of taxpayer money.”A focus on buybacksIn the coming years, the program is also set to be inextricably tied to the politically explosive topic of stock buybacks.Officials have repeatedly pledged that — backed by auditing mechanisms and access to the company records — they will ensure that no taxpayer money is used for buybacks.More challenging is what happens if a company receives government money and then separately announces a buyback plan. A Commerce Department official said this week that the department would ask companies to lay out all their overall buyback plans as part of the application process and then will give preference to ""companies that do make long-term investments in the United States as opposed to prioritizing buybacks.”A recent letter from prominent lawmakers like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) called on the administration to go further, calling for a ban on all buybacks for companies that take money for 10 years.Raimondo and her team promised to cut off the funds if they catch wind of any broken buyback promises— they also said they also have measures to claw back money that has already gone out the door. “I hope we never have to do that, but there are a lot of tools that we have to keep these companies honest,” she said in this week’s interview.Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo speaks about semiconductor chips at the White House in September (REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque)Companies will also be required as part of the application process to make additional promises that could impact the eventual payouts. For example, officials said companies must comply with U.S. export controls and will be required to restrict their ability to expand manufacturing in non-U.S. allies for the coming decade.Companies will also be required to submit detailed workforce provisions for how they plan to find, train, and retain workers to both build these extensive complexes and then eventually staff them. The provisions also include a requirement to outline how they will provide affordable childcare to workers.Raimondo said that at the end of the day “if we do our job right” the government money will encourage much more money from private sources. The goal: the $50 billion in government money will spur at least ten times that - half a trillion dollars - from these companies.Ben Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.Click here for politics news related to business and moneyRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Micron (MU) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Micron currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.70, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 26 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.70 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 26 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 18 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 69.2% and 3.9% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for MUBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for MUCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Micron here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Micron, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is MU Worth Investing In?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Micron, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at -$2.09.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Micron. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Micron.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

BrandsYum! Brands, Monday, February 27, 2023, Press release pictureKFC StoriesKFC is on a journey to reflect the diversity we see in our restaurants, within the dining room, and across our counters.In celebration of Black History Month, we're shining a light on some incredible leaders throughout our KFC family who are playing a role in advancing a more equitable and inclusive KFC for future generations.Meet Kedibone Patricia Malatji Lebethe (she/her), CEO and Managing Director of KFC South Africa's KPML Group of Companies. This is her story.How did you get started as a franchisee with KFC?My journey started with this great brand in 1986, working as a cashier at a franchise-owned KFC restaurant. My relationship with KFC progressed over the years as my career reached different milestones - only then did I realize my purpose at KFC. Success demands singleness of purpose and mine was to be a franchisee one day.Through prayer, persistency, influential mentorship and the boundless support of my family, my career grew rapidly to that of senior management at Yum! Brands. After hardship, a lengthy standard application process and with the support from Tarun Lal (currently KFC U.S. President) and other senior leaders at Yum! Brands, I was then approved as a franchisee.""Alongside my great people, we grew our portfolio to 29 restaurants in 3 different provinces with a team of over 1,000 employees.""In 2007, I opened my first restaurant and worked as the General Manager. After the opening of my third restaurant, I worked as an Area Coach, and as my business grew so did my team. I capitalized on the experience gained from ground level of what can be done and how it can be done; this ensured a strong foundation for the way forward. Alongside my great people, we grew our portfolio to 29 restaurants in three different provinces with a team of over 1,000 employees.We know the customer experience will never exceed the team member experience. How do you keep a winning mindset when growing your restaurant teams?True culture is a shadow of the leader. At KPML Group of Companies, we lead through our motto, Motho Ke Motho Ka Batho, meaning ""No man is an island."" This ignites our HWWT2 principles and delivers a magic recipe in running a great business.Story continues""As a leader, I have learned that my people are the 12th ingredient to a successful KFC franchise and they are the most important assets of my business.""Being compassionate is also a great blend to top our motto and this makes each and every person in my business feel appreciated and valued, as my shadow filters down all the way to store management and team members. Over the years I've learned that you don't merely build restaurants, you build people. And the people will not only build the restaurants but will grow them to greater heights.This all ensures that KFC's People Promise stays alive and everyone can ‘Be their Best Self, Make a Difference and Have Fun.' The key to success as a franchisee consists of being true to the core of the business with passion, hard work, dedication and determination to make it work, while doing the same thing every day until it gets done.My advice on motivating staff and cultivating a culture of recognition and training is to:Celebrate people doing things rightGive consistent recognitionPromote from withinTraining is an integral and ongoing part of our business, which allows people to grow and improve their capability to do their jobs more effectively. We also put people capability first, which results in satisfied customers and sales that will follow and to maintain this we have leaders who lead with their heart to ensure sustainability. Any business is, in large measure, the elongated shadow of one person.When you think about the KFC of the future, what inspires you?It is said, ""The only constant is change."" This alone inspires me - to know that we are forever growing and evolving not only as individuals but as a business, too. One constant since my time with the brand is witnessing how we transform with time. If we reject change there is no growth, no progress. Being part of a brand that rejects being stagnant makes room for innovation. KFC stays aligned with new innovation and technology, and as a global brand, we study and measure other markets to ensure we do things in the right way to benefit the customer and continue to grow the brand on the southern tip of Africa.""...this puts me at ease to know together, the future will be bright.""The brand has the right strategy to ensure we move with time. We have recently seen more technology come on board to ensure we keep the smiles on our important customers faces. The brand always has a go-forward strategy, and this puts me at ease to know together, the future will be bright.Click here to continue reading stories about the People of KFCView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Yum!

Starting next month, McDonald's will be selling the donuts in 160 locations. It's just throughout Kentucky in Louisville and Lexington, in those surrounding areas. So here's what's going to be offered-- the original glazed donut, one of my favorites, the chocolate iced with sprinkles donut, and also the chocolate iced cream-filled donut. Now the burger chain is doing it to get a better read on customer demand and also how a larger scale, potentially, launch impacts restaurant operations.McDonald's business has been holding up well with more people visiting its locations in the second half of the year.

From that, Krispy Kreme-- I'm a big fan of this. It's only in Kentucky, which I'm a little bummed about. But an afternoon stop by McDonald's, getting a donut, I like it.JOSH SCHAFER: I think it's the pairing, too, right, Seana?SEANA SMITH: Coffee.JOSH SCHAFER: What do you have with the donut? You have a coffee, right? And McDonald's exactly, just a couple of weeks ago in the earnings call, when asked about what's the big growth driver for you this year, where do you think you can grow more, they said chicken and coffee. Well, if you're going to get that afternoon coffee, a donut does actually make sense. It pairs well with the coffee. I think that's sort of what they're going for here, Jared.JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, hey, I'm not going to disagree here. I was just looking at Krispy Kreme stock here. Has been around for a while. I believe it came to market over the pandemic. Interesting chart here. Looks like we got the lowest low only recently. But like many other companies, up strongly off of those lows this year.]"

From the crystal-clear waters of the Caribbean to the rugged cliff sides and dramatic black sands of Iceland, this year's rankings give travelers across the globe the opportunity to find their favorite beach.""As a huge beach fan myself, I know the impossible-to-resist allure of sunshine and turquoise water—and certainly, there's plenty of that on this year's list,"" said Sarah Firshein, the Head of Editorial at Tripadvisor. ""But there are some delightful surprises as well. In addition to the much-loved beaches of Hawaii, the Caribbean, and mainland Europe, our community is really looking to kick up their experiences by embracing the cliffs of Cannon Beach, on the coast of Oregon in the Western United States, and cooler destinations like Reynisfjara Beach in Iceland. So whether you're looking to pack a windbreaker or a swimsuit, our list has something for a wide range of travelers—and it might even convince the most ardent beach skeptics to embrace some time on the sand.""Story continuesIsland getaways are popular this year, with almost three quarters of the world's top 10 situated in remote, offshore locations. Winners span from the popular beaches of Hawaii and the Caribbean to the more secluded coastlines of Fernando de Noronha, Brazil and Havelock Island, India.Emerging from the cold, dark days of winter in the Northern Hemisphere, travelers have exotic escapes on the mind. The most popular beaches among Tripadvisor reviewers make for an exciting list with something for every type of beach dweller, from sun worshippers to adventure seekers and wildlife enthusiasts.The Global WinnersClimbing six places from last year to reach the No. 1 spot is Baia do Sancho. Located on the Brazilian island of Fernando de Noronha, part of a group of volcanic islands just over 200 miles from the country's northeast coast, this area is renowned for its jagged coastline and diverse ecosystems. Off the beaten track and only accessible by ladder from the mainland, Baia de Sancho is not only famous for its picture perfect turquoise waters and white sand beach, but also the exotic array of wildlife. Travelers who venture into the warm clear waters might be lucky enough to catch a glimpse of sea turtles, rays, dolphins and even reef sharks. Flanked by forest-clad cliffs this wild, unspoiled spot is also famous for the friendly crabs that crawl the shoreline.A new and exciting entry to the world list for 2023 is the dramatic Reynisfjara Beach in Vik, Iceland – and this is a beach like no other. With its world famous black sands and imposing rock formations towering over the shore, some may recognize the striking backdrop from Game of Thrones. Reynisfjara Beach is popular with birdwatchers for the various types of seabirds spotted nearby, most famously, puffins. But with waves of up to 40 meters (131 feet) and freezing waters, this is a beach best admired from the safety of the coast.Top U.S. BeachesKa'anapali Beach on the Hawaiian island of Maui was named No. 1 in the U.S., climbing a remarkable 16 places from last year to top the list. Three miles of powder white sand and crystal-clear water, this palm-tree lined island paradise shore, lapped by gentle waves of the Pacific Ocean, is as perfect as it gets. For those searching for more than relaxation, there's Driftwood Beach on Jekyll Island, Georgia, which comes in at No. 3, described by Tripadvisor reviewers as ""other worldly"" thanks to the ancient driftwood monuments that line the coast. There are three other new entries to the top 10 this year, including Hanalei, on the island of Kauai, securing an impressive No. 4 spot. Overall, Hawaii takes the crown this year with three total winners in the U.S. top 10, more than any other state. But the Aloha State ties Florida for the most winners overall in the top 25, with eight each.Top 10 Beaches in the World for 2023Baia do Sancho - Fernando de Noronha, BrazilEagle Beach- Aruba, CaribbeanCable Beach - Broome, AustraliaReynisfjara Beach - Vik, IcelandGrace Bay Beach – Turks and Caicos, CaribbeanPraia da Falésia- Olhos de Agua, PortugalRadhanagar Beach – Havelock Island, IndiaSpiaggia dei Conigli – Sicily, ItalyVaradero Beach – Cuba, CaribbeanKa'anapali Beach - Maui, HawaiiTop 10 Beaches in the US for 2023Ka'anapali Beach – Maui, HawaiiSiesta Beach – Siesta Key, FloridaDriftwood Beach – Jekyll Island, GeorgiaHanalei Beach – Kauai, HawaiiHo'okipa Beach Park - Maui, HawaiiHenderson Beach State Park – Destin, FloridaCannon Beach – Cannon Beach, OregonCoronado Beach – Coronado, CaliforniaOgunquit Beach – Ogunquit, MaineLa Jolla Cove - La Jolla, CaliforniaSee all the Travelers' Choice Best of the Best Beach winners for 2023 here: tripadvisor.com/TravelersChoice-Beaches.MethodologyThe Travelers' Choice Best of the Best Awards honor travelers' favorite beaches worldwide, based on the quality and quantity of reviews and ratings from Tripadvisor travelers for beaches, gathered over the 12-month period from January 1, 2022, through December 31, 2022.About TripadvisorTripadvisor, the world's largest travel guidance platform*, helps hundreds of millions of people each month** become better travelers, from planning to booking to taking a trip.

(NYSE:UPS)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-time-look-buying-united-110102605.html,1677582062,STORY,['UPS'],"[United Parcel Service, Inc. ( NYSE:UPS ) received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$192 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$174. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether United Parcel Service's current trading price of US$182 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at United Parcel Service’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.  View our latest analysis for United Parcel Service  What Is United Parcel Service Worth?United Parcel Service appears to be overvalued by 21% at the moment, based on my discounted cash flow valuation. The stock is currently priced at US$182 on the market compared to my intrinsic value of $150.47. Not the best news for investors looking to buy! If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that United Parcel Service’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from United Parcel Service?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. However, with a negative profit growth of -2.1% expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth certainly doesn’t appear to be a driver for a buy decision for United Parcel Service. This certainty tips the risk-return scale towards higher risk.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? If you believe UPS is currently trading above its value, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. Given the uncertainty from negative growth in the future, this could be the right time to de-risk your portfolio. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on UPS for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. Despite an unclear picture of the future, its price increased beyond the fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Should the price fall in the future, will you be well-informed enough to buy?In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

The blue-chip index fell 3% last week, turning red from a year-to-date look. This marks the longest losing streak in 10 months (read: 5 Most Heavily Shorted ETFs So Far This Year).SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF DIA, tracking the Dow Jones Index, is still up a modest 0.3% and most of the stocks have helped it to stay tall. These include American Express Company AXP, Salesforce Inc. CRM, The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, Microsoft Corporation MSFT and Apple Inc. AAPL.Hot economic data lately suggests stronger economic activity and have rekindled worries about a longer-than-expected Fed rate hike. U.S. consumer spending increased by the most in nearly two years in January amid a surge in wage gains, while inflation accelerated. Hiring surprisingly surged with the economy adding a solid 517,000 jobs in January. The unemployment rate fell from 3.5% to 3.4%, the lowest since 1969. Business activity unexpectedly rebounded in February, reaching its highest level in eight months, while U.S. builder confidence rose for the second consecutive month to the highest level since September 2022.Meanwhile, Americans have been regaining confidence in the U.S. economy, with consumer sentiment in early February jumping to its highest level in 13 months, per the latest University of Michigan's consumer survey (read: 5 ETFs to Benefit as Monthly Inflation Drops to 2-Year Low).Inflation has also come in hotter than expected. The Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge accelerated in January at its fastest pace since June, an alarming sign that price pressures remain entrenched in the U.S. economy and could lead the Fed to keep raising interest rates well into this year. Earlier this month, per the government report, the consumer price index surged 0.5% in January following a 0.1% increase in December. It climbed 6.4% year over year, down from a peak of 9.1% in June but far above the Fed’s 2% inflation target.Let’s take a closer look at the fundamentals of DIA and its performance.Story continuesDIA in FocusThis is one of the largest and most popular ETFs in the large-cap space, with AUM of $28.5 billion and an average daily volume of 3.5 million shares.

The S&amp;P 500, the Dow, and the Nasdaq posted their biggest weekly losses in 2023. For the week, the S&amp;P 500 slipped 2.7%, leading to its worst week since Dec 9.The Dow fell 3%, its fourth straight weekly loss, and registered its longest weekly losing streak since May 2022, added the Dow Jones Market Data. The blue-chip index also booked its worst weekly percentage drop since September 2022. The Nasdaq, too, finished 3.3% lower and registered weekly losses in two out of the last three weeks.So, what lead to a bloodbath on Wall Street? A hotter-than-expected Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge was primarily responsible for hurting the stock market. The personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index increased by 0.6% in January, way more than the 0.2% rise in December.Similarly, the PCE Index advanced 5.4% year over year last month from an increase of 5.3% in December. Excluding the volatile food and fuel prices, the PCE Index still increased and all the readings were higher than anticipated.Prices of gas, fuel, and shelter, to name a few, in reality, scaled upward, regrettably, at the beginning of 2023. The consumer price index (CPI) advanced by 0.5% in January and registered an annual gain of 6.4%, easily topping analysts’ expectations. The core CPI also increased by 0.4% last month and 5.6% year over year, more than what market pundits’ have forecast.Now, inflation remaining stubbornly higher this year despite showing some signs of ebbing in the latter half of last year has raised concerns that the Fed will continue to remain aggressive in its monetary policy stance. The central bank is expected to continue hiking interest rates to quell inflationary pressure.Most of the market participants at present expect the central bank to increase interest rates by 25 basis points in March as well as in May. Such a move will push the policy rate to reach 5.36% by mid-summer and could remain elevated at that level for the rest of 2023.Story continuesHowever, rate hikes increase the cost of borrowing, discourage consumers from spending, and deter economic growth, resulting in volatility in the stock market. Thus, currently, higher inflation leading to rate hike expectations eventually weighed on the markets.But investors shouldn’t panic! They should instead invest their hard-earned money in stocks that provide risk-adjusted returns, like NiSource Inc. NI, Spire Inc. SR, Conagra Brands, Inc. CAG and Philip Morris International Inc. PM.These stocks have a low beta (ranges from 0 to 1) and are dividend players. Hence, they have a solid business model and are less susceptible to market uncertainty. They are also non-cyclical in nature since they are part of the utility and consumer staples sectors. This makes them immune to market volatility. These stocks also boast a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

295,6c5cf4d2-176a-3b4d-8675-0c2b1889e71c,TSCO,2023-02-28,4 Stocks to Watch in a Strengthening Retail-Miscellaneous Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-watch-strengthening-retail-142402021.html,1677507842.0,STORY,"['TSCO', 'ULTA', 'ARHS', '^GSPC']","[The Zacks Retail – Miscellaneous industry participants have been focusing on superior product strategy, advancement of omni-channel capabilities and prudent capital investments to strike the right chord with consumers. Ulta Beauty, Inc. ULTA, Tractor Supply Company TSCO, Five Below, Inc. FIVE and Arhaus, Inc. ARHS look well poised, courtesy of their business operating model, growth prospects and cost structure.However, product cost inflation, tight labor market and supply-chain issues are some of the headwinds that players in the industry have been encountering.About the IndustryThe Zacks Retail – Miscellaneous industry covers retailers of sporting goods, office supplies, and specialty products as well as sellers of a wide range of domestic merchandise. It also includes retailers of beauty products providing cosmetics, fragrances, skincare and haircare products, and salon styling tools. Some of the industry participants operate rural lifestyle retail stores, arts and crafts specialty outlets and sell their products to farmers, ranchers, and others as well as tradesmen and small businesses. The industry also comprises recreational boat and yacht retailers as well as specialty value retailers offering a broad range of trend-right, high-quality merchandise targeted at tween and teen customers. The players' profitability depends on a prudent pricing model, a well-organized supply chain and an effective merchandising strategy.4 Key Industry TrendsConsumers’ Willingness to Spend: The industry’s prospects are correlated with the purchasing power of consumers. The players in the industry have been focusing on deepening engagements with consumers and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. We believe that stimulus savings from last year, steady wage gains and a lower unemployment rate kept the demand alive this holiday season. Data compiled by the National Retail Federation (NRF) showed that holiday retail sales increased 5.3% year over year to $936.3 billion during 2022’s November-December period. Retail sales rose 3% on a sequential basis and 6.4% year over year in the month of January, per the Commerce Department.Story continuesFocus on Boosting Portfolio &amp; Market Reach: Most companies in the space are working on providing a wide assortment of products, enhancing the online experience and adopting a favorable pricing strategy to boost sales. Initiatives such as building omni-channel operations, coming up with reward programs, and developing innovative products and services are worth mentioning. There has been an increase in demand for office supplies, personal care items, domestic merchandise products and fitness-related products. Companies are looking to fuel sales via targeted marketing.Digitization Key to Growth: With the change in consumer shopping patterns and behavior, industry participants have been playing dual in-store and online roles. In this respect, the industry players have been directing resources toward digital platforms, accelerating fleet optimization and augmenting the supply chain. In fact, companies’ initiatives to expand delivery options — curbside pickup or ship-to-home orders — and contactless payment solutions have been a boon. Additionally, retailers are investing in renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumers’ product preferences and inclination toward online shopping, retailers are replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.Eye on Margins: Companies in the industry are vying for a bigger share on attributes such as price, products and speed to market. They have been accelerating investments to strengthen the digital ecosystem and boost shipping and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors drive sales, they entail high costs. Apart from these, any deleverage in SG&amp;A rate, higher labor and occupancy costs, and increased marketing and other store-related expenses might build pressure on margins. Of late, the industry participants have been dealing with high labor costs amid the tight labor market, increased freight costs and supply-chain issues. Nonetheless, companies have been focused on undertaking initiatives to mitigate cost-related challenges. These include streamlining operational structures, optimizing supply networks as well as adopting effective pricing policies.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe Zacks Retail – Miscellaneous industry is housed within the broader Zacks Retail–Wholesale sector.

296,10dbb48e-d1f0-3d97-b693-4821f64550df,MDLZ,2023-02-28,7 Dynamite Dividend Stocks for Income and Growth in 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-dynamite-dividend-stocks-income-174609851.html,1677260769,STORY,"['CVX', 'LLY', 'AVGO', 'PM', 'MDLZ', 'V', 'RTX']","[Many long-term investors appreciate dividend stocks, for many reasons. Companies that pay back a portion of their profits to their shareholders via dividends are generally more reliable. Additionally, dividend stocks provide investors looking for income in retirement with a steady stream of passive income.Generally, dividends are typically issued by well-established, financially stable companies that are often household names. And the most dependable dividend stocks have long histories of distributing capital to their shareholders. That’s what many such investors focus on.With the market showing consistent improvement, dividend stocks are likely to provide growth and income in 2023. Investors can choose to reinvest their dividends back into a given stock, or can choose to receive the dividend payments as cash, which can provide a steady stream of income.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDividend-yielding companies tend to be financially healthy and stable over the long term. They tend to be wise investments anytime, especially in an upward-trending market.PMPhilip Morris$98.42LLYEli Lilly$323.35CVXChevron$161.00AVGOBroadcom$575.77RTXRaytheon$98.74VVisa$218.73MDLZMondelez$65.17Philip Morris (PM) An image of a cigarette and an e-cigarette side-by-side on a wood surface.Source: vfhnb12 / Shutterstock.comPhilip Morris (NYSE:PM) is a leading tobacco company known for the biggest cigarette brands. However, because Philip Morris operates in a highly-regulated industry and faces declining smoking rates, many investors could easily ignore it.That said, the company is pivoting into an evolving tobacco industry with a strategy that looks to give it a significant advantage over its competitors. That positioning and its substantial dividend make PM stock very potent.Let’s start with Philip Morris’ dividend. It yields around 5%, which is quite high. This dividend is also relatively stable, having last been reduced in 2008. In 2022, shareholders received $5.04 in dividend payments for each share of PM stock owned. Analysts expect PM stock to increase to $111 in the next 12-18 months, and it currently trades around $100 per share. So, there’s roughly a 15% upside baked into the stock, if analyst estimates are to be believed.Story continuesPhilip Morris is relying on growth from its smokeless tobacco brands, which have been profitable, while competitors rely more heavily on cigarettes for revenues even as smoking rates continue to decline.Eli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XISource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comInvestors should seriously consider Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) stock. The company develops and sells medications in various therapeutic areas, including diabetes, oncology, and immunology. Currently, its diabetes drug, Mounjaro, has investors excited.Overall, Eli Lilly appeals to investors seeking exposure to the pharmaceutical industry and a steady source of income. Those considering Eli Lilly note that this company is a highly-profitable, fast-growing, dependable dividend stock with a potent catalyst for future growth in Mounjaro.Eli Lilly boasts exceptionally high profitability metrics within a drug manufacturing industry known for increased profitability. Its gross, operating, and net margins exceed the 90th percentile of industry competitors. Further, the firm’s cost of capital is 3.5%, while it returns 21.55% on that capital.LLY stock provides a modest forward dividend yield around 1.4%. However, this distribution was last reduced in 1986, so it’s dependable. Lastly, Eli Lilly is seeking FDA approval to market the diabetes drug Mounjaro for weight loss. Sales of Mounjaro recently fell short of expectations, but the company still exceeded expectations and could take off when and if Mounjaro receives FDA approval.Chevron (CVX) Chevron logo on blue sign in front of skyscraper buildingSource: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comChevron (NYSE:CVX) is an American multinational energy corporation that has seen a very strong 2022. The company is among the world’s largest producers of oil and natural gas. Although Chevron had a strong 2022, challenges related to the volatility of commodity prices and environmental concerns make it somewhat volatile. But its dividend balances those concerns as a source of income. With its current lower price, Chevron looks like a buy.The energy sector was the strongest performer in 2022. Oil majors, including Chevron, Shell (NYSE:SHEL), and Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) profited more than $132 billion in 2022, returning $78 billion through buybacks and dividends. But investors have shied away from CVX, which has seen its stock price drop considerably of late. Concerns over environmental issues and an unclear situation in Ukraine are likely factors.That said, 2022 showed that oil demand will likely remain robust for a long time. That gives Chevron a potent catalyst moving forward as it continues to provide revenue for shareholders.Broadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office buildingSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.comBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock is a strong choice for investors seeking semiconductor exposure and dividends. The company designs, develop and sells semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. Its software is used across multiple industries, including telecommunications, data centers, and enterprise software.Broadcom offers investors growth and income. Currently, AVGO shares currently trade for $575 and carry an average target price of $665. AVGO’s dividend yielded 3.1% at last count, totaling $16.90 in dividends per share last year. Assuming Broadcom continues to pay $4.60 quarterly for all of 2023, it’ll reward investors with $18.40 of dividends in 2023. So, Broadcom’s value could grow to $683.40 per share, which equates to 14.86% growth.The company will re-release earnings on Mar. 2 after a strong 2022 in which revenues grew 21% to $33.2 billion. Broadcom’s net income growth was even more robust in 2022, growing by 70.65% and reaching $11.495 billion.Raytheon (RTX) Raytheon (RTX) defense company logo hanging from glass buildingSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comRaytheon (NYSE:RTX) stock represents a multinational aerospace and defense company that sells systems and services to commercial, military, and government customers worldwide. Its products include missile defense systems, radar, and communication systems.Raytheon has paid a dividend for several decades. However, it was reduced in 2021, so investors seeking rock-solid increases should beware. In any case, it provides reliable, if fluctuating, income to long-term investors.The company has strong growth prospects, including high demand for weapons orders tied to the Ukraine conflict. Additionally, with other geopolitical pressures coming out of China and other regions, there’s plenty to like about the company’s long-term prospects. Although revenues related to the war in Ukraine have been substantial, supply chain issues have hampered deliveries. That suggests Raytheon could move higher if and when those issues are sorted.Raytheon expects between $72 to $73 billion in sales for fiscal 2023. That would represent between 7.3% and 8.8% top-line growth over its 2022 results. Indeed, I think these numbers should entice investors as this growth rate would significantly outpace the company’s 4% growth seen between 2021 and 2022.Visa (V) several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comVisa (NYSE:V) is a multinational financial services corporation providing payment processing and digital payment solutions for individuals and businesses globally. The company is most notable for offering credit and debit cards but also provides payment gateway and risk management services.Visa shares include a dividend, yielding very modest 0.8%. So, it won’t provide substantial income or dividends that allow for any sort of significant share repurchases upon reinvestment. That said, the company’s dividend is highly-dependable, having last been reduced in 2008, and growing 17.4% over the last five years. In any case, Visa’s pricing upside is most attractive.The company’s Q1 revenue grew by 12%, with cross-border travel as a bright spot. Payments volume remained stable. Cross-border volume increased by 22%, suggesting that travel remains strong even as overall economic concerns remain substantial. Visa returned $4 billion to shareholders during the period as well.Mondelez (MDLZ) The Mondelez website magnified by a magnifying glassSource: ShutterstockLast on this list of dividend stocks to buy is Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ). This diversified consumer goods stock has impressive upside, a solid dividend, and ended 2022 on a strong note. Those factors should interest investors in the snack company that sells Oreos, Wheat Thins, Chips Ahoy!, and BelVita.Firstly, MDLZ stock has roughly a $10 upside above its current $66 price, according to analyst. This is among the dividend stocks I think is worth buying, despite its modest 2.3% yield. That’s because Mondelez has grown its revenue by 12.3% over the last five years. The math suggests plenty of appreciation for investors willing to buy now.Additionally, Mondelez’s performance leading into 2023 only strengthens that notion. Revenues increased 9.7% overall in 2022 and grew an even faster 13.5% rate in Q4.Mondelez’s organic revenue growth reached 12.3% in 2022 and 15.4% in Q4. Its core brands are performing well and should bolster investor confidence in MDLZ as an investment.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Ulta Beauty, Inc. ULTA, Tractor Supply Company TSCO, Five Below, Inc. FIVE and Arhaus, Inc. ARHS look well poised, courtesy of their business operating model, growth prospects and cost structure.However, product cost inflation, tight labor market and supply-chain issues are some of the headwinds that players in the industry have been encountering.About the IndustryThe Zacks Retail – Miscellaneous industry covers retailers of sporting goods, office supplies, and specialty products as well as sellers of a wide range of domestic merchandise. It also includes retailers of beauty products providing cosmetics, fragrances, skincare and haircare products, and salon styling tools. Some of the industry participants operate rural lifestyle retail stores, arts and crafts specialty outlets and sell their products to farmers, ranchers, and others as well as tradesmen and small businesses. The industry also comprises recreational boat and yacht retailers as well as specialty value retailers offering a broad range of trend-right, high-quality merchandise targeted at tween and teen customers. The players' profitability depends on a prudent pricing model, a well-organized supply chain and an effective merchandising strategy.4 Key Industry TrendsConsumers’ Willingness to Spend: The industry’s prospects are correlated with the purchasing power of consumers. The players in the industry have been focusing on deepening engagements with consumers and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. We believe that stimulus savings from last year, steady wage gains and a lower unemployment rate kept the demand alive this holiday season. Data compiled by the National Retail Federation (NRF) showed that holiday retail sales increased 5.3% year over year to $936.3 billion during 2022’s November-December period. Retail sales rose 3% on a sequential basis and 6.4% year over year in the month of January, per the Commerce Department.Story continuesFocus on Boosting Portfolio &amp; Market Reach: Most companies in the space are working on providing a wide assortment of products, enhancing the online experience and adopting a favorable pricing strategy to boost sales. Initiatives such as building omni-channel operations, coming up with reward programs, and developing innovative products and services are worth mentioning. There has been an increase in demand for office supplies, personal care items, domestic merchandise products and fitness-related products. Companies are looking to fuel sales via targeted marketing.Digitization Key to Growth: With the change in consumer shopping patterns and behavior, industry participants have been playing dual in-store and online roles. In this respect, the industry players have been directing resources toward digital platforms, accelerating fleet optimization and augmenting the supply chain. In fact, companies’ initiatives to expand delivery options — curbside pickup or ship-to-home orders — and contactless payment solutions have been a boon. Additionally, retailers are investing in renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumers’ product preferences and inclination toward online shopping, retailers are replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.Eye on Margins: Companies in the industry are vying for a bigger share on attributes such as price, products and speed to market. They have been accelerating investments to strengthen the digital ecosystem and boost shipping and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors drive sales, they entail high costs. Apart from these, any deleverage in SG&amp;A rate, higher labor and occupancy costs, and increased marketing and other store-related expenses might build pressure on margins. Of late, the industry participants have been dealing with high labor costs amid the tight labor market, increased freight costs and supply-chain issues. Nonetheless, companies have been focused on undertaking initiatives to mitigate cost-related challenges. These include streamlining operational structures, optimizing supply networks as well as adopting effective pricing policies.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe Zacks Retail – Miscellaneous industry is housed within the broader Zacks Retail–Wholesale sector.

Without a doubt, Kroger’s digital business remains one of its growth drivers, growing 10% year over year in the last quarter. Its Kroger Delivery Now service provides customers with food and household staples in 30 minutes. Also, its focus on the margin-rich alternative profit business bodes well.On its last earnings call, the company announced the termination of the Express Scripts agreement, effective Dec 31. Management informed that the termination of the contract will reduce fourth-quarter sales by $100 million. This termination will also impact identical sales without fuel by approximately 35 basis points in the said quarter.Additionally, margins remain an area to watch.

The war in Ukraine reminded folks that the world remains a dangerous place. After many years of stagnant or shrinking defense budgets, significant powers such as Germany and Japan are ramping up military spending again. It’s not just Russian aggression causing this, either. Rising tensions around China and the Middle East, among other regions, are forcing governments to rethink the geopolitical map.Additionally, the space race is on. And that’s true from both a commercial and defense perspective. Companies with leading space and satellite solutions should enjoy strong growth in the coming years.This volatile economic environment adds to the appeal of aerospace and defense stocks. These sectors enjoy heavy government support and long-term contracts, ensuring consistent revenues regardless of broader economic conditions.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPutting it all together, these three aerospace and defense stocks are set to grow and prosper.LMTLockheed Martin$478.37AVAVAeroVironment$85.62TXTTextron$72.90Lockheed Martin (LMT)Close top view of a Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35C Lightning II with afterburner onSource: ranchorunner / Shutterstock.comLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is an all-in-one option for aerospace and defense stock investors. The blue-chip company has a heavy presence in providing key defense capabilities, such as fighter jets. The company also is involved in the commercial space, offering products and services for engines, radar systems, and other critical aircraft components.However, an underappreciated part of Lockheed Martin’s business is its satellite operations. Satellite and space have become the second-largest part of the company’s overall business.Lockheed’s satellite business should continue to post sharply above-average growth. Companies increasingly look to satellites for everything from communications platforms to remote monitoring and big data applications. The recent drama around spy balloons and purported unidentified flying objects may also boost demand.Story continuesEven before recent events, the military has increasingly focused on space. The U.S. set up its Space Force as a separate military branch. Whether on the ground, in the air, or in space, Lockheed Martin provides key capabilities to help provide security.AeroVironment (AVAV)Russian and Ukrainian flags, Russian-Ukrainian War, defense stocksSource: Svet foto / Shutterstock.comFor investors that want to buy stock in a company helping the fight in Ukraine, AeroVironment (NASDAQ:AVAV) is a great pick. AeroVironment produces the Switchblade system.Switchblade is an advanced direct-fire loitering missile system. Switchblade can operate as a drone that can be sacrificed, rather than risking a human combatant. AeroVironment has a long history of developing unmanned aircraft systems (AUS) and tactical missile systems.While AeroVironment has an extensive track record in the industry, the conflict in Ukraine has highlighted the value of these systems like never before. Last fall, AeroVironment announced that it is ramping up production to be able to send more drones to Ukraine. This includes replenishing the existing inventory of these systems while also producing a higher-capacity version of the unit.AeroVironment also continues to gain momentum in other areas, with a new contract signed with the Marines for its Puma 3 battlefield drones.Textron (TXT)Two individuals step out of a helicopter while the pilot stands nearby.Source: ShutterstockTextron (NYSE:TXT) is an aerospace company focused on helicopters. It produces helicopters for both commercial and military markets. Textron has a long-running history; founded in 1923, the company made it to the century mark this year.Textron shares initially fell sharply during the pandemic around concerns about future commercial helicopter demand. But these worries proved to be misplaced. Textron’s sales have stabilized, and are now growing solidly once again.Meanwhile, the company secured a huge and somewhat unexpected contract win. Last year, the Army gave a coveted new contract for the Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) to the Textron Bell V-280. This came despite fierce competition from rival Boeing (NYSE:BA). Boeing is still appealing the outcome, but it seems Textron won the contract, which could result in up to $7.1 billion in revenue, and potentially run into the tens of billions over time.This gives new life to the military side of Textron’s business. It offers a huge growth catalyst to an already cheap stock. Textron shares go for less than 15 times forward earnings, and analysts forecast double-digit earnings growth.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in LMT stock.

It expects to complete the process this year. However, Soroban's action indicated frustration that the process isn't going fast enough.Soroban said it wants Union's former chief operating office Jim Vena, who left the company in 2020, to return as CEO. Vena had upset some customers with the implementation of Precision Scheduled Railroading - a management process that sharply reduces cost - especially on labor - but which has been criticized for also delivering poorer service and compromising safety.The latter issue, in particular, has been much in the headlines recently after the derailment of a Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) train carrying hazardous chemicals.Story continues""A return of Vena to the company would be well met by Wall Street, but may be a tougher sell to other industry stakeholders,"" said analysts at Bernstein in a note to clients.Fritz took over as CEO in 2015 during a golden period for U.S. railroads, when shipments of oil and refined products, in particular, were booming. The pandemic also juiced returns as lockdowns triggered a massive rush for durable goods, many of which had to be distributed by rail after being imported from Asia and Europe.However, Union Pacific stock peaked in March last year and has lost one-third of its value since then, despite a widespread rotation to ‘value’ stocks in old-economy sectors.Union Pacific stock rose nearly 10% on the news by 08:30 ET (13:30 GMT), compared to a rise of 0.5% in S&amp;P 500 stock futures.

330,87b7cd45-b40d-378b-96bc-410ccf1b93be,SRE,2023-02-28,ONCOR REPORTS 2022 RESULTS,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oncor-reports-2022-results-120500843.html,1677585900,STORY,['SRE'],"[DALLAS, Feb. 28, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Oncor Electric Delivery Company LLC (""Oncor"") today reported twelve months ended December 31, 2022 net income of $905 million compared to reported twelve months ended December 31, 2021 net income of $770 million. The $135 million year-over-year increase was driven by higher revenues from updates to base transmission and distribution rates to reflect increases in invested capital, increased customer consumption attributable primarily to significantly warmer summer weather and colder winter weather, and customer growth, partially offset by increases in costs associated with additional investments (primarily depreciation and borrowing costs) and higher operation and maintenance expense.Oncor. (PRNewsFoto/Oncor)""Once again, 2022 represented another year of remarkable growth and operational achievements, including improved safety and reliability performance. None of that could happen without the professionalism, dedication and focus on customer service that the Oncor team brings to work each and every day,"" said Oncor CEO Allen Nye. ""Texas grew by nearly 1,300 people a day in 2022, leading the nation in both job growth and population growth. At Oncor, we also saw company records for annual new and active transmission point of interconnection requests, as well as the highest new subdivision requests in several years. Now more than ever, we need to continue to attract the capital to build the infrastructure necessary to power that growth for years to come.""Oncor's fourth quarter 2022 net income decreased to $164 million, down from $175 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was driven by increases in costs associated with additional investment (primarily depreciation, property taxes and borrowing costs), the timing of an annual energy efficiency program performance bonus approved in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the prior year's annual energy efficiency program performance bonus being approved in the fourth quarter of 2021, and higher operation and maintenance expense, partially offset by increased customer consumption attributable primarily to colder weather as compared to the same period in 2021 and higher revenues from updates to base transmission and distribution rates to reflect increases in invested capital and customer growth.Story continuesOncor's total distribution base revenues in the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021 increased 9.9% (2.6% increase on a weather-normalized basis). The change in Oncor's total distribution base revenues in the fourth quarter of 2022 included a 16.9% increase in distribution base revenues from residential customers (0.3% increase on a weather-normalized basis) and a 4.4% increase in distribution base revenues from large commercial and industrial customers. Oncor's total distribution base revenues in the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 increased 10.4% (4.7% increase on a weather-normalized basis). The change in Oncor's total distribution base revenues in the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 included a 14.9% increase in distribution base revenues from residential customers (3.2% increase on a weather-normalized basis) and a 6.6% increase in distribution base revenues from large commercial and industrial customers. Financial and operational results are provided in Tables A, B, C, and D below.Regulatory UpdateOncor's comprehensive base rate review proceeding before the Public Utility Commission of Texas (""PUCT"") continues to progress. The rate review includes a request for an average increase over test year adjusted annualized revenues of 4.5%, and, if approved as requested, would result in an aggregate annualized revenue increase of approximately $251 million. Oncor has also requested a regulatory capital structure ratio of 55% debt to 45% equity (which aligns with its actual capitalization at year-end 2022) and a revision to its authorized return on equity to 10.3% in the proceeding. Oncor's current authorized regulatory capital structure ratio is 57.5% debt to 42.5% equity and its current authorized return on equity is 9.8%. On December 28, 2022, a Proposal for Decision (""PFD"") was issued by administrative law judges from the State Office of Administrative Hearings (""SOAH"") to the PUCT for its consideration. The PFD initially recommended a $397 million reduction to Oncor's requested annualized base rate revenue requirement, which would be a $146 million reduction to test year adjusted annualized revenue. The PFD also included recommendations for a return on equity of 9.3%, continuation of Oncor's existing 57.5% debt to 42.5% equity capital structure, disallowances of various items included in rate base, as well as other modifications to Oncor's base rate review requests. On January 19, 2023, PUCT Staff filed an errata memorandum indicating that the number run model relied upon by the PFD included a $680 million accumulated depreciation reallocation error. On February 9, 2023, the SOAH administrative law judges filed an exceptions letter indicating that they agreed that this and certain other number-running corrections and any associated flow-through adjustments should be adopted. Oncor believes the impact of the number-running errors results in an unwarranted reduction to rate base that drives $51 million of the proposed annualized revenue decrease reflected in the PFD. Oncor further believes that the correction of the accumulated depreciation reallocation number running error will revise the PFD's recommendation to a $346 million reduction to Oncor's requested annualized base rate revenue, which would be a $95 million decrease to Oncor's test year adjusted annualized revenue. The PUCT is expected to discuss Oncor's base rate review at its open meeting on March 9, 2023. On January 24, 2023, Oncor filed Exceptions to the Proposal for Decision (""Exceptions"") explaining why it disagrees with certain recommendations of the administrative law judges in the PFD. Other intervening parties in the proceeding filed Exceptions as well, and on February 1, 2023, Oncor filed a Reply to Exceptions addressing points in those intervenor Exceptions. Resolution of the base rate review requires issuance of a final order by the PUCT, which is expected around the end of the first quarter of 2023, with new rates going into effect following approval of tariffs reflecting that final order. Oncor cannot predict whether or to what extent its requests in the base rate review will be approved or what the ultimate impact of the proceeding will be on its results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, or cash flows.In addition, on February 13, 2023, Oncor filed an application with the PUCT requesting that it grant certain exceptions to the distribution cost recovery factor (""DCRF"") application filing requirements, including extending the filing deadline, due to the timing of its pending base rate review. Oncor requested that its April 8, 2023 deadline for filing a DCRF application for eligible distribution investments placed into service during 2022 be extended until at least May 31, 2023.Oncor Service Territory Growth Oncor experienced another strong year in 2022 with solid growth in premises and the construction of new transmission and distribution lines, as well as new company records for both new and active transmission point-of-interconnection (""POI"") requests, all while remaining focused on safety and reliability.Texas's population continued to grow in 2022, despite the prolonged impact of tightening global supply chains and the limited availability of new construction materials, and Oncor continues to support that growth with new projects, including projects designed to increase reliability for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. (""ERCOT"") market. Oncor connected 64,000 new premises to the ERCOT grid in 2022, as compared to 70,000 in 2021. Additionally, Oncor placed approximately $1.1 billion of transmission projects into service in 2022. The continued growth across Oncor's service territory required the construction or upgrading of approximately 340 miles of transmission lines and included 48 major substation projects and 27 major switching station projects being placed into service in 2022. The dynamic growth across Oncor's service territory demonstrates the rapid growth taking place in Texas and the continued opportunity to deploy capital to grow the Oncor system.At December 31, 2022, Oncor had approximately 610 active generation and retail transmission POI requests in queue representing a 53% increase as compared to active generation and retail transmission POI requests in queue at December 31, 2021. Of the approximately 360 active generation POI requests in queue at December 31, 2022, 52% are solar, 35% are storage, 10% are wind and 3% are gas. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, Oncor received approximately 280 new generation and retail transmission POI requests as compared to approximately 215 new generation and retail transmission POI requests during the same period of 2021.Oncor's service territory continues to be a vibrant, diverse and growing service territory. Recently, Oncor announced a new Vehicle-to-Grid (""V2G"") collaboration with Toyota Motor North America (""Toyota"") to study the impacts and benefits of V2G transactions on the grid. This V2G pilot project will examine the interconnectivity between Toyota battery electric vehicles (""BEVs"") and utilities – providing insight into the ways Oncor can reliably provide the necessary infrastructure to support growth of electric vehicles across Texas. This effort represents the first collaboration of its kind between Oncor and an automotive original equipment manufacturer, and the first utility collaboration for Toyota around BEVs.Operational HighlightsFor the industry's primary benchmark for reliability, System Average Interruption Duration Index (non-storm), Oncor continued to improve in 2022 as compared to 2021. On average, Oncor's customers experienced three and a half fewer minutes of outage over the period – an improvement of approximately 4.5%. Oncor has undertaken various efforts to enhance reliability, including automation and system hardening projects, particularly in its planning for severe weather events. During the year, Oncor's service territory experienced significantly higher than normal summer temperatures. ERCOT's record peak demand was broken several times during the summer reaching a new all-time record peak demand of over 80,000 megawatts on July 20, 2022. In addition, 2022 winter weather was colder than normal, including the impacts of winter storms in February and December. The heat wave experienced during the summer and colder than normal weather in the winter months of 2022 demonstrates the continuing need for and effectiveness of system hardening projects.Oncor's service territory has already experienced a severe weather event in 2023, with winter storm Mara bringing several waves of freezing rain and up to 2 inches of ice accumulation to much of north, central and eastern Texas beginning on January 30. These conditions lasted for several days causing severe damage to trees and power facilities. Approximately 338,000 Oncor customers were without power for some period of time.  Even before the storm hit, Oncor pre-positioned personnel, equipment and other resources, and eventually brought in approximately 3,000 off-system resources to aid in restoration. Restoration efforts continued around the clock until restoration was essentially complete by February 4.Oncor's safety record also continued to improve in 2022 as its employee DART (Days Away from job or Restricted/Transferred duty) performance and Lost Time Incident performance, two primary industry benchmarks for safety, achieved top quartile and top decile, respectively, as compared to 2021 industry safety benchmarks.Oncor continued to be active on environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") matters in 2022, continuing its sustainable finance efforts by issuing $400 million of green bonds in May 2022. Proceeds from the green bonds are intended to be used to finance and/or refinance eligible green projects, which include transmission and distribution projects connecting renewable energy sources to the ERCOT grid, customer energy efficiency programs and deployment of automated metering infrastructure and smart grid technology. In June, Oncor released its expanded, third annual Corporate Sustainability Overview, which is available on Oncor's website at oncor.com under the Investor Relations section. In early October, an independent third party ESG ratings company improved its rating of Oncor, ranking Oncor in the top 3 percent of electric utilities then rated by that agency.Financial PlanCapital expenditures totaled $3.0 billion in 2022 in line with Oncor's previously announced 2022 capital plan. Oncor's management anticipates recommending to its board of directors capital expenditures of at least $3.0 billion for each of the years 2023 through 2027. Oncor's board of directors is expected to review a long-term financial plan in April 2023 (subject to receipt of a final order in the base rate review), and Oncor plans to announce a five-year capital plan following that board of directors review.LiquidityAs of February 27, 2023, Oncor's available liquidity, consisting of cash on hand and available credit facility and commercial paper program capacity, totaled approximately $2.1 billion. Oncor expects cash flows from operations combined with long-term debt issuances and borrowings under term loan credit agreements as well as availability under its credit facility and commercial paper program to be sufficient to fund current obligations, projected working capital requirements, maturities of long-term debt and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months.Sempra Internet Broadcast TodaySempra (NYSE: SRE) (BMV: SRE) will broadcast a live discussion of its earnings results over the Internet today at 12 p.m. ET, which will include discussion of 2022 results and other information relating to Oncor. Oncor Chief Executive Allen Nye will also participate in the broadcast. Access to the broadcast is available by registering on the Investors section of Sempra's website and clicking on the appropriate link. Prior to the conference call, an accompanying slide presentation will be posted on Sempra's Investors site.

The declared quarterly dividend represents an increase of the company's common stock dividend to $4.76 per share, on an annualized basis, from $4.58 per share in 2022.Story continuesAdditionally, Sempra's board of directors declared a semi-annual dividend of $24.375 per share on the company's 4.875% Fixed-Rate Reset Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C. The preferred stock dividends will be payable April 15, 2023, to preferred stock shareholders of record at the close of business on April 1, 2023.Track Record of Disciplined GrowthOver the last five years, Sempra has been successful in simplifying its business model and improving its position as a leader in some of North America's largest economic markets. Moreover, the company has increased the scope and scale of its three business platforms — Sempra California, Sempra Texas and Sempra Infrastructure. This has allowed the company to also increase its recurring cash flows and substantially improve its financial performance.Looking ahead, Sempra remains strategically focused on sustainable growth across its three business platforms underpinned by investments in energy infrastructure supporting electrification, lower carbon fuel sources and energy security in some of North America's leading markets. Across its various businesses, the company is pursuing a portfolio of opportunities to continue improving safety, bolstering reliability and supporting the delivery of increasingly clean and more affordable sources of energy.Sempra CaliforniaSempra California's San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. (SDG&amp;E) and Southern California Gas Co. (SoCalGas) achieved strong safety results in 2022 while continuing to enhance reliability and support California's ambitious clean energy goals. Throughout 2022, the utilities advanced strategic programs to better serve customers including modernizing their energy networks with a focus on safety, reliability and climate resiliency.SDG&amp;E is advancing state-of-the-art wildfire mitigation and resiliency solutions to further reinforce community fire safety and electric system hardening efforts in the San Diego region. The utility has now hardened 100% of transmission assets in its Tier 3 high-fire threat areas and continues to work toward hardening the remaining areas vulnerable to the threat of wildfires. These enhancements include the completion of the Cleveland National Forest fire hardening and safety project, a $700 million decade-long collaboration with local, state and federal agencies to improve the fire resistance of electric infrastructure throughout approximately 880 square miles of SDG&amp;E's service territory.SoCalGas achieved an important milestone for its Aspire 2045 strategy, receiving California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) approval to establish a memorandum account to track the costs of feasibility studies for its Angeles Link green hydrogen infrastructure proposal. The CPUC also directed SoCalGas to include this green hydrogen infrastructure system proposal as part of California's application to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for Hydrogen Hub federal funding.The ongoing general rate cases that SDG&amp;E and SoCalGas filed with the CPUC in the spring of 2022 establish the foundation for future growth of this platform, and a proposed decision is scheduled to be issued in the second quarter of 2024. SDG&amp;E and SoCalGas also received a final decision authorizing their cost of capital applications, which maintained their existing authorized equity layers and updated their costs of debt, and equity rates of return to 9.95% and 9.8%, respectively, for the 2023 through 2025 period, both subject to an existing adjustment mechanism.Sempra Texas In Texas, Oncor continues to demonstrate a strong commitment to safety and operational excellence while executing on its robust capital plan.Oncor advanced its operational execution in 2022, constructing new projects to support growth across Texas and increase reliability for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) market. The utility placed more than $1 billion of transmission projects into service in 2022, including placement of 13 new substations and 18 new switching stations into service and approximately 340 miles of new or upgraded high-voltage transmission lines. Additionally, in 2022, Oncor experienced a 53% increase in active generation and retail transmission interconnection requests. This strong momentum is driven by continued high demand for renewable energy and business growth across Oncor's service territory.In addition, Oncor recently announced a new Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) collaboration with Toyota Motor North America (Toyota) to study the impacts and benefits of V2G transactions on the grid. This V2G pilot project will examine the interconnectivity between Toyota battery electric vehicles (BEV's) and utilities, providing insight into the ways Oncor can reliably provide the necessary infrastructure to support growth of electric vehicles across Texas. This effort represents the first collaboration of its kind between Oncor and an automotive original equipment manufacturer and the first utility collaboration for Toyota around BEV's.Oncor continues to advance its base rate review with the Public Utility Commission of Texas and anticipates a final order to be issued around the end of the first quarter of 2023. Oncor's board of directors is expected to review a long-term financial plan following receipt of a final order in the base rate review.Sempra InfrastructureSempra Infrastructure is advancing its three integrated business lines — liquefied natural gas (LNG) and net-zero solutions, energy networks and clean power. With projects competitively positioned on both the Gulf and Pacific Coasts of North America, Sempra Infrastructure is assisting with energy security and decarbonization in North America and globally.Throughout 2022, Sempra Infrastructure achieved a number of key milestones. Cameron LNG Phase 1 continues to exceed original production expectations while unlocking efficiencies and achieving a strong safety record. The company also brought online the fuels terminal in Puebla, which is the sister terminal to the marine facility in Veracruz. At its Pacific Coast assets, Energía Sierra Juarez Phase 2 wind farm, with 108 megawatts of capacity, reached commercial operations and construction of the Energía Costa Azul LNG (ECA LNG) Phase 1 project continues to make substantial construction progress.Sempra Infrastructure continues to advance marketing efforts for its various LNG development projects to help meet global demand for U.S. LNG. The company recently completed the marketing phase for Phase 1 of the Port Arthur LNG development project, and it is now fully subscribed at 10.5 Mtpa of definitive, long-term contracts with top-tier counterparties. The company is targeting a final investment decision for Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 before the end of the first quarter of 2023.In addition, the Cameron LNG Phase 2 development project remains on track for completion of the competitive front-end engineering design process in the summer of this year. Additional opportunities for future investment include ECA LNG Phase 2 and Vista Pacífico LNG, both of which received DOE approval in December to export U.S.-sourced natural gas in the form of LNG from Mexico to non-Free Trade Agreement countries.Earnings GuidanceSempra is reaffirming its full-year 2023 earnings per common share (EPS) guidance range of $8.60 to $9.20. The company is also reiterating its long-term projected EPS compound annual growth rate of approximately 6% to 8% based on the midpoint of 2023 EPS guidance range.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresNon-GAAP financial measures include Sempra's adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS. See Table A for additional information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures.Internet BroadcastSempra will broadcast a live discussion of its earnings results over the internet today at 12 p.m. ET with the company's senior management.

These non-GAAP financial measures exclude significant items that are generally not related to our ongoing business activities and/or are infrequent in nature. These non-GAAP financial measures also exclude the impact from foreign currency and inflation effects on our monetary positions in Mexico and associated undesignated derivatives and unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives, which we expect to occur in future periods, and which can vary significantly from one period to the next. Exclusion of these items is useful to management and investors because it provides a meaningful comparison of the performance of Sempra's business operations to prior and future periods. Non-GAAP financial measures are supplementary information that should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 87% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Sempra. See our latest analysis for Sempra ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Sempra?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Sempra does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Sempra's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Sempra. The company's largest shareholder is BlackRock, Inc., with ownership of 9.5%. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 9.0% of common stock, and Capital Research and Management Company holds about 7.6% of the company stock.A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 12 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of SempraThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Sempra. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$20m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 13% stake in Sempra. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Sempra better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks for example - Sempra has   2 warning signs  (and 1 which is significant)  we think you should know about.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

Sempra Energy has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 6.88%, on average.Factors to NoteIn the fourth quarter, Sempra Energy’s service territories witnessed warmer-than-normal temperatures accompanied by drought conditions in most regions. Such weather patterns are likely to have boosted the electricity demand for cooling purposes among the company’s customers. This is expected to have contributed to revenues in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.However, its service territories experienced heavy snowfall during some time of the fourth quarter, which might have caused outage for its customers, thereby impacting the company’s overall fourth-quarter revenues.Sempra Energy Price and EPS SurpriseSempra Energy Price and EPS SurpriseSempra Energy price-eps-surprise | Sempra Energy QuoteMeanwhile, growing requests for transmission interconnections in Oncor, buoyed by growing demand and penetration of renewables in its service territory, are likely to have favorably impacted Sempra Energy’s fourth-quarter top line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $3.81 billion, indicating a 0.8% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.From the cost perspective, the heavy snowfall might have caused infrastructural damage for Sempra Energy, thereby increasing the company’s operating expenses to repair the damage. This might have hurt the fourth-quarter bottom line.Moreover, charges arising from final settlement of the 2015 Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility leak might have had an adverse impact on SRE’s fourth-quarter earnings.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.06 per share, indicating a 4.7% decline from the prior-year reported figure.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for SRE this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.Earnings ESP: The company’s Earnings ESP is +3.27%.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Sempra is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for SRE in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $2.13 per share for SRE, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.06 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for SRE, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +3.27% heading into earnings season.Sempra Energy Price and EPS SurpriseSempra Energy Price and EPS SurpriseSempra Energy price-eps-surprise | Sempra Energy QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Currently, Everest Re has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Cincinnati Financial has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that RE is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.RE currently has a forward P/E ratio of 8.55, while CINF has a forward P/E of 23.65. We also note that RE has a PEG ratio of 0.35. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. CINF currently has a PEG ratio of 1.34.Another notable valuation metric for RE is its P/B ratio of 1.79. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, CINF has a P/B of 1.81.Story continuesThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to RE's Value grade of A and CINF's Value grade of C.RE sticks out from CINF in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that RE is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Valero Energy with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Valero Energy How Fast Is Valero Energy Growing Its Earnings Per Share?Strong earnings per share (EPS) results are an indicator of a company achieving solid profits, which investors look upon favourably and so the share price tends to reflect great EPS performance. So a growing EPS generally brings attention to a company in the eyes of prospective investors. Commendations have to be given in seeing that Valero Energy grew its EPS from US$2.27 to US$30.94, in one short year. While it's difficult to sustain growth at that level, it bodes well for the company's outlook for the future. This could point to the business hitting a point of inflection.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. The music to the ears of Valero Energy shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 2.1% to 9.2% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. That's great to see, on both counts.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-historyOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Valero Energy.Are Valero Energy Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$50b company like Valero Energy. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$219m. This comes in at 0.4% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Should You Add Valero Energy To Your Watchlist?Valero Energy's earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. That sort of growth is nothing short of eye-catching, and the large investment held by insiders should certainly brighten the view of the company. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So at the surface level, Valero Energy is worth putting on your watchlist; after all, shareholders do well when the market underestimates fast growing companies. You should always think about risks though. Case in point, we've spotted   1 warning sign for Valero Energy  you should be aware of.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

According to Keith Fitz-Gerald, ""if the Fed wants to raise more aggressively, all of these huge traders that are leveraged up to their eyeballs are not gonna want to carry that because it costs them more money"".Keith Fitz-Gerald sees pressure into the second quarter of 2023 and he thinks that ""the Fed might have to admit that it was wrong about rates and labor as it was about transitory"".

Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”15. Verizon Communications Inc.

TTE is one of the world’s largest energy companies. It develops and produces oil and gas, produces and sells refined products, is one of the largest producers and traders of LNG, and owns a large portfolio of renewable power generating assets. TTE has one of the lowest cost portfolios of oil and gas assets and therefore one of the lowest breakeven points in the industry. It also has one of the best balance sheets in the industry. We estimate it will reach a net cash position sometime in 2023.The valuation of TTE—and that of Shell—is fascinating. TTE sells at approximately 4X earnings and has a 5% dividend yield. With its current buyback program and a recently announced special dividend, the owners yield is more than 10%. The valuation and owners yield are not dissimilar to those of Shell, which we also own and which trades at just under 5X earnings. To say that a discount is attached to European oil companies relative to US peers is an understatement. Exxon Mobil sells at 8X earnings, Chevron 9X and Conoco 8X. If TTE and Shell redomiciled to the US, their share prices would probably double.We have a few theories for the valuation anomaly. First, as mentioned above, Europe generally trades at a big discount to the US. In the case of TTE and Shell, this makes no economic sense. The oil and gas business is a global one, and TTE and Shell have attractive assets. The main explanation, we believe, is that large sections of the European asset management industry will not invest in oil and gas because of ESG restrictions. Yet if the recent war in Ukraine and the current energy crisis have shown us nothing else, the supply of energy is an enormous social good. Indeed, it is an existential good. Moreover, it is companies such as TTE that will invest billions to supply the LNG that Europe desperately needs to restore its economy and reduce the crushing cost burden on families who must now choose between heating their homes and eating. Finally, TTE is also investing billions per year in renewable power generating assets such as wind and solar. Such assets will likely never replace clean burning natural gas and nuclear as base power suppliers, but they are a valuable and clean adjunct to modern grids. We believe TTE’s renewable portfolio is worth between $25 billion and $35 billion and is moving from almost no profit contribution toward meaningful levels of profit over the next few years. We wonder how it makes sense for investors to disinvest from these kinds of assets on ethical grounds.”13.

Although Pfizer continues to report strong performance of its core drugs, sales of its COVID vaccine and treatment have likely peaked and sales are expected to decline going forward.

I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”10.

Despite the positives of higher interest rates and the company making good progress on reducing expenses and regulatory consent orders, Wells Fargo shares have fallen one-third from their highs earlier this year to roughly 6.5x our estimate of normalized earnings power, and the stock ended the quarter at ~1x next year’s tangible book value. We find this is far too cheap for a strong banking franchise capable of tangible returns in the low-to-mid teens across business cycles.”8.

The current company was formed through various mergers including NationsBank, FleetBoston, US Trust, Countrywide Financial, and Merrill Lynch with the legacy commercial bank to form a national banking powerhouse and bulge bracket investment firm. As one of the ‘Big Four’ U.S. banks it enjoys scale driven cost advantages and economies of scale which provide meaningful competitive advantages and potential for strong returns in the largely commoditized banking industry.

The stock is the seventh most profitable stock of the last 20 years.Here is what Diamond Hill Capital had to say about Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Most recently in Q4, we increased our energy exposure by reinitiating a position in a company we know well and have owned in the past, integrated oil and gas company Chevron Corporation(NYSE:CVX).We previously owned Chevron as recently as February 2022. We sold our position at that time due to heightened risk associated with operations in Kazakhstan, which sends oil through a pipeline that runs through Russia out to the Black Sea. When Russia invaded Ukraine, we believed there was real risk that something would happen to inhibit Chevron’s ability to get that oil to the market. We didn’t believe that risk was reflected in the stock price, so we sold our position. Today, 10+ months into the Ukraine crisis, more information has become available regarding the Kazakhstan operations, and the associated risks are now well-known. We believe those risks are fully priced into the current stock valuation. Chevron is one of the best operators in its field, with a diversified portfolio and strong management, and we took the opportunity to reinvest when the stock was trading below our estimate of intrinsic value.”6.

344,4fba84b4-aff5-3042-8672-d74bba3ea4bc,UNH,2023-02-28,Investors Heavily Search UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-unitedhealth-group-140002531.html,1677506402,STORY,['UNH'],"[UnitedHealth Group (UNH) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this largest U.S. health insurer have returned -0.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1% change. The Zacks Medical - HMOs industry, to which UnitedHealth belongs, has lost 1.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, UnitedHealth is expected to post earnings of $6.23 per share, indicating a change of +13.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $24.91 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +12.3%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.22 indicates a change of +13.3% from what UnitedHealth is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for UnitedHealth.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for UNH _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For UnitedHealth, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $89.31 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +11.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $358.97 billion and $383.77 billion estimates indicate +10.7% and +6.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUnitedHealth reported revenues of $82.79 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.3%. EPS of $5.34 for the same period compares with $4.48 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $82.79 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of 0%. The EPS surprise was +3.29%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.UnitedHealth is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about UnitedHealth. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The sell-off on Friday was not a result of inflation, and was instead a result of ""the amount of leverage that's being carried"", noted Fitz-Gerald. According to Keith Fitz-Gerald, ""if the Fed wants to raise more aggressively, all of these huge traders that are leveraged up to their eyeballs are not gonna want to carry that because it costs them more money"".Keith Fitz-Gerald sees pressure into the second quarter of 2023 and he thinks that ""the Fed might have to admit that it was wrong about rates and labor as it was about transitory"".

We like the company’s track record of innovation, and its diversified portfolio of drugs. However, we’ve become increasingly concerned about the outlook for some of its recently launched therapeutics, as well as some generic competition in a few of its mature drugs. If pressed, we still like the odds that Novartis will do well, but the outlook is a little cloudier than it’s been in a while. As noted above, we’ve been big fans of its Alcon unit for many years, and now that Alcon is independent, we decided to concentrate our investment there.”17.

Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”15. Verizon Communications Inc.

TTE is one of the world’s largest energy companies. It develops and produces oil and gas, produces and sells refined products, is one of the largest producers and traders of LNG, and owns a large portfolio of renewable power generating assets. TTE has one of the lowest cost portfolios of oil and gas assets and therefore one of the lowest breakeven points in the industry. It also has one of the best balance sheets in the industry. We estimate it will reach a net cash position sometime in 2023.The valuation of TTE—and that of Shell—is fascinating. TTE sells at approximately 4X earnings and has a 5% dividend yield. With its current buyback program and a recently announced special dividend, the owners yield is more than 10%. The valuation and owners yield are not dissimilar to those of Shell, which we also own and which trades at just under 5X earnings. To say that a discount is attached to European oil companies relative to US peers is an understatement. Exxon Mobil sells at 8X earnings, Chevron 9X and Conoco 8X. If TTE and Shell redomiciled to the US, their share prices would probably double.We have a few theories for the valuation anomaly. First, as mentioned above, Europe generally trades at a big discount to the US. In the case of TTE and Shell, this makes no economic sense. The oil and gas business is a global one, and TTE and Shell have attractive assets. The main explanation, we believe, is that large sections of the European asset management industry will not invest in oil and gas because of ESG restrictions. Yet if the recent war in Ukraine and the current energy crisis have shown us nothing else, the supply of energy is an enormous social good. Indeed, it is an existential good. Moreover, it is companies such as TTE that will invest billions to supply the LNG that Europe desperately needs to restore its economy and reduce the crushing cost burden on families who must now choose between heating their homes and eating. Finally, TTE is also investing billions per year in renewable power generating assets such as wind and solar. Such assets will likely never replace clean burning natural gas and nuclear as base power suppliers, but they are a valuable and clean adjunct to modern grids. We believe TTE’s renewable portfolio is worth between $25 billion and $35 billion and is moving from almost no profit contribution toward meaningful levels of profit over the next few years. We wonder how it makes sense for investors to disinvest from these kinds of assets on ethical grounds.”13.

(NYSE:PFE), media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG). Although Pfizer continues to report strong performance of its core drugs, sales of its COVID vaccine and treatment have likely peaked and sales are expected to decline going forward.

(NYSE:WMT) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”10.

Despite the positives of higher interest rates and the company making good progress on reducing expenses and regulatory consent orders, Wells Fargo shares have fallen one-third from their highs earlier this year to roughly 6.5x our estimate of normalized earnings power, and the stock ended the quarter at ~1x next year’s tangible book value. We find this is far too cheap for a strong banking franchise capable of tangible returns in the low-to-mid teens across business cycles.”8.

The current company was formed through various mergers including NationsBank, FleetBoston, US Trust, Countrywide Financial, and Merrill Lynch with the legacy commercial bank to form a national banking powerhouse and bulge bracket investment firm. As one of the ‘Big Four’ U.S. banks it enjoys scale driven cost advantages and economies of scale which provide meaningful competitive advantages and potential for strong returns in the largely commoditized banking industry. A survivor of the financial crisis, BAC has emerged with a solid capital base and stands to benefit from a rising interest rate environment.”7.

The stock is the seventh most profitable stock of the last 20 years.Here is what Diamond Hill Capital had to say about Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Most recently in Q4, we increased our energy exposure by reinitiating a position in a company we know well and have owned in the past, integrated oil and gas company Chevron Corporation(NYSE:CVX).We previously owned Chevron as recently as February 2022. We sold our position at that time due to heightened risk associated with operations in Kazakhstan, which sends oil through a pipeline that runs through Russia out to the Black Sea. When Russia invaded Ukraine, we believed there was real risk that something would happen to inhibit Chevron’s ability to get that oil to the market. We didn’t believe that risk was reflected in the stock price, so we sold our position. Today, 10+ months into the Ukraine crisis, more information has become available regarding the Kazakhstan operations, and the associated risks are now well-known. We believe those risks are fully priced into the current stock valuation. Chevron is one of the best operators in its field, with a diversified portfolio and strong management, and we took the opportunity to reinvest when the stock was trading below our estimate of intrinsic value.”6.

Eaton joins 11 other members in the project consortium, which is coordinated by RWTH Aachen University and includes academic partners, as well as other companies, industry associations and standards organizations.The mass adoption of energy storage is vital to enabling Europe's energy transition, and this demands both standardization and interoperability. To maximize benefits for operators, vendors, suppliers and end users, energy storage equipment and systems must be able to communicate seamlessly, irrespective of their age or manufacturer. To this end, the InterSTORE project aims to achieve four key goals:Provide four open-source software tools for assuring interoperability, flexibility and data standardization;Consider all relevant aspects of the flexible use of hybrid energy storage systems in four principal areas of application (electric vehicles, industrial, residential and commercial);Demonstrate seven high-impact use cases in four real-life laboratories;Deploy beyond state-of-the-art methods to enable hybridization, utilization and monetization of flexible storage, while also ensuring standardization across the data space.""The sun doesn't always shine and the wind doesn't always blow-so widespread energy storage is vital to Europe's successful transition to renewables and the electrification of everything,"" says Dominik Laska, director, Eaton European Innovation Center. ""However, today's solutions are very diverse and often incompatible. To enable widescale adoption, we need a unified approach to energy storage management. I'm delighted we're joining forces with our expert InterSTORE partners to help develop an innovative and agnostic solution that can support third-party software or hardware and so deliver a significant real-world impact.""Story continuesCurrently, Eaton's Energy Management System (EMS) is designed to optimize GreenMotion EV chargers, xStorage Compact battery packs, and photovoltaic panels. As part of the InterSTORE consortium, Eaton will work with other EMS providers to identify differences and synergies between their solutions. Novel optimization concepts will then be developed and incorporated to enable the integration of different types of energy storage, such as heat pumps and electrolyzers. Eaton's concepts and control algorithms will also be validated and demonstrated at the Forschungszentrum Jülich research institute.""As a member of the InterSTORE project, our goal is to create seamless solutions that can support multiple types of energy storage, while also building a rock-solid commercial case for mass adoption,"" says Anne Lillywhite, senior vice president and general manager, Energy Transition, Digital &amp; Services, Electrical Sector, EMEA. ""Our engineers will develop a toolkit for EMS interoperability, as well as a deeper understanding of user requirements and possible business models. In today's environment of rising energy prices, tighter emissions regulation, and increasingly eco-conscious consumers, this is a fantastic opportunity to pioneer crucial new technologies that will contribute to decarbonization and a more sustainable future.""Eaton is an intelligent power management company dedicated to improving the quality of life and protecting the environment for people everywhere. We are guided by our commitment to do business right, to operate sustainably and to help our customers manage power ─ today and well into the future.

357,a625b643-526d-3fc0-ab89-91a076abf1cf,SHW,2023-02-28,Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW) shareholders have earned a 12% CAGR over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sherwin-williams-nyse-shw-shareholders-120029889.html,1677585629,STORY,['SHW'],"[It hasn't been the best quarter for The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) shareholders, since the share price has fallen 11% in that time. While that's not great, the returns over five years have been decent. The share price is up 66%, which is better than the market return of 56%.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. View our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, Sherwin-Williams managed to grow its earnings per share at 4.4% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 11% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Sherwin-Williams' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Sherwin-Williams, it has a TSR of 74% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 8.3% in the twelve months, Sherwin-Williams shareholders did even worse, losing 12% (even including dividends). However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 12% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Sherwin-Williams .Sherwin-Williams is not the only stock that insiders are buying.

This compares to earnings of $2.95 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 2.03%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this hospital and health facility operator would post earnings of $2.40 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.54, delivering a surprise of 5.83%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Universal Health Services , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Hospital industry, posted revenues of $3.45 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.30%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.28 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Universal Health Services shares have added about 4.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 3.4%.What's Next for Universal Health Services?While Universal Health Services has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Universal Health Services: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $2.57 on $3.45 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $10.63 on $13.94 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Medical - Hospital is currently in the bottom 29% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the broader Zacks Medical sector, TG Therapeutics (TGTX), has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2022. The results are expected to be released on February 28.This biopharmaceutical company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.26 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +62.9%.

In February of 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a $1.4 billion increase to the program. As of December 31, 2022, we had an aggregate available repurchase authorization of approximately $947 million.Pursuant to the terms of our stock repurchase program, shares of our Class B Common Stock may be repurchased, from time to time as conditions allow, on the open market or in negotiated private transactions.

During the full year of 2022, we have repurchased approximately 6.67 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $810.9 million (approximately $122 per share) pursuant to the program.Provision for Asset Impairment:Our financial statements for the three and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2022, include a pre-tax provision for asset impairment of $57.6 million, which is included in other operating expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of income, to write-down the asset value of Desert Springs Hospital Medical Center, a 282-bed acute care hospital located in Las Vegas, Nevada. In early 2023, as a result of various competitive pressures and operational challenges experienced in the market, which had a significant unfavorable impact on the hospital's results of operations during the past year, as well as physical plant constraints and limitations resulting from the advanced age of the facility (which opened in 1971), we announced plans to discontinue all inpatient operations by March of 2023. During the next two years, we plan to continue providing emergency department services within a portion of the existing facility while we construct a new free-standing emergency department on the hospital's campus. The provision for asset impairment reduced the asset values of the facility's real estate and equipment to their estimated fair values.2023 Operating Results Forecast:Reflected below is our 2023 guidance range for consolidated net revenues, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation &amp; amortization, and the impacts of other income/expense and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (""Adjusted EBITDA net of NCI""), adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share (""Adjusted EPS-diluted"") and capital expenditures.Adjusted EPS-diluted and Adjusted EBITDA net of NCI, are non-GAAP financial measures and should be examined in connection with net income determined in accordance with GAAP as presented in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in this report or in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including our Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Growing steadily since our inception into an esteemed Fortune 500 corporation, our annual revenues during 2022 were approximately $13.4 billion. UHS ranked #297 on the Fortune 500; and #391 on Forbes' list of America's Largest Public Companies. UHS was again recognized as one of the World's Most Admired Companies by Fortune.Our operating philosophy is as effective today as it was upon the Company's founding in 1979, enabling us to provide compassionate care to our patients and their loved ones. Our strategy includes building or acquiring high quality hospitals in rapidly growing markets, investing in the people and equipment needed to allow each facility to thrive, and becoming the leading healthcare provider in each community we serve.Headquartered in King of Prussia, PA, UHS has approximately 93,800 employees and, through its subsidiaries, operates 28 inpatient acute care hospitals, 331 inpatient behavioral health facilities, 39 outpatient facilities and ambulatory care access points, an insurance offering, a physician network and various related services located in 39 states, Washington, D.C., the United Kingdom and Puerto Rico. It acts as the advisor to Universal Health Realty Income Trust, a real estate investment trust (NYSE:UHT). For additional information visit www.uhs.com.This press release contains forward-looking statements based on current management expectations. Numerous factors, including those disclosed herein, those related to the anticipated impact of COVID-19 on our operations and financial results, those related to healthcare industry trends and those detailed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (as set forth in Item 1A-Risk Factors and in Item 7-Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022), may cause the results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and therefore actual results may differ materially. Readers should not place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements which reflect management's view only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, or to make any other forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.Many of the factors that could affect our future results are beyond our control or ability to predict, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which began during the second half of March, 2020, has had a material effect on our operations and financial results since that time. The length and extent of the disruptions caused by the COVID–19 pandemic are currently unknown; however, we expect such disruptions to continue into the future. Since the future volumes and severity of COVID-19 patients remain highly uncertain and subject to change, including potential increases in future COVID-19 patient volumes caused by new variants of the virus, as well as related pressures on staffing and wage rates, we are not able to fully quantify the impact that these factors will have on our future financial results. However, future developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to materially affect our financial performance.The nationwide shortage of nurses and other clinical staff and support personnel has been a significant operating issue facing us and other healthcare providers. Like others in the healthcare industry, we continue to experience a shortage of nurses and other clinical staff and support personnel at our acute care and behavioral health care hospitals in many geographic areas. In some areas, the labor scarcity is putting a strain on our resources and staff, which has required us to utilize higher–cost temporary labor and pay premiums above standard compensation for essential workers. This staffing shortage has required us to hire expensive temporary personnel and/or enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other clinical staff and support personnel. At certain facilities, particularly within our behavioral health care segment, we have been unable to fill all vacant positions and, consequently, have been required to limit patient volumes. These factors, which had a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations during 2022, could continue to have an unfavorable material impact on our results of operations for the foreseeable future.In addition, the increase in interest rates has substantially increased our borrowings costs and reduced our ability to access the capital markets on favorable terms. Additional increases in interest rates could have a significant unfavorable impact on our future results of operations and the resulting effect on the capital markets could adversely affect our ability to carry out our strategy.We believe that adjusted net income attributable to UHS, adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share, EBITDA net of NCI and Adjusted EBITDA net of NCI, which are non-GAAP financial measures (""GAAP"" is Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America), are helpful to our investors as measures of our operating performance. In addition, we believe that, when applicable, comparing and discussing our financial results based on these measures, as calculated, is helpful to our investors since it neutralizes the effect of material items impacting our net income attributable to UHS, such as, changes in the market value of shares of certain equity securities and other potential material items that are nonrecurring or non-operational in nature including, but not limited to, impairments of goodwill and long-lived and intangible assets, reserves for various matters including settlements, legal judgments and lawsuits, costs related to extinguishment of debt, gains/losses on sales of assets and businesses, and other amounts that may be reflected in the current or prior year financial statements that relate to prior periods. To obtain a complete understanding of our financial performance these measures should be examined in connection with net income attributable to UHS, as determined in accordance with GAAP, and as presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in this report or in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including our Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Since the items included or excluded from these measures are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance under GAAP, these measures should not be considered to be alternatives to net income as a measure of our operating performance or profitability. Since these measures, as presented, are not determined in accordance with GAAP and are thus susceptible to varying calculations, they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Investors are encouraged to use GAAP measures when evaluating our financial performance.Universal Health Services, Inc.Consolidated Statements of Income(in thousands, except per share amounts)(unaudited)Three monthsTwelve monthsended December 31,ended December 31,2022202120222021Net revenues$3,446,980$3,275,251$13,399,370$12,642,117Operating charges: Salaries, wages and benefits1,701,0831,621,7886,762,2566,163,944 Other operating expenses919,673802,2793,445,7333,035,869 Supplies expense381,936374,1571,474,3391,427,134 Depreciation and amortization148,353133,363581,861533,213 Lease and rental expense34,55130,015131,626118,8633,185,5962,961,60212,395,81511,279,023Income from operations261,384313,6491,003,5551,363,094Interest expense, net43,88719,217126,88983,672Other (income) expense, net(4,838)(12,316)10,406(13,891)Income before income taxes222,335306,748866,2601,293,313Provision for income taxes51,96672,837209,278305,681Net income170,369233,911656,982987,632Less: Net income (loss) attributable tononcontrolling interests (""NCI"")(4,451)(5,213)(18,627)(3,958)Net income attributable to UHS$174,820$239,124$675,609$991,590Basic earnings per share attributable to UHS (a)$2.45$3.03$9.23$11.99Diluted earnings per share attributable to UHS (a)$2.43$3.00$9.14$11.82Universal Health Services, Inc.Footnotes to Consolidated Statements of Income(in thousands, except per share amounts)(unaudited)Three monthsTwelve months(a) Earnings per share calculation:ended December 31,ended December 31,2022202120222021Basic and diluted:Net income attributable to UHS$174,820$239,124$675,609$991,590Less: Net income attributable to unvested restricted share grants(156)(450)(748)(2,059)Net income attributable to UHS - basic and diluted$174,664$238,674$674,861$989,531Weighted average number of common shares - basic71,16578,80873,11882,519Basic earnings per share attributable to UHS:$2.45$3.03$9.23$11.99Weighted average number of common shares71,16578,80873,11882,519Add: Other share equivalents6278677141,173Weighted average number of common shares and equiv. - diluted71,79279,67573,83283,692Diluted earnings per share attributable to UHS:$2.43$3.00$9.14$11.82Universal Health Services, Inc.Schedule of Non-GAAP Supplemental Information ...]"

364,f414855f-7f9f-30e5-9bf9-e2081a8b3cd6,FCX,2023-02-28,3 Non Ferrous Metal Mining Stocks to Watch in a Challenging Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-non-ferrous-metal-mining-143602533.html,1677508562,STORY,"['GC=F', 'HG=F', 'SI=F', 'FCX', 'SCCO', 'CDE', '^GSPC']","[The prospects of the Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry look bleak, as apprehensions about slowing demand in China and economic activity have been weighing down commodity prices. Additionally, the industry players are grappling with inflated input costs, particularly energy, and labor shortages and supply-chain issues.Against this backdrop, we suggest keeping a close eye on companies like Freeport-McMoRan Inc. FCX, Southern Copper Corporation SCCO and Coeur Mining CDE. These companies are poised to gain from their endeavors to build reserves and control costs, while investing in technology and improving production efficiency.About the IndustryThe Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry comprises companies that produce non-ferrous metals, including copper, gold, silver, cobalt, molybdenum, zinc, aluminum and uranium. These metals are utilized by various industries, including aerospace, automotive, packaging, construction, machinery, electronics, transportation, jewelry, chemical and nuclear energy. Mining is a long, complex and capital-intensive process. Significant exploration and development to evaluate the size of the deposit, followed by the assessment of ways to extract and process the ore efficiently, safely and responsibly, precede actual mining. The miners continually search for opportunities to grow their reserves and resources through targeted near-mine exploration and business development. They strive to upgrade and improve the quality of their existing assets, internally, as well as through acquisitions.What's Shaping the Future of the Mining-Non Ferrous Industry?Fears of Rate Hikes, Weak Demand in China Hurt Prices: Copper prices have declined for the major part of 2022 due to varied reasons — the uncertainties surrounding the global economy, resurgent COVID-19 outbreaks in top consumer China, the Russia-Ukraine situation, the spike in energy costs and low global inventories. Zinc and nickel prices were also weighed down by worries about weak demand as COVID-19 lockdowns in China stoked concerns over a global recession. Gold and silver prices had also been negatively impacted, owing to a stronger U.S. dollar, rising interest rates and sluggish growth. Recently, stronger-than-expected U.S. economic data has fueled expectations of further monetary tightening from the Federal Reserve, which, in turn, has impacted commodity prices. Also, demand has been lower than expected in China, which is impacting prices. Slower-than-expected demand recovery following the Lunar New Year holiday in China has been impacting metal prices.Cost Control &amp; Innovation to Increase Efficiency: The industry has been facing a shortage of skilled workforce to date, which hiked wages. Labor-related disputes can be damaging to production and revenues. The industry players are grappling with escalating production costs, including electricity, water and materials, as well as higher freight expenses and supply-chain issues. Since the industry cannot control the prices of its products, it focuses on improving sales volume, increasing operating cash flow and lowering unit net cash costs. The industry participants are opting for alternate energy sources to minimize fuel-price volatility and secure supply. Miners are now committed to cost-reduction strategies and digital innovation to drive operating efficiencies. Demand and Supply Imbalance to Eventually Support Prices: The industry players are dealing with depleting resources, declining supply in old mines and a lack of new mines. Development projects are inherently risky and capital-intensive. Demand for non-ferrous metals will remain high in the future, given their wide use in primary sectors, including transportation, electricity, construction, telecommunication, energy, information technology and materials. The demand for electric vehicles and renewable energy is expected to be a significant growth driver for metals like copper and nickel in the years to come. The plan to overhaul and upgrade the nation’s infrastructure and promote green policies per the U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will require a huge amount of non-ferrous metals. While demand remains strong, there will be an eventual deficit in metal supply, leading to a situation that will bolster metal prices. This, in turn, would favor the industry in the long haul.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Weak ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates a gloomy near term. The Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry, a 12-stock group within the broader Zacks Basic Materials Sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #189, which places it in the bottom 24% of 251 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Since the beginning of this year, the industry’s earnings estimates for the current year have moved down 27%.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and its valuation picture.Industry Versus Broader MarketThe Zacks Mining- Non Ferrous Industry has outperformed its sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past 12 months. The stocks in this industry have collectively gained 6% in the past year compared with the Zacks Basic Materials sector’s decline of 6.1%. The S&amp;P 500 has dipped 10.9% in the said time frame.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationBased on the forward 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio, a commonly used multiple for valuing Mining- Non Ferrous stocks, we see that the industry is currently trading at 8.14X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 19.71X. The Basic Materials sector’s trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA is at 6.88X. This is shown in the charts below.Enterprise Value/EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) Ratio (F12M)Enterprise Value/EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) Ratio (F12M)Over the last five years, the industry traded as high as 8.88X and as low as 4.80X, with the median being at 5.95X.3 Mining-Non Ferrous Stocks to Keep an Eye onCoeur Mining:  Over the past five years, CDE has invested around $245 million in exploration investment, which has resulted in peer-leading reserve and resource growth, and longer mine lives. Backed by these efforts, on a gold-equivalent basis, reserves have increased 34% net of depletion, measured and indicated resources have grown by 80%, and inferred resources have expanded 26% since 2017. CDE’s exploration investments remain focused on generating attractive returns from near-term priorities, including mine life extensions at Kensington, which was achieved in 2022. Resource growth at the high-grade Silvertip project in British Columbia, and additional enhancements to Rochester’s reserve and resource pipeline will also aid growth. Construction at Rochester is scheduled to be completed by mid-year 2023. The sale of Crown Sterling holdings completed last year is consistent with Coeur Mining’s strategy of monetizing non-core assets and prioritizing high-return growth from its North American asset portfolio. CDE shares have gained 3.1% over the past six months.This Chicago, IL-based company explores, develops, and produces gold, silver, zinc and lead properties with five operations in the United States, Mexico and Canada. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal 2023 earnings indicates year-over-year growth of 50%. The estimate has been unchanged over the past 60 days. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Price &amp; Consensus: CDEFreeport-McMoRan: FCX’s exploration activities near existing mines, which are focused on expanding reserves, will drive growth. It is expected to benefit from the ongoing large-scale concentrator expansion project at Cerro Verde that will likely result in incremental annual productions of 600 million pounds of copper and 15 million pounds of molybdenum. Cerro Verde's expanded operations will also offer cost efficiencies, and large-scale and long-lived reserves.  It is assessing a large-scale milling operation at El Abra to process additional sulfide material. The expansion at Morenci increased milling rates. The Lone Star project in eastern Arizona has been completed and is on track to produce more than 200 million pounds of copper annually. The company is looking to advance studies for potential expansions and long-term development options for its large-scale sulfide resources at Lone Star. It is also ramping up underground production at Grasberg in Indonesia, resulting in a spike in milling rates. The focus on cost management and reduction of debt levels is commendable. Shares of FCX have gained 27% over the past six months.Based in Phoenix, AZ, Freeport-McMoRan is engaged in mineral exploration and development; mining and milling of copper, gold, molybdenum and silver; and smelting and refining copper concentrates. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FCX’s earnings for 2023 has moved up 18% over the past 90 days. FCX has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 1.1%, on average. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Price &amp; Consensus: FCXSouthern Copper: The company has the largest copper reserves in the industry and operates world-class assets in investment-grade countries, such as Mexico and Peru. Its constant focus on increasing low-cost production is commendable. SCCO expects copper production in 2023 to reach 926,000 tons, with the Peruvian production coming back on track, and new production at Pilares, El Pilar and Buenavista. The company’s capital investment program for this decade exceeds $15 billion and includes investments at the Buenavista Zinc, Pilares, El Pilar and El Arco projects in Mexico and at the Tia Maria, Los Chancas and Michiquillay projects in Peru. It will gain from its efforts to grow in Peru, given that the country is currently the second-largest producer of copper globally and holds 13% of the world’s copper reserves. The company's shares have gained 43% in the past six months.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Phoenix, AZ-based company’s fiscal 2023 earnings has been revised upward by 11.8% over the past 60 days. SCCO has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 7%, on average. The company, which engages in mining, exploring, smelting, and refining copper and other minerals, currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Price &amp; Consensus: SCCOWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Consequently, intuitional investors still play a huge role in determining the fate of stocks. So when retail investors are looking for stocks to buy, they should remember that names that institutional investors favor have a much higher chance of succeeding than the stocks with which the “big money” is not very enamored.As a result, it’s quite valuable to know which stocks institutional investors are rushing to buy.

Alliant Energy also granted each of the initial purchasers of the convertible notes an option to purchase, within a 13-day period from, and including, the date on which the convertible notes are first issued, up to an additional $75 million aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes. The sale of the convertible notes is expected to close on March 2, 2023, subject to customary closing conditions.Alliant Energy expects that the net proceeds from the convertible notes will be approximately $490.9 million (or $564.6 million if the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional convertible notes in full), after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by Alliant Energy. Alliant Energy intends to use the net proceeds from the offering of the convertible notes for general corporate purposes, which may include repayment or refinancing of debt, working capital, construction and acquisition expenditures, investments and repurchases and redemptions of securities.The convertible notes will be senior unsecured obligations of Alliant Energy, and will mature on March 15, 2026, unless earlier converted or repurchased in accordance with their terms. The convertible notes will bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.875% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2023.Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding December 15, 2025, the convertible notes will be convertible at the option of the holders only under certain conditions.On or after December 15, 2025, until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders of the convertible notes may convert all or any portion of their convertible notes at their option at any time at the conversion rate then in effect, irrespective of these conditions. Alliant Energy will settle conversions of the convertible notes by paying cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes to be converted and paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of its common stock, $0.01 par value per share, or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at its election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of its conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes being converted.Story continuesThe conversion rate for the convertible notes will initially be 15.5461 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of convertible notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $64.32 per share of common stock). The initial conversion price of the convertible notes represents a premium of approximately 25% over the last reported sale price of Alliant Energy’s common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on February 27, 2023. The conversion rate and the corresponding conversion price will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. Alliant Energy may not redeem the convertible notes prior to the maturity date.If Alliant Energy undergoes a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture that will govern the convertible notes), subject to certain conditions, holders of the convertible notes may require Alliant Energy to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their convertible notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the convertible notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date (as defined in the indenture that will govern the convertible notes). In addition, if certain fundamental changes occur, Alliant Energy may be required, in certain circumstances, to increase the conversion rate for any convertible notes converted in connection with such fundamental changes by a specified number of shares of its common stock.The offering is being made to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Any offers of the convertible notes will be made only by means of a private offering memorandum.

This is not good as insiders invest based on expectations that their money will appreciate over time. However, as a result of recent losses, their original investment is now worth only US$62k.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Alliant Energy Alliant Energy Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Independent Director Nancy Falotico for US$73k worth of shares, at about US$61.00 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, even at a higher price than the current share price (being US$51.46). Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares. Generally speaking, it catches our eye when an insider has purchased shares at above current prices, as it suggests they believed the shares were worth buying, even at a higher price. Nancy Falotico was the only individual insider to buy during the last year.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year.

So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.Does Alliant Energy Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Alliant Energy insiders own about US$19m worth of shares. That equates to 0.1% of the company. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Alliant Energy Insiders?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Alliant Energy shares in the last quarter. On a brighter note, the transactions over the last year are encouraging. Insiders own shares in Alliant Energy and we see no evidence to suggest they are worried about the future. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Alliant Energy.

Check out our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Independent Director, Arthur Ryan, for US$4.3m worth of shares, at about US$622 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$758. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. This single sale was just 26% of Arthur Ryan's stake. Arthur Ryan was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

It's great to see that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals insiders own 4.2% of the company, worth about US$3.4b.

370,52de7e91-5ad3-341b-a707-ab0bd994122f,REGN,2023-02-28,Top 10 Drug Companies in USA and Their China Reliance,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-10-drug-companies-usa-211157534.html,1677532317,STORY,"['REGN', 'LLY', 'ABT', 'GILD', 'AMGN', 'JNJ', 'PFE', 'ABBV']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the top 10 drug companies in USA and their China reliance. To skip our detailed analysis of the pharmaceutical sector, you can go directly to see the Top 5 Drug Companies in USA and Their China Reliance.The US has long been reliant on China for the upkeep of several industries. The most notable of these industries are the semiconductor and healthcare sectors. With the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, America's widespread reliance on China became increasingly evident because of a sharper light being shed on US-Chinese manufacturing and supply chains. With the pandemic first breaking out in China and reducing exports from the Asian country to others, shortages of critical medical supplies in the US made the latter's heavy reliance on the former clearer than ever.Top US drug producers such as Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) were found to be just as heavily reliant on China as smaller medical companies. Many American drug companies have manufacturing and supply chain infrastructure set up in China, causing this reliance. According to a report published by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean in  2021, the US imported about $105.32 billion worth of medical products and equipment, including medical imaging, diagnostic, and oxygen therapy equipment, in 2019 alone. China was recorded as the second-largest supplier of these products and equipment. During the first nine months of 2020, pharmaceutical imports from China to the US increased by 46%, with 69% of the imports being active pharmaceutical ingredients and 27% of the imports being pharmaceutical preparation products.President Biden has been taking steps to curb the US reliance on China when it comes to the healthcare sector and elsewhere. In September 2022, Biden signed an executive order to boost domestic manufacturing in the biotech sector to increase American self-sufficiency in this area. However, it is unclear how this objective can be attained since China is a major manufacturer of active pharmaceutical ingredients to India, which is conversely a major supplier of generic drugs to the US. Ever since China acceded to the World Trade Organization in 2001, it began focusing on economic growth through the expansion of its pharmaceutical industry. As a result of this, the country devoted itself to producing basic chemicals and active pharmaceutical ingredients. Consequently, it is unsurprising that the country today is a lead supplier of these ingredients by volume in the global market. In some markets specifically, China has increased its share of the US import markets. For instance, the market for penicillin saw an increase in the Chinese share from 1% to 51%, while the antibiotics market saw an increase of the country's share from 15% to 37%. This increase occurred over the 10 years preceding 2021. As the situation currently stands, it will be difficult for the US to disengage itself from the Chinese manufacturing and supply chain infrastructure. Hence, many major American companies have a huge stake in the Chinese pharmaceutical market, leading to their increased presence in the country.Story continuesTop 10 Drug Companies in USA and Their China ReliancePhoto by Christina Victoria Craft on UnsplashLet's now take a look at the top 10 drug companies in USA and their China reliance.Our MethodologyWe have selected pharmaceutical companies in the US with the highest revenues in the sector as of 2021 and a strong reliance on China. They are ranked based on these revenues, from the lowest to the highest. These companies are heavily reliant on China since they source a variety of their raw materials from the country. They also have a large presence in the Chinese market, making China one of their most profitable consumer markets to date. We have also mentioned analyst price targets and ratings for the stocks of these companies. In our list below, we go over key business fundamentals for these companies as well, such as their latest profit margins.Top Drug Companies in USA and Their China Reliance10. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN)Total Revenue in 2021: $16.07 billionRegeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) specializes in developing and commercializing drugs for the treatment of medical conditions such as cancer, eye diseases, and inflammatory disorders. Its top-selling drugs include Dupixent and Eylea.On January 31, Tyler Van Buren at Cowen upgraded Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) shares from Market Perform to Outperform. The analyst also placed an $875 price target on the stock.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) expects its Dupixent sales to reach almost $11 billion in 2023, representing an increase of about 30% compared to 2022 numbers. Dupixent is one of the company's top products recently approved in China for adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. This approval will likely increase Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:REGN) Dupixent sales significantly, making the company heavily reliant on continued Chinese use and approval.Bronte Capital, an investment management company, mentioned Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“There have been some bright spots in our long book. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN), a major position and a stock we wrote up in our June 2021 letter, has been one of the best performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 this year. Alas it has not been enough to offset some of our weaker stocks, let alone our overweight exposure to the UK (and Europe) which have suffered from both stock and currency weakness. We do not think we are bad at picking stocks on the long side and hope – reasonably we think – for better relative results in the future. Prior to COVID, our longs were markedly better than the index. Unfortunately, if you look at our long book this quarter and since the onset of the COVID pandemic, there is scant evidence that we have added any value by picking stocks to go long.”9. Amgen, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN)Total Revenue in 2021: $25.98 billionAmgen, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) is a biopharmaceutical company based in Thousand Oaks, California. Its top-selling drugs include Neulasta, Enbrel, and Prolia.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) is heavily reliant on its manufacturing facilities in China, where some of its top-selling drugs are produced. These include Enbrel, a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, and Prolia, a treatment for osteoporosis.8. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD)Total Revenue in 2021: $27.31 billionGilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) is a biopharmaceutical company that specializes in the development and commercialization of medicines for various diseases. It was founded in 1987 and is headquartered in Foster City, California.

The company also has a manufacturing and supply chain infrastructure established in the country for efficient production and distribution of its drugs.Ariel Investments, an investment management company, mentioned Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“At the stock level, biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) was the top contributor in the quarter based on positive data released in a study evaluating Trodelvy versus comparative chemotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer. The detailed findings increased investor confidence the drug would receive incremental approvals for a broader range of breast cancer treatments. Shares also received a boost on news the TAF patent portfolio for HIV drugs will be extended from the middle of this decade through the early 2030s, thereby lengthening the company’s long-term opportunity in the virology market.”Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD), like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), is among the most successful American drug companies with high revenue generation.7. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)Total Revenue in 2021: $28.3 billionEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is among the largest global healthcare companies. It is based in Indianapolis, Indiana. Some of its products include Alimta for non-small cell lung cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma, and Cyramza for metastatic gastric cancer.An Overweight rating was reiterated on Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) shares on January 3 by Carter Gould at Barclays.

The company has established an R&amp;D center in China for the development of new drugs for the Chinese market.

Here's what the firm said:“Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a large-cap pharmaceutical company. Shares increased on investor optimism about Lilly’s new product pipeline, which includes Mounjaro for diabetes and obesity and Donanemab for Alzheimer’s disease. We continue to think Lilly has a healthy base business with limited near-term patent expirations, a strong pipeline, and potential for significant margin expansion, which should translate to strong revenue and earnings growth over at least the next five years.”6. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Total Revenue in 2021: $43.08 billionAbbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is a healthcare company based in North Chicago, Illinois. It operates through its Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices segments.Matt Miksic at Barclays holds an Overweight rating on Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) shares as of January 27, alongside a $125 price target.Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) generated huge revenues during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In the fourth quarter of 2021, the company's medical devices sales came in at $3.75 billion, missing analyst estimates of $.84 billion because of China's COVID-19 curbs at the time.Stewart Asset Management, an investment management firm, mentioned Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“We also need to point out one global consequence of the rapid rise in interest rates: an irrepressibly strong dollar. This hurts the reported earnings of U.S. companies who sell their goods and services overseas. Foreign currency earnings translate into fewer dollars and thus lower earnings. Most of the companies in your portfolios gain a notable amount of earnings from their international operations. While the strength or weakness of a currency doesn’t change the quality of a business or its longer-term earnings power, it can change the reported earnings of a company over short periods of time. It is difficult to forecast this effect accurately because many of our companies manufacture where they sell, which to some extent dulls the sharp negative effect of a surging dollar. Abbott (NYSE:ABT), among others, is a good example.”Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), is a medical company with significant earnings and profitability today. Click to continue reading and see the Top 5 Drug Companies in USA and Their China Reliance. Suggested articles:15 Best Drug Stocks To BuyTop Drug Companies In the World in 202215 Most Advanced Countries in MedicineDisclosure: None.

Shares of Union Pacific also spiking higher today following news of a change in the company's C-suite. Union Pacific announcing on Sunday that CEO Lance Fritz going to be stepping down by the end of the year. And that is thanks to pressure from hedge fund Soroban Capital Partners.Now this is just the latest example of activist investors pushing for change at some major companies with Starboard Value, Elliott Management, Third Point among the activist investors taking a stake in software giants in the recent months. And additionally, I would say, ValueAct CEO Mason Morfit has been appointed to the software giant's board, which is going to take effect on March 1, the same day Salesforce reports its fourth quarter earnings. So lots of shaking out in the M&amp;A space, Seana.SEANA SMITH: Yes, certainly. We have seen a rise in shareholder activism and investor activism, I should say. Certainly something that we have been talking about time and time again. When you take a look at some of these numbers, Lazard was out with recent data showing that the number of new overall campaigns last year hit 235. That's a rise of about 36%, comparing it to the number that we saw back in 2021.In terms of a Union Pacific, the reaction that we saw in the stock today, shares there jumping on this, just in terms of the fact that it looks like we will get a new CEO there, with Lance Fritz saying that he will be stepping down. Bank of America upgraded the railroad operator to a buy. They had a neutral rating. They cited that leadership change as a reason that they are more bullish on the stock.But certainly, we have seen more activism here in some of these larger blue chip industry names. Those have been targeted. You mentioned activity that we're seeing in Salesforce. You can really see it across the board. Technology, the most frequently targeted sector in 2022, represented about a fifth, 21% of the activist targets there. So as we saw the large decline in many of those tech stocks, certainly an opportunistic time for some of those activist investors to get involved.JARED BLIKRE: Yes, indeed.]"

Then, stocks gave up some gains as yields moved off the day's lows. The yield on two-year Treasury notes, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, slipped after touching a near four-month high.""A little bit of a bounce because Friday’s reaction was an overreaction,"" said Ken Polcari, managing partner at Kace Capital Advisors in Boca Raton, Florida.""If inflation does not subside and it continues to creep higher over the next couple of months (the Fed) absolutely could force it higher. The realization now is there is no pivot coming this year and the people who still think a pivot is coming this year need their heads examined.""The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 141.43 points, or 0.43%, to 32,958.35, the S&amp;P 500 gained 23.19 points, or 0.58%, to 3,993.23 and the Nasdaq Composite added 107.45 points, or 0.94%, to 11,502.39.Last week, the Dow Industrials fell by the biggest weekly percentage since September, and the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq had their biggest weekly percentage fall since December as economic data and comments from U.S. Federal Reserve officials heightened expectations the central bank will become more aggressive in raising interest rates.Story continuesEconomists at UK-based banks Barclays and NatWest believe the Fed could ramp up the pace of its interest-rate rises in March with a half-point hike. Morgan Stanley said it no longer sees a cut by the Fed this year and expects a slower pace of 25 basis points when the central bank does begin lowering rates.Fed funds futures show traders are pricing in a third 25 bps hikes this year and see rates peaking at 5.4% by September.Fed Governor Philip Jefferson said he had ""no illusion"" that inflation would quickly fall back to target and was committed to keeping restrictive monetary policy in place for as long as needed.Data showed new orders for key U.S.-made capital goods increased more than expected in January while shipments of core goods rebounded, suggesting that business spending on equipment picked up.Easing yields helped growth stocks rebound 0.91%, while Tesla jumped 6.14% after the electric automaker said its plant in Brandenburg near Berlin was producing 4,000 cars a week, three weeks ahead of schedule according to a recent production plan reviewed by Reuters.Seagen Inc surged 9.73% after the Wall Street Journal reported that Pfizer was in early talks to acquire the biotech firm. Pfizer's shares lost 1.69%.U.S. railroad operator Union Pacific climbed 10.08% as Chief Executive Lance Fritz said he would step down. Hedge fund Soroban Capital Partners had called for his ouster.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.30-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.66-to-1 ratio favored advancers.The S&amp;P 500 posted four new 52-week highs and five new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 58 new highs and 82 new lows.

That is, there were more number of shares sold by insiders than there were purchased.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Cisco Systems The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Cisco SystemsNotably, that recent sale by Maria Martinez is the biggest insider sale of Cisco Systems shares that we've seen in the last year. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$48.73. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Cisco Systems Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Cisco Systems shares. Specifically, Executive VP &amp; COO Maria Martinez ditched US$998k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Insider Ownership Of Cisco SystemsFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It appears that Cisco Systems insiders own 0.03% of the company, worth about US$53m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Cisco Systems Insiders?An insider sold Cisco Systems shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. While insiders do own shares, they don't own a heap, and they have been selling. So we'd only buy after careful consideration. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.
