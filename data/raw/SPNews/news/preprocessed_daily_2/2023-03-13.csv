Company highlights for the month of February 2023 include:This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230313005341/en/Core net new assets brought to the company by new and existing clients totaled $41.7 billion. Net new assets excluding mutual fund clearing totaled $40.5 billion.Total client assets were $7.38 trillion as of month-end February, down 4% from February 2022 and down 1% compared to January 2023.Average margin balances were $60.6 billion in February, down 28% from February 2022 and up 1% compared to January 2023.Chief Financial Officer Peter Crawford offered the following thoughts on the current environment, our company’s performance, and recent client activity:""Given the events of the past few days, we thought it might be helpful to highlight several factors that enable us to keep delivering for clients and stockholders through a range of market conditions:Schwab’s business continues to perform exceptionally well, as our Through Clients’ Eyes strategy and ‘no trade-offs’ positioning resonates with both clients and prospects. February core net new assets totaled $41.7 billion, our 2nd largest February ever (trailing only February 2021, the height of the meme stock craze). Our growth and momentum have continued into March, with daily net new assets averaging nearly $2B per trading day month-to-date. Our financial performance continues to be strong. As we look ahead to our first quarter results, we anticipate year-over-year revenue growth of about 10% relative to Q1 2022, with adjusted1 pre-tax profit margin in the 45-47% range.Client bank sweep cash outflows in February were about $5 billion lower than January and March month-to-date daily average outflows are tracking consistent with February. Importantly, these outflows reflect a continuation of client decisions to reallocate a portion of their cash into higher yielding cash alternatives within Schwab. Based on our ongoing analysis of these trends, we still believe client cash realignment decisions will largely abate during 2023.This activity reflects the collective behavior of our heterogenous client mix of individual retail investors and the advisors who serve them. More than 80% of our total bank deposits fall within the FDIC insurance limits, among the five highest ratios of the top 100 banks in the United States. As a reminder, our deposit base is primarily comprised of transactional cash balances swept to our banks from one of our 34 million brokerage accounts.We have access to significant liquidity, including an estimated $100 billion of cash flow from cash on hand, portfolio-related cash flows, and net new assets we anticipate realizing over the next twelve months. We believe we have upwards of $8 billion in potential retail CD issuances per month, plus over $300 billion of incremental capacity with the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and other short-term facilities – including the recently announced Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP).Our approach to managing our assets is quite different than traditional banks. So before closing, I wanted to provide some thoughts on recent comments by some pundits regarding unrealized losses within bank held-to-maturity (HTM) portfolios. As a reminder, our banks’ loan-to-deposit ratio is approximately 10% and nearly all the loans are over-collateralized by first-lien mortgages or securities. The remainder of our assets are invested in high-quality, liquid securities in either our available-for-sale (AFS) portfolio, working capital at the parent or broker-dealer subsidiaries, or in our HTM portfolio. Focusing attention on unrealized losses within HTM has two logical flaws. First, those securities will mature at par, and given our significant access to other sources of liquidity there is very little chance that we’d need to sell them prior to maturity (as the name implies). Second, by looking at unrealized losses among HTM securities, but not doing the same for traditional banks’ loan portfolios, the analysis penalizes firms like Schwab that in fact have a higher quality, more liquid, and more transparent balance sheet.Story continuesAll of these factors demonstrate that Schwab is well-positioned to navigate the current environment as we continue to serve clients and build the future of modern wealth management. And we applaud the efforts of our regulators to support depositors during this critical time, helping to bolster confidence across the American banking system.""1 For the 1Q 2023, we currently expect GAAP pre-tax profit margin of 41% – 43%. Further detail on Schwab’s non-GAAP financial measures is included within our 10-K filed in February 2023. Adjusted pre-tax profit margin is calculated as adjusted income before taxes on income divided by net revenues. Adjusted income before taxes on income equals net revenues less adjusted total expenses. Adjusted total expenses equals total GAAP expenses excluding interest less acquisition and integration-related costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets.Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements relating to Schwab’s business momentum and growth; strategy and positioning; financial performance; revenue growth; adjusted pre-tax profit margin; client bank sweep cash outflows; client cash realignment decisions; access to liquidity, including from cash flows, CD issuances, and FHLB and other short-term facilities; HTM portfolio; and balance sheet.

TROW announced its preliminary assets under management (AUM) of $1.31 trillion as of Feb 28.

Rowe Price’s total U.S. mutual fund balance was $644 billion, down 2.7% from January 2023 level. Of the total U.S. mutual funds balance, almost 88.5% comprised investments in equity and blended assets, while the remaining came from fixed income, including the money-market portfolio.T. Rowe Price’s total sub-advised and separate accounts, and other investment products were worth $670 billion, marking 2.5% decline from the prior month. Of this, equity and blended assets, accounting for $531 billion, were down 4.5% sequentially. While fixed-income products, including the money market, constituted $95 billion (down 1% sequentially), alternative products aggregated $44 billion (flat sequentially) of total other investment portfolios.Additionally, TROW registered $351 billion in target date retirement portfolios, which declined 2% from the previous month.In near term, a challenging operating backdrop will continue to adversely impact TROW’s AUM balance.

6,acd9e9ae-803e-3e6e-8f70-7495e01aa111,SCHW,2023-03-13,Is Schwab Small-Cap Equity (SWSCX) a Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-small-cap-equity-swscx-110011624.html,1678705211,STORY,['SCHW'],"[Any investors hoping to find a Mutual Fund Equity Report fund might consider looking past Schwab Small-Cap Equity (SWSCX). SWSCX possesses a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 4 (Sell), which is based on various forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.History of Fund/ManagerSWSCX is a part of the Schwab Funds family of funds, a company based out of San Francisco, CA. Schwab Small-Cap Equity debuted in June of 2003. Since then, SWSCX has accumulated assets of about $542.60 million, according to the most recently available information. The fund's current manager is a team of investment professionals.PerformanceInvestors naturally seek funds with strong performance. This fund in particular has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 6.39%, and it sits in the middle third among its category peers. If you're interested in shorter time frames, do not dismiss looking at the fund's 3-year annualized total return of 14.44%, which places it in the top third during this time-frame.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. Over the past three years, SWSCX's standard deviation comes in at 25.55%, compared to the category average of 26.61%. Looking at the past 5 years, the fund's standard deviation is 23.65% compared to the category average of 23.62%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Risk FactorsWith a 5-year beta of 1.14, the fund is likely to be more volatile than the market average. Because alpha represents a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark, which is the S&amp;P 500 in this case, one should pay attention to this metric as well. With a negative alpha of -3.4, managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.HoldingsExploring the equity holdings of a mutual fund is also a valuable exercise. This can show us how the manager is applying their stated methodology, as well as if there are any inherent biases in their approach. For this particular fund, the focus is largely on equities that are traded in the United States.Story continuesCurrently, this mutual fund is holding 98.36% stock in stocks, and these companies have an average market capitalization of $3.23 billion. The fund has the heaviest exposure to the following market sectors:FinanceIndustrial CyclicalTechnologyWith turnover at about 74%, this fund is making more trades per year than the comparable average.ExpensesFor investors, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is key, since costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing. Competition is heating up in this space, and a lower cost product will likely outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, all things being equal. In terms of fees, SWSCX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 1.09% compared to the category average of 1.20%. SWSCX is actually cheaper than its peers when you consider factors like cost.While the minimum initial investment for the product is $0, investors should also note that there is no minimum for each subsequent investment.Bottom LineOverall, Schwab Small-Cap Equity ( SWSCX ) has a low Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively similar performance, average downside risk, and lower fees, this fund looks like a somewhat weak choice for investors right now.For additional information on this product, or to compare it to other mutual funds in the Mutual Fund Equity Report, make sure to go to www.zacks.com/funds/mutual-funds for additional information.

For example, the Tech Sector is still struggling, and the recent implosion of SVB Financial (NASDAQ:SIVB) could make things worse, according to the firm.California is a big market for EVs (41% for Tesla) and tech (roughly 20% of California's economy), and if tech spending slows down more, the firm believes there could be more layoffs.Charles Schwab upgraded to Buy at CitiCiti upgraded Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) to Buy from Neutral while cutting its price target to $75.00 from $83.00 due to a compelling risk/reward at current levels after a 23% decline over the last two trading days.Although there may be some short-term revenue/earnings headwinds from rising funding costs and continued client cash sorting, the firm believes they are already reflected in the stock price. The firm doesn't see a significant risk of deposits leaving Charles Schwab due to the composition of its deposit base and customer protections.""Tapping supplemental fundings (FHLB, CDs, etc.) will present a near-term earnings headwind, but we expect these to be temporary measures and for the company to swap out these funding sources via organic sources ASAP,"" added the firm.Shares are down more than 3% pre-market today.3 more rating changesJPMorgan downgraded Under Armour (NYSE:UA) (NYSE:UAA) to Neutral from Overweight and cut its price target to $10.00 from $13.00.Story continues""Larger picture, management is now citing Summer to Fall '23 at the earliest for the ""inventory overhang"" to be worked through, which has created an elevated promotional environment across the sector ""longer than expected"" for UAA,"" said the firm.Under Armour expects its 2023 gross margin to decline by approximately 425bps year-over-year, with around 140bps of pressure from higher promotions and discounting. This is due to Under Armour managing its own inventory and discounting more than expected to stay competitive in a sector with bloated inventory levels.UBS downgraded United Natural Foods (NYSE:UNFI) to Neutral from Buy and cut its price target to $32.00 from $48.00.The company reported a Q2 EPS miss and lowered its full-year guidance last week.

9,f177aea2-1bd0-3568-9952-972e513fb558,TXN,2023-03-13,Texas Instruments' (NASDAQ:TXN) investors will be pleased with their decent 99% return over the last three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/texas-instruments-nasdaq-txn-investors-110032059.html,1678705232,STORY,['TXN'],"[By buying an index fund, investors can approximate the average market return. But many of us dare to dream of bigger returns, and build a portfolio ourselves. For example, Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) shareholders have seen the share price rise 84% over three years, well in excess of the market return (41%, not including dividends). On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 5.9% , including dividends .Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. Check out our latest analysis for Texas Instruments There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During three years of share price growth, Texas Instruments achieved compound earnings per share growth of 22% per year. This EPS growth is remarkably close to the 22% average annual increase in the share price. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Quite to the contrary, the share price has arguably reflected the EPS growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Texas Instruments has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Texas Instruments will grow revenue in the future.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Texas Instruments' TSR for the last 3 years was 99%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Texas Instruments has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 5.9% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 13% a year, is even better. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted   3 warning signs for Texas Instruments  you should be aware of, and 2 of them shouldn't be ignored.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

If you want to see stocks that hedge funds are buying, you can go to 5 Stocks Hedge Funds Are Buying.Growth stocks had one of their historically worst years in 2022, as interest rates climbed to bring down inflation. The growth-heavy Nasdaq Composite lost over 30% of its value as the year came to an end. Tech was the victim of huge sell-offs and also mass lay-offs as the Fed remained hawkish through year-end. 2023 got off to an interesting start, with the Nasdaq rallying above 12,000 in February. However, the key question remains about whether the Fed will continue to remain hawkish in 2023 or will it pivot to a relatively dovish stance? A hawkish Fed means higher interest rates, which are not good for growth as they put a strain on these companies' future earnings.Hedge Fund Consultant: ""I Think The Fed Is Now Probably Gonna End Up Cutting Rates By 100 Basis Points""On March 10, Silicon Valley Bank collapsed after it failed to raise capital and resolve its liquidity crisis. Shortly after the collapse of the bank, Larry McDonald appeared in an interview on CNBC to discuss his view on what's ahead for the financial services sector, the risk of contagion, and what he thinks the Fed is going to do. Larry McDonald is a New York Times bestselling author, a renowned financial consultant, and is also held in high esteem as a risk consultant, particularly for hedge funds and high-net-worth investors.According to Larry McDonald, larger banks have relatively more resources and experience in managing interest rate risk than smaller regional banks. Therefore, the risk of contagion from the collapse of SVB to large banks is relatively smaller than the risk of contagion to regional banks. Larry McDonald thinks that the Fed needs to raise interest rates right now in order to bring down inflation. However, he also sees the Fed cutting rates significantly by the end of the year. Here are some comments from Larry McDonald:Story continues""They (the Fed) need to get inflation down and so they need to tighten financial conditions. And so they're doing that, and now we're having a run on some of these banks... I think the Fed's gonna now probably end up cutting rates by 100 basis points by December.""Larry McDonald explained his view with the help of an analogy. According to Larry McDonald, the Fed has to take care of two separate fires, one is the inflation fire and the other one is the risk of contagion. The Fed will do that by using its fire hose, that is interest rates, differently throughout 2023. Here is what Larry McDonald said:""So There's an inflation fire. They're (the Fed) pulling out the fire hose with (tightening) financial conditions trying to put that out. And so that's the fire they're dealing with now. The problem is, when you do that, our 21 Lehman systemic indicators are at the highest levels since Lehman and Covid right now. They're exploding higher. So now, within the next couple of months, as the contagion brews up this channel, up to high yield, leveraged loans, across the entire ecosystem, that's when the Fed is going to have to bring out the other fire hose and cut rates, probably within 6 to 9 months.""To conclude, Larry McDonald sees the Fed raising interest rates right now but eventually, in the back half of 2023, he thinks the Fed will end up cutting rates as ""contagion brews up"".Investors have repositioned themselves throughout 2022 as interest rates went through the roof. In a volatile market environment, such as the one we are in right now, it is imperative to know where big money managers are placing their bets and what they are avoiding. This can save retail investors from potential losses. We have compiled a list of 10 growth stocks that hedge funds have dumped in the fourth quarter of 2022, and also a list of the 5 stocks that hedge funds have bought. Stocks that experienced an influx of institutional money in Q4 2022 include Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI), Chart Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:GTLS), and Mobileye Global Inc. (NASDAQ:MBLY).Hedge Funds Are Fleeing These 10 Growth Stocks. 5 Stocks They Are Buying InsteadPhoto by Pascal Bernardon on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo determine the 10 growth stocks hedge funds are fleeing and the 5 stocks that hedge funds are buying instead, we consulted Insider Monkey's proprietary database of more than 900 elite hedge funds. We calculated the hedge fund sentiment for each stock. We narrowed down our list to the 10 growth stocks that had the highest number of hedge fund exits in Q4 2022. After that, we picked the 5 stocks that had the highest number of hedge fund initiations.For growth stocks that hedge funds have fled in Q4 2022, we have ranked the stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that sold the stock. For stocks that hedge funds have bought, we have ranked the stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that bought the stock. Where the number of hedge funds that sold/bought were the same, we used the number of hedge fund holders as the tie-breaker.Hedge Funds Are Fleeing These 10 Growth Stocks.15. Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 115Number of Hedge Funds That Sold: 11Payments giant Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) released earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022 on February 9. The company reported an EPS of $1.24 and outperformed EPS estimates by $0.04. The company's revenue for the quarter amounted to $7.38 billion and fell short of expectations by $8.55 million.At the end of Q4 2022, 115 hedge funds were long Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) and disclosed positions worth $5.10 billion in the company. This is compared to 126 hedge funds in Q3 2022 with stakes worth $6.78 billion. The hedge fund sentiment for the stock is negative. The stock is placed tenth among the growth stocks hedge funds are fleeing.As of December 31, Citadel Investment Group is the largest investor in Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) and has a position worth $481 million in the company.Here is what RiverPark Advisors had to say about PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)  in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)l: PayPal shares were a top detractor for 4Q, reporting slightly weaker than expected 3Q payment volumes and 4Q payment volume guidance. The company nevertheless reported betterthan-expected EPS on improved margins. PYPL operates at significantly lower margins than its payment competitors Visa and Mastercard, and 3Q results and 4Q guidance show early improvements in its margins and ability to drive higher cash flow growth in the near term. For 3Q, PYPL reported $1.8 billion of FCF, the highest quarterly FCF number in its history, representing 37% growth. The company expects continued operating margin expansion for 4Q and full year FCF of more than $5 billion, representing a 6% FCF yield.PayPal is the most accepted digital wallet – with almost triple the acceptance of Apple Pay, the number two digital wallet. PayPal is a key beneficiary of the ongoing shift to ecommerce driven digital payments, as well as consumer-to-consumer payment trends through its Venmo peer-topeer (P2P) payment service. With a 3Q non-GAAP operating margin of 22%, PYPL also has significant margin expansion potential given that competitors Adyen, Visa and Mastercard have 50%-65% operating margins. We believe the combination of secular growth, expanding operating leverage and the strategic use of the company’s significant and growing cash balance should fuel high teens earnings growth over the next five years. This, to us, presents an excellent risk/reward given that PYPL trades at a below market multiple.”14. Bill.com Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:BILL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58Number of Hedge Funds That Sold: 12Bill.com Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:BILL) is a leading fintech company and provider of cloud-based software for financial operations. As of March 10, the stock has lost 60.34% over the past 6 months.12 hedge funds fled Bill.com Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:BILL) in Q4 2022. The stock was held by 58 investors at the end of Q4 2022. These funds held collective positions worth $1.15 billion in the company, down from $1.66 billion in the previous quarter with 70 positions. The stock is one of the growth stocks that hedge funds have sold in Q4 2022.As of December 31, Alkeon Capital Management is the most prominent stockholder in Bill.com Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:BILL) and has disclosed a stake worth $215.4 million in the company.Here is what TimesSquare Capital Management had to say about Bill.com Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:BILL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Bill.com Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:BILL) offers cloud-based software that simplifies, digitizes, and automates back-office functions for small and mid-sized businesses. The company has indicated that customer spending softened a bit in recent months and that has been factored into forward guidance. We decided to sell out of the position, which had declined by -20% while it was held in the quarter.”Stocks that hedge funds are pouring hefty investments into right now include Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI), Chart Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:GTLS), and Mobileye Global Inc. (NASDAQ:MBLY).13. Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40Number of Hedge Funds That Sold: 13Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) is a provider of cloud-based cybersecurity software and services. The stock has lost 21.24% over the past 6 months, as of March 10.Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) was abandoned by 13 hedge funds in Q4 2022. The stock was a part of 40 investors' portfolios, down from 53 investors' portfolios in the third quarter of 2022. The stock is placed eighth among the top growth stocks hedge funds have fled in Q4 2022.As of December 31, Marshall Wace LLP is the leading investor in Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) and has disclosed a position worth $119.5 million in the company.Here is what Ron Baron's Baron Funds had to say about Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We continued to build our position in Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) during the quarter as the shares declined with the overall software space and the long-term risk/ reward balance became more compelling. The company reported a strong second quarter, with revenue growth accelerating to 54%, as well as better gross and operating margins. Third quarter guidance was also ahead of Wall Street expectations. Given Cloudflare’s proprietary network and massive global scale, its software products have a disruptive price-performance advantage over competitors. As the company introduces new products as well as disruptive packaging/pricing, its unit level economics should continue to improve over time, with the company already well ahead of its long-term gross margin target of 74%, reporting 78.9% for the second quarter. This drives strong cross/upselling activity with customers, reflected in strong net-dollar expansion rates in excess of 125%. Indeed, in the most recent quarters, customers purchasing five or more products reached 81% of the base, six or more products reached 70% of the base, and seven or more products reached 58% of the base. Enterprise penetration continues to be a key long-term driver, with 1,749 customers now spending over $100,000 annually with the company, growing 61% and now accounting for over 60% of total revenue. With approximately 152,000 paying customers at the end of last quarter, large enterprise customers still represent just 1% of total paid customers and thus a material growth opportunity in the coming years. We continue to have high confidence in the company’s ability to innovate at a rapid pace (announced 20 new products or enhancements in September alone), package and bundle with disruptive pricing, and take material share in its large and growing addressable markets.”12.

The stock was held by 34 hedge funds that disclosed collective positions worth $303.5 million in the company. This is compared to 47 hedge funds in the previous quarter with stakes worth $2.63 billion. The hedge fund sentiment for the stock is negative.As of December 31, Knoll Capital Management is the top investor in Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company Ltd. (NYSE:BHVN) and disclosed a stake worth $6.25 million in the company.11. Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:MPWR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30Number of Hedge Funds That Sold: 13Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:MPWR) is a semiconductor company that develops and markets semiconductor-based power electronics.

As of December 31, Holocene Advisors is the largest shareholder in Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:MPWR) and held a position worth $169 million in the company.Here is what Artisan Partners had to say about Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:MPWR) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“During the quarter, we began new GardenSM positions in Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:MPWR), Industrie De Nora and Saia. Monolithic Power Systems designs analog power-management chips for a wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. The company is executing well as its customers convert their analog, digital and power semiconductor chips into its single-chip design, which is energy efficient and priced lower than peers. While we acknowledge certain areas of the business may be a source of weakness in the near term (storage, computing and consumer), we believe much of that is now discounted. However, the enterprise and auto areas of the business are set up to be big growth drivers over the next couple years given the company’s differentiation in both segments, which is driving market share gains and pricing power. Based on its unique ability to offer highly integrated solutions and solve complex power management issues across multiple end-applications, we believe the profit cycle runway ahead is meaningful and initiated a GardenSM position.”10. Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31Number of Hedge Funds That Sold: 15Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) is a leading global provider of data storage products and services.

We cut our cyclical technology exposure with a trim to hard disk drive maker Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC), which has higher than average financial leverage for our portfolio and is facing a challenging demand environment.”9.

(NASDAQ:PANW) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Stock selection within the IT sector was the main detractor from relative performance during the period. In addition to rate hikes compressing the multiples of longerduration, high growth companies, recession concerns were also a headwind. IT companies which had proven resilient against customer budget reductions earlier in the year are starting to feel the impact of spending slowdowns as companies further scrutinize expenses in light of economic uncertainty. For example, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW), which provides enterprise security solutions including next-generation firewalls and threat detection software, faced a challenging environment as customers delayed purchases and orders. However, we remain convinced of the company’s long-term growth prospects as an industry leader in a critical field and as digital attacks and ransomware continue to grow.”8.

Shares declined on the back of a weaker-than-expected earnings report, in which revenue beat Street expectations but net new annual recurring revenue (ARR) slightly missed consensus due to elongated sales cycles that impacted deals with small- and medium-sized businesses (SMB) and phased start dates with larger customers. For example, instead of 100,000 end-points starting on day 1, start 75,000 on day 1 and 25,000 six months later. For fuller context, in the fiscal third quarter, revenue grew 53%, ARR grew 54%, net new ARR was $198 million vs. expectations about $20 million higher, and the business generated 30% FCF margins. Accounting for the net new ARR miss, the company offered conservative initial guidance for fiscal year 2024 (ending January 2024), with ARR growth in the low 30s, subscription revenue growth in the low-to-mid 30s, and FCF margins around the 30% level. While this was a painful reset, CrowdStrike noted its SMB win rates had improved, enterprise win rates remained constant, its gross and net retention rates are at best-in-class levels, and its emerging products were experiencing rapid adoption. Despite short-term weakness, Morgan Stanley’s fourth quarter CIO survey showed security software projects remained the top CIO priority, and our research continues to indicate that CrowdStrike is one of the few true platforms in the security space.”7.

To varying degrees, each is managing through cyclical challenges during a period of substantial investor pessimism. Drawdowns of this magnitude are painful, and it may be prudent for management to moderate the pace of some investments, but we remain encouraged by their long-term focus.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. Statements made during this conference call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Laith Sando, Vice President, Investor Relations at Range Resources. Please go ahead.Laith Sando: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Range's year end earnings call. The speakers on today's call are Jeff Ventura, Chief Executive Officer; Dennis Degner, Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Scucchi, Chief Financial Officer. Hopefully you've had a chance to review the press release and updated investor presentation that we've posted on our website. We may reference certain of those slides on the call this morning. You will also find our 10-K on Range's website under the Investors tab or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system. Please note, we'll be referencing certain non-GAAP measures on today's call. Our press release provides reconciliations of these to the most comparable GAAP figures. For additional information, we've posted supplemental tables on our website to assist in the calculation of EBITDAX, cash margins and other non-GAAP measures. With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.Jeff Ventura: Thanks Laith and thanks everyone for joining us on this morning's call. While front month natural gas prices have no doubt wavered over the past couple of months, Range's operations have remained consistent. We've made steady progress on key objectives and our business is more resilient today than at any point in the company's history. In 2022 Range successfully managed a great opportunity the natural gas markets presented us with. We delivered our operational plans safely and with peer leading efficiencies, we generated record free cash flow, materially strengthened our financial position and returned significant capital to shareholders. At the end of the year we had reduced debt by over $1 billion marking our 5th consecutive year of debt reduction, repurchased $400 million in shares and established an annualized dividend of $0.32 per share.Story continuesWe captured much of the upside presented to us in 2022 with a deliberate fit-for-purpose hedging program. Ultimately, every natural gas EMP Company would have preferred to have been unhedged last year as the natural gas market moved higher. But when looking back at our results, Ranger's hedge program retained more of the upside on a per Mcf basis than any of our natural gas peers. Looking forward into 2023 and 2024, the natural gas market is in a different place, but our hedge program is once again positioned for success. Our hedging activity is not aimed at picking tops and bottoms, but our program is aimed at supporting durable free cash flow through the cycles while retaining exposure to improving longer term natural gas and NGL fundamentals.Looking at our 2022 results and projections for the next two years, I believe we've struck that balance quite well. Our business generates free cash flow down to very low prices, and for 2023, we believe Range has among the best annual breakevens in the industry, well below $2 per Mcf. The resilience that our business has in a lower price environment, like we find ourselves in today is a positive differentiator for Range. Having hedges in place to cover our fixed cost and capital commitments as part of it, but the business model over the long run is really underpinned by Range's sustaining capital requirements. Our relatively low capital requirements are the result of Range's class leading drilling and completion costs, coupled with our shallow base decline and large blocky core inventory.Altogether, these result in a peer leading all-in maintenance that is approximately $0.76 per Mcfe. This provides Range a solid foundation for consistently generating significant free cash flow and returns to shareholders. Further bolstering Range's durability is our liquids production. NGLs and condensate are approximately 30% of Range's production. Through the cycles, our liquid revenue has provided an uplift to natural gas prices and using today's strip pricing for 2023; that uplift is meaningful. For context, Range's NGL's pricing would currently be priced around $26 per barrel, using strip prices for 2023. That is the equivalent to a 40% or $1.30 per Mcf premium to current Henry Hub strip pricing for 2023. When we roll all of that together, our low maintenance capital, our leading hedge program in our liquids optionality, you get the lowest breakeven amongst natural gas producers in the most durable free cash flow in 2023.As we show in our slides, Range is still generating several hundred million in free cash flow at $2.50 natural gas prices. Importantly, our leading efficiencies and low breakevens are sustainable, because of Range's large blocky acreage position that provides us decades of core inventory. A portion of the value of this massive inventory can be found in our year end reserves. The after-tax PV10 of our reserves using $4 NYMEX, which is approximately where the 10-year strip is, equates to over $40 per share net of debt, over 50% higher than Range's current share price. For added context, our reserve report includes our proved developed wells in only 367 undeveloped locations out of approximately 3,000 undrilled core locations we have in the Marcellus.Simply put, we do not believe the significant resource value is currently reflected in today's market, presenting Range the opportunity to create meaningful, long term per share value for equity holders through our buyback program, which has $1.1 billion of availability remaining. As a reminder, we set a target in the spring of 2021 to reduce debt by more than $2 billion by the end of 2023. Today we are 90% of the way towards that target. It's been a successful repositioning of our balance sheet within a short period of time and clears the path for meaningful returns of capital to shareholders in the years ahead. Before turning it over to Mark and Dennis, I'll reiterate what I've said on the last many calls. Range is in the best position in the company's history.As the world continues to move towards cleaner, more efficient fuels, natural gas and NGLs will be the affordable, reliable and abundant supply that help power our everyday lives, while also helping billions of others improve their standard of living. We believe Appalachia natural gas and natural gas liquids are positioned to meet that future demand. And within Appalachia, Range will be among those leading the way on capital efficiency, emissions intensity and transparency, which are all core to generating sustainable long term value for shareholders. Range has derisked a massive inventory of high quality wells in the Marcellus, measured in decades and translated that into a business capable of generating free cash flow through the cycles. With the resilient business plan for 2023 and 2024 and favorable long term fundamentals for natural gas and natural gas liquids, Range is well positioned to generate healthy returns on and returns of capital to shareholders.I'll now turn it over to Dennis to cover operations.Natural Gasamerican-public-power-association-bv2pvCGMtzg-unsplashDennis Degner : Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with capital. All in CapEx for the year totaled $492 million. Included in our fourth quarter activity were nine additional top holes as we were able to secure drilling equipment in December in advance of our 2023 program. This added $11 million to our original capital plans. Production for the fourth quarter averaged 2.2 Bcf equivalent per day, resulting in an annual average daily production just above 2.12 Bcf equivalent per day for the year. This was achieved despite a cumulative production loss of 2.7 Bcf equivalent and a few well turn-in-lines being moved into January during the cold weather Appalachia experienced in late December. As we look forward into 2023, our all-in capital spending is expected to be between $570 million and $615 million.With this year's activity weighted more towards our liquids rich acreage versus last year. Approximately two-thirds of the lateral footage turned to sales this year will be in the wet and super rich acreage positions with the remainder in Range's dry gas footprint, including three wells in northeast PA. This plan delivers a similar production level as last year, at 2.12 Bcf to 2.16 Bcf equivalent per day, while adding lateral footage to our expected inventory at year end. The incremental inventory being added is underpinned by the drilling team's successes in late 2022, and so far in 2023, they are off to an incredible start, setting daily footage records that I will touch on in just a moment. As a result our 2023 capital plan includes approximately $30 million associated with this lateral inventory, providing us with increased optionality as we think about our 2024 and 2025 operational plans.Approximately 95% of this year's capital is slated to be allocated towards drilling and completions related activity, with the remaining balance director towards leasing and support functions. Similar to prior years, the 2023 program is front-end loaded, with three horizontal rigs tapering off by year end, while completions will continuously utilize a single electric frac crew with a second crew performing planned spot work. 68 horizontal wells are expected to be drilled, with 61 wells turning to sales during the year. Our average horizontal links for wells completed and turned to sales during the year will be approximately 11,000 feet per well. With more than half of the wells developed on pads with existing production, similar to prior years.Our production is expected to be back half weighted in 2023, similar to the last year, which fits nicely with the current shape of the natural gas forward curve. A review of our 2022 operational highlights begins with drilling. In the fourth quarter we drilled 13 top holes and five horizontals, with an average drilled horizontal length for the quarter of approximately 14,700 feet. As part of these results, we also added four new wells to our top 15 long lateral list, with each of the four laterals drilled in excess of 18,300 feet. This success continued into 2023, where the team has set a new Range record by drilling in excess of 7,300 feet in a single day and then beat that record again at 7,900 feet in a single day in the days that followed.These results so far this year represent a 20% increase versus the prior record, showing the team's continued efforts to improve efficiencies after drilling over 1,200 wells. Continuing with the flexibility afforded by our large contiguous acreage position and the practice of returning to existing pads, 75% of top holes drilled in the fourth quarter were on pads with existing production. In addition to the efficiency gains by returning to pads, 90% of the wells drilled in Southwest PA in 2022 were drilled with dual fuel rigs, which successfully displaced more than 480,000 gallons of diesel fuel. The fuel savings equated to nearly $2 million, while improving emissions from our operations. As a result of our fourth quarter long lateral development, drilling costs were approximately $230 per lateral foot, which was a 15% improvement versus the prior quarter.On the completion side, we reached 8.8 fracs stages per day in the fourth quarter and completed over 3,100 total fracs for the year. Looking back on 2022, completion efficiencies continue to improve while setting several new records. The first new record involved averaging nine frac stages per day for a given quarter. Second, a new benchmark of 15 frac stages completed in a 24 hour period; and third; averaging 8.2 frac stages per day for the full year. One area driving these efficiency improvements is our return trips to existing pads, and the data driven decisions enhancing each consecutive completion job. For example, operations returning to pads has seen the average frac stages per day increase by 33% versus the first wave of development.Applying data from prior completions, coupled with our use of strategic logistical planning and utilizing existing surface equipment has supported our recent records and continued leadership amongst peers on well cost and overall capital efficiency. Water recycling efforts for Range's water operations and logistics teams resulted in saving $2.8 million for the fourth quarter, with our full year savings reaching a total of $12.9 million. Looking back on the past three years, the average savings per year is $12.4 million, and looking back even farther to 2018, the five year average is $11.8 million in savings per year, once again demonstrating the repeatable components that underpin Range's operations. In addition to our standard production procedures, new technology is playing a role in our base production management.This past year Range pilot tested the use of artificial intelligence in our production operations. Working in conjunction with our AI technology provider, an algorithm was created to monitor well production and make automated changes to parameters within our flow logic that enhanced production and reduced downtime. The trial was completed last year and based upon the results the project will be expanded this year, with the potential to add approximately 1 Bcf of growth production for the year. This production addition may appear small versus our total production, but it is this type of project that demonstrates our team's continued focus on production optimization and the use of technology to further support our low base decline and improve returns.In addition to our operational highlights, Range saw similar advancements for our safety performance in 2022. Through collaborative efforts with our Range employees and contractors, a 50% percent reduction in our OSHA incident rate was achieved versus last year, while reaching a program record low for days away or restricted duty, and making it our best safety performance in our program history. Shifting over to marketing, Range's pre-hedged NGL price for Q4 was $27.17 per barrel, which was approximately $0.75 per barrel below the Mont Belvieu equivalent, showing the differential improvement mentioned on our prior earnings call. In November, Shale Chemical announced that operations had begun at its Pennsylvania project. The facility includes an ethylene steam cracker that will consume an estimated 100,000 barrels per day of ethane when it ramps to full production, representing a significant increase in basin ethane demand.As we've stated previously, Range's NGL logistics and marketing program is designed to provide flexibility across seasons, markets and phases of the business cycle. I'm pleased to report that the Range team made uninterrupted deliveries to our customers with improved NGL pricing versus the prior quarter. Looking ahead, Range is poised to benefit from improving NGL export economics in the first half of 2023. As China's reopening proceeds, ocean freight rates stabilize and exports via the Marcus Hook terminal continue to command a price premium versus the Mont Belvieu index. Looking at this year, Range's NGL differential guide for 2023 is between $1 below and $1 premium relative to our Mont Belvieu equivalent barrel. For natural gas, Range reported a better than expected differential of $0.29 below NYMEX for full year 2022, which beat the low end of our guidance.As seen in our fourth quarter numbers and over the past several years, Range's natural gas marketing process and active basis hedging program helped to mitigate some of the swings experienced in the daily markets. Similar to our guidance at the start of last year, Range is setting 2023 natural gas differential guidance at $0.35 to $0.45 below NYMEX. As we wrap up our operations and marketing update, I'd like to congratulate our team for their accomplishments discussed today and their dedication to our continued improvements. Thanks for your hard work and commitment to delivering on our safe, efficient operations. We look forward to the exciting things we'll achieve in the year ahead. I'll now turn it over to Mark to discuss the financials.Mark Scucchi : Thanks, Dennis. On the earnings call a year ago, we spoke of a transformational year. We defined target debt levels and discuss the priority of debt reduction alongside a return of capital program. So in 2022, how do the actions and results compared to our stated objectives. I believe the results speak for themselves that we met or exceeded state objective. It was a record year for Range Resources in nearly every respect. Safe, efficient operations led to planned production levels. Our on-plan production levels sold through a diverse portfolio of sales points yielded strong realized prices. A constant focus on costs helped translate strong pricing into record cash flow and net income. That cash flow was strategically deployed to reduce debt, repurchase common stock and to reinitiate a cash dividend.In summary, we executed on the plan communicated a year ago, exceeded goals and enhanced the resilience of the company so the business can thrive throughout commodity price cycles, generating strong returns and free cash flow. Let's start with a discussion of the balance sheet. During 2022 Range reduced debt by approximately $1.1 billion. This brings total debt reduction since 2018 to approximately $2.3 billion. Debt reduction, combined with a timely refinancing in January of last year reduces current annualized interest expense by approximately $35 million, with additional savings expected as debt is further reduced. Leverage debt-to-EBITDAX stood at 0.8x at year end, the lowest in company history. Equity holders gained value from debt reduction, as well as through return of capital programs, including our share repurchases and cash dividends.In 2022 Range repurchased $400 million in common equity. Since initiating the share repurchase program, Range has repurchase $430 million in stock, reducing share count by 24 million shares or nearly 10%. Additionally, the sustainable dividend was reinitiated midyear at an annualized rate of $0.32 per share, returning an additional $39 million to shareholders during the second half of the year. In total, capital returned to stakeholders in 2022 alone was more than $1.5 billion according to roughly one quarter of current market cap. With $1.1 billion remaining under the existing share repurchase program, we have ample capacity to prudently reinvest free cash flow in shares of the business. As a reminder, our priority remains further improving the balance sheet to within our stated target range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion net debt, which we have a potential to reach in coming months based on recent strip pricing.As debt declines, we have incremental latitude to deploy free cash flow as evidenced by our actions in 2022. Driving balance sheet improvement and shareholder returns was the tireless operating team focused on safety and efficiency. The team delivered planned production at a competitive all-in capital cost of $0.64 per unit of production. When measuring capital efficiency and a maintenance profile, dividing capital expenditures by total production offers good perspective on relative performance, both in terms of cost and production profile. Not all capital dollars invested are equal. With perhaps the lowest decline rate of comparable companies, Range's capital efficiency stands out in terms of cost per Mcfe, as well as the required reinvestment rate of cash flow to maintain production.At $0.64 per Mcfe or less than 30% of cash flow reinvested as maintenance capital in 2022, Range was at or near best in the industry. We expect the same to be true in 2023. Fourth quarter operating results achieved cash flow of $513 million, compared to $112 million in capital spending, resulting in free cash flow of approximately $400 million. Significant improvements in fourth quarter free cash flow were driven by a combination of lower expenses and a 5% improvement in hedged realized prices per unit of production versus the prior year period, with realized price per unit reaching $4.33 per mcfe in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter cash margins per unit of production were $2.49, an increase of $0.39 or 18% compared to fourth quarter last year.Lease operating expenses remain in the historic range and in line with guidance at $0.11 per unit. Recurring cash G&amp;A expense was approximately $32 million or $0.15 per unit, roughly in line with preceding quarters despite inflation. Cash interest expense declined to less than $36 million with redemption of 2023 notes in December totaling $528 million. Combined with debt reduction and refinancing earlier in 2022, annualized net interest expense run rate is estimated at $35 million lower than last year. Further significant interest savings should follow-up as we retire our additional debt. As we discussed each quarter, Range's gas processing costs is linked to NGL prices such that gathering, processing and transportation expense decreased during the fourth four, serving as a right-way risk relationship between costs and pricing.Also reducing costs in Q4 were lower fuel and electricity costs and some cost savings from winter weather downtime. Additionally, rising commodity prices has improved the value of our contingent derivative assets, such that the 2022 installment was maximized at $24.5 million, leaving an additional $21 million as a potential remaining balance for 2023. Taxes have become a relevant topic with company profitability. In 2022 Range's total cash taxes are state level for a total of roughly $15 million for the year. At year end 2022 Range had federal NOL carry forwards totaling $2 billion. These NOLs will serve to reduce taxable income in coming years subject to utilization limitations. For some added understanding, the first layer of federal NOLs totaling $375 million can be used to reduce up to 100% of taxable income.The remaining $1.7 billion of federal NOLs can be used to reduce up to 80% of a given year's taxable income. At current strip pricing and Range's expected profitability, we believe will benefit from the full utilization of these NOL carry forwards in coming years. Turning from 2022 accomplishment to where the company is headed in 2023, given the strong foundation provided by high quality assets paired with low financial leverage, we expect Range's strategic focus will remain consistent going forward: Generate free cash flow, reduce debt, prudently return capital and reinvest in the business. This plan is reinforced with a thoughtfully constructed hedge book that in principle is the same risk management process we have always used. We seek to thoughtfully retain participation and improve long term market pricing, while increasing confidence in near term forecasted cash flow, all in support of a consistent, efficient operations, preserving the balance sheet and thereby preserving optionality around returns of capital.We believe Range's results demonstrate a thoughtful approach to hedging has served the company well and will continue to do so in the future. Presently, Range has approximately 55% of 2023 natural gas hedged with an average floor price of $3.57 and in 2024 approximately 35% hedged with an average floor price of $3.75, which is at or near the head of the class among natural gas producers. Range's business plan continues to be executed on what we believe is the largest high quality asset in Appalachia, paired with a transport and sales portfolio delivering production across the U.S. and internationally, all underpinned by a strong financial foundation. We have the team, assets and balance sheet to succeed through price cycles, and we believe that the Range business can and will continue to deliver significant value to investors.Jeff, back to you.Jeff Ventura: Operator, we'll be happy to answer questions.See also 25 Most Powerful Countries in Europe and 10 Dumbest Companies to Invest In.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Management is focused on enhancing digital growth via investments in e-commerce sites and logistics capabilities. GIII is quite optimistic about its five global power brands, including DKNY, Donna Karan, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Karl Lagerfeld Paris.In addition, GIII is benefiting from assortments and products resonating well with consumer demand. Additionally, its strategic licensing agreements and international business remain positives. All the aforesaid tailwinds are expected to have boosted G-III Apparel’s sales performance in the to-be-reported fiscal quarter.On the flip side, a tough operating landscape, including inflationary pressures on consumers and increased costs in areas like warehousing and supply chain, remains a headwind. This coupled with any deleverage in SG&amp;A expenses might hurt G-III Apparel’s earnings results in the to-be-reported fiscal quarter. On its last earnings call, management cited that it expects to continue witnessing elevated warehouse costs with respect to the higher inventory.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for G-III Apparel this time around.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 76% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).And institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's share price fell by 14% last week. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 22% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors. Institutions or ""liquidity providers"" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. As a result, if the decline continues, institutional investors may be pressured to sell U.S. Bancorp which might hurt individual investors.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of U.S. Bancorp. View our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About U.S. Bancorp?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.U.S. Bancorp already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at U.S. Bancorp's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. U.S. Bancorp is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 7.8% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 6.6% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 3.9% by the third-largest shareholder.Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of U.S. BancorpThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of U.S. Bancorp. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$123m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 23% stake in U.S. Bancorp. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

While the firm remains positive on Tesla's long-term opportunity and ""impressive cost trajectory,"" it is growing increasingly concerned about macro challenges facing the EV maker.Tesla has had to lower prices more than expected, and there are macro challenges that could hurt EV makers even more. For example, the Tech Sector is still struggling, and the recent implosion of SVB Financial (NASDAQ:SIVB) could make things worse, according to the firm.California is a big market for EVs (41% for Tesla) and tech (roughly 20% of California's economy), and if tech spending slows down more, the firm believes there could be more layoffs.Charles Schwab upgraded to Buy at CitiCiti upgraded Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) to Buy from Neutral while cutting its price target to $75.00 from $83.00 due to a compelling risk/reward at current levels after a 23% decline over the last two trading days.Although there may be some short-term revenue/earnings headwinds from rising funding costs and continued client cash sorting, the firm believes they are already reflected in the stock price. The firm doesn't see a significant risk of deposits leaving Charles Schwab due to the composition of its deposit base and customer protections.""Tapping supplemental fundings (FHLB, CDs, etc.) will present a near-term earnings headwind, but we expect these to be temporary measures and for the company to swap out these funding sources via organic sources ASAP,"" added the firm.Shares are down more than 3% pre-market today.3 more rating changesJPMorgan downgraded Under Armour (NYSE:UA) (NYSE:UAA) to Neutral from Overweight and cut its price target to $10.00 from $13.00.Story continues""Larger picture, management is now citing Summer to Fall '23 at the earliest for the ""inventory overhang"" to be worked through, which has created an elevated promotional environment across the sector ""longer than expected"" for UAA,"" said the firm.Under Armour expects its 2023 gross margin to decline by approximately 425bps year-over-year, with around 140bps of pressure from higher promotions and discounting.

23,a3d4be40-3570-3704-9a75-174c39dc7ad0,O,2023-03-13,AP sources: Biden OKs huge Willow oil project in Alaska,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ap-sources-biden-oks-huge-125722927.html,1678712242,STORY,"['COP', 'CL=F']","[WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration said Monday it is approving a huge oil-drilling project on Alaska’s petroleum-rich North Slope, a major environmental decision by President Joe Biden that drew quick condemnation as flying in the face of his pledges to slow climate change.The announcement came a day after the administration, in a move in the other direction toward conservation, said it would bar or limit drilling in some other areas of Alaska and the Arctic Ocean.The approval of ConocoPhillips' big Willow drilling project by the Bureau of Land Management will allow three drill sites including up to 199 total wells. Two other drill sites proposed for the project will be denied. ConocoPhillips Chairman and CEO Ryan Lance called the order “the right decision for Alaska and our nation.”The Houston-based company will relinquish rights to about 68,000 acres of existing leases in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.The order, one of the most significant of Interior Secretary Deb Haaland's tenure, was not signed by her but rather by her deputy, Tommy Beaudreau, who grew up in Alaska and briefed state lawmakers on the project Monday. Haaland was notably silent on the project, which she had opposed as a New Mexico congresswoman before becoming Interior secretary two years ago, until releasing a video Monday evening.She described Willow as “a difficult and complex issue that was inherited” from earlier administrations. Because ConocoPhillips has held leases in the area for decades, Haaland said officials ""had limited decision space” to block the project but focused on minimizing its footprint.Haaland defended the Biden administration's record on climate change, saying, “I am confident that we are on the right path, even if it’s not always a straight line.”Climate activists remained outraged that Biden approved the project, which they say puts his climate legacy at risk. Allowing the drilling plan to go forward marks a major breach of Biden’s campaign promise to stop new oil drilling on federal lands, they say.Story continuesMonday's announcement is not likely to be the last word, with litigation expected from environmental groups.The Willow project could produce up to 180,000 barrels of oil a day, create up to 2,500 jobs during construction and 300 long-term jobs, and generate billions of dollars in royalties and tax revenues for the federal, state and local governments, the company said.The project, located in the federally designated National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, enjoys widespread political support in the state. Alaska’s bipartisan congressional delegation met with Biden and his advisers in early March to plead their case for the project, and Alaska Native state lawmakers recently met with Haaland to urge support.Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said Monday the decision was “very good news for the country.”“Not only will this mean jobs and revenue for Alaska, it will be resources that are needed for the country and for our friends and allies,” Murkowski said. “The administration listened to Alaska voices. They listened to the delegation as we pressed the case for energy security and national security.”Fellow Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan said conditions attached to the project should not reduce Willow's ability to produce up to 180,000 barrels of crude a day. But he said it was “infuriating” that Biden also had moved to prevent or limit oil drilling elsewhere in Alaska.Environmental activists who have promoted a #StopWillow campaign on social media were fuming at the approval, which they called a betrayal.“This decision greenlights 92% of proposed oil drilling (by ConocoPhllips) and hands over one the most fragile, intact ecosystems in the world to"" the oil giant, said Earthjustice President Abigail Dillen. ""This is not climate leadership.''Biden understands the existential threat of climate change, ""but he is approving a project that derails his own climate goals,'' said Dillen, whose group vowed legal action to block the project.John Leshy, who was a top Interior Department lawyer in the Clinton administration, said Biden’s climate goals aren’t the only factor in an environmental review process that agencies must follow.Leshy, a professor at the University of California College of the Law, San Francisco, called the decision on Willow defensible, adding: “I think it reflects a balancing of the things they have to balance, which is the environmental impact and the lease rights that Conoco has.''Christy Goldfuss, a former Obama White House official who now is a policy chief at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said she was “deeply disappointed'' at Biden's decision to approve Willow, which the BLM estimates would produce more than 239 million metric tons of greenhouse gases over the project’s 30-year life, roughly equal to the combined emissions from 1.7 million passenger cars.""This decision is bad for the climate, bad for the environment and bad for the Native Alaska communities who oppose this and feel their voices were not heard,'' Goldfuss said.The Willow project has been a particularly galvanizing issue for young activists, who flooded TikTok with videos opposing the proposal.Biden has not commented publicly on the project's approval. However, he talked about climate change with Kal Penn, an actor who served in the White House under President Barack Obama, in an interview that was taped last week and will be aired Monday evening on Comedy Central's “The Daily Show.""“We're going faster than anyone has ever gone,” Biden said when asked about young people who want him to push harder. He said the energy situation “got really complicated” with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, adding that “we're going to need fossil fuel.”“So it’s a matter of transitioning, but it’s not like you can cut everything off immediately,” Biden said.Anticipating anger among environmental groups, the White House announced Sunday that Biden will prevent or limit oil drilling in 16 million acres in Alaska and the Arctic Ocean. The plan would bar drilling in nearly 3 million acres of the Beaufort Sea — closing it off from oil exploration — and limit drilling in more than 13 million acres in the National Petroleum Reserve.The withdrawal of the offshore area ensures that important habitat for whales, seals, polar bears and other wildlife “will be protected in perpetuity from extractive development,″ the White House said in a statement.The conservation announcement did little to mollify activists.“It’s a performative action to make the Willow project not look as bad,"" said Elise Joshi, the acting executive director of Gen-Z for Change, an advocacy organization.City of Nuiqsut Mayor Rosemary Ahtuangaruak, whose community of about 525 people is closest to the proposed development, has been outspoken in her opposition, worried about impacts to caribou and her residents’ subsistence lifestyles. ""My constituents and community will bear the burden of this project with our health and our livelihoods,'' she said.But there is “majority consensus” in the North Slope region supporting the project, said Nagruk Harcharek, president of the group Voice of the Arctic Iñupiat, whose members include leaders from across much of that region.The conservation actions announced Sunday block drilling in the Beaufort Sea and build on President Barack Obama’s actions to restrict drilling there and in the Chukchi Sea.Separately, the administration moved to protect more than 13 million acres within the petroleum reserve, a 23-million acre chunk of land on Alaska’s North Slope set aside a century ago for future oil production. Areas to be protected include the Teshekpuk Lake, Utukok Uplands, Colville River, Kasegaluk Lagoon and Peard Bay Special Areas, which serve as habitat for grizzly and polar bears, caribou and migratory birds.___Associated Press writers Becky Bohrer in Juneau, Alaska and Matthew Brown in Billings, Montana, contributed to this story.]"

The less-volatile four-week average also rose.There has been no obvious decline in Russia's seaborne exports since its troops invaded Ukraine more than a year ago, though there may have been an overall drop in flows because tankers have taken on some crude previously sent to Europe through the Druzhba pipeline. As yet, there’s no sign of flows being impacted by the 500,000-barrels-a-day output cut that Russia said it would impose in March.India overtook China as the biggest buyer of Russian seaborne crude in early November and has continued to buy more than its neighbor ever since. Increasing quantities of the Pacific ESPO crude grade are heading to India’s ports, after months in which Chinese refiners had snapped up almost every available shipment.India will not breach Western sanctions on Russia — including the price cap of $60 a barrel imposed on purchases of oil from Moscow -- according to people familiar with the matter, who said the authorities have asked banks and traders to adhere to the rules.The combined volume of crude on vessels heading to China and India plus smaller flows to Turkey and quantities on ships that haven’t yet shown a final destination rebounded in the latest four-week period, to an average 3.28 million barrels a day, setting a new high.Story continuesAs the ultimate destinations of cargoes loading in late January and early February become apparent, flows to China rose to new post-invasion highs. Historical patterns suggest that most of the cargoes currently identified as “Unknown Asia” and heading for the Suez Canal will end up in India.Ship-to-ship transfers of cargoes in the Mediterranean continue apace. This has been most visible off the Spanish north African city of Ceuta and off the Greek coast near Kalamata. At least 46 cargoes have been transferred between ships in those two locations since the start of the year. The volume transferred off the coast of Greece, mostly in the Bay of Lakonikos, soared in February, rising to more than 10 million barrels, equivalent to 360,000 barrels a day. That compares with 4.4 million barrels, equivalent to 156,000 barrels a day transferred off Ceuta.A tanker carrying a cargo of Russian crude remains anchored off the Ghanaian port of Tema more than two weeks after it arrived at the west African country. The National Petroleum Authority granted a delivery period for the cargo to be unloaded, but national security considerations have held up the process, according to people familiar with the matter.Crude Flows by DestinationCrude flows in the week to March 10 rose by 220,000 barrels a day from the previous week. On a four-week average basis, overall seaborne exports gained 116,000 barrels a day to 3.41 million barrels a day.All figures exclude cargoes identified as Kazakhstan’s KEBCO grade. Those are shipments made by KazTransoil JSC that transit Russia for export through the Baltic ports of Ust-Luga and Novorossiysk.The Kazakh barrels are blended with crude of Russian origin to create a uniform export grade. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Kazakhstan has rebranded its cargoes to distinguish them from those shipped by Russian companies. Transit crude is specifically exempted from European Union sanctions.AsiaMost Read from BloombergBonds Rally, Stocks Steady as Fed Rate Path Mulled: Markets WrapFed’s New Backstop Shields Banks From $300 Billion of LossesSignature Seized by Regulators as Pain Spreads From SVB’s FallFDIC Auction for Failed SVB Underway, Final Bids Due SundayUS Discusses Fund to Backstop Deposits If More Banks FailFour-week average shipments to Russia’s Asian customers, plus those on vessels showing no final destination rose to a new high of 3.19 million barrels a day in the period to March 10, up from 3.1 million barrels a day in the period to March 3.While the volumes heading to China and India appear to have declined, history shows that most of the cargoes on ships without an initial destination eventually end up in one or other of those countries.The equivalent of 682,000 barrels a day was on vessels showing destinations as either Port Said or Suez in Egypt, or which have already been or are expected to be transferred from one ship to another off the South Korean port of Yeosu. Those voyages typically end at ports in India and show up in the chart below as “Unknown Asia” until a final destination becomes apparent.The “Other Unknown” volumes, running at 558,000 barrels a day in the four weeks to March 10, are those on tankers showing a destination of Gibraltar, Malta or no destination at all. Most of those cargoes go on to transit the Suez Canal, but some could end up in Turkey. An increasing number are being transferred from one vessel to another in the Mediterranean for onward journeys to Asia.EuropeMost Read from BloombergBonds Rally, Stocks Steady as Fed Rate Path Mulled: Markets WrapFed’s New Backstop Shields Banks From $300 Billion of LossesSignature Seized by Regulators as Pain Spreads From SVB’s FallFDIC Auction for Failed SVB Underway, Final Bids Due SundayUS Discusses Fund to Backstop Deposits If More Banks FailRussia’s seaborne crude exports to European countries remained steady at 83,000 barrels a day in the 28 days to March 10, with Bulgaria the sole destination. These figures do not include shipments to Turkey.A market that consumed more than 1.5 million barrels a day of short-haul crude, coming from export terminals in the Baltic, Black Sea and Arctic has been lost almost completely, to be replaced by long-haul destinations in Asia that are much more costly and time-consuming to serve.No Russian crude was shipped to northern European countries in the four weeks to March 10.Exports to Turkey, Russia’s only remaining Mediterranean customer, rose to 141,000 barrels a day in the four weeks to March 10. Flows there are little more than one-third of the highs they reached in September and October.Despite not being a part of European sanctions on Russian crude exports, Turkey has become much less significant as a lifeline for Moscow since the EU import ban came into effect on Dec. 5. The Star refinery near Aliaga, owned by Azerbaijan’s Socar, is cutting down purchases of Russian crude, with flows to the plant averaging about 50,000 barrels a day in January and February, compared with an average of about 180,000 barrels a day from August to October.Flows to Bulgaria, now Russia’s only Black Sea market for crude, were stable. Despite Bulgaria securing a partial exemption from the EU’s import ban, Lukoil PJSC appears to be starting to use non-Russian crude in its refinery.Flows by Export LocationAggregate flows of Russian crude rose to 3.33 million barrels a day in the week to March 10. A drop in exports from Baltic and Arctic terminals was more than offset by increases in flows from the Black Sea and the Pacific.Figures exclude volumes from Ust-Luga and Novorossiysk identified as Kazakhstan’s KEBCO grade.Export RevenueInflows to the Kremlin's war chest from its crude-export duty rose by $5 million to $45 million in the seven days to March 10, while four-week average income rose by $2 million to $43 million.President Vladimir Putin signed into law amendments to the way Russia’s oil price is assessed for tax purposes. From April, rates of mineral extraction tax and profit-based tax on oil companies will be calculated using a decreasing discount to prevailing Brent prices, rather than assessments of Urals crude. Export duty, which will be phased out at the end of 2023, will not be affected by the change.The duty rate for March has been set at $1.94 a barrel, the first increase since December, and is based on a Urals price of $50.51 a barrel during the assessment period that ran from Jan. 15 to Feb. 14.Origin-to-Location FlowsThe following charts show the number of ships leaving each export terminal and the destinations of crude cargoes from the four export regions.A total of 31 tankers loaded 23.3 million barrels of Russian crude in the week to March 10, vessel-tracking data and port agent reports show. That’s up by 1.5 million barrels, or 7%, from the previous week. Destinations are based on where vessels signal they are heading at the time of writing, and some will almost certainly change as voyages progress. All figures exclude cargoes identified as Kazakhstan’s KEBCO grade.The total volume on ships loading Russian crude from Baltic terminals fell for the first time in five weeks, dropping to 1.36 million barrels a day.Shipments from Novorossiysk in the Black Sea jumped to a three-month high of 688,000 barrels a day.Arctic shipments slumped to a four-week low, with one Suezmax tanker loading in the week to March 10.Flows from the Pacific recovered half of the the previous week’s loss. Eleven tankers loaded at the region’s three export terminals in the week to March 10, up from eight the previous week.An increasing volume of ESPO crude is heading to India, with four out of 11 cargoes loading so far this month, compared with two out of a total 30 shipments in February.The volumes heading to unknown destinations are all Sokol cargoes that have recently been transferred to other vessels at Yeosu, or are currently being shuttled to an area off the South Korean port from the loading terminal at De Kastri.Note: This story forms part of a regular weekly series tracking shipments of crude from Russian export terminals and the export duty revenues earned from them by the Russian government.Note: All figures exclude cargoes owned by Kazakhstan’s KazTransOil JSC, which transit Russia and are shipped from Novorossiysk and Ust-Luga as KEBCO grade crude.Note: Data on crude flows can also be found at {DSET CRUDEJ }.

Following a recent meeting between Russian and Pakistani officials, Russia has asked Pakistan to purchase and import one cargo as a test case.According to the News, Pakistan will test the cost of landed oil cargo from Russia by importing one cargo.Other reports said last week that the first cargo from Russia—the one to test the costs and increase the “trust” between the parties – could depart from Russia by next month.Pakistan hasn’t been a major importer of Russian oil and gas so far.Many large customers in Asia haven’t joined the price cap mechanism, but China and India, for example – Russia’s top crude oil buyers now – are demanding steep discounts for the Russian grades.Meanwhile, Pakistan’s economic and energy crises have deepened in recent months as the South Asian country is trying to negotiate a new deal for a loan with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  Story continuesBy Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:SpaceX Is Leading The Private Space RaceHow Recycling Could Solve The Battery Metals ShortageThese Countries Have The Lowest Inflation In The WorldRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

West Texas Intermediate crude futures (WTI) ticked up by 23 cents, or 0.30%, to $76.91 a barrel.Market sentiment was fragile as worries about further monetary tightening by the Fed have been exacerbated by high crude oil inventories in the U.S., analysts from ANZ Bank said in a note on Monday morning.""It's like the battle of surging activity data in the East meets macro malaise in the West"", said Stephen Innes, managing partner of SPI Asset Management, commenting on the competing sentiment drivers in the crude market.""From an oil trader's perspective, the U.S. dollar should pull back as traders give up on a re-acceleration of Fed hikes; this, in turn, clears a path for more robust Chinese fundamentals to dominate commodity trading,"" Innes added.A weaker dollar makes oil cheaper for holders of other currencies, lending support to oil prices.The failure of Silicon Valley Bank and New York-based Signature Bank and concerns about possible contagion led to a selloff in U.S. assets at the end of last week, which has also put downward pressure on the dollar.Comments on Sunday from Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser on crude demand from China also provided some support.""If you considered China opening up and a pick up in jet fuels and very limited spare capacity, we are talking 2 million barrels, so as I said we are cautiously optimistic in the short to midterm and the market will remain tightly balanced,"" he said.The comments come in the wake of the announcement that Riyadh and Tehran had agreed to restore diplomatic relations in a China-brokered deal, potentially paving the way to the revival of a nuclear deal that would allow exports of currently-sanctioned Iranian crude.Oil's fluctuating start to the week follows positive momentum on Friday, when U.S. employment data surprised to the upside.

That would lift China’s share of the mineral critical to electric-vehicle batteries to 32% of global supply, from 24% last year, according to a note on Friday.The race to secure lithium is playing out at the highest levels, with nations including the US prioritizing access to the materials necessary for making batteries as the world turns away from fossil fuels. China’s needs are particularly acute because it’s home to the world’s biggest market for new energy vehicles.The rise in Chinese output will include an increase in material derived from lepidolite, a lithium-bearing rock often overlooked as poor quality and environmentally unsound because of its low yield and high energy costs.

Furthermore, compared to its low in November, Bitcoin has risen by more than 53%. Yet, despite a strong correlation between crypto-exposed stocks and bitcoin, a number of crypto-exposed stocks including Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MARA), Riot Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIOT), and CleanSpark, Inc. (NASDAQ:CLSK) were in the red and analysts attribute this to bitcoin's weakened relationship with the stock market compared to previous years.The crypto market is also seeing a regulatory crackdown. According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, the Securities and Exchange Commission has been investigating violations of investor-protection laws by different currencies. The SEC has already reduced the power of some middlemen offering lending services for cryptocurrencies. Coinbase Global Inc (NASDAQ:COIN), is one of the companies that has disclosed being investigated by the SEC, and Forbes predicts these will make it harder for crypto exchanges to keep customers' crypto assets secure.Despite this, some crypto markets still have long-term growth potential. According to Blaxberg, when Bitcoin hits $25,000 as forecasted, it will be a major psychological boost for crypto investors. According to the Coin Telegraph, venture capitalist firms also poured investments worth $14.2 billion in the first half of 2022. While the rate of investments slowed down in the second half of 2022 due to the crypto winter, analysts predict them to increase again as the values of cryptocurrencies resurge.Story continuesWith the rise of the digital realm, which was further boosted by the Covid-19 pandemic, investing in the digital space seems to have enormous potential. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are all companies that have invested heavily in the crypto market.10 Most Profitable Cryptocurrency StocksPhoto by Austin Distel on UnsplashLet's now take a look at the 10 most profitable cryptocurrency stocks.Our MethodologyFor our shortlisting, we looked at all the major cryptocurrency companies in the world by market capitalization and revenue.

40,b7fbdb27-a937-32c5-b31a-3cfa57198639,ADM,2023-03-13,Estimating The Intrinsic Value Of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estimating-intrinsic-value-archer-daniels-110107943.html,1678705267,STORY,['ADM'],"[Key InsightsArcher-Daniels-Midland's estimated fair value is US$75.50 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityWith US$76.66 share price, Archer-Daniels-Midland appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value The US$99.43 analyst price target for ADM is 32% more than our estimate of fair valueToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland Crunching The NumbersWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.97bUS$3.05bUS$2.83bUS$2.17bUS$2.12bUS$2.11bUS$2.11bUS$2.12bUS$2.14bUS$2.17bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ -0.85%Est @ 0.03%Est @ 0.64%Est @ 1.07%Est @ 1.37% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.8% US$2.8kUS$2.7kUS$2.3kUS$1.7kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.3kUS$1.3kUS$1.2kUS$1.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$17bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.2b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.8%– 2.1%) = US$47bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$47b÷ ( 1 + 6.8%)10= US$24bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$41b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$76.7, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Archer-Daniels-Midland as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Archer-Daniels-MidlandStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Food market.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

USDOT unveiled a government dashboard highlighting airline commitments.Southwest Airlines Chief Executive Bob Jordan said last week the airline is in discussions with USDOT about the family seating dashboard. Southwest, which has an open seating plan, lets parents traveling with children six or younger board ahead of some other passengers.Jordan says he believes the percentage of time families cannot find seats together on Southwest ""is much, much lower"" than other airlines.Airlines for America, which represents large U.S. airlines, says its carriers do not charge for family seating, but most do not include commitments in customer service plans. Carriers not honoring written commitments can face USDOT enforcement actions.USDOT has begun drafting regulations to end all family seating fees but that could take years to finalize.President Joe Biden in February urged airlines to take the action, saying, ""Baggage fees are bad enough - airlines can't treat your child like a piece of baggage.""

(NYSE:PM) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Philip Morris International The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$9.47bUS$10.9bUS$11.7bUS$12.3bUS$12.8bUS$13.3bUS$13.7bUS$14.1bUS$14.5bUS$14.8bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x7Analyst x6Est @ 5.10%Est @ 4.19%Est @ 3.55%Est @ 3.11%Est @ 2.80%Est @ 2.58%Est @ 2.43% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.8% US$8.9kUS$9.6kUS$9.6kUS$9.5kUS$9.2kUS$8.9kUS$8.6kUS$8.3kUS$8.0kUS$7.7k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$88bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$15b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.8%– 2.1%) = US$318bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$318b÷ ( 1 + 6.8%)10= US$164bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$253b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$98.4, the company appears quite good value at a 40% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance.

It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

PM has been benefiting from its focus on expanding in the smoke-free products arena. Strong pricing power has also been working well for the company, which is expecting certain margin pressures in the first half of 2023. Let’s delve deeper.Factors Working WellThe company is progressing well with its business transformation, with smoke-free products generating 36% of its net revenues in the fourth quarter of 2022. PM is well placed to become a majority smoke-free company by 2025. Toward this end, the company’s IQOS, a heat-not-burn device, counts as one of the leading RRPs in the industry.  The company expects such advanced and high-quality products to aid adult smokers in switching from traditional cigarettes to smoke-free options.  In the fourth quarter of 2022, revenues from smoke-free products (excluding Wellness and Healthcare) jumped 23% to $2,866 million. In the quarter, the company witnessed continued strength in IQOS performance. Total IQOS users at the end of the fourth quarter were estimated at roughly 24.9 million (including nearly 17.8 million who switched to IQOS and stopped smoking). For 2023, management expects heated tobacco unit (HTU) shipment volumes of 125-130 billion units, suggesting 15-19% year-over-year growth.Among other initiatives, Philip Morris became the majority owner of Swedish Match on Nov 11, 2022. Management expects a robust performance from Swedish Match’s existing operations in 2023. Further, on Jan 30, 2023, Philip Morris unveiled a long-term partnership with KT&amp;G to continue commercializing the innovative smoke-free devices and consumables of the latter on a unique, worldwide basis (excluding South Korea). The deal covers 15 years and is likely to enhance Philip Morris’ smoke-free product portfolio.Moving on, the company has been benefiting from its strong pricing power. Though higher pricing might lead to a possible decline in cigarette consumption, it is seen that smokers tend to absorb price increases owing to the addictive quality of cigarettes. Higher pricing variance was an upside to the company’s performance (mainly due to increased combustible tobacco pricing) in the fourth quarter of 2022.  During the quarter, both the top and bottom lines improved year over year and beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.Story continuesPhilip Morris International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePhilip Morris International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePhilip Morris International Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Philip Morris International Inc. QuoteNot All is RosyPhilip Morris has been battling cost-related headwinds for a while now. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the adjusted operating income margin was somewhat affected by increased manufacturing costs (mainly due to escalated logistics costs and other inflationary impacts). In 2023, the adjusted operating margin on an organic basis is likely to decline 50-150 basis points.Management expects certain margin pressures in the first half of 2023. It expects the first quarter to be the most difficult, wherein it expects earnings per share (EPS) in the band of $1.28-$1.33, including currency headwinds. This reflects HTU shipment volumes of 26-28 billion units, organic top-line growth in the low-single digits and lower margins. Apart from these, the company expects increased net interest costs of around $200 million for 2023 compared with the 2022 levels.Wrapping UpPhilip Morris is likely to continue benefiting from its robust pricing actions and smoke-free portfolio strength amid cost inflation and other headwinds.For 2023, management expects net revenues to increase 7-8.5% on an organic basis, driven by higher combustible pricing and the continued progress of IQOS. The adjusted EPS is envisioned in the range of $6.25-$6.37, including currency headwinds.

""February volumes and spot rates gave carriers little incentive to move away from contracted freight.""The DAT Truckload Volume Index (TVI) for van freight was 207, down 8% compared to January and 5% lower year over year. The reefer TVI fell to 162, 7.9% lower month over month and down 4.7% year over year. The flatbed TVI was virtually unchanged at 217 and was 7.9% higher year over year. It’s not uncommon for the number of loads moved to be lower compared to January in part because February is a shorter month.Van rates fell to August 2020 levelsNational average spot van and reefer rates fell to two-and-a-half-year lows.The spot van rate was $2.24 per mile, down 14 cents compared to January and 63 cents less than the average contract van rate. The spot van rate in February was the lowest monthly average since August 2020 and was down 85 cents compared to February 2022.The spot reefer rate dropped 19 cents to $2.59 a mile, 57 cents less than the average contract rate for reefer freight. The rate was 95 cents lower year over year and the lowest monthly average since October 2020.The flatbed rate fell by 6 cents to $2.70 per mile, 73 cents lower than the average contract rate and 51 cents less year over year.Story continuesLine-haul rates, which subtract an amount equal to an average fuel surcharge, declined to pre-holiday levels. Van line-haul rates averaged $1.71 a mile, down 12 cents compared to January, while reefer line-haul rates averaged $2.01 a mile, down 17 cents. The flatbed line-haul rate dipped 2 cents to $2.07 a mile.Lower diesel prices in February pushed fuel surcharges to 12-month lows, averaging 53 cents a mile for van freight, 58 cents for reefers and 63 cents for flatbeds.Load-to-truck ratios reflect weak demandLoad-to-truck ratios reflect truckload supply and demand on the spot market and are leading indicators of the direction of rates.The national average van load-to-truck ratio fell from 3.0 to 2.5, meaning there were 2.5 loads for every van posted to the DAT One marketplace last month. The ratio was 13.7 in February 2022.The reefer ratio averaged 3.8, down from 4.9 in January and 10 points less than in February 2022.The flatbed ratio was 13.6, up from 12.5. It was 83.9 in February 2022.About the DAT Truckload Volume IndexThe DAT Truckload Volume Index reflects the change in the number of loads with a pickup date during that month; the actual index number is normalized each month to accommodate any new data sources without distortion. A baseline of 100 equals the number of loads moved in January 2015, as recorded in DAT RateView, a truckload pricing database and analysis tool with rates paid on an average of 3 million loads per month.Spot truckload rates are negotiated for each load and paid to the carrier by a freight broker. National average spot rates are derived from payments to carriers by freight brokers, third-party logistics providers and other transportation buyers for hauls of 250 miles or more with a pickup date during the month reported.

Moreover, the figure increased 1.3% year over year.This performance was backed by a better-than-expected top line. Its results were aided by a healthy operating performance and growth in occupancy levels. This retail REIT behemoth issued its 2023 comparable FFO per share outlook in the range of $11.70-$11.95.Analysts, too, seem bullish on this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 funds from operations (FFO) per share indicates a favorable outlook as it has increased marginally upward over the past month.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet us now decipher the factors behind the increase in the stock price.Improving Leasing Environment: The increase in consumers’ preference for in-person shopping experience following the pandemic downtime has been driving the recovery in the retail real estate industry. Retailers continue to rent out more physical store spaces to meet this growing demand. As a result, Simon Property’s portfolio of premium assets in the United States and abroad has been experiencing solid leasing activity.In 2022, it signed 1,262 new leases and 1,517 renewal leases (excluding mall anchors and majors, new development, redevelopment and leases with terms of one year or less) with a fixed minimum rent across its U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets portfolio.Healthy Operating Performance: The occupancy for Simon Property’s U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets portfolio improved 150 basis points year over year to 94.9% as of Dec 31, 2022. Also, the base-minimum rent per square foot for this portfolio was $55.13 on Dec 31, 2022, rising from $53.91 as of Dec 30, 2021.   In the trailing 12 months ended Dec 31, 2022, the retailer sales per square foot touched another record high of $753 for the malls and the outlets combined. This reflected an increase of 5.6% year over year.Focus on Omni-Chanel Strategy: Simon Property’s adoption of an omni-channel strategy and successful tie-ups with premium retailers have paid off well. Its online retail platform, coupled with an omni-channel strategy, is likely to be accretive to its long-term growth. Further, its efforts to explore the mixed-use development option, which has gained immense popularity in recent years, has enabled it to tap the growth opportunities in areas where people prefer to live, work and play.Balance Sheet Strength: The company maintains a solid balance-sheet position with ample liquidity. It exited 2022 with $7.8 billion of liquidity and a fixed-charge coverage ratio of 4.8, which is well ahead of the required level. SPG also enjoys investment-grade credit ratings, giving it favorable access to the debt market.SPG’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) is 60.33% compared with the industry’s average of 6.01%. This reflects that the company is more efficient in using shareholders’ funds than its peers.With strong financial footing and enough financial flexibility, it is well-placed to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.Dividends: Solid dividend payouts remain the biggest enticement for REIT investors, and SPG has consistently raised its dividend rates. Concurrent with the third-quarter earnings release on Nov 1, 2022, SPG announced a 2.9% sequential hike in its fourth-quarter 2022 dividend to $1.80 per share. Prior to this, the company increased its third-quarter 2022 dividend to $1.75 per share from $1.70 paid earlier. Such efforts boost investors’ confidence in the stock.Nonetheless, given the convenience of online shopping, it is likely to remain a popular choice among consumers, affecting the market share for brick-and-mortar stores. Also, interest rate hikes add to its concerns.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are Federal Realty Investment Trust FRT, Essential Properties Realty Trust EPRT and Tanger Factory Outlet Centers SKT, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

The ESR protocol has resulted in an up to 44% decrease in opioid usage for some surgeries.""Receiving this award for the 13th time would not be possible without the integrity and dedication of the approximately 294,000 HCA Healthcare colleagues across the country and in the UK,"" said Kathi Whalen, senior vice president and chief ethics and compliance officer at HCA Healthcare.

(NYSE:TJX)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/declining-stock-decent-financials-market-130027982.html,1678712427,STORY,['TJX'],"[With its stock down 7.4% over the past month, it is easy to disregard TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX). But if you pay close attention, you might find that its key financial indicators look quite decent, which could mean that the stock could potentially rise in the long-term given how markets usually reward more resilient long-term fundamentals. Particularly, we will be paying attention to TJX Companies'  ROE today.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for TJX Companies How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for TJX Companies is:55% = US$3.5b ÷ US$6.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.55.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.TJX Companies' Earnings Growth And 55% ROEFirst thing first, we like that TJX Companies has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 29% which is quite remarkable. Despite this, TJX Companies' five year net income growth was quite flat over the past five years. We reckon that there could be some other factors at play here that's limiting the company's growth. These include low earnings retention or poor allocation of capitalStory continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that TJX Companies' reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 29% in the same period, which is not something we like to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is TJX worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether TJX is currently mispriced by the market.Is TJX Companies Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?In spite of a normal three-year median payout ratio of 40% (or a retention ratio of 60%), TJX Companies hasn't seen much growth in its earnings. Therefore, there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.In addition, TJX Companies has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 38% of its profits over the next three years. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that TJX Companies' future ROE will be 64% which is again, similar to the current ROE.ConclusionIn total, it does look like TJX Companies has some positive aspects to its business. However, given the high ROE and high profit retention, we would expect the company to be delivering strong earnings growth, but that isn't the case here. This suggests that there might be some external threat to the business, that's hampering its growth. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

That would lift China’s share of the mineral critical to electric-vehicle batteries to 32% of global supply, from 24% last year, according to a note on Friday.The race to secure lithium is playing out at the highest levels, with nations including the US prioritizing access to the materials necessary for making batteries as the world turns away from fossil fuels. China’s needs are particularly acute because it’s home to the world’s biggest market for new energy vehicles.The rise in Chinese output will include an increase in material derived from lepidolite, a lithium-bearing rock often overlooked as poor quality and environmentally unsound because of its low yield and high energy costs. UBS sees lepidolite in China accounting for 280,000 tons of lithium in 2025, or 13% of global supply, from 88,000 tons last year, as the government continues to support the sector.Beijing has already moved to curb unlicensed lepidolite extraction in Jiangxi province, a major mining hub, as it seeks to exert more control over its deposits.The Week’s Diary(All times Beijing unless noted.)Monday, March 13Last day of National People’s Congress in BeijingTuesday, March 14Nothing major scheduledWednesday, March 15China sets monthly medium-term lending rate, 09:20China industrial output for Jan.-Feb., including steel &amp; aluminum; coal, gas &amp; power generation; and crude oil &amp; refining. 10:00Retail sales, fixed assets, property investment, residential property sales, jobless rateCCTD’s weekly online briefing on China’s coal market, 15:00Mysteel Southeastern China Aluminum Summit in Foshan, Guangdong, day 1EARNINGS: CGN Power, Daqo New Energy, Power AssetsStory continuesThursday, March 16China new home prices for February, 09:30China Hydrogen Summit in Shanghai, day 1Mysteel Southeastern China Aluminum Summit, Foshan, Guangdong, day 2EARNINGS: RusalFriday, March 17China Jan.-Feb. output data for base metals and oil productsChina weekly iron ore port stockpilesShanghai exchange weekly commodities inventory, ~15:30China Hydrogen Summit in Shanghai, day 2Mysteel Southeastern China Aluminum Summit, Foshan, Guangdong, day 3EARNINGS: CMOC, Hong Kong &amp; China GasSaturday, March 18China’s 2nd batch of Jan.-Feb. trade data, including agricultural imports; LNG &amp; pipeline gas imports; oil products trade breakdown; alumina, copper and rare-earth product exports; bauxite, steel &amp; aluminum product importsOn The WireChinese President Xi Jinping capped this year’s National People’s Congress by securing a third, norm-defying term in office and shaping some of the policies that will steer the world’s second-largest economy through the year ahead.--With assistance from Annie Lee.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe SVB Collapse Threatens an Already Fragile EconomyBrazil’s Surprise Oil Tax Puts $20 Billion in Investment at RiskGlencore CEO Rides Coal Windfall on the Way to a Low-Carbon WorldFoxconn Finds EVs Are Harder to Build Than iPhonesInside TikTok’s Fight to Avoid a US Ban©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Spot gold jumped 0.6% to $1,878.92 an ounce, while gold futures surged 0.9% to $1,883.25 an ounce by 21:06 ET (02:06 GMT).Over the weekend, the Fed rolled out emergency measures to make borrowing easier for embattled banks. The White House also assured Silicon Valley Bank depositors that it will cover all withdrawals.“It looks for now as if the Fed’s rapid action may have forestalled a larger problem. What it also does, is make a 50bps rate hike at the March FOMC meeting look fairly unlikely,” analysts at ING wrote in a note.Silicon Valley Bank’s failure highlight the deepening cracks in the U.S. economy caused by a rapid increase in interest rates. The Fed had embarked on its most hawkish hiking spree in over 50 years to curb runaway inflation.But this weighed heavily on metal markets, as rising yields drove up the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets. Still, the prospect of a less hawkish Fed spurred broader gains in metal prices.Data showing an easing in wage growth also helped calm markets over a hawkish Fed.

As of midnight Sunday, USDC had recovered and was trading at near exact parity with the U.S. dollar.On Sunday night, Circle put out a press release confirming that $3.3 billion in SVB deposits—which were part of the reserves that back the USDC coin—were safe, and that the token remains redeemable 1:1 with the dollar.The company also announced that it had added Cross River Bank—known for providing banking services to the likes of Visa, Coinbase and fintech companies—as a new commercial banking partner for the purposes of minting and redeeming USDC. Circle also announced other ""expanded relationships"" for USDC redemptions that include BNY Mellon, which already provides custody services for the company's reserves.Circle's announcement also noted that it had no exposure to Silvergate, a crypto friendly bank that announced on Sunday it would voluntarily liquidate its holdings as part of a takeover process by federal regulators.This weekend's USDC turmoil was part of a broader financial conflagration set off by the shocking collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), which was the sixteenth biggest bank in the country and a financial pillar of the tech and venture capital world. The failure of SVB triggered a panic as the thousands of companies, including Circle, were unable to access billions in deposits. On Sunday, the Federal Reserve and other agencies calmed markets by announcing depositor at SBV would be made whole.In the case of Circle, the upshot of all this is that the company appears to have survived the weekend crisis and sought to minimize further risk by strengthening ties with larger financial institutions. In addition to its deepening ties with BNY Mellon, Circle also relies on the giant asset manager BlackRock to handle transactions related to its USDC reserves.Story continuesThis story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeHow to save $750 a month, according to financial advisersChatGPT helped me make a plan to buy a $500,000 home, but experts warn me it's a bad ideaThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home ]"

Now at its lowest level since August 2020Item shortages are minimal, and businesses unwind their safety stocks to make inventories leaner CLARK, N.J., March 13, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index — a leading indicator tracking demand conditions, shortages, transportation costs, inventories and backlogs — improved further in February to 0.48, from 0.97 in January, indicating the lowest level of stress across the world's supply chains since August 2020.GEP Logo (PRNewsfoto/GEP)Demand for raw materials and components, while remaining depressed, especially in the U.K., eased in February in North America. Notably, procurement and supply managers in Asia are reporting an uplift in purchasing for the first time since July 2022.Commenting on the February data, Michael Seitz, vice president of consulting, GEP Asia, said: ""The world's supply chains are much improved and now operating very efficiently. For the first time since July 2022, input demand across Asia entered positive territory, with the region reporting healthier supplier order books, which will likely fuel prices and inflation.""The key findings from February's data:DEMAND: Global demand for components, raw materials, commodities, and items that companies require for their goods and services remains depressed, but the trend improved during February as procurement leaders in Asia increased purchasing.INVENTORIES: Notably, global companies are unwinding their safety stocks as falling lead times, improved material supplies and an uncertain economic outlook prompt more businesses to make inventories leaner. Reports of stockpiling are now at their lowest in two-and-a-half years.LABOR SHORTAGES: Labor shortages are having little adverse effect on supplier capacity, indicating that staffing levels are sufficient to deal with workloads and demand.MATERIAL SHORTAGES: Business reports of item shortages are at their lowest since September 2020 as global supply and demand forces become more aligned.TRANSPORTATION: Global transportation costs have normalized and remain stable due to lower pressures on shipping, rail, air, and road freight.REGIONAL SUPPLY CHAIN VOLATILITY: Europe continues to be the greatest bottleneck for suppliers, although pressures are easing. Notably, suppliers to U.K. and North American companies saw spare capacity rise for the first time since summer 2020.Story continuesFor more information, visit www.gep.com/volatilityNote: Full historic data dating back to January 2005 is available.

The GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index is derived from S&amp;P Global's PMI™ surveys, sent to companies in over 40 countries, totaling around 27,000 companies. These countries account for 89% of global gross domestic product (GDP) (source: World Bank World Development Indicators).The headline figure is the GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index. This is a weighted sum of six sub-indices derived from PMI data, PMI Comments Trackers and PMI Commodity Price &amp; Supply Indicators compiled by S&amp;P Global.The GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index is calculated using a weighted sum of the z-scores of the six indices. Weights are determined by analyzing the impact each component has on suppliers' delivery times through regression analysis.The six variables used are 1) JP Morgan Global Quantity of Purchases Index, 2) All Items Supply Shortages Indicator, 3) Transport Price Pressure Indicator, and Manufacturing PMI Comments Tracker data for 4) stockpiling due to supply or price concerns, and backlogs rising due to 5) staff shortages and 6) item shortages.A value above 0 indicates that supply chain capacity is being stretched and supply chain volatility is increasing. The further above 0, the greater the extent to which capacity is being stretched.A value below 0 indicates that supply chain capacity is being underutilized, reducing supply chain volatility. The further below 0, the greater the extent to which capacity is being underutilized.A Supply Chain Volatility Index is also published at a regional level for Europe, Asia, North America and the U.K. The regional indices measure the performance of supply chains connected to those parts of the world.For more information on PMI surveys, PMI Comments Trackers and PMI Commodity Price &amp; Supply Indicators, or the GEP Supply Chain Volatility Index methodologies, please contact economics@spglobal.com.About GEPGEP® delivers transformative supply chain solutions that help global enterprises become more agile and resilient, operate more efficiently and effectively, gain competitive advantage, boost profitability and increase shareholder value.

Meanwhile, questions are swirling around the Fed’s policy path as the central bank enters its quiet period before its March 22 rate decision.With Fed officials silent, all eyes are on Tuesday’s release of the consumer price index, after last week’s jobs data signaled inflation may be cooling. It sets the stage for a make-or-break stretch for stocks leading up to the central bank’s announcement and Chair Jerome Powell’s subsequent discussion of the path forward.“There’s heightened sensitivity among investors to the CPI data, especially given what’s happening in the banking sector and concerns that the Fed’s interest-rate cycle is starting to have rippling effects throughout the economy,” said Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment strategist at BMO Wealth Management. “This is somewhat of a fragile time for equities.”The CPI report is expected to give further evidence of ebbing inflation pressures, with forecasts calling for an annual growth rate of 6% in February, down from 6.4% in January. Should that be the case, it could strengthen reemerging bets in the swaps market that the Fed will end its tightening campaign around mid-year and cut rates by year-end, laying the foundation for an equities rebound in the second half of 2023.Story continuesRisky DaysIt’s been a brutal year for stocks since the Fed began its tightening campaign on March 16, 2022. Rising rates dented the allure of technology and growth shares for most of last year, with the Nasdaq 100 Index plunging 33% in its largest drop since 2008. The S&amp;P 500 also posted its biggest annual decline since the global financial crisis, tumbling 19%.Stocks rallied to start 2023, but have since come back down, with the S&amp;P 500 essentially flat for the year. So this week’s economic figures carry plenty of risk. Any sign that inflation is still stubbornly elevated may reignite bets on a more hawkish Fed, putting pressure on expensive corners of the stock market, such as technology.At the end of last week, swaps traders downshifted wagers on the Fed’s peak rate to roughly 5.3% at midyear from as high as 5.7% in September just days earlier. That shift fueled the biggest tumble in two-year Treasury yields since 2008. Traders are also now favoring a quarter-point Fed increase this month instead of a half, from its current range of 4.5%-4.75%.In addition, near-term anxiety is on full display in stocks. A gauge of projected S&amp;P 500 turbulence over the next two weeks — which includes updates on CPI and producer prices, the Fed decision and S&amp;P Global services PMI data — is hovering near 25, some 3.2 points above the expected volatility two months from now. That’s the widest gap since October.“The jobs data together with the inflation print and the Fed’s rate decision will give investors a good sense of how the Fed’s path to price stability is going to look,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial.The key issue facing Wall Street is how close the Fed is to ending its rate increases — a juncture that historically has delivered double-digit returns for equities.The past eight hiking cycles saw the Fed continue to lift its benchmark until it was above CPI, according to Carson Investment Research. That means there still could be more room for the Fed to lift rates to tame high prices.“This is a very nervous market, but the Fed’s medicine is working,” said Eric Diton, president and managing director of The Wealth Alliance. It takes one to two years for rate hikes to filter “through the economy so the next few months will probably be bumpy for stock investors.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekNext Big Job Cuts Will Be in Finance and Health Care, Data ShowThe Digital Age Ushers in a Speedier, More Viral Breed of Bank RunThe Biggest Winner of the Gas Stove Fight Is Induction RangesThe Promise of Higher Pay Woos MBAs, Yet Earnings Haven’t Kept Up With InflationEven Wealthy Landlords Are Skipping Payments on Office Buildings©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

That would lift China’s share of the mineral critical to electric-vehicle batteries to 32% of global supply, from 24% last year, according to a note on Friday.The race to secure lithium is playing out at the highest levels, with nations including the US prioritizing access to the materials necessary for making batteries as the world turns away from fossil fuels. China’s needs are particularly acute because it’s home to the world’s biggest market for new energy vehicles.The rise in Chinese output will include an increase in material derived from lepidolite, a lithium-bearing rock often overlooked as poor quality and environmentally unsound because of its low yield and high energy costs. UBS sees lepidolite in China accounting for 280,000 tons of lithium in 2025, or 13% of global supply, from 88,000 tons last year, as the government continues to support the sector.Beijing has already moved to curb unlicensed lepidolite extraction in Jiangxi province, a major mining hub, as it seeks to exert more control over its deposits.The Week’s Diary(All times Beijing unless noted.)Monday, March 13Last day of National People’s Congress in BeijingTuesday, March 14Nothing major scheduledWednesday, March 15China sets monthly medium-term lending rate, 09:20China industrial output for Jan.-Feb., including steel &amp; aluminum; coal, gas &amp; power generation; and crude oil &amp; refining. 10:00Retail sales, fixed assets, property investment, residential property sales, jobless rateCCTD’s weekly online briefing on China’s coal market, 15:00Mysteel Southeastern China Aluminum Summit in Foshan, Guangdong, day 1EARNINGS: CGN Power, Daqo New Energy, Power AssetsStory continuesThursday, March 16China new home prices for February, 09:30China Hydrogen Summit in Shanghai, day 1Mysteel Southeastern China Aluminum Summit, Foshan, Guangdong, day 2EARNINGS: RusalFriday, March 17China Jan.-Feb. output data for base metals and oil productsChina weekly iron ore port stockpilesShanghai exchange weekly commodities inventory, ~15:30China Hydrogen Summit in Shanghai, day 2Mysteel Southeastern China Aluminum Summit, Foshan, Guangdong, day 3EARNINGS: CMOC, Hong Kong &amp; China GasSaturday, March 18China’s 2nd batch of Jan.-Feb. trade data, including agricultural imports; LNG &amp; pipeline gas imports; oil products trade breakdown; alumina, copper and rare-earth product exports; bauxite, steel &amp; aluminum product importsOn The WireChinese President Xi Jinping capped this year’s National People’s Congress by securing a third, norm-defying term in office and shaping some of the policies that will steer the world’s second-largest economy through the year ahead.--With assistance from Annie Lee.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe SVB Collapse Threatens an Already Fragile EconomyBrazil’s Surprise Oil Tax Puts $20 Billion in Investment at RiskGlencore CEO Rides Coal Windfall on the Way to a Low-Carbon WorldFoxconn Finds EVs Are Harder to Build Than iPhonesInside TikTok’s Fight to Avoid a US Ban©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Spot gold jumped 0.6% to $1,878.92 an ounce, while gold futures surged 0.9% to $1,883.25 an ounce by 21:06 ET (02:06 GMT).Over the weekend, the Fed rolled out emergency measures to make borrowing easier for embattled banks. The White House also assured Silicon Valley Bank depositors that it will cover all withdrawals.“It looks for now as if the Fed’s rapid action may have forestalled a larger problem. What it also does, is make a 50bps rate hike at the March FOMC meeting look fairly unlikely,” analysts at ING wrote in a note.Silicon Valley Bank’s failure highlight the deepening cracks in the U.S. economy caused by a rapid increase in interest rates. The Fed had embarked on its most hawkish hiking spree in over 50 years to curb runaway inflation.But this weighed heavily on metal markets, as rising yields drove up the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets. Still, the prospect of a less hawkish Fed spurred broader gains in metal prices.Data showing an easing in wage growth also helped calm markets over a hawkish Fed.

The first was the exclusivity decision squashed by the Court,"" he told the General Court.He said the 3G baseband chipsets singled out in the case accounted for just 0.7% of the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) market and thus it was not possible for Qualcomm to shut out rivals from the chipset market.""What price should Qualcomm have charged for each chipset and each quarter to allow it to pass the price cost test?"" Rato said.Qualcomm's actions showed it was determined to eliminate a rival before it could pose a competitive threat, Commission lawyer Carlos Urraca Caviedes told the court.""Icera was about to gain a solid foothold in the market segment which was strategically important for future growth. Qualcomm feared that if it did not take action, Icera would grow to expand and become a formidable rival,"" he said.The court will rule in the coming months. The case is T-671/19 Qualcomm v Commission.($1 = 0.9366 euros)(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)]"

To skip the detailed analysis of the semiconductor market, you can go directly to 5 Small Publicly Traded Semiconductor Companies.Semiconductors are at the core of modern life. They are the brains with which modern electronics think and execute the functions they were created to accomplish. These tiny pieces of magic have driven advances in all sectors of modern life, from computing, communications, and transportation to military systems.In 2020, the importance of electronics cranked up significantly. This was a difficult period when the world was struggling through a severe pandemic, the coronavirus disease. With infections traveling fast across borders, governments across the globe imposed movement restrictions that affected the semiconductor industry in two main ways.First, the restrictions collapsed supply chains, leading to a chip shortage. As of mid to late 2021, consumers could not purchase essential and other electronic items. For example, the BBC reported that big vehicle manufacturers like Volvo, Toyota, and Ford had to temporarily suspend manufacturing in 2021 because they could not acquire the chips necessary for powering the electronics in their cars. Interestingly, even companies one couldn't imagine could be affected by a chip shortage suffered significantly. For example, CSSI International, an American company that makes dog-grooming machines, could not fulfill orders because of the shortage.Secondly, the restrictions precipitated higher demand for electronics. As more people were stuck in their houses, many due to work-from-home (WFH) policies, they needed more electronics to keep them company. Others needed computers and attendant devices to make it possible to work away from the office. In fact, a Pew Research survey released in September 2021 revealed that 90% of Americans relied on the internet to survive the pandemic. But for the tech to become a lifeline, people had to acquire electronics, whose production depends on the chips.Story continuesWhile the pandemic increased chip sales, it is important to note that the market was initially shrinking. The United States started targeting China with sanctions in 2018, with President Trump arguing that they were necessary to placate US businesses. The sanctions introduced bottlenecks that plunged chip sales between 2018 and 2019. For example, Statista data shows that the semiconductor market size fell 12% in 2019 from the previous year's $468.78 billion. However, sales increased in the aftermath of the pandemic, growing the global semiconductor market size to $440.39 billion in 2020, just under $30 billion below the 2018 historic peak. The positive growth extended into 2021 ($555.89 billion market size) and 2022 ($580.13 billion market size).Moreover, the semiconductor market has the energy to add another $200 billion to its current value. According to Precedence Research, the market will expand at a 6.6% CAGR between 2022 and 2030 to reach $772.03 billion. Considering that Precedence Research undervalues the market's 2022 size (relative to Statista's valuation), it is possible that the value could cross the $1 trillion mark by 2030.What does this mean? Much can be deduced from the insights, but the most obvious is that companies operating in the space have huge potential to grow revenue. In other words, investors have the chance to grow their portfolios by investing in semiconductor companies.Unfortunately, many investors tend to select industry leaders when angling for such opportunities. Granted, big semiconductor companies like Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM), Broadcom, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), and others have an edge in terms of incumbency and market share.13 Small Publicly Traded Semiconductor CompaniesDragon Images/Shutterstock.comHowever, those who equate such qualities with the earning potential for investors are often wrong for several reasons. The main reason small publicly traded companies – in any industry, not just the semiconductor market – offer a better earning potential is that the stocks can transform into massive capital gains due to share price explosion. Large-cap companies have a narrow space for such moves. In addition, largest semiconductor companies are often ready victims in geopolitical contests, such as the ongoing US-China trade war. The war has affected giants like Intel and TSMC, leading to a substantial loss of value. In contrast, small companies often operate in niches rarely touched by sanctions and counter-sanctions, making the ideal haven to protect one's investment in the semiconductor industry.Our MethodologyWe started by defining a small publicly traded company in the semiconductor industry, a stock from a publicly traded semiconductor company with a total market capitalization ranging from $150 million to $2 billion. The other name for these companies, which we adopted here, is small-cap semiconductor stocks. Then, we drew a list of all small-cap semiconductor stocks trading in the United States. Lastly, we picked the 13 most popular ones based on hedge fund holdings as hedge funds usually invest in small-cap stocks because of their upside potential. In other words, we chose the 13 most popular small-cap semiconductor stocks among US hedge funds.Small Publicly Traded Semiconductor Companies13.

While we do not generally enter positions with the anticipation of a buyout, it is the case that a MagnaChip acquisition will be the most likely outcome.”12. SMART Global Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:SGH)Market capitalization as of March 3: $850.97 million Number of hedge fund holders: 17SMART Global Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:SGH) operates in three major tech industry sectors, and memory solutions is amongst them.

(NASDAQ:SGH) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“SMART Global Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:SGH) is a diversified technology company with leading market positions in memory controllers, LEDs, high-performance computing (HPC), and the internet of things (IoT). The company hit a rough patch in 2019 and early 2020 when earnings declined due to a combination of volatility in its memory business caused by weakness in Brazil and inventory corrections, growth investments the company had made in new products ahead of revenue, and order delays in its HPC business. While none of these developments is particularly unusual, it is uncommon for all three to turn negative at the same time. Our investment thesis was that the company’s impressive new management team could not only smooth out some of the volatility in the business but also drive growth through superior capital allocation and organic investment. We also believed that strong secular trends were in place for memory controllers, driven by the increased importance of memory for computing speeds and increased memory content in devices, and for HPC, driven by artificial intelligence and machine learning. Smart Global’s stock traded lower during the quarter due to macro concerns and weakness in its Brazil segment, which is highly exposed to a slowdown in consumer demand for mobile devices and PCs. We took advantage of the downturn and increased our position. We are comfortable with the volatility of the Brazil business as, over cycles, this segment is a solid cash generator that helps fund investments in the strong secular growth prospects for memory controllers and HPC.”11. nLIGHT, Inc.

Naturally, it’s always a heart-pounding moment to move into the fire. However, acquiring deflated securities may lead to significant upside – so long as you buy the right ones.But how to go about this process represents the million-dollar question. As with any market endeavor, risks abound. However, to mitigate downside threats, investors may want to consider the below bargain stocks for the “trifecta”: strong value, passive income and upside potential (as adjudicated by Wall Street analysts).Fundamentally, companies trading at a discount to trailing earnings while offering dividends and enjoying support from market professionals should benefit from a higher probability of success. So, without any more delay, here are the bargain stocks to consider.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsVLOValero Energy$132.83QCOMQualcomm$117.19DINOHF Sinclair$49.77BGBunge$95.19SIMOSilicon Motion$65.06EPMEvolution Petroleum$6.52DRDDRDGOLD$6.81Bargain Stocks: Valero Energy (VLO)bargain stocks to buy: stock market tickers with the word ""bargains"" appearing in the center of the boardSource: ShutterstockOne of the top downstream petroleum firms, Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) benefits from natural relevancies. With both geopolitics and soaring inflation contributing to higher profitability potential, VLO represents a cynical recipient of downwind catalysts. To be fair, VLO is a strong performer. Since the beginning of the year, shares gained almost 11%. And in the trailing year, they’re up over 52%.Nevertheless, VLO may swing higher. Financially, the business appears undervalued. For example, the market prices VLO at a trailing multiple of 4.56. As a discount to earnings, Valero ranks better than nearly 69% of the industry. As well, VLO trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 0.31 times. In contrast, the sector median stands at 1.02 times.Story continuesTurning to the passive income component, Valero carries a forward yield of 3.07%. Notably, its payout ratio sits at 25.79%, indicating high confidence of yield sustainability. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg VLO as a consensus strong buy. Further, their average price target stands at $159.71, implying over 20% upside potential. Thus, it’s one of the bargain stocks to buy.Bargain Stocks: Qualcomm (QCOM)the word bargain over a pile of american money to represent cheap stocks, stocks under $20Source: ShutterstockA multinational technology giant, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) creates semiconductors, software and services related to wireless technology. In recent years, Qualcomm has expanded into selling semiconductor products in a predominantly fabless manufacturing model. Still, QCOM is working through some market volatility. In the past 365 days, shares gave up nearly 23% of equity value.At the same time, QCOM gained 13% since the Jan. opener. It’s likely to attract even more attention as one of the bargain stocks to consider. Specifically, the market prices QCOM at a trailing multiple of 11.69. As a discount to earnings, Qualcomm ranks better than 68.3% of the competition. Also, its forward price-earnings ratio is 13 times, in contrast to the sector median value of nearly 21 times.For passive income, QCOM carries a forward yield of 2.48%.

Since the start of the new year, DINO hasn’t exactly performed up to snuff, gaining a little over 1%.However, broader relevancies helped spike DINOI skyward to a 50% profit in the trailing year. Because of this, at first glance, DINO doesn’t seem a natural candidate for bargain stocks. Financially, though, it is. Specifically, the market prices DINO at a forward multiple of 5.89. As a discount to earnings, HF Sinclair ranks better than 62.5% of sector peers.Heading over to the passive income component, the company carries a forward yield of 3.58%.

In addition, their average price target stands at $61.40, implying 22% upside potential.Bunge (BG)A Photo of a blue sign in an industrial campus showing the Bunge (BG) logo.Source: JHVEPhoto/ShutterStock.comAn agribusiness and food company, Bunge (NYSE:BG) mainly focuses on its international soybean export business. Furthermore, it involves itself in food processing, grain trading and fertilizer production. With so many wild events transpiring across the world, Bunge enjoys significant relevancies (albeit cynically). Still, it hasn’t been a brilliant performer, only gaining 1.3% since the January opener.What may be more surprising to market observers is that BG shed 10% of equity value in the trailing year. However, the red ink may be an opportunity to pick up one of the underrated bargain stocks to buy. Enticing, the market prices BG at a forward multiple of 8.19. As a discount to earnings, Bunge ranks better than 86.84% of the competition. Looking at passive income, Bunge carries a forward yield of 2.58%.

However, it’s not that bad at all considering the yield. Finally, Northland Securities’ Donovan Schafer pegs EPM as a buy, placing an $11 price target on shares. If so, this forecast would imply over 68% upside potential.DRDGold (DRD)A pile of shining gold bars.Source: ShutterstockBased in South Africa, DRDGold (NYSE:DRD) is a gold producer. It also specializes in the recovery of the metal from the retreatment of surface tailings. With inflation concerns running high due to a robust labor market, gold may swing higher yet. And that may benefit DRD handsomely. Still, it’s a patient person’s investment, with shares down nearly 10% since the start of the year. In the past 365 days, they’ve lost about 31% of market value.To be sure, labor strikes in South Africa often negatively impact mining operations in the region. However, that might be a temporary issue, possibly making DRD one of the bargain stocks to buy. Additionally, the market prices DRD at a trailing multiple of 8.46. As a discount to earnings, DRDGold ranks better than 62.17% of the competition.Heading over to the passive income component, TipRanks notes that DRDGold features a dividend yield of 3.62%. Plus, its payout ratio sits at a favorably low 33.41%. Lastly, H.C. Wainwright’s Heiko Ihle rates DRD as a buy, anticipating a rise to $15 a share.

They are expected to be the 10 pharmacy-based prescription drugs it spends the most on for the year ended May 2023.For months, lobbyists for the biggest pharmaceutical companies have been meeting with Medicare officials trying to game out which drugs the government will choose, what discounts they will seek, and ways to redress the final price.Five lobbyists told Reuters they have been given little information beyond what has been publicly disclosed.The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which will run the negotiation process, said in a statement it expects to answer some of the industry’s questions in a guidance document it will circulate this spring. A spokesperson said the agency intends to use feedback from monthly calls with drugmakers to inform implementation.For individual companies, the financial impact is expected to vary. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that negotiations will save the government around $4.8 billion in 2026 and nearly $25 billion a year by 2031, as more drugs are added to the negotiation process.Those savings will help fund the bill's out of pocket spending caps and reduced cost sharing for older Americans.Story continues""We couldn't have the other parts of the IRA without this Medicare negotiation,"" said Sean Dickson, director of the West Health Policy Center, a non-partisan healthcare think tank.Reuters compiled five lists prepared by Wall Street analysts and academics with a total of 27 drugs across them.Eliquis, which Bristol Myers shares with Pfizer , Ibrance, and Imbruvica, sold by AbbVie and Johnson &amp; Johnson, appear on every list.Novo Nordisk's diabetes drug Ozempic, prostate cancer treatment Xtandi from Astellas Pharma and Pfizer, and J&amp;J's blood thinner Xarelto are on three of the lists.The lists differ because each analyst has their own projections for drug sales, and it is not certain if the government will consider gross sales or net sales after market discounts.MAKING THE CASEBristol Myers Chief Commercialization Officer Chris Boerner said in an interview last month that Eliquis may well be in the government's crosshairs. ""We would anticipate that you could potentially see price setting by the government with Eliquis,” he said.Astellas said it was analyzing information from CMS to understand its potential impact. Pfizer, Novo Nordisk and J&amp;J declined to comment on the likelihood their drugs would be included in the first round of negotiations. AbbVie did not respond to request for comment.Medicare is the biggest single purchaser of drugs in the country, reimbursing private companies and hospitals for medications used by individuals covered by the program.Under the new law’s process, the government will publish its list of the first 10 drugs for negotiation from the pharmacy-based prescription drug program called Part D on Sept. 1.Drugmakers will have to submit data making the case for each treatment's value by Oct. 2, including whether the drug represents a therapeutic advance and if it serves unmet medical needs.Drugmakers have long presented similar value-based arguments in negotiations with private buyers and European governments.Three industry lobbyists told Reuters they are pressing Medicare officials to commit to a process under which it will reveal how the government arrived at a final price, and have asked for a framework for resolving disputes.Without such a process, drugmakers could resort to lawsuits as a last-ditch attempt to stop government price setting - even though the IRA exempts the process from lawsuits, two of those lobbyists said.One of those lobbyists suggested adoption of an appeal process similar to ones used by European countries, where price-setting regimes have long existed, would give companies recourse outside of lawsuits.A Medicare spokesperson declined to say if the agency was considering such a move.Steven Pearson, president of the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), an influential research group that does drug pricing value assessments, said how the government comes to a price based on data companies submit should be clearly communicated.""It's going to be frustrating to a lot of people,"" he said, ""if, at the end of the day, we don't really understand how this information is being interpreted and applied to a final decision.""(Reporting by Michael Erman and Patrick Wingrove in New York and Ahmed Aboulenein in Washington; Editing by Caroline Humer and Bill Berkrot)]"

The primary drivers of this growth are expected to be the rising incidence of depression and other mental health conditions in the United States, as well as a growing acceptance of psychedelic drugs as a viable treatment for depression. As per a 2020 consensus, around 26% of individuals aged 18 or older in the United States were believed to experience a mental disorder that can be diagnosed within a year, and approximately 17.3 million adults in the country have had at least one significant depressive episode. Additionally, an estimated 40 million adults in the US have anxiety disorders. These figures are predicted to rise further as a result of the aftermath of the global pandemic, which highlights the need for effective treatment options.Clara Burtenshaw, who is a partner at Neo Kuma Ventures, the most significant venture capital fund in Europe that invests in psychedelic firms like Atai Life Sciences and Compass Pathways, told CNBC on February 16, 2023: “Psychedelic healthcare is a very exciting area because it’s really this apex of drugs, clinics and experimental treatments.”Psychedelic substances are composed of different types of chemicals, including lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and compounds extracted from plants. These substances have the capacity to modify or intensify sensory perceptions, cognitive processes, energy levels, and have even been linked to fostering spiritual encounters. The global market for antidepressant drugs is projected to surpass $20 billion by the year 2030. Due to their mind-altering properties, substances such as ketamine, psilocybin, MDMA, and LSD remain unlawful in the majority of the world. However, certain investors are now optimistic that psychedelic treatments can obtain a portion of this enormous market share.

The Medtronic Women's Network is rallying around this year's theme to #EmbraceEquity, which is embodied at Medtronic year-round through programs like the one in this story.Anaisa Rojas Brache first came to Medtronic as a manufacturing operator. She would look at the office in the corner and think, ""Someday that will be me."" And thanks to the Medtronic Advanced Pathways &amp; Skill Building (MAPS) program, she's well on her way.Medtronic launched MAPS to help remove barriers for Medtronic employees in the United States and Puerto Rico who wish to pursue an undergraduate degree as part of their career development.This program offers 100% tuition paid by Medtronic for participating schools to eligible employees from day one. Notably, MAPS participants do not need to pay upfront for these educational costs, eliminating the need for reimbursement - just one more way Medtronic is working to remove barriers and ensure every employee has equitable access to the opportunities they seek.Across industries, women comprise 48% of all entry-level hires, but they make up just 38% of first-level managers - a figure that continues to shrink at higher leadership levels, according to McKinsey. Medtronic recognizes that different people face different barriers on their journey, and for many, earning a degree leads to meaningful personal and professional growth.Breaking down barriersWhen Rojas Brache came to the United States from the Dominican Republic four years ago, she didn't speak English. She didn't need to - her life was back home where she had an accounting degree and a plan. And she was certain she would return someday.But as time went on, things started to change. She was exceling at her job, picking up English, and starting to see a future - not only in the U.S., but at Medtronic.Story continuesShe considered seeking tuition reimbursement to attend college, but she'd just had a child and felt the cost was too much.""When I learned about MAPS, I thought, ‘This is my time,'"" Brache said. ""Medtronic is not just saving patients' lives. It's changing employees' lives, too.""She's studying business administration - specifically management - at the University of Memphis.And she's applying her education to work in a new leadership role on the manufacturing line.""I'm creating my life here,"" she said.

Follow Sozzi on Twitter @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn. Have tips on SVB? Send confidentially to brian.sozzi@yahoofinance.com.Welcome to the first true black swan event for markets since the COVID-induced meme stock craze.Silicon Valley Bank's collapse on Friday is the second largest bank failure in the U.S.Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said early Sunday there will be no federal bailout for the stricken bank, and she held true to those words by the end of the day.A joint statement from Yellen, Fed chief Jerome Powell and FDIC chair Martin Gruenberg said depositors will have access to all of their money today from Silicon Valley Bank. The same goes for Signature Bank, which was closed on Sunday. No losses will be borne by the taxpayer. Any losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund to make uninsured depositors whole will be recouped by a special assessment on banks, the statement said.Shareholders in these banks will not be protected. Senior management has been removed.The Fed added it will make available additional funding to eligible depository institutions to help assure they can meet depositor needs.Wall Streeters are likely still to brace for more contagion despite the extraordinary measures, while at the same time trying to convey messages this is not Lehman Brothers circa 2008/2009.""Yes there are a couple other banks that have some tech concentration that pose some risk, but SVB was extreme in its courting of large accounts and perks. And they will try to tell you this is a risk to the entire system but it isn’t. The big banks are incredibly well capitalized and the market even told you that on Friday with JP Morgan, Citi, Bank of America and Wells Fargo all having uneventful days in the market. This will be a one (or possibly two)-off situation where a bank made a mistake with buying longer term mortgages to push for yield and with a concentrated deposit base that was incredibly loyal until they were not,"" one long-time fund manager told Yahoo Finance.Story continuesAs I have reminded a lot of folks in the last 72 hours, I view our job here at Yahoo Finance at this unique moment in time as to present the facts, add easy to understand context and bring our community into our world of sources across the world of business. It's not the time to yell fire in a crowded theater (it never is), or in our field (business news) add more noise to an already unnerving situation.This is a troubling situation to a lot of hard-working people that strive to save money and don't have that insider Wall Street/VC access — such as my family members who asked me over the weekend if their money was safe in their local bank.That's a jarring conversation to be having in 2023.Now let's get you up to speed.The VisualsOnly the collapse of Washington Mutual was larger than SVB's meltdown, per the chart from strategist Charlie Bilello below.The biggest bank collapses in history.The event has brought out the short-sellers on the regional banks, S3 Partners Ihor Dusaniwsky points out.

Pfizer then plans to let the biotech drug developer “continue innovating,” except with more resources than it would have alone, Pfizer Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla told analysts.“We are not buying the golden eggs,” he said. “We are acquiring the goose that is laying the golden eggs.”Bothell, Washington-based Seagen Inc. specializes in working with antibody-drug conjugate, or ADC, technology. Its key products use lab-made proteins called monoclonal antibodies that seek out cancer cells to help deliver a cancer-killing drug while sparing surrounding tissue.Cancer treatments are a priority for Pfizer. They brought in $12 billion in revenue for the drugmaker last year. But Pfizer has only marketed a couple first-generation ADC treatments, a spokeswoman said.Seagen has four treatments on the market. It also has a pipeline of drugs under development that includes potential treatments for a form of lung cancer and advanced breast cancer.“We think this really changes dramatically the oncology presence of Pfizer, makes it one of a kind,"" Bourla said.Seagen’s top seller, Adcetris, treats lymph system cancers. It brought in $839 million in sales last year, a 19% increase over the previous year.Seagen also has a deal with Pfizer’s Array BioPharma to develop, make and sell the breast and colorectal cancer treatment Tukysa. It brought in $353 million in sales for Seagen last year.The company, which changed its name from Seattle Genetics in 2020, saw total revenue grow about 25% last year to nearly $2 billion. Seagen also shaved its loss to $610 million from $674 million in 2021.The drug developer predicts about $2.2 billion in sales for this year.Pfizer booked about $100 billion in total revenue last year and has been flush with cash thanks to sales of its COVID-19 vaccine and treatment, Comirnaty and Paxlovid.Story continuesBourla said earlier this year that the company planned to use its “extraordinary firepower” to buy products that will deliver $25 billion in incremental revenue by 2030.The deal announced Monday and some previous acquisitions will help Pfizer account for most of that. But Bourla emphasized on Monday that the company expects Seagen's contributions to extend beyond the end of the decade.New York-based Pfizer Inc. has already spent $11.6 billion on migraine treatment developer Biohaven Pharmaceutical. It also spent $5.4 billion on sickle cell disease treatment maker Global Blood Therapeutics and bought Arena Pharmaceuticals for another $6.7 billion.The drugmaker needs more revenue sources in part because it faces the expiration of patents protecting drugs like its breast cancer treatment Ibrance from cheaper competition in the coming years.Pfizer said Monday it will pay for Seagen mostly through $31 billion in new, long-term debt.Both companies' boards have unanimously approved the deal. But regulators still need to look at it, and Seagen shareholders will have to approve it.The companies expect to complete the transaction in late 2023 or early 2024.Shares of Pfizer rose 2% to $40.26 after markets opened Monday, while Seagen's stock soared more than 15% to nearly $200.

It will add four approved cancer therapies with combined sales of nearly $2 billion in 2022.Washington-based Seagen is a pioneer of antibody-drug conjugates, which work like ""guided missiles"" designed to destroy cancer while sparing healthy cells.Seagen's shares were trading up more than 16% at $200.93 on Monday, well below Pfizer's offer price of $229, signaling investor concern over a possible prolonged antitrust review. Pfizer shares were nearly 3% higher.Pfizer's bid represents a 32.7% premium to Seagen's closing price on Friday.""The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) clearance is sort of the open question at this point with regards to the deal,"" said Needham &amp; Co analyst Ami Fadia, pointing to an overlap in bladder cancer treatments as an area the FTC could look into.However, Fadia said there was less than a 50% chance of the FTC challenging the deal in court.Pfizer, on a conference call to discuss the planned acquisition, acknowledged that antitrust regulators are likely to closely review the deal due to its size, but said the companies expect to be able to complete the transaction in late 2023 or early 2024.PROTECTION FROM COMPETITION, REGULATORSAdding Seagen helps Pfizer move into an area ""that is more protected from a regulatory and patent perspective, and market dynamics,"" Chief Executive Albert Bourla said on the call.Seagen is set to benefit from out-of-pocket healthcare spending caps for older Americans under President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), Bourla said, meaning more patients could gain access to the company's expensive treatments.Story continuesA focus on complex biotech medicines also provides a longer exclusivity on the market versus pills before becoming subject to government price limits under the IRA, he said. The U.S. Medicare program will be allowed to negotiate drug prices for the first time, with new prices for the initial 10 drugs selected starting in 2026.Seagen's complicated drugs also make it more difficult for rivals to develop less expensive biosimilar versions, which could lengthen their profitability.The latest deal comes as Pfizer seeks to mitigate an anticipated $17 billion hit to revenue by 2030 from patent expirations for top drugs, and a decline in demand for its COVID products.Pfizer's COVID vaccine, which it shares with BioNTech, and oral antiviral treatment Paxlovid have brought in sales of more $90 billion through 2022.The New York-based drugmaker said the Seagen deal and other recent acquisitions could generate more than $20 billion in combined sales in 2030.Pfizer's recent deals include its purchase of Global Blood Therapeutics for $5.4 billion, migraine headache drug maker Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding for $11.6 billion and a $6.7 billion buyout of drug developer Arena Pharmaceuticals.Pfizer's oncology portfolio already boasts 24 approved therapies. The Seagen purchase would add Adcetris for lymphoma, Padcev for bladder cancers, Tivdak for cervical cancer and breast cancer treatment Tukysa.Pfizer rival Merck &amp; Co and Seagen were in advanced deal talks last year before they collapsed, according to reports.(Reporting by Manas Mishra, Bhanvi Satija in Bengaluru and Michael Erman in New York; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty, Sriraj Kalluvila and Bill Berkrot)]"

""Together, Pfizer and Seagen seek to accelerate the next generation of cancer breakthroughs and bring new solutions to patients by combining the power of Seagen’s antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) technology with the scale and strength of Pfizer’s capabilities and expertise. Oncology continues to be the largest growth driver in global medicine, and this acquisition will enhance Pfizer’s position in this important space and contribute meaningfully to the achievement of Pfizer’s near- and long-term financial goals.""Seagen expects to generate approximately $2.2 billion of revenue in 20231, representing 12% year-over-year growth, from its four in-line medicines, royalties and collaboration and license agreements. When combining the expected strong growth trajectories for these medicines with candidates that could emerge from Seagen's pipeline, subject to clinical trial and regulatory success, Pfizer believes Seagen could contribute more than $10 billion in risk-adjusted revenues in 2030, with potential significant growth beyond 2030.Story continuesSeagen is a pioneer in ADC technology, with four of the twelve total FDA-approved and marketed ADCs using its technology industry-wide. ADCs are a transformative modality that is emerging as a powerful tool across a broad range of cancers designed to preferentially kill cancer cells and limit off-target toxicities. Seagen has developed a leadership position in ADC technologies since its founding 25 years ago, with groundbreaking and proprietary technology that is positioned for significant growth in 2023 and beyond. Seagen’s portfolio includes four approved medicines2 that are first- or best-in-class in their respective indications across solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, including three ADCs: ADCETRIS® (brentuximab vedotin), PADCEV® (enfortumab vedotin), and TIVDAK® (tisotumab vedotin). The company also commercializes TUKYSA® (tucatinib). Clinical development programs are ongoing for each of these medicines for potential new tumor types or expanded indications in earlier lines of therapy, with catalysts expected annually through 2027.Seagen is also poised to expand the impact of its therapeutic approach with its broad and deep pipeline that includes eleven new molecular entities, many with the potential to treat large patient populations and all with global commercial rights.3 The proposed acquisition is also expected to enable for combination potential across both the Seagen and Pfizer pipelines and will leverage Pfizer’s protein engineering and medicinal chemistry capabilities to advance Seagen’s ADC technology to unlock potential novel target combinations and next-generation biologics.Seagen is also advancing innovative technologies capable of potentially generating multiple Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs)​, including next-generation linker/payload technologies for ADCs and other innovative antibody platforms that directly engage the immune system to destroy tumors, such as bi-specific antibodies.""Pfizer shares our steadfast commitment to patients, and this combination is a testament to the passion, dedication and talent of the Seagen team to achieve our mission to discover, develop, and commercialize transformative cancer medicines that make a meaningful difference in people’s lives,"" said David Epstein, Seagen Chief Executive Officer. ""The proposed combination with Pfizer is the right next step for Seagen to further its strategy, and this compelling transaction will deliver significant and immediate value to our stockholders and provide new opportunities for our colleagues as part of a larger science-driven, patient-centric, global company.""Today, Pfizer Oncology has an industry-leading portfolio of 24 approved innovative cancer medicines that generated $12.1 billion in 2022 revenues, including the best-selling therapies for metastatic breast cancer and prostate cancer. Pfizer’s in-line portfolio is focused on four broad, key areas: breast cancer, genitourinary cancer, hematology and precision medicine, complemented by an extensive pipeline of 33 programs in clinical development. The proposed combination with Seagen would double Pfizer’s early-stage oncology clinical pipeline.""Over the past decade we’ve taken bold new approaches to translating scientific research into effective medicines for people living with cancer, and we have pioneered several breakthroughs in breast cancer, genitourinary cancer, hematological malignancies and precision medicine,"" said Chris Boshoff, Chief Development Officer Oncology and Rare Disease, Pfizer. ""The addition of Seagen’s world-leading ADC technology will position us at the forefront of innovative cancer care, and strongly complements our existing portfolio across both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. We believe the combination of our teams, and respective areas of strength and global footprints will allow us to realize Seagen’s potential and advance even more potential breakthroughs to patients with cancer.""Pfizer expects to finance the transaction substantially through $31 billion of new, long-term debt, and the balance from a combination of short-term financing and existing cash. The transaction is expected to be neutral to slightly accretive to adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS)4 in the third to fourth full year post close. Pfizer expects to achieve nearly $1 billion in cost efficiencies in the third full year after the completion of the transaction.The companies expect to complete the transaction in late 2023 or early 2024, subject to fulfillment of customary closing conditions, including approval of Seagen’s stockholders and receipt of required regulatory approvals.Pfizer’s financial advisor for the transaction is Guggenheim Securities, LLC, with Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz acting as Pfizer’s legal advisor.

If you want to see stocks that hedge funds are buying, you can go to 5 Stocks Hedge Funds Are Buying.Growth stocks had one of their historically worst years in 2022, as interest rates climbed to bring down inflation. The growth-heavy Nasdaq Composite lost over 30% of its value as the year came to an end. Tech was the victim of huge sell-offs and also mass lay-offs as the Fed remained hawkish through year-end. 2023 got off to an interesting start, with the Nasdaq rallying above 12,000 in February. However, the key question remains about whether the Fed will continue to remain hawkish in 2023 or will it pivot to a relatively dovish stance? A hawkish Fed means higher interest rates, which are not good for growth as they put a strain on these companies' future earnings.Hedge Fund Consultant: ""I Think The Fed Is Now Probably Gonna End Up Cutting Rates By 100 Basis Points""On March 10, Silicon Valley Bank collapsed after it failed to raise capital and resolve its liquidity crisis. Shortly after the collapse of the bank, Larry McDonald appeared in an interview on CNBC to discuss his view on what's ahead for the financial services sector, the risk of contagion, and what he thinks the Fed is going to do. Larry McDonald is a New York Times bestselling author, a renowned financial consultant, and is also held in high esteem as a risk consultant, particularly for hedge funds and high-net-worth investors.According to Larry McDonald, larger banks have relatively more resources and experience in managing interest rate risk than smaller regional banks. Therefore, the risk of contagion from the collapse of SVB to large banks is relatively smaller than the risk of contagion to regional banks. Larry McDonald thinks that the Fed needs to raise interest rates right now in order to bring down inflation. However, he also sees the Fed cutting rates significantly by the end of the year. Here are some comments from Larry McDonald:Story continues""They (the Fed) need to get inflation down and so they need to tighten financial conditions. And so they're doing that, and now we're having a run on some of these banks... I think the Fed's gonna now probably end up cutting rates by 100 basis points by December.""Larry McDonald explained his view with the help of an analogy. According to Larry McDonald, the Fed has to take care of two separate fires, one is the inflation fire and the other one is the risk of contagion. The Fed will do that by using its fire hose, that is interest rates, differently throughout 2023. Here is what Larry McDonald said:""So There's an inflation fire. They're (the Fed) pulling out the fire hose with (tightening) financial conditions trying to put that out. And so that's the fire they're dealing with now. The problem is, when you do that, our 21 Lehman systemic indicators are at the highest levels since Lehman and Covid right now. They're exploding higher. So now, within the next couple of months, as the contagion brews up this channel, up to high yield, leveraged loans, across the entire ecosystem, that's when the Fed is going to have to bring out the other fire hose and cut rates, probably within 6 to 9 months.""To conclude, Larry McDonald sees the Fed raising interest rates right now but eventually, in the back half of 2023, he thinks the Fed will end up cutting rates as ""contagion brews up"".Investors have repositioned themselves throughout 2022 as interest rates went through the roof. In a volatile market environment, such as the one we are in right now, it is imperative to know where big money managers are placing their bets and what they are avoiding. This can save retail investors from potential losses. We have compiled a list of 10 growth stocks that hedge funds have dumped in the fourth quarter of 2022, and also a list of the 5 stocks that hedge funds have bought. Stocks that experienced an influx of institutional money in Q4 2022 include Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI), Chart Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:GTLS), and Mobileye Global Inc. (NASDAQ:MBLY).Hedge Funds Are Fleeing These 10 Growth Stocks. 5 Stocks They Are Buying InsteadPhoto by Pascal Bernardon on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo determine the 10 growth stocks hedge funds are fleeing and the 5 stocks that hedge funds are buying instead, we consulted Insider Monkey's proprietary database of more than 900 elite hedge funds. We calculated the hedge fund sentiment for each stock. We narrowed down our list to the 10 growth stocks that had the highest number of hedge fund exits in Q4 2022. After that, we picked the 5 stocks that had the highest number of hedge fund initiations.For growth stocks that hedge funds have fled in Q4 2022, we have ranked the stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that sold the stock. For stocks that hedge funds have bought, we have ranked the stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that bought the stock. Where the number of hedge funds that sold/bought were the same, we used the number of hedge fund holders as the tie-breaker.Hedge Funds Are Fleeing These 10 Growth Stocks.15. Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 115Number of Hedge Funds That Sold: 11Payments giant Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) released earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022 on February 9. The company reported an EPS of $1.24 and outperformed EPS estimates by $0.04. The company's revenue for the quarter amounted to $7.38 billion and fell short of expectations by $8.55 million.At the end of Q4 2022, 115 hedge funds were long Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) and disclosed positions worth $5.10 billion in the company. This is compared to 126 hedge funds in Q3 2022 with stakes worth $6.78 billion. The hedge fund sentiment for the stock is negative. The stock is placed tenth among the growth stocks hedge funds are fleeing.As of December 31, Citadel Investment Group is the largest investor in Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) and has a position worth $481 million in the company.Here is what RiverPark Advisors had to say about PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)  in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)l: PayPal shares were a top detractor for 4Q, reporting slightly weaker than expected 3Q payment volumes and 4Q payment volume guidance. The company nevertheless reported betterthan-expected EPS on improved margins. PYPL operates at significantly lower margins than its payment competitors Visa and Mastercard, and 3Q results and 4Q guidance show early improvements in its margins and ability to drive higher cash flow growth in the near term. For 3Q, PYPL reported $1.8 billion of FCF, the highest quarterly FCF number in its history, representing 37% growth. The company expects continued operating margin expansion for 4Q and full year FCF of more than $5 billion, representing a 6% FCF yield.PayPal is the most accepted digital wallet – with almost triple the acceptance of Apple Pay, the number two digital wallet. PayPal is a key beneficiary of the ongoing shift to ecommerce driven digital payments, as well as consumer-to-consumer payment trends through its Venmo peer-topeer (P2P) payment service. With a 3Q non-GAAP operating margin of 22%, PYPL also has significant margin expansion potential given that competitors Adyen, Visa and Mastercard have 50%-65% operating margins. We believe the combination of secular growth, expanding operating leverage and the strategic use of the company’s significant and growing cash balance should fuel high teens earnings growth over the next five years. This, to us, presents an excellent risk/reward given that PYPL trades at a below market multiple.”14. Bill.com Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:BILL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58Number of Hedge Funds That Sold: 12Bill.com Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:BILL) is a leading fintech company and provider of cloud-based software for financial operations.

(NYSE:BILL) and has disclosed a stake worth $215.4 million in the company.Here is what TimesSquare Capital Management had to say about Bill.com Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:BILL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Bill.com Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:BILL) offers cloud-based software that simplifies, digitizes, and automates back-office functions for small and mid-sized businesses. The company has indicated that customer spending softened a bit in recent months and that has been factored into forward guidance. We decided to sell out of the position, which had declined by -20% while it was held in the quarter.”Stocks that hedge funds are pouring hefty investments into right now include Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI), Chart Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:GTLS), and Mobileye Global Inc. (NASDAQ:MBLY).13. Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40Number of Hedge Funds That Sold: 13Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) is a provider of cloud-based cybersecurity software and services. The stock has lost 21.24% over the past 6 months, as of March 10.Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) was abandoned by 13 hedge funds in Q4 2022. The stock was a part of 40 investors' portfolios, down from 53 investors' portfolios in the third quarter of 2022. The stock is placed eighth among the top growth stocks hedge funds have fled in Q4 2022.As of December 31, Marshall Wace LLP is the leading investor in Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) and has disclosed a position worth $119.5 million in the company.Here is what Ron Baron's Baron Funds had to say about Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We continued to build our position in Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) during the quarter as the shares declined with the overall software space and the long-term risk/ reward balance became more compelling. The company reported a strong second quarter, with revenue growth accelerating to 54%, as well as better gross and operating margins. Third quarter guidance was also ahead of Wall Street expectations. Given Cloudflare’s proprietary network and massive global scale, its software products have a disruptive price-performance advantage over competitors. As the company introduces new products as well as disruptive packaging/pricing, its unit level economics should continue to improve over time, with the company already well ahead of its long-term gross margin target of 74%, reporting 78.9% for the second quarter. This drives strong cross/upselling activity with customers, reflected in strong net-dollar expansion rates in excess of 125%. Indeed, in the most recent quarters, customers purchasing five or more products reached 81% of the base, six or more products reached 70% of the base, and seven or more products reached 58% of the base. Enterprise penetration continues to be a key long-term driver, with 1,749 customers now spending over $100,000 annually with the company, growing 61% and now accounting for over 60% of total revenue. With approximately 152,000 paying customers at the end of last quarter, large enterprise customers still represent just 1% of total paid customers and thus a material growth opportunity in the coming years. We continue to have high confidence in the company’s ability to innovate at a rapid pace (announced 20 new products or enhancements in September alone), package and bundle with disruptive pricing, and take material share in its large and growing addressable markets.”12.

The hedge fund sentiment for the stock is negative.As of December 31, Knoll Capital Management is the top investor in Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company Ltd. (NYSE:BHVN) and disclosed a stake worth $6.25 million in the company.11. Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.

(NASDAQ:MPWR) and held a position worth $169 million in the company.Here is what Artisan Partners had to say about Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:MPWR) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“During the quarter, we began new GardenSM positions in Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.(NASDAQ:MPWR), Industrie De Nora and Saia. Monolithic Power Systems designs analog power-management chips for a wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. The company is executing well as its customers convert their analog, digital and power semiconductor chips into its single-chip design, which is energy efficient and priced lower than peers. While we acknowledge certain areas of the business may be a source of weakness in the near term (storage, computing and consumer), we believe much of that is now discounted. However, the enterprise and auto areas of the business are set up to be big growth drivers over the next couple years given the company’s differentiation in both segments, which is driving market share gains and pricing power. Based on its unique ability to offer highly integrated solutions and solve complex power management issues across multiple end-applications, we believe the profit cycle runway ahead is meaningful and initiated a GardenSM position.”10. Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31Number of Hedge Funds That Sold: 15Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) is a leading global provider of data storage products and services. On January 31, the company reported earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The company reported a loss per share of $0.42 and missed EPS estimates by $0.29.

We cut our cyclical technology exposure with a trim to hard disk drive maker Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC), which has higher than average financial leverage for our portfolio and is facing a challenging demand environment.”9. Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NYSE:PANW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 85Number of Hedge Funds That Sold: 18Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NYSE:PANW) is another cybersecurity giant that hedge funds sold heavily in Q4 2022.

(NASDAQ:PANW) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Stock selection within the IT sector was the main detractor from relative performance during the period. In addition to rate hikes compressing the multiples of longerduration, high growth companies, recession concerns were also a headwind. IT companies which had proven resilient against customer budget reductions earlier in the year are starting to feel the impact of spending slowdowns as companies further scrutinize expenses in light of economic uncertainty. For example, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW), which provides enterprise security solutions including next-generation firewalls and threat detection software, faced a challenging environment as customers delayed purchases and orders. However, we remain convinced of the company’s long-term growth prospects as an industry leader in a critical field and as digital attacks and ransomware continue to grow.”8. CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Number of Hedge Funds That Sold: 19As of March 10, cybersecurity giant CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) has lost 38.64% over the past 6 months. 19 hedge funds exited their positions in CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) at the end of Q4 2022, placing it third on our list of the growth stocks hedge funds are fleeing.CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) was a part of 66 investors' portfolios that disclosed collective positions worth $1.64 billion in the company. This is compared to 85 hedge funds in the previous quarter with stakes worth $2.97 billion. The hedge fund sentiment for the stock is negative.As of December 31, SCGE Management is the largest shareholder in CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) and has disclosed a position worth $154.9 million in the company.Here is what Baron Funds had to say about CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a market leading cloud-native cybersecurity vendor. Shares declined on the back of a weaker-than-expected earnings report, in which revenue beat Street expectations but net new annual recurring revenue (ARR) slightly missed consensus due to elongated sales cycles that impacted deals with small- and medium-sized businesses (SMB) and phased start dates with larger customers. For example, instead of 100,000 end-points starting on day 1, start 75,000 on day 1 and 25,000 six months later. For fuller context, in the fiscal third quarter, revenue grew 53%, ARR grew 54%, net new ARR was $198 million vs. expectations about $20 million higher, and the business generated 30% FCF margins. Accounting for the net new ARR miss, the company offered conservative initial guidance for fiscal year 2024 (ending January 2024), with ARR growth in the low 30s, subscription revenue growth in the low-to-mid 30s, and FCF margins around the 30% level. While this was a painful reset, CrowdStrike noted its SMB win rates had improved, enterprise win rates remained constant, its gross and net retention rates are at best-in-class levels, and its emerging products were experiencing rapid adoption. Despite short-term weakness, Morgan Stanley’s fourth quarter CIO survey showed security software projects remained the top CIO priority, and our research continues to indicate that CrowdStrike is one of the few true platforms in the security space.”7. ZoomInfo Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:ZI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31Number of Hedge Funds That Sold: 19Pandemic darling ZoomInfo Technologies Inc.

As of December 31, Tiger Global Management LLC is the leading investor in the company and has a position worth $187.8 million.Here is what Baron Funds had to say about ZoomInfo Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:ZI) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“ZoomInfo Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:ZI) provides business intelligence software that companies use to inform their go-to-market strategy, with modules focused on areas including sales, marketing, operations, and talent. Shares detracted from performance after the company predicted weaker revenue trends, driven by meaningful macroeconomic weakness and slowing purchasing trends by its customers. We believe that ZoomInfo has the potential to be a much larger company as it grows into its ever expanding $70 billion total addressable market and potential adjacent markets such as marketing and talent acquisition software.We reduced our stake in ZoomInfo Technologies Inc., which provides business intelligence software, given uncertainty about its near-term business trends in a more challenging environment for its primary customer base.”While ZoomInfo Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:ZI) is one of the most heavily sold stocks by hedge funds right now, some of the most heavily-bought stocks by hedge funds include Activision Blizzard, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) was held by 240 investors that disclosed collective stakes worth $27.5 billion in the company. This is compared to 269 hedge funds in the previous quarter with stakes worth $34.6 billion. The hedge fund sentiment for the stock is negative.As of December 31, Harris Associates is the top shareholder in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and has disclosed a stake worth $1.62 billion in the company.Here is what Weitz Investment Management had to say about Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), perhaps the ultimate “COVID beneficiary,” has seen its shares dip below pre-pandemic levels as investors brace for a potential recession’s impact both on retail spending as well as slowing adoption of Amazon’s cloud infrastructure service, Amazon Web Services.Meta, Alphabet, Amazon and CarMax were all top detractors for the quarter and calendar year periods (FIS and Liberty Broadband, respectively, complete the quarterly and calendar-year detractor lists.) To varying degrees, each is managing through cyclical challenges during a period of substantial investor pessimism. Drawdowns of this magnitude are painful, and it may be prudent for management to moderate the pace of some investments, but we remain encouraged by their long-term focus. In the short run, cutting spending indiscriminately to “defend earnings” may lessen the pain of a drawdown, but it seldom grows a company’s business value — the ultimate prize.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Stocks Hedge Funds Are Buying.Suggested articles:12 Small Cap Stocks with Insider Buying10 Penny Stocks with Insider Buying11 Best Long-term Growth Stocks for Strong ReturnsDisclosure: None.

My name is Candice, and I will be your moderator for today's call. I would now like to hand you over to our host, Susan Harcourt, Vice President of Investor Relations. The floor is yours. Please go ahead.Susan Harcourt: Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter and full-year 2022 financial review call. Our press release, presentation, and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements.

Joining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Coughlin, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will turn the call over to Andres.Andres Gluski: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full-year 2022 financial review call. Today, I will discuss our 2022 financial results and strategic accomplishments, as well as our 2023 guidance. Steve Coughlin, our CFO will discuss our financial results and outlook in more detail shortly. Beginning with our 2002 results and accomplishments on Slide 3. I am very pleased with our performance in 2022, which was our best year ever. Adjusted EPS came in at $1.67, above our guidance range of $1.55 to $1.65. This accomplishment is primarily the result of three factors: strong performance across our portfolio, growth in renewables, particularly from solar and energy storage in the U.S., and the benefit of embedded optionality in our LNG contracts.Story continuesTurning to Slide 4. I would like to highlight an area in which we are particularly proud of our performance, our success in bringing our construction projects online. In 2022, despite numerous market-wide challenges throughout the year, we added approximately 2 gigawatts of new projects to our portfolio, which was consistent with our expectations at the beginning of the year. Our success was the result of the extensive work we have done to develop the people, processes, and solid supplier relationships to rapidly expand our portfolio of renewables. We see our ability to execute as the source of competitive advantage that is highly valued in the marketplace. Not only does it support our strong global customer relationships, but it also contributes to our confidence in our long-term forecast.In addition to our execution, 2022 was a year where we focused on taking actions that will position us well for future growth. These actions included signing a record number of new PPAs for projects that we will complete in the coming years, investing in our pipeline of future projects, creating a leading position in green hydrogen, establishing strong regulatory foundations to support future utility growth, and achieving significant cold phase out milestones in Hawaii and Chile. As you can see on Slide 5, 2022 was a record year for PPA signings for AES. We signed 5.2 gigawatts of renewables under long-term contracts, increasing our backlog to 12.2 gigawatts. In fact, for the second year in a row, BNEF reported that AES signed more renewable deals with corporate customers than anyone else in the world.This included an expansion of our 24/7 structured projects. Moving to Slide 6. We also worked hard throughout the year to grow our pipeline of future projects, which increased by 25% to 64 gigawatts, including 51 gigawatts in the U.S. We see extensive and growing demand for renewables worldwide and expect that in the future a key limitation to growth will be the availability of projects. We have been preparing by investing in land, interconnections, and permitting work to advance the projects that will be used for future PPA signings. Turning to Slide 7. We also established ourselves as a leader in green hydrogen. In December, we announced a partnership with Air Products to develop, build, and own, and operate the largest green hydrogen production facility in the U.S. This project will have the capacity to produce more than 200 metric tons per day of green hydrogen and will include approximately 1.4 gigawatts of wind and solar generation.It builds upon the expertise we have developed in combining renewables to create around the clock carbon free energy. This project has the potential to serve approximately 4,000 trucks, which while significant represents less than 0.1% of the current market for long haul trucking. As such, we see a massive total addressable market for decarbonizing the transportation sector. Turning to Slide 8. Another focus of our 2022 work was to develop strong regulatory foundations for future growth at our U.S. Utilities, where we expect to grow the combined rate basis 9% annually through 2025. Specifically, at AES Ohio, we filed a new electric security plan or ESP 4 to enhance and upgrade the network and improve service reliability. With the lowest in the states, across all customer categories, AES Ohio is well positioned to make the much needed customer centric investments.A ruling by the Ohio Commission on ESP 4 is expected this summer. Finally, we're pleased with the constructive outcome of AES Ohio's distribution rate case in which the Ohio Commission approved an annual revenue increase of $75.6 million. At AES Indiana, we filed our integrated resource plan for IRP with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission in December. AES Indiana's near term plan includes the conversion of the utility's last two coal units to natural gas in 2025 using an existing on-site gas pipeline. It also includes the addition of up to 1.3 gigawatts of new wind, solar, and energy storage by 2027 and should reduce AES Indiana's carbon intensity by two-thirds from 2018 to 2030. This plan is an important step to fully transition away from coal and provides the opportunity for substantial additional investments at AES Indiana.Now, turning to our outlook for 2023 on Slide 9. Today, we're initiating adjusted EPS guidance of $1.65 to $1.75, and reaffirming our long-term growth rate of 7% to 9% through 2025 for both adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow of a base year of 2020. Our focus this year will remain on execution. As you can see on Slide 10, we expect to complete approximately 3.4 gigawatts of new projects, including 2.1 gigawatts in the U.S. I will note that our 2023 guidance range does not include a potential upside from 600 megawatts of projects currently scheduled to be completed in December 2023, but which are likely to come online in 2024. Looking at our growth through 2025 on Slide 11. We expect to maintain the pace of PPA signings we have established with an estimated 14 gigawatts to 17 gigawatts expected to be signed over the next three years.We see strong demand for renewables across all of our key markets, particularly the U.S. where the benefits of the Inflation Reduction Act or IRA are becoming even clearer. Thus, given the strength of our backlog and our visibility into future PPA signings and project completions. We are confident in reaffirming our long-term guidance through 2025. Finally, today we're announcing that we will hold an Investor Day this spring, we will be sharing our strategic long-term view of the company, introducing new business segments, and extending our long-term growth rate. We will provide additional details at a later date. With that, I now would like to turn the call over to our CFO, Steve Coughlin.Pixabay/Public DomainSteve Coughlin: Thank you, Andres, and good morning everyone. Today, I will cover the following key topics. Our financial performance during 2022, our parent capital allocation, and our 2023 guidance and expectations through 2025. As Andres mentioned, our results for 2022 demonstrate the strength, resiliency, and flexibility of our portfolio as we surpassed our guidance range of $1.55 to $1.65. Overall, our portfolio was well structure to perform in the current market environment and is well-positioned for growth as AES continues to lead the global energy transition. Turning to Slide 13. Full-year 2022 adjusted EPS was $1.67 versus $1.52 in 2021, driven primarily by a significant volume of LNG sales in our increased ownership of AES Andes.These positive drivers were partially offset by unplanned outages, several one-time expenses we recorded at our U.S. and utilities and South America SBUs, a higher share count as a result of the 2021 accounting adjustment for our equity units, and higher parent interest stemming from higher debt balances. The $1.67 per share also includes approximately $0.12 of losses from AES Next. Primarily from our ownership in Fluence, which served as an additional drag year-over-year. We expect Fluence's results to significantly improve beginning this year as they discussed on their recent earnings call. Turning to Slide 14. Adjusted pretax contribution or PTC was $1.6 billion for the year, an increase of 149 million and a 11% growth over 2021. I'll cover our results in more detail over the next four slides, beginning with the U.S. and utilities SBU on Slide 15.Lower PTC in the U.S. was primarily driven by the recognition of one-time expenses from previously deferred purchased fuel and energy costs at our utilities. Outages at Southland Energy and AES Indiana in the second quarter and lower contributions from Clean Energy and the retirement of our coal plant in Hawaii. Partially offset by higher contributions from our Southland legacy assets in the third quarter. Higher PTC at our South America SBU was primarily driven by our increased ownership of AES Andes and higher margins at both AES Andes and AES Brazil, but partially offset by a prior year gain related to an arbitration at Alto Maipo, outages at AES Andes and a one-time regulatory provision in Argentina. Higher PTC at our MCAC SBU reflects the benefit from a large volume of LNG sales redirected to the international market.As I'll discuss later, we do not expect an opportunity of the same scale recur this year and anticipate lower PTC from MCAC in 2023. The LNG sales were partially offset by the full-year impact from the sale of our coal plant in the Dominican Republic in 2021. Finally, in Eurasia, adjusted PTC was relatively flat year-over-year with an overall net decline driven by higher interest expense, but partially offset by higher energy prices earned at our wind plant in Bulgaria. Now, let's turn to how we allocated our capital in 2022 on Slide 19. Beginning on the left hand side, sources reflect 1.3 billion or total discretionary cash. This includes parent free cash flow of $906 million, which was near the top end of our guidance expectations. Asset sales were below our expectations for the year, but we still expect to achieve our goal of $1 billion in proceeds by 2025.Given the delay in asset sales, we accelerated the issuance of some parent debt, which is within our long-term expectations. Moving to uses on the right hand side. We invested more than 700 million in growth at our subsidiaries, of which approximately two-thirds were in the U.S. We also allocated nearly 500 million of our discretionary cash to our dividend. Turning to our guidance and expectations, beginning on Slide 20. Today, we are initiating 2023 adjusted EPS guidance of $1.65 to $1.75. This year, we expect to commission approximately 3.4 gigawatts of new renewables, which is the largest year-over-year increase in AES history. This growth further validates AES' position as a leader in renewables and highlights the outstanding efforts of our commercial and operations teams in our markets.Roughly 65% of this new renewable capacity is located in the U.S. More than half our total 2023 adjusted PTC will come from the U.S. this year as we execute on the transformation of our portfolio. As I discussed last quarter, our U.S. renewables projects benefit from both investment tax credits and production tax credits. Our 2023 guidance includes approximately 500 million of adjusted PTC from tax credits generated and recognized by new U.S. renewable projects coming online this year, which is approximately double the amount from 2022. Tax credits are an important component of our renewables business earnings and cash flow and we intend to provide updates on our 2023 tax credit expectations throughout the year. While the midpoint of our 2023 guidance range is below our long-term annual growth target, we are reaffirming the 7% to 9% growth rate through 2025.2023 growth is lower than the long-term trend for a few reasons. First, we've taken a conservative approach to modeling renewables projects expected to come online in 2023. Our renewables construction is typically concentrated in the fourth quarter and this year will be no exception. As a result, construction delays of only a few days could cause a project to shift from 2023 to 2024 and negatively impact this year's results. This is particularly relevant for our U.S. renewables projects where we recognized significant earnings from investment tax credits in the year a project is placed into service. Of the 2.1 gigawatts we plan to complete in 2023, two-thirds are expected to come online in the fourth quarter. Our guidance assumes that an additional 600 megawatts of projects currently scheduled to come online in December slip into 2024.If some or all of these projects are completed on schedule, this will create up to $0.10 of upside to our 2023 guidance. It's also important to note that even if there are delays to next year, this is only a timing issue with no material value impact. And would support higher growth in 2024 with no impact on our long-term growth rate expectation. Second, we expect to see lower contributions from our MCAC SBU on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by more than 200 million of adjusted PTC from LNG sales we executed in 2022. Our commercial team was able to leverage the optionality embedded in our LNG supply contracts to capitalize on high international gas prices by redirecting Henry Hub-linked LNG cargoes to the international market. Although LNG sales will continue in 2023, we do not expect the same magnitude of opportunity as the spreads between Henry Hub and international gas prices have compressed and more of our gas supply this year is linked to TTF international prices rather than Henry Hub.Third, we expect to see lower margins at our Chile business this year, particularly in the first half of the year, which is a temporary impact of our Green blend and extend strategy to transition our customers from coal power to renewables. Several coal PPAs have or will expire this year as we proceed with our intent to fully exit coal by 2025, and others have been restructured to be priced off renewables that are still under construction. We view this as a short-term cost of decarbonizing our portfolio and do not expect any impact to our 7% to 9% long-term growth rate. Looking ahead, our teams are working on commercial solutions to mitigate the dilution as the portion of our earnings from coal continues to decline. Based on the drivers discussed, we expect our 2023 earnings to be significantly second half weighted with approximately three quarters recognized in the second half of the year.While we typically have had about two-thirds of our earnings in the second half, the increase in seasonality this year is driven by the significant volume of new U.S. renewable projects coming online in the fourth quarter. Now, turning to our 2023 parent capital allocation plan on Slide 21, beginning with approximately 2.2 billion of sources on the left-hand side. Parent free cash flow for 2023 is expected to be 950 million to 1 billion, in-line with our annualized growth target. In addition to parent free cash flow, we expect to generate 400 million to 600 million in asset sale proceeds this year. This includes our previously announced sale in Jordan, as well as the pending sell-down of some of our operating renewables in the U.S. I also want to point out that we intend to relaunch the sale process for our Mong Duong coal plant in Vietnam to better align with the approval requirements that became clear during the initial sale.The remaining portion of our 2023 asset sales is expected to come from additional sell-downs and sales supporting our decarbonization goals. Now, to the uses on the right-hand side. We plan to invest approximately 1.7 billion toward new growth, of which about two-thirds will be allocated in the U.S. to renewables and to increase our utility rate base. We expect to allocate approximately 500 million to our shareholder dividend, which reflects the previously announced 5% increase. In summary, we exceeded our financial commitments for 2022 and are confident in this year's guidance and the long-term outlook for AES. The energy transition provides tremendous investment and innovation opportunities, and I believe no company is better positioned than AES to lead this transition.As we execute on our strategy, we will continue to deliver on our financial commitments to maximize per share value for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andres.Andres Gluski: Thank you, Steve. In summary, 2022 was our best year ever. Not only did we meet or exceed our targets for adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow, but we signed more PPAs and added more renewables to our portfolio than ever before. Once again, we were recognized by BNEF as the top developer worldwide, selling clean energy to corporations through PPAs. We also launched the first mega scale green hydrogen project in the U.S. and developed a regulatory foundation that will enable us to grow our U.S. utilities by 9% annually through 2025. Looking forward, we are very well positioned for the future. Our leadership in corporate PPAs and green hydrogen gives a line of sight into our continued success. We remain focused on executing on our construction program and further developing our pipeline of potential future projects, and we are on track to exit coal by the end of 2025. With that, I would like to open up the call for questions.See also 12 Best S&amp;P 500 Dividend Stocks To Buy and 12 Cheap Biotech Stocks To Buy.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

In the latest setback, in January, a union sued GM's India unit and its global CEO for failing to pay court-ordered compensation to sacked factory workers.GM has previously said its employees have been legally separated and it remains confident of its legal position.India has been a tough battleground for Western carmakers, especially U.S. companies, that have struggled to break the dominance of Japan's Suzuki Motor and South Korea's Hyundai Motor, which together hold 60% market share. Like GM, Ford Motor, too, ceased operations in India.This acquisition will give Hyundai a second plant in India allowing the carmaker to boost production capacity at a time when it plans to launch six electric vehicles in India by 2028.

This $5 million investment will support the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made from algae, an abundant and scalable resource that can be grown and harvested without impacting the food supply chain.United Airlines logo. (PRNewsFoto/United Airlines)Viridos specializes in the bioengineering of microalgae and its proprietary technology accelerates the amount of oil that can produced from microalgae. This algae oil could then be used to scale the future production of SAF.SAF is an alternative to conventional jet fuel that, on a lifecycle basis, reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with air travel compared to conventional jet fuel alone.¹ SAF is made from used cooking oil and agricultural waste, and, in the future, could be made from other feedstocks, including household trash, forest waste, or algae. To date, United has invested in the future production of over three billion gallons of SAF - the most of any airline in the world.²""SAF is proven, scalable, and the best tool we have to reduce our carbon emissions from flying, but we face a significant shortage of available feedstock,"" said United Airlines Ventures President Mike Leskinen. ""As the global aviation leader in SAF production investment United remains committed to reaching net zero carbon emissions, without relying on traditional carbon offsets, by 2050. Viridos' algae-based biofuel technology has the potential to help solve our supply problem without the need for farmland or other agricultural resources and marks our inaugural investment in our new cross-industry UAV Sustainable Flight Fund.""Story continuesViridos, a biofuel company focused on decarbonizing industries, is leading the bioengineering of microalgae and has already achieved seven times the oil productivity compared to typical wild-type algae. This creates an opportunity for potentially scalable and more sustainable production of algae oil, that could later be used to produce SAF. Based on current estimates, SAF created by Viridos' algae oil is expected to have a 70% reduced carbon footprint on a lifecycle basis when compared to traditional jet fuel.Viridos' bioengineering technology combines several important and unique attributes contributing to better scalability and sustainability compared with traditional jet fuel production:Surface area oil productivities of Viridos algae far exceed any traditional oil crop, achieving high algae oil output on comparatively small areas.Viridos algae are grown in vessels containing seawater. This allows contained deployment in hot and dry locations without taxing scarce freshwater and arable land resources, while eliminating runoff.Viridos algae have extremely high oil contents facilitating downstream processing to algae oil.Viridos algae oil is a quality plant oil allowing existing bio-refineries to process the oil with high yield.""By establishing production sites to grow Viridos-engineered microalgae in saltwater, we are creating the foundation for a biofuel future that moves away from fossil fuels without competing for precious resources such as fresh water and arable land. We are excited to have the support from United Airlines. Together we can build the ecosystem needed to bring algae biofuels to the market,"" said Oliver Fetzer, Viridos Chief Executive Officer.About the UAV Sustainable Flight FundThe UAV Sustainable Flight Fund is a first-of-its-kind investment vehicle that is designed to leverage support from cross-industry businesses in order to support start-ups focused on decarbonizing air travel through SAF research, technology and production. The fund is starting with more than $100 million in investments from United and inaugural corporate partners Air Canada, Boeing, GE Aerospace, JPMorgan Chase and Honeywell. To date, nearly 6,000 United customers have contributed to supplement United's investment in the fund while purchasing tickets.The Federal Government Recognizes the Value of SAFThe 2022 Inflation Reduction Act includes the largest governmental climate change investments in U.S. history - a new blender's tax credit specifically for SAF along with other critical incentives for clean energy and carbon capture – that will help spur an increase in SAF infrastructure and supply while lowering costs for SAF consumers.The U.S. military currently uses nearly five billion gallons of jet fuel annually and the Department of Defense will use a jet fuel blend containing at least 10% SAF by 2028 because of the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act.And according to the U.S. Department of Energy, the country's vast feedstock resources are enough to meet the projected SAF demand of the entire U.S. aviation industry.United's Commitment to Net Zero Emissions by 2050United aims to be 100% green by reducing its GHG emissions 100% by 2050, without relying on traditional carbon offsets. In addition to the UAV Sustainable Flight Fund, United has launched a SAF purchasing program called the Eco-Skies Alliance and established a venture fund - United Airlines Ventures - to identify and invest in companies and technologies that can decarbonize air travel.

At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions and comments after the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Amanda Ho. Ma'am, the floor is yours.Amanda Ho: Thank you, Matt.

Now, I will turn the call over to Jeff.Jeffrey Guldner: Thanks, Amanda, and thank you all for joining us today. Good morning. In looking back on 2022, it was no doubt one of our most challenging years in recent memory is we faced major financial headwinds and a financial reset resulting from the outcome of our last rate case. I'm going to provide several updates today and share the successes we were able to achieve, despite the challenges we faced. Coming out of last rate case, we laid out a comprehensive plan and strategy and we met or exceeded nearly every target we set for ourselves, including delivering strong service reliability to our customers. We made significant progress in the last year but we're not done and we look forward to continuing to execute our plan.Story continuesTurning now to regulatory, we came out of the last rate case fully committed to improving our regulatory relationships, and we've seen progress as a result of our focus in that area. We received constructive decisions for all key items served by the previous bench during 2022, including our financing application last December. We started 2023 with two new commissioners and a new Chair, Commissioner Thompson and Commissioner Meyers joined the bench in January and Commissioner O'Connor was elected Chairman. We've already seen constructive actions and decisions by the new bench, including the creation of a docket to examine ways to reduce regulatory lag. We believe that these conversations are important and we look forward to working with the commission on thoughtful solutions.For our pending rate case, the administrative law judge issued a procedural order in December, outlining the schedule. The first round of staff and intervenor testimony is due in May with the hearing set to commence in early August. We look forward to working with the parties and the commission through the rate case process and in gaining additional regulatory clarity. Our number one goal continues be to be doing what's right for the people and prosperity of Arizona, which includes working collaboratively with the commission and building a more constructive relationship. Turning to the operation side, I want to start by recognizing our field team's exceptional execution in 2022, I'm especially proud of our employees for prioritizing safety and ending the year with significantly lower employee injuries.Three low-energy SIPs and our lowest number of OSHA recordable injuries on record. We had one of the most hazardous and damaging summer storm seasons in recent history, where we saw a record number of poles damaged. And for context we replaced over 800 poles, which is about 500 more than an average summer. In addition, while parts of the southwest region experienced capacity shortages, again in 2022, our careful long-term planning and resource adequacy allowed us to serve our customers reliably. Additionally, we remain engaged in the western wholesale market which allowed us to make off-system sales and to create savings for APS customers. Importantly, those off-system sales directly benefit APS customers by lowering our overall costs, while helping maintain regional grid stability.And finally, our generation units performed extremely well with our nonnuclear fleet, recording a summertime equivalent availability factor, EAF of 95%, and we achieved a capacity factor of 100.2% at the Palo Verde Generating Station. We recognize the importance of creating customer value and remain focused on improving our customer experience. Our employees are committed to putting customers first and working towards our goal of achieving an industry-leading best-in-class customer experience. As a result of this commitment, we made extraordinary progress on that front in 2022 with APS earning ratings from its customers making it among the most improved utilities in the nation for both residential and business customer satisfaction, measured by J.D. Power.Compared to 2021, APS achieved quartile gains in every single driver of residential and business customer satisfaction, firmly lifting the company into the second quartile nationally for residential customers, in the first quartile nationally for business customers. Consequently, overall satisfaction is now well above industry benchmarks when compared to the Company's large investor-owned peers. We also continue to make progress on our resource procurement and clean energy commitment since announcing our goal to reach 100% clean carbon-free energy by 2050, three years ago. We procured over 2,100 megawatts of clean and affordable energy resources. Additionally, as previously discussed, we issued an all-source RFP last year for another 1,000 to 1,500 megawatts of new resources to be in service from 2025 to 2027, and we continue to work through finalizing procurement decisions from that RFP.These substantial investments are essential resources designed to help us keep pace with Arizona's tremendous growth. At the same time, electricity capacity markets are tightening across the entire West. Looking forward, our goals for 2023 include, continuously improving our customer communication and engagement; achieving a constructive outcome in our pending rate case; and reliably serving customers through the tremendous growth in our service territory. And I want to once again recognize the near-term headwinds that are created by the unfavorable outcome of our previous rate case and how it will continue to make 2023 challenging. However, we believe in our ability to provide long-term value to both customers and shareholders and we look forward to executing our plan and continuing our proven cost management efforts all against the backdrop of Arizona's extraordinary economic expansion.So I want to thank you for your time today and I'm going to turn the call over to Andrew, who will talk about our fourth quarter and full-year 2022 earnings and our forward-looking financial expectations. Andrew?Photo by Matthew Henry on UnsplashAndrew Cooper: Thank you, Jeff, and thanks again to everyone for joining us today. This morning we reported our fourth quarter and full-year financial results for 2022 and introduced guidance for 2023. I will cover our results and provide additional details around the financial outlook for 2023 and beyond. As Jeff discussed, we remain in our period of financial reset during the near-term. But right upfront I want to make clear that while we are navigating through challenges brought on by the negative outcome over the last rate case, we have been executing well on our plan and we remain confident in our ability to create renewed growth and deliver strong shareholder returns. For the fourth quarter of 2022, we lost $0.21 per share, down $0.45 compared to fourth quarter 2021.The unfavorable rate case decision and reduction in net income from no longer deferring the costs related to the Four Corners SCR and Ocotillo modernization project have been the primary driver of lower results all year and that remain the case for the fourth quarter. The quarter also included a $17.1 million impairment charge relating to a Bright Canyon energy equity investment. This was a legacy investment by Bright Canyon for a minority stake in a wind farm. In the fourth quarter, we determined that impairment of the investment was appropriate due to ongoing disputes on transmission cost allocation and a lack of a probable favorable outcome. Other negative impacts included lower LFCR revenues, higher O&amp;M and higher interest expense. Favorable weather and customer and sales growth were partial offsets to the negative drivers in the fourth quarter.For our full year results for 2022, we earned $4.26 per share, down from $5.47 per share in 2021. We ended the year in line with our updated full year guidance. As noted earlier, the negative rate case outcome drove a financial reset and is the primary driver for the lower year-over-year results. The Bright Canyon impairment charge, higher O&amp;M and higher interest expense were other negative drivers for lower year-over-year results. The Bright Canyon impairment charge, higher O&amp;M and higher interest expense were other negative drivers for lower year-over-year results. For the year, we saw beneficial weather as well as customer and sales growth that partially offset the negative drivers. Turning to customer growth the fourth quarter remained in-line with our guidance at 2.1%, which was also the customer growth rate for the full-year.Arizona continues to be a popular destination for relocation and have the fifth highest population growth in 2022, according to recent data from U.S. Census Bureau. Arizona has continued to show strong employment growth, including an emerging areas of economic diversification with manufacturing employment, for example, growing at 6.2% to 2022 as compared to a U.S. rate of 3.8%. We also continue to experience strong weather health growth. Sales increased 1.2% in the fourth quarter relative to the prior year and for the full year 2022, our weather-normalized sales growth was 2.4% in line with our upwardly revised guidance range. This was anchored by strong C&amp;I growth of 4.6% over 2021, as the benefits of Arizona is increasingly diversified economy realized.In fact, Phoenix Metro was recently named a top three industrial market to watch in 2023 according to a JLL tenant demand study that evaluated 60 U.S. markets. Moving on to our financial outlook. Our 2023 earnings guidance range is $3.95 to $4.15 per share. Although this is a decline from 2022 actual results, the range is comparable to our weather-normalized 2022 guidance range of $3.90 to $4.10 per share. We forecast steady customer growth and robust sales growth ahead in 2023. Headwinds for 2023 include higher benefit expense, interest expense and plant D&amp;A. We continue to target declining O&amp;M per megawatt hour and believe our proven track record of cost management and lean initiatives will help us successfully navigate through this inflationary period.We continue to have a strong focus on O&amp;M and look for opportunities to create efficiencies, reduce risk and keep our costs low to maintain affordable rates for our customers. Looking at our forecasted customer growth, we expect it to remain strong and are maintaining the 1.5% to 2.5% guidance range for 2023. On sales growth we expect continued strength particularly in the C&amp;I segments as economic diversification takes hold in areas such as semiconductor hubs, other large manufacturing and distribution. In fact, TSMC recently announced plans to build a second fab of the North Phoenix location increasing its original $12 billion investment to $40 billion. TSMC estimates site will employ 4,500 permanent jobs and increase from the earlier projection of 2,000.In addition, Procter &amp; Gamble, also announced plans for $500 million investments in the manufacturing facility, creating 500 new jobs. Anchored by examples like these, we are expecting our weather-normalized sales growth range to be 3.5% to 5.5% for 2023. Turning to pension. As a reminder, our pension is 106% funded with no expectation for contributions needed in the near-term. We remain committed to the long-term benefits of our liability driven investment strategy and the reduced volatility of a fixed-income weighted portfolio. Nevertheless, we are expecting a headwind in 2023, primarily resulting from the net effect of higher discount rates. Higher benefit expense in 2023 has also impacted by negative 2022 investment returns and is partially offset by the impact of higher expected returns on assets in 2023.All-in we expect benefit expense to be $0.33 headwind for 2023 as compared to 2022. However, we continue to evaluate options for regulatory recovery of higher benefit expense. Turning to interest expense as the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates, try to combat inflation. We are closely monitoring our financing needs. I would highlight that we do not have any maturities until mid-2024, that we do expect higher interest expense year-over-year. We've also updated our capital plan to $5.3 billion from 2023 to 2025 with rate base growth at an average annual growth rate of 5% to 7%. Importantly, the increase in CapEx is independent of any rate case outcome and is directly related to loan growth and the needed investments we are making in more resilient infrastructure.This update is need to simply to keep up with that growth and reliably serve customers. We have also updated our financing plan to meet the demands of our updated capital plan. We are continuing to defer any equity issuance and so resolution of the current rate case and remain focused on achieving a constructive regulatory outcome. The rest of our financial outlook remains consistent. Our outlook includes long-term earnings growth of 5% to 7% of the midpoint of our weather-normalized 2022 guidance range. We have a track record of dividend growth and the Board recently raised our quarterly dividend to $0.865 per share. While our current payout ratio is higher than our target, we believe our plan will allow us to achieve our long-term dividend payout ratio of 65% to 75% in the future, recognizing that all future dividends are subject to approval by our Board.We have a path forward that is centered around our long-term track-record of constructive rate case outcomes, a robust service territory growth, continued balance sheet strength and cost discipline and a focused management team that is taking action. We look-forward to building on the great work we were able to accomplish in 2022 and executing on this plan in 2023. This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions.See also 15 Countries with the Largest Uranium Reserves in the World and 20 Biggest Nonalcoholic Beverage Companies in the US.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"
119,6e62fd3d-b849-344c-9f3e-df6473e8b34b,TGT,2023-03-13,Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) insiders who sold US$666k worth of stock earlier this year are probably glad they did so as market cap slides to US$73b,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-corporation-nyse-tgt-insiders-130023208.html,1678712423,STORY,['TGT'],"[By selling US$666k worth of Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) stock at an average sell price of US$202 over the last year, insiders seemed to have made the most of their holdings. After the stock price dropped 4.2% last week, the company's market value declined by US$3.2b, but insiders were able to mitigate their losses.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Target The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At TargetOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Robert Harrison, for US$453k worth of shares, at about US$218 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$158). So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.Target insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeI will like Target better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Target insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$159m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Target Insider Transactions Indicate?The fact that there have been no Target insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Target insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. For example, Target has 4 warning signs (and 1 which shouldn't be ignored) we think you should know about.But note: Target may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. In light of that, when we looked at Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Intuitive Surgical:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.14 = US$1.6b ÷ (US$13b - US$1.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Thus, Intuitive Surgical has an ROCE of 14%.  On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 10.0% generated by the Medical Equipment industry. View our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Intuitive Surgical compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Intuitive Surgical.What Does the ROCE Trend For Intuitive Surgical Tell Us?On the surface, the trend of ROCE at Intuitive Surgical doesn't inspire confidence. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 21% over the last five years. On the other hand, the company has been employing more capital without a corresponding improvement in sales in the last year, which could suggest these investments are longer term plays. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.In Conclusion...Bringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by Intuitive Surgical's reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. Since the stock has gained an impressive 58% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.Story continuesIf you're still interested in Intuitive Surgical it's worth checking out our  FREE intrinsic value approximation  to see if it's trading at an attractive price in other respects.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

One of his favorite stocks is Ardmore Shipping Corporation (NYSE:ASC), an oil &amp; gas storage &amp; transportation company. Mr. Navellier likes Ardmore Shipping Corporation (NYSE:ASC) and generally petroleum shipping stocks because of favorable oil export trends from the U.S. and Russia. As of December 31, Navellier &amp; Associates has a position worth $1.99 million in Ardmore Shipping Corporation (NYSE:ASC).Another stock Louis Navellier is bullish on is Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. (NASDAQ:CALM), one of the largest egg producers in the United States. Louis Navellier likes this stock because egg prices have risen significantly in the U.S. over 2022, roughly 70% according to CNBC. Louis Navellier sees Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. (NASDAQ:CALM) profiting from higher egg prices due to the company's size, scale, and market position. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Louis Navellier increased his hedge fund's exposure to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. (NASDAQ:CALM) by 14% and has a position worth $1.93 million in the company.Story continuesFinally, Louis Navellier likes Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW), a major American food processing company and one of the largest producers of frozen potato products. Louis Navellier is bullish on Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW) due to its market position and noted that the company is well-positioned to profit from an ongoing potato shortage and higher potato prices. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Navellier &amp; Associates initiated a position in Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW). The fund's stake in the company is valued at $3.69 million.Louis Navellier Weighs In On The Jobs Report and SVB CollapseOn March 10, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released the jobs report for February 2023 which showed that the U.S. added 311,000 jobs in February, down from the revised 504,000 jobs in January 2023, but still above economists' estimates of 205,000. The unemployment rate rose to 3.6%, up from 3.4% in January 2023. Another major event that sent stocks crashing on Friday, was the collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank. On March 10, Reuters reported that a California regulator shut down SVB after regulators discovered the bank had insufficient liquidity and is insolvent. On March 10, the S&amp;P 500 lost 1.45%, the Nasdaq went down by 1.76%, and the Dow fell by 1.07%.On March 10, 2023, Louis Navellier shared his insights on both of these events on a podcast uploaded on his firm's website. Mr. Navellier noted that though job creation in America is still strong, the unemployment rate is going up. He sees one of two possibilities for this scenario: ""either the workforce is exploding in size, or the government is messing with the seasonal adjustments"". Louis Navellier noted that the U.S. government overstated economic statistics in the jobs report for January 2023, as well as for retail sales for the month. Here are some comments from Louis Navellier about the SVB collapse, the Fed, and what he thinks the Fed will do at the next FOMC meeting:""Here's what's really going on. The Fed's in charge of the banking system and it's not good to have a run on any bank, because it kind of taints the neighborhood. So even though we don't recommend financial stocks generally, the financial sector is really a mess right now. Because what's happened is, every bank that had treasury securities, watched the value of their collateral drop as yields went higher. Now they can invest it on the right part of the yield curve, maybe lose less, but something is going on. The Fed's in charge of the banking system, so they are probably only going to raise rates 25 basis points on March 22nd. The reason I know that is because market rates are collapsing. So today, as I talk to you, the 10-year bond yield is 3.73 (%), and it was over 4% not that long ago, the real shocker is the 2-year yield which was over 5%, is now 4.64 (%). So that's a big big drop in rates, whether we look at the 2-year, the 10-year, the Fed doesn't fight market rates. So the consensus is that interest rates might have spiked earlier due to bogus economic data, payroll and retail sales being exaggerated in January. Now reality is coming home to roost, now people are finding out things aren't as strong as they wanted, and finally treasury yields are collapsing.""Louis Navellier thinks that the collapse of SVB is going to cause the Fed to not raise interest rates much higher and go ahead with a 25 basis point hike.We have come up with a list of the 12 most thrilling and high-growth stocks to buy now according to Louis Navellier, which include CF Industries Holdings Inc. (NYSE:CF), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP). Let's now discuss these stocks, among others, in detail.12 Thrilling Stocks to Buy According to Louis NavellierLouis Navellier of Navellier &amp; AssociatesOur MethodologyWe sifted through Navellier &amp; Associates' Q4 2022 13F portfolio and went through the fund's top 50 holdings. We narrowed down our selection to the 12 stocks that exhibited the highest year-over-year revenue growth over the past 3 years. We have ranked these stocks in ascending order of Navellier &amp; Associates' stake in them.12. Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NASDAQ:BLDR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52Navellier &amp; Associates' Stake Value: $3,314,1353-year Revenue Growth: 46.15%On February 28, Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NASDAQ:BLDR) posted strong earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022. The company reported an EPS of $3.21 and outperformed EPS estimates by $0.90. The company's revenue for the quarter amounted to $4.36 billion and beat market consensus by $104.26 million.Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NASDAQ:BLDR) is one of the most thrilling stocks to buy according to Louis Navellier. The company has a 3-year average revenue growth rate of 46.15%. For fiscal 2022, the company grew its revenue by 14.24% year over year. As of December 31, Navellier &amp; Associates has a position worth $3.3 million in the company.At the end of Q4 2022, 52 hedge funds held stakes in Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NASDAQ:BLDR) worth $1.11 billion. This is compared to 49 hedge funds in the previous quarter with stakes worth $1.17 billion.Here is what Black Bear Value Partners had to say about Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR) is a manufacturer and supplier of building materials with a focus on residential construction. Historically this business was cyclical with minimal pricing power as the primary products sold were lumber and other non-value-add housing materials. Since the GFC, BLDR has focused on growing their value-add business that is now 40%+ of the topline. BLDR can pre-assemble components such as a roof truss and deliver it to the homesite. This allows homebuilders (their end-users) to shorten their construction time and have higher returns on capital. The company has modest leverage and has been using their abundant free-cash-flow to buy in over 30% of the stock in the last 18 months.While mortgage rates are higher, they are not unusual versus history. The low rates of the last 5-10 years are the outlier. We have a structural shortage of housing in the USA. With existing homeowners locked into low rate mortgages, the aspiring homeowner may increasingly need to find a home from a homebuilder. The next 6-12 months could be rocky as people adjust to the increase in pricing and rates. Eventually the housing market should adjust to the new normal (or rates could go down). We do have a large credit short which benefits if rates continue to go up.Normalized free-cash-flow per share looks to be in the range of $8-$12 per year. At year end pricing of ~$65 that implies a free-cash-flow yield of 12-18%. If we owned this business privately and someone offered us a teens annual cash-flow yield, we would be jumping at it! The pessimism surrounding housing, interest rates and recession fears provides some of the reasons why this opportunity exists.”In addition to Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NASDAQ:BLDR), other top stocks held by Navellier &amp; Associates that have exhibited high revenue growth over the past 3 years include CF Industries Holdings Inc. (NYSE:CF), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP).11. Steel Dynamics, Inc.

(NASDAQ:STLD) and disclosed collective positions worth $283.5 million in the company. This is compared to 28 positions in the previous quarter with stakes worth $228.2 million. The hedge fund sentiment for the stock is positive.10. Cenovus Energy Inc.

(NYSE:CVE) was held by 46 hedge funds at the end of Q4 2022. These funds held collective positions worth $2.31 billion in the company, up from $2.16 billion in the previous quarter with 47 hedge funds.Here is what L1 Capital had to say about Cenovus Energy Inc. (NYSE:CVE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Cenovus Energy (Long -13%) shares declined over the quarter due to an ~18% decline in oil prices on increasing fears of a U.S recession and a slowdown in global growth. Given the long-life nature of its oil sand assets and its low cost of production, we estimate Cenovus is free cash flow break-even at an oil price of ~US$40/bbl. Despite the recent fall, oil prices remain more than double this break-even point, implying considerable free cash flow generation potential for the company at current levels, with Cenovus currently trading on a consensus FY22 free cash flow yield of around 20%. There are also additional value realisation catalysts with the company continuing to progress the de-gearing of its balance sheet via organic cash generation and asset sales.”9.

AMN Healthcare Services provides workforce solutions and staffing services at healthcare facilities. An unstable healthcare employment environment is driving pricing and volume growth for contract labor, which we believe is unsustainable.”8. Essential Utilities, Inc.

126,012b2ce1-ab29-31b0-a129-46c1f9180c21,NVDA,2023-03-13,Is NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Latest Stock Performance A Reflection Of Its Financial Health?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-corporations-nasdaq-nvda-latest-120035378.html,1678708835,STORY,['NVDA'],"[NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 27% over the last three months. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. In this article, we decided to focus on NVIDIA's  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for NVIDIA How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for NVIDIA is:20% = US$4.4b ÷ US$22b (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.20 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of NVIDIA's Earnings Growth And 20% ROETo begin with, NVIDIA seems to have a respectable ROE. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 19%. Consequently, this likely laid the ground for the decent growth of 19% seen over the past five years by NVIDIA.As a next step, we compared NVIDIA's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 28% in the same period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. If you're wondering about NVIDIA's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is NVIDIA Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?In NVIDIA's case, its respectable earnings growth can probably be explained by its low three-year median payout ratio of 7.1% (or a retention ratio of 93%), which suggests that the company is investing most of its profits to grow its business.Moreover, NVIDIA is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 2.5% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 56%, over the same period.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with NVIDIA's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see a good amount of growth in its earnings. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So, when we ran our eye over Air Products and Chemicals' (NYSE:APD) trend of ROCE, we liked what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Air Products and Chemicals is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.10 = US$2.6b ÷ (US$28b - US$3.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Thus, Air Products and Chemicals has an ROCE of 10%.  That's a relatively normal return on capital, and it's around the 11% generated by the Chemicals industry. Check out our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Air Products and Chemicals compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Air Products and Chemicals here  for free.The Trend Of ROCEWhile the current returns on capital are decent, they haven't changed much. The company has employed 53% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 10%. 10% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that Air Products and Chemicals has consistently earned this amount. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Air Products and Chemicals' ROCEThe main thing to remember is that Air Products and Chemicals has proven its ability to continually reinvest at respectable rates of return. Therefore it's no surprise that shareholders have earned a respectable 90% return if they held over the last five years. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.Like most companies, Air Products and Chemicals does come with some risks, and we've found 2 warning signs  that you should be aware of.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. Check out our latest analysis for Devon Energy How Fast Is Devon Energy Growing Its Earnings Per Share?Over the last three years, Devon Energy has grown earnings per share (EPS) at as impressive rate from a relatively low point, resulting in a three year percentage growth rate that isn't particularly indicative of expected future performance. Thus, it makes sense to focus on more recent growth rates, instead. Outstandingly, Devon Energy's EPS shot from US$4.20 to US$9.11, over the last year. Year on year growth of 117% is certainly a sight to behold. That could be a sign that the business has reached a true inflection point.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. The music to the ears of Devon Energy shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 25% to 42% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-historyWhile we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for Devon Energy?Are Devon Energy Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$34b company like Devon Energy. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$243m. We note that this amounts to 0.7% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Devon Energy but it's still worth mentioning. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Should You Add Devon Energy To Your Watchlist?Devon Energy's earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. This level of EPS growth does wonders for attracting investment, and the large insider investment in the company is just the cherry on top. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here. Based on the sum of its parts, we definitely think its worth watching Devon Energy very closely. You still need to take note of risks, for example - Devon Energy has   3 warning signs  (and 1 which can't be ignored)  we think you should know about.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

This week’s list includes Oracle ORCL, AutoZone AZO, Costco COST, FedEx FDX and Lennar LEN.2023 Q1 Earnings Preview: What Are Estimates Telling Us?The 2022 Q4 earnings reports displayed that contrary to fears of an impending earnings cliff, companies were largely able to protect their bottom lines.We are not suggesting that the earnings picture that came out through the preceding reporting cycle was great, but rather that it proved to be much more stable and resilient than many had been willing to give credit to.Actual Q4 results came in better than expected, but that didn't mean much in terms of earnings growth. Not much of a surprise on that count either, given where we are in the economic cycle and the multitude of headwinds facing corporate profitability.We all know that the lagged effect of the extraordinary tightening already implemented and the incremental rate hikes ahead, including in this month's Fed meeting, will at least slow down the economy, if not push into a recession as many have started to fear.In fact, many in the market fear that the unusual strength in the U.S. economy, as reconfirmed by Friday's February jobs report, will force the Fed to stay in the tightening mode longer than would have been the case otherwise. This is showing up in the market's evolving expectations of the Fed Funds 'exit rate', the final level at which the central bank concludes the ongoing tightening cycle. Many are now penciling in an exit rate of 6% or higher, up from their earlier projections of about 5.5%.All of this has direct earnings implications for the U.S. economy's growth trajectory and the health of corporate profitability.2023 Q1 earnings are expected to be down -9.4% on +1.8% higher revenues. This would follow the -5.7% earnings decline in the preceding period (2022 Q4) on +5.6% higher revenues.Story continuesEmbedded in these 2023 Q1 earnings and revenue growth projections is the expectation of continued margin pressures, which has been a recurring theme in recent quarters.Analysts have been steadily lowering their estimates for Q1, a trend that we saw ahead of the start of the last few reporting cycles as well. To give full context, this behavior of negative estimate revisions just ahead of the beginning of the reporting cycle for that period is far from the course, historically speaking. We saw this shift during Covid when estimates started going up for some time. But that trend 'normalized' last year and hence the negative revisions to 2023 Q1 estimates.Please note that while 2023 Q1 estimates have come down, the magnitude of negative revisions compares favorably to what we saw in the comparable periods to the preceding couple of quarters. In other words, estimates haven't fallen as much as they did in the last few quarters.Estimates for full-year 2023 have also been coming down, as we have consistently pointed out in these pages.As we have been pointing out all along, 2023 earnings estimates peaked in April 2022 and have been coming down ever since. Since the mid-April peak, aggregate earnings have declined by -12.6% for the index as a whole and -14.5% for the index on an ex-Energy basis, with the declines far bigger in a number of major sectors.You have likely read about the roughly -20% cuts to S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates, on average, in response to recessions.Many in the market interpret this to mean that estimates still have plenty to fall in the days ahead. But as the aforementioned magnitude of negative revisions at -11.7% on an ex-Energy basis shows, we have already traveled a fair distance in that direction. Importantly, some key sectors in the path of the Fed's tightening cycle, like Construction, Retail, Discretionary, and even Technology, have already gotten their 2023 estimates shaved off by a fifth since mid-April.We are not saying that estimates don't need to fall any further. But rather that the bulk of the cuts are likely behind us, particularly if the coming economic downturn is a lot less problematic than many seem to assume or fear.Please note that the $1.903 trillion aggregate earnings estimate for the index in 2023 approximates to an index 'EPS' of $114.86, down from $221.22 in 2022.This Week's Reporting DocketThe reality of an earning season is that it never ends completely. In fact, every quarter has this one period when the older reporting cycle hasn't completely ended yet, but the new one has gotten underway.We are in such an overlapping period at present, with a couple of 2022 Q4 results still awaited while the 2023 Q1 earnings season has gotten underway. Quarterly results in recent days from three S&amp;P 500 members, Oracle, AutoZone and Costco, for their respective fiscal periods ending in February, form part of our 2023 Q1 tally. We have another four index members on deck to report fiscal February quarter results this week, including FedEx and Lennar.The Q1 reporting cycle will really pick up steam when the big banks come out with their quarterly results on April 14th.For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Will Tech Sector Earnings Growth Resume in Q1?Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

(Nasdaq: MU), today announced the release of its fifth annual diversity, equality and inclusion (DEI) report titled, “We are Micron,” to mark progress and achievements across its six DEI commitments.“These commitments hold Micron accountable to seek greater diversity, drive equal pay and benefits, strengthen our culture of inclusion and be a positive force for all,” said Micron President and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra. “Our commitment to DEI extends globally. It is embedded in our business practices and in our investments for the future.”As Micron expands its global leading-edge manufacturing and R&amp;D capability over the next decade, the company has made significant commitments that will help build the diverse workforce for the future. This has been a centerpiece of Micron’s recent expansion announcements in Idaho and New York. Micron is working across Idaho to create a workforce development plan. Under this plan, the company will build a high-skilled talent pipeline through targeted DEI investments in rural communities and with veteran organizations to create equitable access for underrepresented groups. In New York, Micron established an industry-first Community Investment Framework in partnership with the state. This framework reflects shared community priorities, including training and education programs to expand employment opportunities for women, people of color, veterans and other underrepresented communities. These efforts build on Micron’s commitment to growing a diverse STEM talent pipeline in the communities where it does business.“We are proud of the meaningful progress our team is making to foster diversity, equality and inclusion inside and outside the company,” said April Arnzen, senior vice president and chief people officer at Micron and president of the Micron Foundation. “At Micron, we believe that respecting and valuing diversity encourages our team members to share their unique perspectives and fuel innovation and creativity, and that’s why we continue to focus on DEI at all levels of the company.”Story continues“We Are Micron” DEI Report HighlightsMicron’s female workforce increased globally for the fourth year in a row, now representing 31% of the global workforce and trending ahead of the industry average. The company’s percentage of women increased for vice presidents, senior leaders and leaders in technical positions around the globe. More than 22% of the original patent applications that Micron filed in fiscal year 2022 (FY22) named a woman as an inventor, for a total of 182 female team members — an increase of 10% over FY21. As a part of Micron’s growth, Micron is committed to supporting women and families by identifying quality, affordable and accessible child care solutions for the direct workforce and broader community globally. This includes FY23 investments and partnerships in Malaysia and the United States to provide affordable world-class child care facilities and support to Micron employees.Micron also enhanced its focus on the veteran community, with representation increasing for the fourth year in a row to approximately 9% of its U.S. workforce for FY22. Now veterans account for nearly 17% of Micron’s overall workforce in the U.S. Aspiring to hire more than 1,500 veterans, the company established new partnerships with Syracuse University’s D’Aniello Institute of Veteran and Military Families (IVMF) to help veterans develop the skills necessary for advanced manufacturing jobs and transitions into Micron and other industry roles.Micron actively participates in diversity and inclusion indexes, listed on the Bloomberg Equality Index for the first time this year and achieving a perfect score on the U.S. Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index for the second year in a row. Also, for the first time, in FY22, Micron India and Micron Japan received recognition, through the India Workplace Equality Index and Japan Pride Index, respectively, for their inclusion of the LGBTQ+ community. Micron participated in the 2022 Disability Equality index for the second time and was named on its list of Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion.In 2021, Micron achieved comprehensive global pay equity for all underrepresented groups, for base pay, cash bonuses and stock awards among veteran, Black or Hispanic/Latino employees in the United States, as well as for gender and people with disabilities globally.

(NYSE:UPS)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-fair-value-united-parcel-110054227.html,1678705254,STORY,['UPS'],"[Key InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, United Parcel Service fair value estimate is US$153With US$182 share price, United Parcel Service appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value Analyst price target for UPS is US$192, which is 25% above our fair value estimateToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for United Parcel Service The ModelWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$8.14bUS$8.71bUS$9.10bUS$8.92bUS$8.86bUS$8.88bUS$8.94bUS$9.04bUS$9.17bUS$9.32bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x11Analyst x3Analyst x2Est @ -0.64%Est @ 0.17%Est @ 0.74%Est @ 1.14%Est @ 1.42%Est @ 1.61% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.1% US$7.5kUS$7.5kUS$7.2kUS$6.5kUS$6.0kUS$5.6kUS$5.2kUS$4.8kUS$4.5kUS$4.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$59bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$9.3b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.1%– 2.1%) = US$158bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$158b÷ ( 1 + 8.1%)10= US$72bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$131b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$182, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at United Parcel Service as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.016. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for United Parcel ServiceStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Logistics market.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For United Parcel Service, there are three important items you should further research:Risks: For instance, we've identified   3 warning signs for United Parcel Service (1 can't be ignored)  you should be aware of.Future Earnings: How does UPS's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

146,de971b77-f83b-336f-a7cc-65c9ac506917,PPL,2023-03-13,PPL (NYSE:PPL) Could Be At Risk Of Shrinking As A Company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ppl-nyse-ppl-could-risk-102907981.html,1678703347,STORY,['PPL'],"[When we're researching a company, it's sometimes hard to find the warning signs, but there are some financial metrics that can help spot trouble early. Businesses in decline often have two underlying trends, firstly, a declining return on capital employed (ROCE) and a declining base of capital employed. Ultimately this means that the company is earning less per dollar invested and on top of that, it's shrinking its base of capital employed. And from a first read, things don't look too good at PPL (NYSE:PPL), so let's see why.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on PPL is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.042 = US$1.4b ÷ (US$38b - US$3.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Therefore, PPL has an ROCE of 4.2%. In absolute terms, that's a low return but it's around the Electric Utilities industry average of 4.7%. Check out our latest analysis for PPL roceIn the above chart we have measured PPL's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for PPL.What Can We Tell From PPL's ROCE Trend?There is reason to be cautious about PPL, given the returns are trending downwards. Unfortunately the returns on capital have diminished from the 8.2% that they were earning five years ago. Meanwhile, capital employed in the business has stayed roughly the flat over the period. Companies that exhibit these attributes tend to not be shrinking, but they can be mature and facing pressure on their margins from competition. So because these trends aren't typically conducive to creating a multi-bagger, we wouldn't hold our breath on PPL becoming one if things continue as they have.Story continuesOur Take On PPL's ROCEIn the end, the trend of lower returns on the same amount of capital isn't typically an indication that we're looking at a growth stock. Investors must expect better things on the horizon though because the stock has risen 23% in the last five years. Either way, we aren't huge fans of the current trends and so with that we think you might find better investments elsewhere.Like most companies, PPL does come with some risks, and we've found 2 warning signs  that you should be aware of.While PPL isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

A copy of the same can be downloaded here. In 2022, the fund declined −8.91% slightly outperforming the S&amp;P 500 Financials Index which returned −10.53%. Investments in property and casualty (P&amp;C) insurance, foreign banks, and Berkshire Hathaway were the primary contributors while U.S. bank and consumer-lending holdings detracted from the performance. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2022.Davis Financial Fund highlighted stocks like Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) in its 2022 annual investor letter. Headquartered in McLean, Virginia, Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) is a financial services company. On March 10, 2023, Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) stock closed at $98.19 per share. One-month return of Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) was -16.34%, and its shares lost 26.54% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) has a market capitalization of $37.418 billion.Davis Financial Fund made the following comment about Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) in its 2022 annual investor letter:""Let’s consider our largest holding in Davis Financial Fund, Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF). The company’s two main consumer-facing lending businesses are credit cards and autos. Credit quality trends in both lines have followed a similar path, as seen in Figure 4. Delinquencies and charge-offs declined in 2020– 2021 relative to pre-COVID-19 levels, but more recently they’ve started to experience an uptick in delinquencies (which naturally would precede any increase in charge-offs). So, the trajectory does suggest that the credit environment is deteriorating from what it was, but the absolute level of the trend remains favorable relative to the longer-term past. As Capital One’s CEO Rich Fairbank recently noted, “It would be very abnormal if we were not seeing normalization.”We try to avoid making forecasts about macroeconomic variables, though given the Federal Reserve’s desire to rein in inflation through tighter monetary policy, a recession within the next year or so remains the most plausible scenario. Regardless of exactly how the next six- to-eighteen months play out we’ve always assumed that our companies would need to live through a recession at some point during our holding period.The important question is, how well prepared are the companies to get through it? Their first line of defense is the allowance for loan losses that has already been booked. Accounting rules require a company to make a “life of loan” estimate of total credit losses, so their existing allowance already reflects a consensus economic outlook that calls for a slowing economy and a gradual rise in the unemployment rate. The actual path taken by the economy can of course veer adversely from the current outlook, but the point is that banks’ reserves already incorporate a down payment on reversion to the mean of economic trends…” (Click here to read the full text)Story continuesbackground, modern, room,ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comCapital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

(NYSE:WM), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 82% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Waste Management, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Waste Management ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Waste Management?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Waste Management. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Waste Management, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Waste Management. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.2% of shares outstanding. Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Asset Trust is the second largest shareholder owning 8.6% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 7.5% of the company stock.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 24 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Waste ManagementThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Waste Management, Inc. in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$119m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 18% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Waste Management. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Waste Management   you should know about.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

153,e1b1493e-a3b8-37ca-8f2c-ddaa5c0743a7,SRE,2023-03-13,Opinion: Who profits from Southern California's high gas bills? The problem is we don't know,LA Times,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/opinion-profits-southern-californias-high-103025509.html,1678703425,STORY,"['NG=F', 'SRE']","[Above-ground storage tanks at Southern California Gas Co.'s Honor Rancho facility in Santa Clarita. (Bloomberg via Getty Images)The doubling and in some cases quadrupling of Southern Californians’ natural gas bills in recent months stemmed from rapid price spikes in the so-called spot market, a real-time wholesale market for the fuel. The lack of transparency in California’s spot market for gasoline played a similarly major role in the pummeling California drivers took at the pump last year.The secrecy surrounding transactions in both of these markets keeps the public in the dark about who is making a fortune off their pain. Transparency would not only reveal the profiteers but could also discourage future gouging.Southern California Gas Co., the monopoly that provides gas in Southern California, usually draws down its stored inventory of gas in the winter instead of buying it during the colder months, when it is most expensive. This year, however, rather than tap its inventory, the utility chose to buy massive quantities of gas on the spot market — where someone made a fortune off natural gas prices that were 10 times higher than usual.The public does not know who reaped this windfall, but it is in our interest to find out. SoCalGas’ parent company, Sempra Energy, has an energy trading arm that sells gas to the utility. Did SoCalGas’ decision to buy on the spot market at a peak drive up the price and help an affiliated company make a killing?Unfortunately, that remains unclear because spot market transactions in natural gas are shielded from public scrutiny. Comparable electricity transactions, by contrast, were made public after Enron traders took advantage of deregulation to loot California. Now every electricity trade on the spot market is published, deterring such misconduct.The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, has the power to publish natural gas spot market transactions but has never done so. The nonprofit group Public Citizen has petitioned the agency to change that. Southern Californians, who just paid the highest natural gas bills in America, have a right to know who got their hard-earned money.Story continuesNatural gas isn’t the only fuel that Californians found themselves paying dramatically more for in recent months. At one point in October, California gasoline prices rose to $2.60 more per gallon than the U.S. average. The enormous gap powered historic profits for oil refiners, which doubled their profits per gallon in the West last year, according to their own public reports to investors. Gasoline prices that soared past $6 a gallon caused incalculable pain for low-income families, some of whom had to choose between filling their tanks and putting food on the table.How can oil refiners charge Californians so much more at the pump when their production costs, as evidenced by their profits, don’t justify it? California oil refiners set the price they charge station owners for gasoline based not on their costs but on the price of California gasoline on the spot market — a market controlled by the five oil refiners that make 98% of our gasoline, along with a small group of traders.Like the analogous natural gas market, California’s gasoline spot market is shrouded in secrecy, making it vulnerable to manipulation. The California attorney general’s office is suing traders SK Energy and Vitol for allegedly manipulating the spot market after Exxon’s Torrance refinery went down in 2015. The companies are accused, among other things, of making trades in which no gasoline changed hands solely to drive up the price of the fuel.This is possible because no public ledger of trades on the gasoline spot market exists — only voluntary reports to the Oil Price Information Service, an oil industry news service. Nothing requires disclosure of a trade, its quantity or the identity of the buyer or seller. Nor is there a record of how many trades occur in a given day. The service publishes only a spot market price.That means a single trade can set the price of all retail gasoline in the state for days or weeks. When the spot price is high, there is no incentive to report a trade. Robert McCullough, an economist who has studied energy markets for decades, testified before a state Senate committee recently that at the height of the spikes last fall, the spot price for gasoline didn’t change for two weeks. If that had happened with the Dow, he wondered, wouldn’t someone have noticed?California’s Legislature, which is considering how to avoid future spikes in gas prices, should make transactions on the spot market public. Federal regulators, meanwhile, already have the power to impose similar transparency on the natural gas market. Shedding some sunlight on prices could help Californians weather future winters.Jamie Court is the president of the Los Angeles-based nonprofit Consumer Watchdog.This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 82% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).No shareholder likes losing money on their investments, especially institutional investors who saw their holdings drop 6.4% in value last week. However, the 49% one-year return to shareholders may have helped lessen their pain. They should, however, be mindful of further losses in the future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Valero Energy, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Valero Energy ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Valero Energy?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Valero Energy does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Valero Energy's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Valero Energy is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 11% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 9.9% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 7.5% of the company stock.Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 17 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Valero EnergyWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Valero Energy Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$221m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 17% stake in Valero Energy. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Valero Energy better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Valero Energy   you should know about.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

Naturally, it’s always a heart-pounding moment to move into the fire. However, acquiring deflated securities may lead to significant upside – so long as you buy the right ones.But how to go about this process represents the million-dollar question. As with any market endeavor, risks abound. However, to mitigate downside threats, investors may want to consider the below bargain stocks for the “trifecta”: strong value, passive income and upside potential (as adjudicated by Wall Street analysts).Fundamentally, companies trading at a discount to trailing earnings while offering dividends and enjoying support from market professionals should benefit from a higher probability of success. So, without any more delay, here are the bargain stocks to consider.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsVLOValero Energy$132.83QCOMQualcomm$117.19DINOHF Sinclair$49.77BGBunge$95.19SIMOSilicon Motion$65.06EPMEvolution Petroleum$6.52DRDDRDGOLD$6.81Bargain Stocks: Valero Energy (VLO)bargain stocks to buy: stock market tickers with the word ""bargains"" appearing in the center of the boardSource: ShutterstockOne of the top downstream petroleum firms, Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) benefits from natural relevancies. With both geopolitics and soaring inflation contributing to higher profitability potential, VLO represents a cynical recipient of downwind catalysts. To be fair, VLO is a strong performer. Since the beginning of the year, shares gained almost 11%. And in the trailing year, they’re up over 52%.Nevertheless, VLO may swing higher. Financially, the business appears undervalued. For example, the market prices VLO at a trailing multiple of 4.56. As a discount to earnings, Valero ranks better than nearly 69% of the industry. As well, VLO trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 0.31 times. In contrast, the sector median stands at 1.02 times.Story continuesTurning to the passive income component, Valero carries a forward yield of 3.07%. Notably, its payout ratio sits at 25.79%, indicating high confidence of yield sustainability. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg VLO as a consensus strong buy. Further, their average price target stands at $159.71, implying over 20% upside potential. Thus, it’s one of the bargain stocks to buy.Bargain Stocks: Qualcomm (QCOM)the word bargain over a pile of american money to represent cheap stocks, stocks under $20Source: ShutterstockA multinational technology giant, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) creates semiconductors, software and services related to wireless technology. In recent years, Qualcomm has expanded into selling semiconductor products in a predominantly fabless manufacturing model. Still, QCOM is working through some market volatility. In the past 365 days, shares gave up nearly 23% of equity value.At the same time, QCOM gained 13% since the Jan. opener. It’s likely to attract even more attention as one of the bargain stocks to consider. Specifically, the market prices QCOM at a trailing multiple of 11.69. As a discount to earnings, Qualcomm ranks better than 68.3% of the competition. Also, its forward price-earnings ratio is 13 times, in contrast to the sector median value of nearly 21 times.For passive income, QCOM carries a forward yield of 2.48%. Conspicuously, this ranks higher than the tech sector’s average yield of 1.37%. Also, the payout ratio sits at 26.16%. Lastly, covering analysts peg QCOM as a consensus moderate buy. Additionally, their average price target stands at $146.06, implying almost 21% upside potential.Bargain Stocks: HF Sinclair (DINO)Person holding the glowing world in their hands with icons with different types of energy. Energy stocks; energy storageSource: PopTika / ShutterstockA diversified energy company, HF Sinclair (NYSE:DINO) manufactures and sells products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, renewable diesel, specialty lubricant products, specialty chemicals and specialty and modified asphalt, among others. Since the start of the new year, DINO hasn’t exactly performed up to snuff, gaining a little over 1%.However, broader relevancies helped spike DINOI skyward to a 50% profit in the trailing year. Because of this, at first glance, DINO doesn’t seem a natural candidate for bargain stocks. Financially, though, it is. Specifically, the market prices DINO at a forward multiple of 5.89. As a discount to earnings, HF Sinclair ranks better than 62.5% of sector peers.Heading over to the passive income component, the company carries a forward yield of 3.58%. It doesn’t feature a long history of consecutive dividend increases. However, its payout ratio sits at a lowly 25.19%. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg DINO as a consensus moderate buy. In addition, their average price target stands at $61.40, implying 22% upside potential.Bunge (BG)A Photo of a blue sign in an industrial campus showing the Bunge (BG) logo.Source: JHVEPhoto/ShutterStock.comAn agribusiness and food company, Bunge (NYSE:BG) mainly focuses on its international soybean export business. Furthermore, it involves itself in food processing, grain trading and fertilizer production. With so many wild events transpiring across the world, Bunge enjoys significant relevancies (albeit cynically). Still, it hasn’t been a brilliant performer, only gaining 1.3% since the January opener.What may be more surprising to market observers is that BG shed 10% of equity value in the trailing year. However, the red ink may be an opportunity to pick up one of the underrated bargain stocks to buy. Enticing, the market prices BG at a forward multiple of 8.19. As a discount to earnings, Bunge ranks better than 86.84% of the competition. Looking at passive income, Bunge carries a forward yield of 2.58%. Notably, that’s above the consumer staple sector’s average yield of 1.89%. As well, its payout ratio is subterranean at 22.1%.Lastly, Wall Street analysts peg BG as a consensus strong buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $123, implying 27% upside potential.Silicon Motion Technology (SIMO)sale signs stock bargainsSource: Champiofoto / Shutterstock.comAn American-Taiwanese firm, Silicon Motion Technology (NASDAQ:SIMO) focuses on developing NAND flash controller-integrated circuits for solid-state storage devices. With society steadily normalizing, demand may increase for various technological products. However, SIMO gained modestly so far this year, moving up nearly 3%. Over the trailing year, SIMO gave up nearly 7% of market value.Still, investors willing to weather acute geopolitical tensions may want to consider SIMO as one of the bargain stocks. Right now, the market prices SIMO at a forward multiple of 14.7. As a discount to earnings, Silicon Motion ranks better than 72.14% of its peers. As well, SIMO trades at 1.42-times trailing sales. Here, the company ranks better than 70.16% of the industry.Regarding passive income, TipRanks notes that Silicon Motion carries a dividend yield of 3%. Conspicuously, its payout ratio sits at 15.65%, implying strong confidence for dividend sustainability. Looking to the Street, analysts peg SIMO as a consensus strong buy. Also, their average price target stands at $91, implying nearly 38% upside potential.Evolution Petroleum (EPM)In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocksSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Houston, Texas, Evolution Petroleum (NYSEAMERICAN:EPM) is an independent energy company focused on maximizing total returns to its shareholders through the ownership of and investment in onshore oil and natural gas properties in the U.S. Given the pertinent relevancies affecting the hydrocarbon sector, one might think EPM would be killing it in the charts.Unfortunately, EPM is more like getting killed. Since the beginning of this year, shares stumbled 6%. In the past 365 days, EPM declined by over 11%. Nevertheless, it could make up the ranks of bargain stocks to consider. Specifically, the market prices shares at a trailing multiple of 5.25. As a discount to earnings, Evolution ranks better than 65.77% of sector players. Also, it enjoys excellent revenue growth and profit margins.Moving to passive income, Evolution Petroleum features a forward yield of 7.35%. That’s well above the energy sector’s average yield of 4.24%. True, the payout ratio of 49.48% is elevated. However, it’s not that bad at all considering the yield. Finally, Northland Securities’ Donovan Schafer pegs EPM as a buy, placing an $11 price target on shares. If so, this forecast would imply over 68% upside potential.DRDGold (DRD)A pile of shining gold bars.Source: ShutterstockBased in South Africa, DRDGold (NYSE:DRD) is a gold producer. It also specializes in the recovery of the metal from the retreatment of surface tailings. With inflation concerns running high due to a robust labor market, gold may swing higher yet. And that may benefit DRD handsomely. Still, it’s a patient person’s investment, with shares down nearly 10% since the start of the year. In the past 365 days, they’ve lost about 31% of market value.To be sure, labor strikes in South Africa often negatively impact mining operations in the region. However, that might be a temporary issue, possibly making DRD one of the bargain stocks to buy. Additionally, the market prices DRD at a trailing multiple of 8.46. As a discount to earnings, DRDGold ranks better than 62.17% of the competition.Heading over to the passive income component, TipRanks notes that DRDGold features a dividend yield of 3.62%. Plus, its payout ratio sits at a favorably low 33.41%. Lastly, H.C. Wainwright’s Heiko Ihle rates DRD as a buy, anticipating a rise to $15 a share. If so, investors would be looking at upside of almost 115%.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

161,bf4733e3-a61b-3332-8f71-c903c2901b4c,SHW,2023-03-13,Insiders probably made the right decision selling US$1.0m worth of shares earlier this year as The Sherwin-Williams Company's (NYSE:SHW)) stock dips by 4.6%.,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-probably-made-decision-selling-120055605.html,1678708855,STORY,['SHW'],"[By selling US$1.0m worth of The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) stock at an average sell price of US$235 over the last year, insiders seemed to have made the most of their holdings. After the stock price dropped 4.6% last week, the company's market value declined by US$2.4b, but insiders were able to mitigate their losses.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams Sherwin-Williams Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe insider, Bryan Young, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$607k worth of shares at a price of US$221 each. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$214. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.All up, insiders sold more shares in Sherwin-Williams than they bought, over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeI will like Sherwin-Williams better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insiders At Sherwin-Williams Have Sold Stock RecentlyWe've seen more insider selling than insider buying at Sherwin-Williams recently. We note insider Bryan Young cashed in US$607k worth of shares. On the other hand we note Chairman &amp; CEO John Morikis bought US$500k worth of shares , as previously mentioned . The share price has moved a bit recently, but it's hard to argue that the selling is a positive.Story continuesDoes Sherwin-Williams Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that Sherwin-Williams insiders own 0.3% of the company, worth about US$171m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Do The Sherwin-Williams Insider Transactions Indicate?Unfortunately, there has been more insider selling of Sherwin-Williams stock, than buying, in the last three months. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. But it is good to see that Sherwin-Williams is growing earnings. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

(NYSE:UHS) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript February 28, 2023Steve Filton: I'm Steve Filton. Marc Miller is joining us this morning. Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services results for the Fourth Quarter Ended December 31, 2022. During the conference call, we'll be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions.As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $2.43 for the fourth quarter of 2022. After adjusting for the impact of the items reflected on the supplemental schedule, as included with the press release, primarily an asset impairment charge associated with an acute care hospital in Las Vegas, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $3.02 for the quarter ended December 31, 2022.Marc Miller: During the fourth quarter, our acute care hospitals experienced a decrease in the number of patients with a COVID diagnosis treated in our hospitals as compared to the prior year quarter. As a percentage of total admissions, COVID diagnosed patients made up 7% of our admissions in the fourth quarter of 2021, but only about half of that percentage of admissions in the fourth quarter of 2022. This decline in COVID patients resulted in reduced revenues due to the lower acuity and less of the incremental government reimbursement associated with COVID patients. While overall surgical volumes tended to recover to pre-pandemic levels, there was a measurable shift from inpatient to outpatient, resulting in further overall revenue softness.Story continuesMeanwhile, the amount of premium pay in the quarter, which declined from a peak of $153 million in the first quarter was $85 million in the fourth quarter, similar to what it was in the third quarter. In total, there was insufficient revenue growth to offset the accelerated rate of wage increases and other inflationary pressures, leading to an acute EBITDA result in the quarter below our internal forecasts. At the same time, this decline in COVID activity allowed our behavioral hospitals to continue to reduce their labor vacancies, resulting in a reduction of the capping of bed capacity. The effect of the increased revenue largely offset higher labor costs, leading to a behavioral EBITDA result in the quarter more in line with our internal forecasts.racorn/Shutterstock.comSteve Filton: We also note that the fourth quarter included approximately $10 million of losses related to start-up facilities. Our cash generated from operating activities was $297 million during the fourth quarter of 2022 as compared to $322 million during the same quarter in 2021. The decline was largely due to the opening of new facilities and the timing of receipt of certain supplemental reimbursements. We spent $734 million on capital expenditures during 2022. Reaction to the earnings softness experienced during the year, we reduced the pace of our capital expenditure spend by about one quarter from our original plans for the year. Similarly, we moderated the trajectory of our share repurchases. For the full year of 2022, we acquired $811 million of our own shares pursuant to our share repurchase program.Since the inception of the current share repurchase program in 2014, we have repurchased more than 20% of the company's outstanding shares. As of December 31, 2022, we had $886 million of aggregate available borrowing capacity pursuant to our $1.2 billion revolving credit facility.Marc Miller: Our 2023 operating results forecast, which was provided in last night's release, Envision's 2023 as a year of continued transition into a post-pandemic world. We anticipate that volumes in both segments and acuity in our acute business will continue their recovery trajectory and gradually begin to resemble the patterns we experienced before the pandemic. Similarly, we expect to be able to reduce premium pay by about one-third in 2023 from 2022 levels as we continue to increase hiring rates and reduce turnover as a result of multiple recruitment and retention programs that have been implemented over the last few years. Again, we've assumed these improvements will occur incrementally during the year. But will be partially offset by wage pressures created by a continued shortage of nurses and other clinical personnel and by broader inflationary pressures affecting our other expenses.We note that in our Acute segment, physician subsidy expense is specifically anticipated to increase by a substantial amount. Other headwinds that are reflected in our 2023 forecast are approximately $100 million in COVID-related reimbursement received in 2022, but phased out in 2023 as well as a reduction of about $30 million in supplemental reimbursement payments as disclosed in our 10-K. Finally, we will incur a significant increase in interest expense in 2023. About three quarters of which was due to rising interest rates and the remainder to increased borrowings. Despite these challenges, we note that some of the operating indicators in early 2023 have been encouraging, especially in our behavioral health business. During the pandemic, we have found the pace of recovery from several of the aforementioned challenges has often been slower than we originally anticipated and have reflected that gradual cadence of recovery in our forecast.However, we remain confident in the fundamental strength of both our business segments, given our well-positioned hospital franchises around the country. We are pleased to answer questions at this time.Operator: Thank you. Our first call comes from the line of Andrew Mok with UBS.
