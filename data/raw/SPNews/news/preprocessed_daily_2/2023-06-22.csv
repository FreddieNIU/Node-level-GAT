Fundamentally, computer chips undergird the innovations we deploy. Further, as productivity demands increase, chips need to accelerate in capacity to stay ahead of the curve.Moreover, artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT points toward technological advancements as a key reason to attempt to retire rich with semiconductors. As the AI protocol states, semiconductors represent the building blocks of modern electronic devices, powering everything from smartphones to computers to autonomous vehicles. Unless you see these arenas as passing fads, the best chipmakers command enormous long-term relevancies.Also, the best semiconductor stocks benefit from a burgeoning demand profile. Thanks to the proliferation of connected devices, the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and data centers, the need for advanced chips should go up, not down. Therefore, sustained relevance should provide confidence for retirees. Finally, many companies in this space provide a balance between capital returns and passive income. If you’re seeking an accelerated path to your golden years, these may be the ideal semiconductor stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIntel (INTC)Hand with pen marking holographic chart with the word ""AI"". Artificial IntelligenceSource: shutterstock.com/everything possibleTo be sure, tech giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) incurred more than its fair share of setbacks and misfires. Nevertheless, the company seems to have finally found its footing. Since the beginning of this year, INTC gained over 33% of equity value. While it’s still down in the past 365 days, INTC mitigated the red ink, now down only 8%.Moving forward, the market seems encouraged by rumors that Intel is hosting talks with semiconductor firm Arm. Essentially, the tech icon wants to be an anchor investor in Arm’s initial public offering. Notably, in the trailing five sessions, INTC popped up 13%, making it one of the best-performing semiconductor stocks for retirement.Story continuesAlthough bruised by the aforementioned setbacks, Intel still commands relevant intellectual property. As well, the company demonstrated that it still levers design and manufacturing prowess. Earlier this year, management announced the world’s fastest mobile processor. Combined with a modest but still sector-beating forward yield of 1.41%, INTC makes an intriguing case for the best semiconductor stocks to buy.Nvidia (NVDA)Nvidia (NVDA) logo and sign on headquarters. Blurred foreground with green treesSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comAs a leading designer of graphics processing units (GPUs), it’s no surprise that ChatGPT elected Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) as one of the semiconductor stocks for retirement. While GPUs historically provided firepower for advanced games, they increasingly undergird data centers and AI protocols. Given that the AI trajectory only seems to point in a northbound trajectory, NVDA seems a reasonable long-term wager.Currently, though, the main criticism against Nvidia as a vehicle to retire rich with semiconductors is its valuation. Not too long ago, Wall Street maven Cathie Wood trimmed her exposure to NVDA. According to Gurufocus, the market prices NVDA at nearly 224 times trailing earnings. Also, shares trade at a forward multiple of 57.9. No matter how you look at it on paper, it’s steeply overvalued.Still, because of the explosive growth potential of AI and other GPU-intensive markets such as data centers, the paper valuation might not fully account for the long-term total addressable market. Thus, if you don’t mind a little speculation in your retirement portfolio, NVDA could be an intriguing play among high-growth semiconductor stocks.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.Source: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.comSpecializing in the design and development of microprocessors and related technologies for the computer and consumer electronics industries, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) in recent years accelerated from being a poor person’s Intel to a legitimate standalone tech superpower. It also has the goods to back it up. Since the start of the year, AMD almost doubled in market value.Also, in the trailing year, AMD gained almost 43%. Undergirding recent positive sentiment is its latest semiconductor and data center products optimized for AI, according to Investor’s Business Daily. At a company event earlier this week, AMD showcased its latest Epyc server processors and a new AI accelerator chip series. Combined with a broader interest in AI-related investments, AMD managed to gain nearly 8% in the last five sessions.To be fair, Advanced Micro doesn’t make a traditional case for semiconductor stocks for retirement. However, it’s a relevant growth machine that can enliven your portfolio. Per Gurufocus, AMD’s three-year revenue growth rate (on a per-share basis) clocks in at 35.7%. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period impresses at 76%.Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM)In Ultra Modern Electronic Manufacturing Factory Design Engineer in Sterile Coverall Holds Microchip with Gloves and Examines it.Source: ShutterstockWith its namesake country under geopolitical crosshairs, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) may seem unusually risky for semiconductor stocks for retirement. However, the sheer relevance of TSM might win over hesitant market participants. Per ChatGPT, Taiwan Semiconductor is the world’s largest dedicated independent semiconductor foundry, offering manufacturing services for a wide range of customers.Just like many other high-growth semiconductor stocks, TSM delivered the goods recently. In the trailing month, shares returned over 25% of market value. So far this year, the security gained slightly over 45%. Notably, Cathie Wood – while trimming her Nvidia exposure – recently initiated a position in TSM.Financially, TSM ranks among the best semiconductor stocks to buy for top-line expansion. Per Gurufocus, Taiwan Semi’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 28.4%, above 82.72% of its peers. Also, its EBITDA growth rate comes in at 32.8% during the same period, above 64.67%. Finally, the company features a forward yield of 1.82%.Texas Instruments (TXN)semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Dallas, Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) ranks among the more compelling ideas for semiconductor stocks for retirement. Per ChatGPT, Texas Instruments is known for its analog and embedded processing chips, which find applications in various industries such as automotive, industrial, and communications. Since the start of this year, TXN gained almost 9% of its equity value.Unlike the other chip manufacturing ideas, TXN rides a slow news cycle. A few days ago, the company announced plans to expand its manufacturing base in Malaysia. The deal would involve two new assembly and test factories. Still, for those seeking to retire rich with semiconductors, TXN may offer a discounted opportunity.According to Gurufocus, TXN appears undervalued relative to discounted cash flow. Based on its analysis, the fair value for TXN should be $288.05. However, at the time of writing, shares trade hands at just over $177. On the passive income side, Texas Instruments offers a forward yield of 2.8%. That’s noticeably above the tech sector’s average yield of 1.37%, making it a top choice for semiconductor stocks for retirement.Broadcom (AVGO)a close up image of a semiconductorSource: ShutterstockIf you’re a believer that strength begets more strength, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) might be an enticing idea for high-growth semiconductor stocks. In the trailing five sessions, AVGO jumped over 11%. Over the past 30 days, shares rocketed higher by almost 39%. For the year so far, Broadcom investors have enjoyed a return of slightly over 60%.Providing a range of semiconductor and infrastructures software solutions, Broadcom surged on a report that its proposed merger with VMware (NYSE:VMW) received conditional approval from the European Commission. If the rumor is confirmed, it would close what has been a long investigative process. Financially, Broadcom offers a bit of a mixed bag. However, its greatest strength lies in its profitability. In particular, its trailing-year net margin clocks in at 39.06%, beating out 97.23% of the competition. Also, its return on equity (ROE) impresses at a robust 62.26%.Notably, the company also carries a forward yield of 2.08%. As well, its payout ratio sits at 40.56%, providing confidence regarding sustainability. Overall, AVGO makes a strong case for semiconductor stocks for retirement.Applied Materials (AMAT)Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.Source: ShutterstockA leader in materials engineering and equipment for the semiconductor industry, Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) enables the production of advanced chips. Thanks to its wide-ranging relevancies, investors have jumped aboard the AMAT train with vigor. Since the start of this year, shares have soared to the tune of nearly 46%. Over the course of the past one-year period, AMT gained just under 45%, making it an enticing play for semiconductor stocks for retirement.Fundamentally, unless you envision a world where advanced protocols like AI fall by the wayside, you’re going to want to give Applied Materials extra attention. For example, the burgeoning field of generative AI will require expensive new chips. Therefore, if you missed the ride on other high-flying tech names, you could get onboard AMAT.Financially, the company benefits from a three-year revenue growth rate of 23.9%, which beats out 76.15% of sector players. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period comes in at an impressive 32.1%. Notably, its trailing-year net margin pings at 24.36%, ahead of 89.15% of rivals. Finally, the market prices AMAT at a forward multiple of 19.12. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than 66.17% of the field, making it an enticing pick for the best semiconductor stocks to buy.INTCIntel$35.82NVDANvidia$426.53AMDAdvanced Micro Devices$124.24TSMTaiwan Semiconductor$105.18TXNTexas Instruments$178.09AVGOBroadcom$883.43AMATApplied Materials$140.11On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

ARE, through its affiliates, recently disposed of five non-core, non-mega campus properties in Greater Boston to affiliates of TPG Real Estate Partners. The move aligns with the company’s capital recycling strategy.The sale of the portfolio, encompassing 428,663 rentable square feet (RSF), was carried out for $365 million or an average sales price of $852 per RSF. Based on ARE’s net operating income (NOI) for second-quarter 2023, the weighted average capitalization rate was 5.2%, inclusive of vacancy available for redevelopment. The transaction yielded a gain on sale of $187.2 million and a value-creation margin of 80%, making the latest move a strategic fit for Alexandria.The portfolio comprised two of ARE’s first life science developments in the Cambridge cluster, 780 and 790 Memorial Drive, which it acquired in 2001 and delivered in 2002. It also included 225 Second Avenue, and 266 and 275 Second Avenue, all in Waltham.Alexandria intends to reinvest the proceeds from the disposition into its highly leased value-creation pipeline to capitalize on the secular trends of the life science industry. This consists of large-scale research and development centers for top life science companies, including Eli Lilly LLY, Bristol Myers Squibb and Moderna.  Additionally, for 2023, Alexandria aims at dispositions and sales of partial interests of $1.525 billion (at the midpoint of its guidance range of $1.425–$1.625 billion). So far, inclusive of this latest transaction, it has completed or has signed letters of intent or purchase and sale agreements for pending transactions totaling $884 million, achieving 58% of its 2023 capital plan.In May 2023, the company concluded the sale of 11119 North Torrey Pines Road, a fully leased 72,506 RSF single-tenant property, in its San Diego cluster to DivcoWest for $86 million. Based on ARE’s annualized NOI for first-quarter 2023, the capitalization rate was 4.6%, yielding significant realized value for the company.Further, in April 2023, ARE transferred a partial interest in 15 Necco Street, a 345,995 RSF Class A property presently under construction, to a U.S. affiliate of Mori Trust Co., Ltd. The proceeds from the transaction were used to fund the development of the property located in the Seaport Innovation District submarket of Greater Boston. The delivery is anticipated to take place in late 2023.Eli Lilly, one of Alexandria’s longtime tenants, had chosen this state-of-the-art facility for its Lilly Institute for Genetic Medicine. The institute will leverage promising RNA- and DNA-based technologies to develop therapies with the potential to treat or prevent diseases in a way that is either challenging or not possible with traditional medicines.Alexandria’s Class A properties are situated in North America's AAA innovation cluster locations, with significant market presence in Greater Boston, San Francisco Bay Area, New York City, San Diego, Seattle, Maryland and Research Triangle. The advantageous locations of its properties have been driving demand, resulting in high occupancy levels.Also, ARE’s focus on acquiring, developing and redeveloping new Class A properties in AAA locations bodes well for growth. As of Mar 31, 2023, its current and near-term value-creation projects totaled 6.7 million RSF and were 72% leased, which is encouraging.The company expects to capture more than $610 million of annual incremental net operating income from the second quarter of 2023 through the first quarter of 2026 with these projects.With a solid balance-sheet position and ample financial flexibility, ARE is well-positioned to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 2.6% in the past three months against its industry’s growth of 3.2%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Ventas VTR and Host Hotels &amp; Resorts HST.

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.One company to watch right now is Unum Group (UNM). UNM is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), as well as an A grade for Value. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 5.96, while its industry has an average P/E of 10.22. Over the past year, UNM's Forward P/E has been as high as 7.46 and as low as 5.47, with a median of 6.37.We also note that UNM holds a PEG ratio of 0.71. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. UNM's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 1.82. Within the past year, UNM's PEG has been as high as 1.03 and as low as 0.42, with a median of 0.54.Investors should also recognize that UNM has a P/B ratio of 0.97. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. UNM's current P/B looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/B of 1.71. UNM's P/B has been as high as 1.06 and as low as 0.62, with a median of 0.89, over the past year.Story continuesValue investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. UNM has a P/S ratio of 0.75. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.24.Finally, investors should note that UNM has a P/CF ratio of 5.55. This figure highlights a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook. UNM's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 6.94. Over the past 52 weeks, UNM's P/CF has been as high as 6.40 and as low as 4.71, with a median of 5.58.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that Unum Group is likely undervalued currently. And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook, UNM sticks out at as one of the market's strongest value stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

10,18c8ac80-1dc9-3ec7-91ab-797649e2340e,CF,2023-06-22,7 Undervalued S&P 500 Stocks to Buy in June,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-undervalued-p-500-stocks-013550055.html,1686879350,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'VLO', 'BIIB', 'SNA', 'MPC', 'CF', 'GD', 'ADM']","[When attempting to build a portfolio of reliable entities, you probably can’t go wrong with undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks. Featuring the market performance of 500 of the largest companies listed on stock exchanges in the U.S., you’re dealing with proven winners. To be fair, you might not receive a blistering performance. At the same time, these ideas are less likely to leave you stranded on the road.In addition, ChatGPT points out that the best S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy offer diversification. Specifically, by acquiring undervalued securities within the index, investors can potentially benefit from the performance of a diverse range of companies and industries, mitigating risks associated with individual stocks or sectors.As well, the artificial intelligence-powered chatbot mentions the potential for reversion to fair value as a benefit for cheap S&amp;P 500 stocks. Basically, enterprises that are undervalued now may carry the potential to their fair value over time. As market inefficiencies correct themselves, undervalued stocks can experience price appreciation as the market recognizes their true worth. So, if you’re ready to start winning consistently, these may be the best S&amp;P 500 stocks for June.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsADMArcher Daniels Midland$74.56CFCF Industries$70.08BIIBBiogen$297.83SNASnap-On$274.27MPCMarathon Petroleum$113.83VLOValero Energy$114.03GDGeneral Dynamics4214.96Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comAn American multinational food processing and commodities trading corporation, Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) makes an excellent case for undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy. Fundamentally, no matter how advanced we become as a civilization, certain things will never change. Of course, the most critical is our need for nutritional sustenance. Thus, long-term investors may treat ADM’s loss of over 18% this year as irrationality.Story continuesNo matter, when the market is giving you one of the best S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy at a discount, you take it. Over the trailing one-year period, ADM slipped over 11%, which seems like overkill given the underlying relevance. More importantly, the market prices ADM at a forward multiple of only 10.55. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than 81.7% of the competition.It’s no slouch on the operational metrics either. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 16.4% (on a per-share basis), above 76.8% of its peers. Also, its Piotroski F-Score comes in at 7 out of 9, indicating solid operational efficiency. Thus, it’s easily one of the S&amp;P 500 stocks for June.CF Industries (CF)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Headquartered in Deerfield, Illinois, CF Industries (NYSE:CF) is an American manufacturer and distributor of agricultural fertilizers, including ammonia, urea, and ammonium nitrate products. Given the geopolitical flashpoint in Eastern Europe and implications for the global food supply chain, agricultural entities such as CF command extraordinary relevance. However, exposure to geopolitics has many investors worried, with CF shedding over 17% since the Jan. opener.Nevertheless, those with a patient view might consider the agro firm as one of the undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks. True, the present circumstances don’t seem enticing at all. Plus, in the past 365 days, CF stock gave up more than 26% of market value. Still, at some point, circumstances will eventually normalize. Plus, the red ink presents much food for thought.Mainly, the market now prices CF at a trailing multiple of 4.53. As a discount to earnings, CF ranks better than 90.61% of its peers. Also, shares now trade at a price-earnings-growth ratio of 0.12. In contrast, the sector median value stands at a loftier 0.72 times. Therefore, it’s worth consideration as one of the cheap S&amp;P 500 stocks.Biogen (BIIB)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comBased in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) is a multinational biotechnology firm specializing in the discovery, development, and delivery of therapies for the treatment of neurological diseases to patients worldwide. Thanks to its permanently relevant business, BIIB ranks among the best S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy. Since the Jan. opener, shares popped just over 10%.Despite its performance in the charts, however, BIIB also ranks among the undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks. At the moment, the market prices shares at a trailing multiple of 13.93. As a discount to earnings, Biogen ranks better than 72.7% of companies listed in the drug manufacturing industry. Also, BIIB trades at 0.95 times the projected free cash flow. In contrast, the underlying sector median value is 1.58 times.Just as well, the company benefits from excellent profitability metrics. For example, its trailing-year net margin clocks in at 31%, outflanking 95.87% of its rivals. With a Piotroski F-Score of 7 out of 9, Biogen delivers an operationally efficient business. Thus, it’s a solid candidate for S&amp;P 500 stocks with upside.Snap-on (SNA)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Best Speculative StocksSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comHailing from Kenosha, Wisconsin, Snap-on (NYSE:SNA) is an American designer, manufacturer, and marketer of high-end tools and equipment for professional use in the transportation industry. This includes solutions for automotive, heavy-duty, equipment, marine, aviation, and railroad industries. To be fair, SNA is one of the boring entities among undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks. Still, that shouldn’t be confused with underperforming.Since the beginning of this year, SNA gained over 18% of its equity value. In the trailing one-year period, it popped up over 33%. Thanks to its everyday relevance, Snap-on offers resilience and predictability for its stakeholders. Despite the robust gains, however, SNA offers a discount for those seeking S&amp;P 500 stocks for June.Notably, the market prices SNA at a forward multiple of 15.86. As a discount to projected earnings, Snap-on ranks better than 62.4% of companies listed in the industrial products sector. Also, SNA trades at 0.8 times discounted cash flow, ranking better than 60.2% of the competition.Marathon Petroleum (MPC)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Findlay, Ohio, Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) is a petroleum refining, marketing, and transportation firm. Mostly specializing in the downstream and midstream components of the hydrocarbon energy value chain, MPC could benefit from rising relevancies. As society continues to normalize, traffic volume should rise. On paper, this framework should benefit MPC.So far, though, the market doesn’t really seem to appreciate this thesis. Since the Jan. opener, MPC gained less than 1%. Nevertheless, this lack of mobility in the charts might make MPC one of the undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks. Significantly, the market prices Marathon shares at a forward multiple of 6.08. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than nearly 63% of its oil and gas peers.Also, MPC trades at 0.32 times sales. In contrast, the sector median stands at 0.91 times. That’s noteworthy because Marathon’s three-year revenue growth rate clocks in at 27.1%, above 80.28% of its rivals. As well, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period pings at 60.9%. Thus, it’s a great idea for cheap S&amp;P 500 stocks with upside potential.Valero Energy (VLO)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comA downstream petroleum specialist, Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) mostly focuses on manufacturing and marketing transportation fuels. As well, it produces other petrochemical products and power. As with Marathon Petroleum above, Valero should benefit from rising social normalization trends. However, the market has a dim view of VLO, with shares fading nearly 7%. Over the trailing one-year period, it’s down almost 13%.Still, the red ink might make Valero one of the compelling undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy. On the valuation front, the market prices VLO at a forward multiple of 5.26. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than 71.08% of its oil and gas compatriots. Also, shares trade at 0.25 times sales. In contrast, the sector median again stands at 0.91 times.Nevertheless, Valero performs very well on the operational side. Its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 19.4%, above nearly 70% of its peers. Also, its Piotroski F-Score lands at a perfect 9 out of 9, indicating superior operational efficiency. Combined with an Altman Z-Score of 5.77 (indicating low bankruptcy risk), VLO makes a strong case for the best S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy.General Dynamics (GD)image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocksSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.comAlthough a bit on the controversial side for some investors for its aerospace and defense business, General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) technically meets the qualifications for undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks. Despite its relevant business profile – and gaining relevance, unfortunately – the market doesn’t believe in GD stock. Since the start of the year, shares tumbled nearly 15%. Over the past 365 days, GD is almost 3% below parity.Nevertheless, rising instability in the geopolitical realm could see demand for General Dynamics rise. In the meantime, the market prices GD at a forward multiple of 16.82. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than 66.67% of enterprises in the aerospace and defense industry. Also, GD trades hands at 14.43 times operating cash flow. In contrast, the sector median stat is 18.89 times.Aside from its value proposition, General Dynamics enjoys strong profitability metrics. Its trailing-year net margin clocks in at 8.5%, above 70.76% of its peers. Also, it’s worth mentioning that its Piotroski F-Score lands at 7 out of 9, indicating decent operational efficiency. Overall, then, it makes a solid case for S&amp;P 500 stocks for June.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

17,8ef845de-32d6-3cc0-81c2-40200b97bc48,WMT,2023-06-22,Amazon may 'surpass' Walmart as largest U.S. retailer: JPMorgan analyst,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/amazon-may-surpass-walmart-largest-214919442.html,1687384159,VIDEO,"['WMT', 'AMZN']","[Digital giant Amazon may over take Walmart to become the largest retailer in the United States, according to a JPMorgan analyst. Yahoo Finance tech reporter Allie Garfinkle breaks down the analyst's case.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]RACHELLE AKUFFO: According to analysts from JPMorgan, Amazon could finally edge out Walmart as the top US retailer. The company benefited during the pandemic. And analysts say the online space is dominated by Gen merch, and Amazon Prime is a powerful market share tool. We're joined now by Yahoo Finance's Allie Garfinkle to discuss this more. Hey, Allie.ALLIE GARFINKLE: Hi, Rachelle. The message here is this from JPMorgan, Amazon's long-term e-commerce. Growth is intact. And that's despite a rocky few years, right? Legendarily, it's been a really up and down time in e-commerce. We've seen we saw that pandemic boom and then a pullback in 2022.A stat for you. 2022 marked the first year since 2009 that US e-commerce grew under 10%. And now, JPMorgan is actually expecting to see 2023 show some growth, especially from Amazon. For 2023, JPMorgan is modeling Amazon's US gross merchandise volume, growing more than 11% to 477 billion. That's also while they have more than 42% of the US e-commerce market in terms of market share.Now, if this does come to pass, Amazon will beat out Walmart as the country's largest retailer and what would be, frankly a momentous shake up for both companies. It would mark a new chapter. And, of course, Amazon getting ahead here does not mean the fight is over by all means. If anything, what I'd say is that it will cause-- it will cause there to be a heat up in the battle between Amazon and Walmart moving forward.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Something does put them in the spotlight. And Amazon does seem to already be in a tight spot at the moment. Senator Bernie Sanders announced that he's starting an investigation into Amazon for their safety practices. What can you tell us about that?Story continuesALLIE GARFINKLE: Yeah, Rachelle, this isn't the first time that Bernie Sanders has really made a move on Amazon asking them to improve their labor practices. And I suspect it won't be the last. I was doing some texting around yesterday with some analysts on Wall Street. And none of them for the time being are expecting the Sanders probe to have any material effect on Amazon's bottom line.However, what this does bespeak is kind of a larger trend, the worse that we're seeing in terms of increased federal scrutiny both on big tech and on Amazon, especially. Let's look at today, right? Today, the FTC sued Amazon alleging it's tricking customers into signing up for Prime and making it more difficult to cancel.What the FTC and Chair Lina Khan are saying is that this is a violation of the FTC Act and the Restore Online Shoppers Confidence Act. And this has been a long time coming. This is an investigation the FTC has had going into Amazon Prime for about two years. So federal entities, right, the federal entity is investigating Amazon, ultimately are piling up here.And the thing I keep thinking is, you know, if everyone's trying to land a punch on Amazon, someone's going to get a blow. The question is just how substantial that blow will really be, RachelleRACHELLE AKUFFO: Indeed. We'll be keeping track of that. Thank you for getting us up to speed. Our very own, Allie Garfinkle. Thanks so much.]"

You can buy things online with them too. In an interview with Yahoo Finance from the 2023 Cannes Lions International festival, Walmart Chief Marketing Officer William White says the retail giant, from a broad marketing perspective, is doing a bit of a ""reframe...to help people think about us digitally first.""Video Transcript[MUSIC PLAYING]BRIAN SOZZI: Joining us now is Walmart Chief Marketing Officer William White. William, good to see you in person here. Thanks for joining us. Lots of key trends being talked about this event from-- anywhere from the state of the advertising industry going into the back half of the year. Economy is a little slow, artificial intelligence. What have been some of your top takeaways?WILLIAM WHITE: Well, I think personalization is something that's been increasingly important for marketers for quite some time and, I think, is continuing to ramp up. The expectation from a customer that things are bespoke for them is continuing to rise. And AI certainly helps fuel some of that. And I think that's something that we'll continue to see for some time and certainly part of the conversations that we're having this week.BRIAN SOZZI: There's been some I'll call it chatter that Walmart in the second half of this year will really ramp up its rollbacks or its price cuts. And that's to me-- having covered Walmart for a while, that's what it does best. That is when it is out there grabbing market share. How do you plan to market an event like that or a series of events like that?WILLIAM WHITE: Well, low price is something that's been consistent with our brand for-- you know, since the beginning. And I don't think about it in terms of-- you know, cyclical times. I think about it as that's the thing that we need to-- that's something that we stand on.We do a great job of running a low-cost business so that we can pass those savings on to our customers. We'll continue to do that. And I think from a marketing standpoint, we want to be loud and proud about that. But we also want to be, as I said, loud and proud about the broad basket, about the experience. And I think the things that we're doing to make shopping both easier and more inspirational for our customers is just as important.Story continuesBRAD SMITH: What's been interesting to hear from some of the chief marketing officers is how they're generating demand during a downturn in some of the more discretionary aisles that a Walmart even has. As powerful a brand as you are, what does it take to get consumers back into some of those other aisles?WILLIAM WHITE: You know, I think it is about-- one, it starts with having a great assortment. Period. And I think creating an environment where people can see that and be inspired by it.We're very focused on shortening that distance between inspiration and purchase, and so particularly in the digital and social space. How we not just inspire someone but make it so seamless in that moment to drive to transaction has been capability that we've been building for the last couple of years and something that we're focused on for the balance of this year and for the future.BRIAN SOZZI: There's been a lot of attention on marketing campaigns gone awry. I think about your competitor target, even though I would argue that wasn't a marketing campaign. That was more of a merchandising issue. Bud Light, of course, too. Where do you stand on this? Do you see Walmart taking stands like these companies? And then, you know, how do you capitalize on their shortfalls?WILLIAM WHITE: 90% of Americans shop at Walmart. 90% of America lives within 10 miles of a Walmart. We have over 200 million people coming to our site each week. For us, we are focused on that breadth of our customer base standing for and being meaningful and relevant to all of our customers. And that's what we're focused on, quite honestly-- how we serve them-- and show up in ways that are meaningful and authentic to them. That-- that's really where we put our focus.BRIAN SOZZI: Are you still putting a lot of marketing dollars to work on social media? The messages, the content on these platforms continues to be polarizing, to pull it-- put it mildly.WILLIAM WHITE: We're not looking to go in any extremes. We're looking to, as I said, to be relevant to our customers and show up in the places and spaces where they're spending their time in a way that inspires them to shop with us and to feel emotionally connected to our brand. And that's the thing-- that's where we put our focus.BRAD SMITH: It's been amazing to see how much focus has also been placed on the digital side for Walmart and really ramping up that investment.WILLIAM WHITE: Absolutely.BRAD SMITH: In terms of that touch point for consumers, what can consumers look forward to next? And how does that--WILLIAM WHITE: Yeah.BRAD SMITH: --start from the marketing efforts that the company puts forward--WILLIAM WHITE: You know--BRAD SMITH: --and all the way through--WILLIAM WHITE: Yeah, so we spend, obviously, within marketing across all aspects of the business. We spent a lot of time with our customers and listening to them and understanding them. And I find it so interesting. If you talk to any customer, usually, the first thing they mention is their store.And that's incredible. That's an amazing asset for us. We're in 4,700 communities across the country. But we are trying to think of them. We're trying to have them think of us beyond their store and think about, you know, we're right there in that pocket.And so many of the efforts that we're driving from a marketing standpoint are that first app to tap. And there's a little-- from a broad marketing perspective, there's a little bit of a reframe, if you will, to help people think about us digitally first. I would just point to campaign we have in market right now, Welcome to Your Walmart, where all of the digital semiotics, if you will, are digital based and are focused on, you know, the look of our app, how things show up and look in the app.And so that's just part of a reframe, if you will, to, I think, connote the digital environment for folks. But we're also really cognizant about how do we drive transactions in the moment digitally and through social commerce. And so for us, social commerce has been a capability that we've been building.We've launched a new platform called Walmart Creator pretty recently, which is a creator platform that is a one-stop shop, if you will, for the creators out there to find access to product to be able to post across all social platforms with one click, giving them the digital tools to understand the analytics of how they're performing as they're monetizing shoppable products.And so I think how we bring creators on board, how we leverage the Walmart brand in the moment for our customers such that they can have a very seamless experience within the feeds that they're-- where they're spending their time to drive a transaction is critical for us. And I'm proud of the work that we've done in that space. And we'll continue to ramp that in a big way.BRIAN SOZZI: All right, we'll leave it there. William White, chief marketing officer at Walmart. Enjoy the sunny weather and beach.WILLIAM WHITE: Thanks so much, guys.BRAD SMITH: We'll talk to you soon.WILLIAM WHITE: Awesome.- And thanks to Brad and Brian and Ken there with Walmart CMO William White.]"

This includes a pledge of 20 million pounds ($25.42 million) to boost access to the World Bank's Multilateral Investment Guarantees Agency, which provides political risk insurance for projects.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU would provide Ukraine with 50 billion euros for 2024-27, while U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken offered $1.3 billion in additional aid.German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said Berlin was offering an additional 381 million euros in humanitarian assistance in 2023.But Zelenskiy, speaking via video link, said Ukraine needed more targeted help in ""real projects"" that would spur growth in an economy he said had moved far away from the oligarchic model of Ukraine's immediate post-Soviet era.Ukraine is seeking up to $40 billion to fund the first part of a ""Green Marshall Plan"" to rebuild its economy, including developing a coal-free steel industry, a senior Ukrainian official said before the conference.The total bill will be huge, with Ukraine, the World Bank, the European Commission and the United Nations estimating in March that the cost was at $411 billion for the first year of the war. It could easily reach more than $1 trillion.Western officials hope the conference will encourage the private sector to harness its resources to help speed Ukraine's reconstruction by investing in small and medium-scale projects. Sunak said more than 400 companies from 38 countries had signed up to the Ukraine Business Compact, a statement of support for Ukraine's recovery.European Investment Bank President Werner Hoyer said he got the feeling while listening to the conference speeches that ""not everyone has realised that speed is of the essence"".

Africa coal plant for clean energy needs millions in loans; experts say that's a problem,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shifting-africa-coal-plant-clean-060829566.html,1687414109,STORY,['CL=F'],"[MIDDELBURG, South Africa (AP) — Plumes of heat-trapping pollutants last billowed from the giant stacks of Komati Power Station in October, when the coal-fired plant that fed South Africa’s hungry electrical grid for more than half a century was shut down to make way for a solar, wind and battery storage plant.Converting Komati to be part of the clean energy revolution is seen as an important test case for coal-reliant South Africa, the world's 16th-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and developing nations elsewhere. It's supported by $497 million, most of it from the World Bank.The problem, energy experts say, is that almost all that money is in the form of loans that can be difficult for developing nations to repay. And that risks hobbling the global effort to cut emissions and limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels to stave off the worst effects of climate change.For South Africa, which needs an estimated $38 billion over the next five years to meet its climate goals, the structure of the Komati funding should be concerning, said Andrew Lawrence, an analyst and senior researcher at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.Not only is most of the money in loans, but the loans are dollar-denominated. South Africa's rand will depreciate against the dollar, “so that is going to become an increasingly snowballing financial burden,” Lawrence said.As world leaders open a two-day global finance summit Thursday in Paris, a central question will be: How can they get the developing world the finances they need to move away from fossil fuels while also growing their economies?“We can’t in the developing world say, look, you got rich by polluting, we’re going to wait till we get rich and then we’re going to start doing what you’re doing now,” said Avinash Persaud, special envoy to Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley on climate finance. “We could say that, but that isn’t the solution for the planet. What we need to do is finance the transition so it can be scaled up and done faster than it would otherwise get done.”Story continuesPersaud was one of the architects of the Bridgetown Initiative, first put forward by Mottley at last year's United Nations climate summit in Egypt and now expected to be a cornerstone of the Paris summit. The initiative, named for the Barbados capital, would overhaul the way development lending works to aid developing nations struggling under rising debt from climate damage.It calls for loan clauses that allow for suspending payments when a country is hit by a natural disaster or pandemic, thus freeing up millions of dollars that could be spent on relief and rebuilding. Barbados has been a pioneer in such clauses, last year issuing its first sovereign bond with such a provision.The plan offers several ideas for lowering borrowing costs for developing countries, including offering loans to climate-vulnerable countries at below-market rates. Another would have the World Bank and other multilateral development banks offer currency risk guarantees so investors aren't worried about currency fluctuations.Loans made in local currency can help protect recipient countries if their currencies depreciate against major global currencies, said David Uzsoki, who offers research and advice on sustainable finance to investors and government officials via the International Institute for Sustainable Development. But international lenders needed to back large projects are generally not willing to take on that risk, he said.Riya Saxena of the New Delhi-based clean energy non-profit group RMI India said that makes it all the more important to come up with innovative financial structures that guard international investors from currency risks.A panel of scientists convened by the United Nations estimated that $2.4 trillion is needed each year by 2035 if the world is to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Much of that need is in developing countries, who account for nearly 80% of the world’s population and whose leaders have made repeated promises to bring their people out of poverty.Growing economies and improving living conditions have a cost, though, especially when the growth is fueled by fossil fuels. While 79% of greenhouse gases emitted in the last 170 years are from rich countries, developing countries have contributed up to 63% of annual emissions in recent years, according to an analysis by the Center for Global Development.And pressure to continue using fossil fuels can be intense. South Africa, which gets 80% of its electricity from coal, is dealing with a power shortfall that has led to rolling nationwide blackouts that have damaged the economy. With national elections looming next year, President Cyril Ramaphosa this spring said South Africa might delay decommissioning some coal plants to ease the blackouts.Suranjali Tandon, an associate professor at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, a research institute under India's Ministry of Finance, was dubious about the “massive shift"" in global finance that the Bridgetown Initiative would require. She suggested changes might be easier at a regional level — for example, dedicating tax revenues from fossil fuel users in a region to climate finance needs in that region.Other climate experts fear the World Bank and other development banks just don’t have the money to support the clean energy transition in the developing world.But Franklin Steves, of the environmental think tank E3G, said he saw momentum for the Bridgetown Initiative and felt some optimism for Paris.“There are some really good proposals on the table, and I hope the Paris summit should be kicking off processes around all of these,” he said.Back in Komati, about 2 hours northeast of Johannesburg, the former coal plant looked deserted this week, with only security guards and cleaners on site and large parking lots sitting empty. In a community where everyone depended on coal jobs to make ends meet, groups of men could be seen on most corners, hoping to be picked up by contractors in trucks for temporary jobs as gardeners or cleaners in nearby settlements.Work on repurposing the plant is expected to take up to five years. Some of the World Bank money is to go toward retraining former plant employees; this week, power utility Eskom invited bids for a plan to mitigate the effect of the plant's closure on surrounding communities.___Arasu reported from Bengaluru, India.___Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down $3.02, or 4.2%, at $69.51.The benchmarks erased gains from the previous session, during which U.S. corn and soybean prices raced to multi-month highs, raising expectations that crop shortfalls could lower biofuels blending and increase oil demand.The Bank of England raised interest rates by a bigger-than-expected half a percentage point to fight stubborn inflation.

Gasoline futures inched lower after the reading.The API data usually heralds a similar trend in official Energy Information Administration (EIA) data due later on Thursday. Both readings were delayed this week on account of the Juneteenth holiday.The EIA reading is expected to show a build of about 1.9 million barrels in the past week, after a bumper 7.9 million barrel build through the week to June 9.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230621744797/en/(Photo: MORGAN STANLEY)Data shows that 81% of private company decision makers are being influenced by the economy in executing liquidity events in their industries. However, with private companies choosing to stay private longer (37% now plan to stay private, while 34% are unsure or questioning next steps), the traditional liquidity path of going public is becoming more elusive. At the same time, there is heightened demand for liquidity to support talent attraction and retention efforts. These simultaneous pressures have pushed innovative liquidity solutions to the forefront as a business strategy to help private companies balance long-term goals with rewarding employees.Specific takeaways from the report include:Increased demand for private market liquidity events is coming from all sides: Almost two thirds (59%) of private company decision-makers reported increased expectations for a liquidity event from investors, C-suite executives, and equity-holding employees. Additionally, nearly all (93%) said having a liquidity event is valuable to a prospect’s decision when considering a job offer.Staying private longer creates opportunities for resilience and growth. By delaying IPOs, private companies maintain greater control amid market challenges while also nudging private capital markets to adapt for more tender offers and direct secondary sales—a trend that’s on track to continue. For example: From 2012 to 2021, global investments in direct secondaries across the venture market increased from $13 billion to $60 billion and are projected to reach $85 billion in 2023.Private market liquidity events must address myriad goals. Private companies reported the top reasons they leverage their equity plans are to validate employee performance (85%), align business/employee goals (84%), and other fiscal business-related objectives—indicating that private liquidity events must continue to evolve to help meet complex business needs beyond simply building personal wealth.Story continues""Amid market uncertainty, this report underscores the message that liquidity events and innovative equity programs are imperative to stakeholders across the private markets, from initial founders and venture capitalists to entry-level employees and private investors,"" said Jeremy Wright, Head of Private Markets at Morgan Stanley at Work. ""Unlocking the potential of liquidity opportunities has become a business essential—both for the organizations and the individuals who make private capital markets tick. Clear-sighted solutions that balance possible future states against current challenges can deliver value and protect long-term vision during volatile times.""The full findings of Morgan Stanley at Work’s Liquidity Trends: Perspectives from Private Company Leaders can be found here.Methodology: The report was researched and authored by Rebel, a third-party research and strategy agency. The findings are based on a survey of 311 U.S.-based private company decision-makers. Participation was limited to private companies that currently offer an equity plan. In addition, qualifying companies had to meet at least one of the following criteria: a valuation of $400 million or more, completion of a fundraising round of a Series B or higher, or greater than 200 employees. All respondents reported that their job responsibilities included selecting the equity management platform or managing their company’s cap table and equity plan.

The contract was scheduled to end in 2030. Potomac Edison's Maryland customers currently pay a Cogeneration PURPA Project Surcharge on their electric bill based on the price at which Potomac Edison can resell the power it purchased from Warrior Run. The surcharge amount has varied greatly year-to-year due to fluctuations in the competitive market.""Potomac Edison is committed to helping customers save money and stabilize their electric bills, and this agreement is a step toward keeping bills affordable and more predictable for our customers,"" said Linda Moss, president of FirstEnergy's Maryland operations.Customers will continue to see the PURPA surcharge on their bills through the term of the buyout in accordance with the Maryland PSC's order. However, through the buyout period, Potomac Edison customers are forecast to save a substantial amount of money. Also, this agreement will help to stabilize their bills by eliminating charges that are based on a volatile market. An early end to the Warrior Run contract has an estimated 90% probability of saving customers money over the remaining term of the agreement.Potomac Edison serves about 285,000 customers in all or parts of Allegany, Carroll, Frederick, Garrett, Howard, Montgomery, and Washington counties.

Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.Another factor that can influence investors is FOMO, or the fear of missing out, especially with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Salesforce.com (CRM) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to CRM for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Salesforce.com's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Salesforce.com's main business drivers.Headquartered in San Francisco, Salesforce, Inc., founded in 1999, is the leading provider of on-demand Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software, which enables organizations to better manage critical operations, such as sales force automation, customer service and support, marketing automation, document management, analytics and custom application development.Salesforce is currently the largest CRM vendor in the world with a market share of nearly 20% according to reports of Gartner, a global research and advisory firm. Its nearest rival, SAP is way behind at a market share of around 8%.  About 90% of the Fortune 100 companies uses at least one Salesforce software.The company has leveraged its expertise in on-demand software to increase the scale of operations. It also offers a technology platform for customers and developers to build and run business applications.Salesforce helps companies of every size and industry to connect with their customers in new ways through existing and emerging technologies including cloud, mobile, social, IoT and artificial intelligence (AI).Rapid digital transformation and the company’s sustained focus on introducing more aligned products as per customer needs is driving its revenues higher. Over the last eight years, Salesforce’s annual revenues have sextuple from $5.4 billion in fiscal 2015 to $31.4 billion in fiscal 2023.Story continuesThere are two main revenue streams — Subscription and Support and Professional Services &amp; Other.Subscription revenues comprise subscription fees from customers, accessing the company’s enterprise cloud computing services (Cloud Services), software licenses and subscription fees recognized from customers for additional support beyond the standard support lent by the company. This segment accounted for more than 93% of Salesforce’s fiscal 2023 revenues.Professional Services &amp; Other revenues consist of fees that the company derives from consulting and implementation services and training. This segment accounted for the remaining 7% of Salesforce’s fiscal 2023 revenues.Bottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of a few things: research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Salesforce.com a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in June 2013 would be worth $5,903.95, or a gain of 490.39%, as of June 21, 2023, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 176.33% and the price of gold went up 37.64% over the same time frame.Analysts are anticipating more upside for CRM.Salesforce is benefiting from a robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. The rapid adoption of its cloud-based solutions is driving demand for its products. Its sustained focus on introducing more aligned products as per customer needs is driving its top-line. Continued deal wins in the international market is another growth driver. The acquisition of Slack would position the company to be a leader in enterprise team collaboration solution space and better compete with Microsoft’s Teams product. Our estimates suggest that Salesforce revenues to grow at a CAGR of 10.5% through fiscal 2024-2026. However, stiff competition and unfavorable currency fluctuations are concerns. Besides, challenging macroeconomic environment might hurt its growth prospects in the near-term.Over the past four weeks, shares have rallied 5%, and there have been 19 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

42,bebbf606-610b-3781-894c-52d1d2076df9,RL,2023-06-22,Top 7 Long-Term Investment Stocks for Future Millionaires,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-7-long-term-investment-010947970.html,1686877787,STORY,"['AVGO', 'AAPL', 'TM', 'MCD', 'RL', 'SBUX', 'TSLA']","[The benchmark S&amp;P 500 index experienced losses in 11 of 47 years between 1975 and 2022. That alone proves the stock market generates far more returns than losses. Yet investors tend to earn returns that are only about one-third of the stock market’s total return. This is because investors tend to jump in and out of stocks, change their minds frequently, and even act on emotion. Instead, what many investors may want to do is buy and stay put with some of the market’s best long-term stocks, such as:Best Long-Term Stocks: Toyota (TM)Toyota motor corporation logo on dealership buildingSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.comTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of the top electric vehicle stocks on the market. But Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM) may be about to catch it. After all, Toyota is the world’s biggest vehicle manufacturer.  In 2022, while Tesla produced 1.3 million vehicles, Toyota produced 10.5 million — and just announced that it will focus its resources on developing a full line-up of electric vehicles and the batteries needed to power them.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIn fact, Toyota said it plans to sell 3.5 million battery-powered vehicles a year by 2030 through a new electric vehicle business unit called “BEV Factory.” The automaker added that it is aiming for a driving range of 1,000 kilometers on a single battery charge for all its future electric vehicles, which is nearly double the 570 km range of Tesla’s Model 3 sedan. The company is also developing solid-state batteries for its EVs. New CEO Koji Sato is making electric vehicle production his central focus, which should worry other automakers. TM stock is up 20% so far this year. The stock also has a low price-earnings ratio of 12 and pays a rich dividend yield of 2.58%.Best Long-Term Stocks: Starbucks (SBUX)Source: ShutterstockStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) does one thing and does it extremely well: sell coffee. Today, Starbucks is the biggest restaurant chain in the world with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, more than 35,000 outlets worldwide, and an army of 400,000 employees. Starbucks is bigger than McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) in terms of its annual sales. That’s impressive when one considers that Starbucks’ menu is much more limited and static than McDonald’s and other quick service restaurants.Story continuesIn addition, Starbucks’ success proves the enduring power of coffee. Surveys have found that nearly half (49%) of Americans drink three to five cups of coffee each day. And 39% of Americans say they enjoy Starbucks coffee the most. The national coffee addiction helps to explain Starbucks’ robust earnings. The Seattle-based company is also huge globally, enjoying a major presence in China, the world’s most populous country with 1.4 billion citizens. Starbucks’ global reach should help power its sales for years to come. SBUX stock has gained 35% in the past 12 months and is up 76% over five years.Best Long-Term Stocks: Broadcom (AVGO)AI. Circuit board. Technology background. Central Computer Processors CPU concept. Motherboard digital chip. Tech science background. Integrated communication processor. 3D illustration representing semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockIt seems that all the news concerning microchip and semiconductor companies revolves around players such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). Too often the discussion around chipmakers leaves out another major player, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). This is a shame as Broadcom has quietly outperformed many of its peers for years now. AVGO stock is up 65% in the past year and has risen more than 200% over five years.Broadcom’s chips are used to power everything from wireless networks and data centers to artificial intelligence (A.I.) applications. The company is currently riding high on news that antitrust regulators in Europe plan to approve its $61 billion acquisition of cloud computing firm VMware (NYSE:VMW). The purchase will further diversify Broadcom’s technology and its uses, making it a great strategic move on the company’s part. AVGO stock also pays a decent dividend that yields 2.14%, which is rare among chipmakers and tech companies.Ralph Lauren (RL)A Ralph Lauren outlet, October 21, 2013, Geneva, Switzerland.Source: Martin Good / Shutterstock.comFashion company Ralph Lauren’s (NYSE:RL) brand and stock have held up better than most retailers during the volatility of the last 18 months. During the past year, RL stock has grown 27%, and it has increased 75% since 2017. The company targets a more affluent clientele with its polo shirts and other preppy wear, and that has made Ralph Lauren more resilient to economic downturns as high net-worth individuals tend to curb their spending last and only in extreme situations.Like other stocks on this list, Ralph Lauren benefits from being a truly international company, with sales in every region of the globe. In its most recent earnings print, Ralph Lauren reported that its China sales rose 4% during the quarter, helping to offset weakness in the U.S.  The company is also much more than its clothing line. Ralph Lauren has also expanded into eyewear, bedding, fragrances, and cosmetics. Management has said the goal is to be a “full luxury” company.Apple (AAPL)An image of a building with the Apple logo on it, a pink sunset in the backgroundSource: askarim / ShutterstockIt remains to be seen if Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) new $3,500 augmented reality headset will be a hit with consumers. Regardless, the technology giant has many other products to continue driving its sales for years to come, including the iPhone, Macbook, Apple Watch and its relatively new financial and streaming ventures. The enduring popularity and strong sales of its products helps to explain why AAPL stock recently closed at an all-time high above $183 (on a split-adjusted basis).Apple’s market capitalization is back to approaching $3 trillion, according to data from FactSet, and the share price can be expected to continue running higher for years to come. Key to Apple’s enduring success has been strong brand loyalty among consumers and its ability to constantly update its technology. Apple is one of the few companies that issue new versions of its products every year without fail. Investors who own AAPL stock also benefit from the fact that the company buys back more of its own stock than any other publicly traded entity.McDonald’s (MCD)Source: ShutterstockMcDonald’s is an evergreen stock. A true set-it-and-forget-it investment. Shares of the Golden Arches can reliably be expected to trend higher over the long-term. Investors looking for stocks with durable competitive advantages and a wide moat around them should consider MCD stock. Today, McDonald’s is the third largest quick-service restaurant chain in the world by revenue with nearly $25 billion in annual sales. That’s a lot of hamburgers and fries.In the last 12 months, MCD stock has risen 20% and the company’s share price is up 75% through five years. Stockholders also get a quarterly dividend that yields 2.11% for a payout of $1.52 a share. In late April, McDonald’s reported earnings that once again beat Wall Street forecasts on the top and bottom lines. Due to increased traffic and higher prices, McDonald’s reported earnings per share of $2.63  versus $2.33 expected. Revenue came in at $5.90 billion compared to the $5.59 billion forecast. Rock solid.Alibaba (BABA)baba value stocksSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.comInvesting in China is not without risk. However, the upside potential might make it worthwhile to take a position in a major Chinese tech firm whose long-term growth prospects are huge. A tech firm such as Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). Dubbed the “Amazon of China,” Alibaba is an e-commerce giant that also has tentacles in cloud computing, online payments, and AI. BABA stock took a drubbing over the past few years as Chinese authorities in Beijing cracked down on publicly traded companies, notably tech firms. However, the worst looks to now be over.In recent months, several notable investors have been taking positions in Chinese stocks, including Michael Burry of “The Big Short” fame. In May, it was revealed that Burry had doubled his holding of BABA stock. Alibaba, along with fellow Chinese tech firm JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), is now the largest holding in Burry’s fund, accounting for 20% of his portfolio. Clearly, Burry and others are betting on the long-term growth potential of China’s major companies.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA and AAPL.

While prices have eased slightly, higher mortgage rates are hurting affordability, and many of those who already own a home are not incentivized to list. As a result, the total number of home sales (projected to be down 15.8% to 4.2 million) is likely to be at its lowest point since 2012. On the rental side, prices are expected to drop slightly on the year (-0.9%), as strong multi-family construction is improving inventory.""High inflation and the Fed's actions to curb it have had a significant impact on the housing market this year. And while inflation has begun to ease, the sustained spike in mortgage rates was enough to stifle the housing market after several years of low rates and strong activity,"" said Realtor.com® Chief Economist Danielle Hale. ""The housing market has really seen a double whammy in 2023, with a retrenchment in the number of homes for sale coupled with still-high prices and mortgage rates that have kept both first-time and repeat buyers on the sidelines.""Revised 2023 Housing ForecastHousing IndicatorRealtor.com® 2023 Revised ForecastRealtor.com® 2023 Forecast (Nov. 2022)2022 Historical DataMortgage RatesAverage 6.4% throughout the year, 6.1% by end of yearAverage 7.4% throughout the year, 7.1% by end of yearAverage 5.3%, 6.7% at end of yearExisting Home Median Sales Price Appreciation- 0.6 %+5.4 %+10.2 %Existing Home Sales- 15.8%4.2 million-14.1%4.5 million-17.8%5.0 millionExisting Home For-Sale Inventory- 5 %+22.8 %Single-Family Home Housing Starts-19.6%0.8 million-5.4%0.9 million -10.6%1.0 million Homeownership Rate65.7 %65.7 %65.8 %Rent Change-0.9 %+6.3 %+10.9 %Affordability improving, but still a long way to goHome prices have been supported by persistent underbuilding relative to household growth over the last decade, but low affordability has had an outsized impact on demand. As a result, Realtor.com® now expects a modest decline in home prices of 0.6% for the year. The expectation is that mortgage rates will also be slightly lower than originally anticipated, but not low enough to bring down buying costs until the end of the year. As inflation is expected to cool gradually, we expect that mortgage rates will start to do the same beginning mid-year and nearing 6% by the end of the year. For the year as a whole, the cost of a mortgage is expected to be up 10.5% compared to 2022.Story continuesMortgage rate lock-in effect impacting inventoryRealtor.com® expects home sales to decline 15.8% in 2023 for a total of about 4.2 million sales for the year, the smallest annual total since 2012. Mortgage rate lock-in has been a stronger factor than initially expected, and the number of homes for sale has not met initial projections. As a result, the expectation now is for inventory levels to slip 5% for the year, and not the growth projected in the initial forecast.""The vast majority of homeowners locked in low rates during the pandemic and aren't particularly excited to give them up in order to buy a new home, unless they really need to move for personal reasons,"" said Hale.Rental prices pull backChallenging conditions in the housing market will lead many to continue renting, driving ongoing demand for rentals through the second half of 2023. However, the strong uptick in new multi-family construction and people choosing to stay in their unit in order to save money is likely to decrease competition for new units and lead to a slight annual decline in rental prices (-0.9%). However, despite this pull-back, rental prices are still historically high with the average rent about $350 more than it was pre-pandemic.Other economic factors to considerDespite the Fed's tightening, the economy and labor markets have shown resilience. And while paychecks haven't kept pace with inflation, Americans have dipped into pandemic savings and continued to spend money. While this is boosting the current economy, it could have an impact in the future if consumers burn through savings and need to rely on high-interest debt.About Realtor.com®Realtor.com® is an open real estate marketplace built for everyone.

(NASDAQ:ALGN) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:""We initiated a position in Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN), a global medical device company best known for its “Invisalign” clear aligners, having created the clear aligner category in 1999. Since that time, it has been a disruptor of the traditional use of wire and bracket braces to straighten teeth and treat malocclusions. While it is leader in the clear aligner category with roughly 85-90% market share, the bigger competition is taking share from wire and brackets and on that measure, it only has 10-15% share of the overall teeth straightening market. Over time, through innovation and vertical integration, the company has evolved to be able to treat over 90% of all cases. Further, it has done a great job deepening relationships with orthodontists and general practitioner dentists over time. All in all, we believe this is a business with a durable competitive advantage, operating in a large, growing and very attractive industry, led by a proven and long-term oriented management team, with a very long runway ahead of it to grow and compound at very attractive rates.""Story continuesCountries with the Lowest Cancer Rates in the World in 2018ESB Professional/Shutterstock.comAlign Technology, Inc.

Microsoft's bid to acquire the ""Call of Duty"" videogame maker was approved by the European Union in May, but British competition authorities blocked the takeover in April.Story continuesThe FTC has argued that the deal, which would be the largest for Microsoft and the biggest in the history of the videogame business, would give Microsoft the ""ability and increased incentive to withhold or degrade Activision’s content in ways that substantially lessen competition.""Microsoft has said that the deal would benefit gamers and gaming companies alike, and has offered to sign a legally binding consent decree with the FTC to provide ""Call of Duty"" games to rivals for a decade.The hearing is scheduled to proceed through June 29. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Activision CEO Bobby Kotick are among the witnesses for next week.(Reporting by David Shepardson and Chris Sanders in Washington; Editing by Leslie Adler, Mark Porter, Matthew Lewis and Sonali Paul)]"

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information.

You can skip our detailed analysis of increasing population projections and the demand for food and go directly to the Top 5 Countries in Food Production Per Capita.Food is not only a basic necessity for survival but also a driving force behind a nation's economic prosperity. It holds the key to unlocking a country's economic potential, influencing factors such as GDP growth, agricultural sector contribution, and trade opportunities.The fascinating truth is that a high level of food production per capita paints a picture of a vibrant agricultural sector, brimming with possibilities and paving the way for numerous positive economic implications. During 2020, Bloomberg reported that the global food production stood at approximately 4 billion metric tons annually at that time. When it comes to the question of which country is the largest food producer in absolute terms, it is, of course, China, with a total production of 682.3 million tons in 2021. However, high per capita food production by countries shows which countries are producing relatively high quantity of food relative to their population sizes.Food Production Per Capita by Country: A Driving Force Behind Economic GrowthCountries' food production per capita plays a pivotal role in shaping its economic landscape, directly influencing both GDP growth and the overall contribution of the agricultural sector.Some of the key benefits of high agricultural yield per capita include enhanced food security, improved standard of living, employment and income generation and rural development. High food production per capita ensures stable supply, reducing dependence on imports and enhancing food security, especially given the fact that 40% of the global agricultural land has become too degraded for good yield. The UN also notes that 90% of the global topsoil is further at risk in the next 30 years. Story continuesIf that wasn't enough, the global population is expected to reach 10 billion by 2050, increasing the demand for food by an average of 78.5%. To feed 10 billion people by 2050, food production will have to increase by 50% by 2050. Expanding Export Potential: High Food Production per Capita and Trade OpportunitiesHigh food production can stimulate increased export potential and trade opportunities for a country. Surplus food production allows for exports, boosting foreign exchange earnings and improving the balance of trade.Commodities like grains, fruits, vegetables, and meat contribute significantly to export revenues. Moreover, countries with ample food production become attractive trade partners, able to supply nations with lower production capabilities. This can foster trade agreements, partnerships, and economic cooperation. Additionally, a strong agricultural sector attracts foreign direct investment, facilitating technological transfer and enhancing global competitiveness.According to the FAO report, many countries experience varying levels of net imports in their food supply. In several instances, the net imports range from 0 to 20% of the domestic food supply. Notably, Argentina, Australia, and the United States of America stand out with net exports surpassing 50% of their domestic food supply. On the other hand, the Near East/North Africa region heavily relies on importing over 50% of its food supply. Additionally, Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and China also fall into the category of net importers, as they depend on external sources to meet their food requirements.When it comes to the food trading industry, certain names stand out prominently. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), Darling Ingredients Inc. (NYSE:DAR), and Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) are three such noteworthy companies. With their extensive experience and expertise, these companies have established themselves as key players in the global food market. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) excels in agricultural sourcing, processing, and distribution, while Darling Ingredients Inc. (NYSE:DAR) specializes in sustainable food ingredients and recycling solutions. Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG), on the other hand, is a leading agribusiness and food ingredient company. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), Darling Ingredients Inc. (NYSE:DAR), and Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) demonstrate their commitment to meeting the world's food trade demands and driving innovation in the food trading sector.Let’s now move to our list of food production per capita by country:Food Production Per Capita by Country: Top 20 CountriesNejron Photo/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyFor our list, we sourced data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) for the year 2021, as it represents the most recent information available regarding food production per capita worldwide.

Fundamentally, no matter how advanced we become as a civilization, certain things will never change. Of course, the most critical is our need for nutritional sustenance. Thus, long-term investors may treat ADM’s loss of over 18% this year as irrationality.Story continuesNo matter, when the market is giving you one of the best S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy at a discount, you take it. Over the trailing one-year period, ADM slipped over 11%, which seems like overkill given the underlying relevance. More importantly, the market prices ADM at a forward multiple of only 10.55. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than 81.7% of the competition.It’s no slouch on the operational metrics either. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 16.4% (on a per-share basis), above 76.8% of its peers. Also, its Piotroski F-Score comes in at 7 out of 9, indicating solid operational efficiency.

Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Headquartered in Deerfield, Illinois, CF Industries (NYSE:CF) is an American manufacturer and distributor of agricultural fertilizers, including ammonia, urea, and ammonium nitrate products. Given the geopolitical flashpoint in Eastern Europe and implications for the global food supply chain, agricultural entities such as CF command extraordinary relevance. However, exposure to geopolitics has many investors worried, with CF shedding over 17% since the Jan. opener.Nevertheless, those with a patient view might consider the agro firm as one of the undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks. True, the present circumstances don’t seem enticing at all. Plus, in the past 365 days, CF stock gave up more than 26% of market value. Still, at some point, circumstances will eventually normalize. Plus, the red ink presents much food for thought.Mainly, the market now prices CF at a trailing multiple of 4.53. As a discount to earnings, CF ranks better than 90.61% of its peers. Also, shares now trade at a price-earnings-growth ratio of 0.12. In contrast, the sector median value stands at a loftier 0.72 times. Therefore, it’s worth consideration as one of the cheap S&amp;P 500 stocks.Biogen (BIIB)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comBased in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) is a multinational biotechnology firm specializing in the discovery, development, and delivery of therapies for the treatment of neurological diseases to patients worldwide. Thanks to its permanently relevant business, BIIB ranks among the best S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy. Since the Jan. opener, shares popped just over 10%.Despite its performance in the charts, however, BIIB also ranks among the undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks. At the moment, the market prices shares at a trailing multiple of 13.93. As a discount to earnings, Biogen ranks better than 72.7% of companies listed in the drug manufacturing industry. Also, BIIB trades at 0.95 times the projected free cash flow. In contrast, the underlying sector median value is 1.58 times.Just as well, the company benefits from excellent profitability metrics. For example, its trailing-year net margin clocks in at 31%, outflanking 95.87% of its rivals. With a Piotroski F-Score of 7 out of 9, Biogen delivers an operationally efficient business. Thus, it’s a solid candidate for S&amp;P 500 stocks with upside.Snap-on (SNA)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen.

Best Speculative StocksSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comHailing from Kenosha, Wisconsin, Snap-on (NYSE:SNA) is an American designer, manufacturer, and marketer of high-end tools and equipment for professional use in the transportation industry. This includes solutions for automotive, heavy-duty, equipment, marine, aviation, and railroad industries. To be fair, SNA is one of the boring entities among undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks. Still, that shouldn’t be confused with underperforming.Since the beginning of this year, SNA gained over 18% of its equity value. In the trailing one-year period, it popped up over 33%. Thanks to its everyday relevance, Snap-on offers resilience and predictability for its stakeholders. Despite the robust gains, however, SNA offers a discount for those seeking S&amp;P 500 stocks for June.Notably, the market prices SNA at a forward multiple of 15.86.

Mostly specializing in the downstream and midstream components of the hydrocarbon energy value chain, MPC could benefit from rising relevancies. As society continues to normalize, traffic volume should rise. On paper, this framework should benefit MPC.So far, though, the market doesn’t really seem to appreciate this thesis. Since the Jan. opener, MPC gained less than 1%. Nevertheless, this lack of mobility in the charts might make MPC one of the undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks. Significantly, the market prices Marathon shares at a forward multiple of 6.08. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than nearly 63% of its oil and gas peers.Also, MPC trades at 0.32 times sales. In contrast, the sector median stands at 0.91 times. That’s noteworthy because Marathon’s three-year revenue growth rate clocks in at 27.1%, above 80.28% of its rivals. As well, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period pings at 60.9%. Thus, it’s a great idea for cheap S&amp;P 500 stocks with upside potential.Valero Energy (VLO)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comA downstream petroleum specialist, Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) mostly focuses on manufacturing and marketing transportation fuels. As well, it produces other petrochemical products and power. As with Marathon Petroleum above, Valero should benefit from rising social normalization trends. However, the market has a dim view of VLO, with shares fading nearly 7%. Over the trailing one-year period, it’s down almost 13%.Still, the red ink might make Valero one of the compelling undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy. On the valuation front, the market prices VLO at a forward multiple of 5.26. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than 71.08% of its oil and gas compatriots. Also, shares trade at 0.25 times sales. In contrast, the sector median again stands at 0.91 times.Nevertheless, Valero performs very well on the operational side. Its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 19.4%, above nearly 70% of its peers. Also, its Piotroski F-Score lands at a perfect 9 out of 9, indicating superior operational efficiency. Combined with an Altman Z-Score of 5.77 (indicating low bankruptcy risk), VLO makes a strong case for the best S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy.General Dynamics (GD)image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocksSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.comAlthough a bit on the controversial side for some investors for its aerospace and defense business, General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) technically meets the qualifications for undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks. Despite its relevant business profile – and gaining relevance, unfortunately – the market doesn’t believe in GD stock. Since the start of the year, shares tumbled nearly 15%. Over the past 365 days, GD is almost 3% below parity.Nevertheless, rising instability in the geopolitical realm could see demand for General Dynamics rise. In the meantime, the market prices GD at a forward multiple of 16.82. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than 66.67% of enterprises in the aerospace and defense industry. Also, GD trades hands at 14.43 times operating cash flow. In contrast, the sector median stat is 18.89 times.Aside from its value proposition, General Dynamics enjoys strong profitability metrics. Its trailing-year net margin clocks in at 8.5%, above 70.76% of its peers. Also, it’s worth mentioning that its Piotroski F-Score lands at 7 out of 9, indicating decent operational efficiency. Overall, then, it makes a solid case for S&amp;P 500 stocks for June.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

DEO also compared unfavorably with the Consumer Staples sector’s growth of 5.5% and the S&amp;P 500’s rally of 17.2%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Factors Aiding GrowthDiageo is expected to continue benefiting from its diversified footprint, advantaged portfolio, strong brands and favorable industry trends of premiumization. The company’s premium plus brands contributed 57% to net sales growth and 65% to organic sales growth in the first half of fiscal 2023. Its super-premium-plus brands aided organic net sales by 12%.DEO is well-poised for growth from effective marketing and extraordinary commercial execution. It is likely to invest strongly in marketing and innovation, and leverage its revenue growth management capabilities, including strategic pricing actions. This is likely to support DEO in the near and long terms.The company’s margin trends were favorable in the first half of fiscal 2023, thanks to its premiumization efforts, ongoing recovery in markets, pricing actions and disciplined cost management. Organic operating profit benefited from leverage in operating costs, driven by disciplined cost management. Growth was driven by supply productivity savings and price increases, which more than offset the higher cost inflation on the gross margin.In fiscal 2023, the company anticipates organic operating margin to benefit from continued premiumization trends, everyday efficiencies and operating expense leverage, offset by strong investments in marketing.Diageo is confident about the long-term growth potential of the beverage alcohol sector. It expects to expand its value share by 50% in the sector to 6% by 2030. DEO is on track to deliver on its medium-term guidance for fiscal 2023-2025 of 5-7% organic sales growth and 6-9% organic operating profit growth. Diageo expects to invest strongly in marketing and innovation, and leverage its revenue growth management capabilities, including strategic pricing actions.For fiscal 2023, DEO anticipates organic net sales growth across North America to normalize through the second half of fiscal 2023, whereas it reported double-digit growth in the year-ago period. In Europe, organic net sales growth is likely to moderate in the second half of fiscal 2023 as the company’s laps the on-trade channel re-opening and recovery in the prior year. It anticipates continued organic net sales growth for the Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Caribbean and Africa in the second half of fiscal 2023, although at a moderated pace relative to strong growth in fiscal 2022.Story continuesHurdles to OvercomeDiageo suffers from persistent inflationary pressures, induced by higher commodity costs, particularly agave, energy expenses and supply disruptions. As a substantial portion of Diageo’s business comes from international operations, exchange rate fluctuations have been hampering its sales for a while.Diageo expects to continue its revenue management initiatives, including pricing actions, throughout fiscal 2023, to overcome the challenging inflationary environment.In the second half of fiscal 2023, the company expects cost inflation pressure to persist and is committed to investing in its brands to deliver sustainable growth. DEO expects marketing investment to increase more than sales growth in the second half of fiscal 2023.Stocks to ConsiderWe highlighted some better-ranked stocks from the beverages space, namely The Duckhorn Portfolio NAPA, Monster Beverage MNST and PepsiCo PEP.Duckhorn currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The solid customer momentum of AWS is driving the company’s top line.The latest selection of AWS by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A. (""BBVA"") is a testament to the same.Notably, BBVA will leverage AWS to accelerate its data-driven transformation. It will utilize AWS’ analytics and machine learning capabilities to bolster its risk management process, deliver advanced solutions and innovate its internal processes.More precisely, BBVA intends to develop a data platform by using AWS Lake Formation and Amazon DataZone, both of which will manage and secure access to the data platform and ensure data governance and compliance.With the help of this platform, BBVA strives to provide a unified view of the data for its various business units.BBVA will leverage Amazon SageMaker, which will enable its data scientists to build, train and deploy machine learning models for any use case.It will utilize AWS’ generative AI capabilities and Amazon Bedrock to create innovative financial solutions.Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus Amazon.com, Inc. Price and ConsensusAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. QuotePortfolio Strength: Key CatalystBBVA’s latest move highlights the efficiency and reliability of AWS’ innovative cloud products and services. AWS’ focus on enhancing its offerings is likely to drive customer momentum.AWS recently made its purpose-built security data lake, called Amazon Security Lake, generally available. The service aids in the simplification of compliance monitoring and security data management across hybrid and multi-cloud environments by centralizing an organization’s security data across AWS environments.Further, the company introduced a new configuration for Amazon Aurora, namely Amazon Aurora I/O-Optimized, which provides improved price performance and predictable pricing for I/O-intensive applications.It also unveiled three new capabilities for its threat detection service called Amazon GuardDuty - GuardDuty EKS Runtime Monitoring, GuardDuty RDS Protection and GuardDuty Lambda Protection.Additionally, AWS announced the general availability of AWS Telco Network Builder, which automates the deployment and management of telco networks on AWS.Story continuesExpanding Customer BaseWe believe that the expanding AWS portfolio will continue to aid AWS in winning customers.Apart from BBVA, Veriff recently teamed up with AWS. Veriff is reinforcing its IT infrastructure with AWS to stay alert for fraudulent attacks. Further, it is leveraging the machine learning capabilities of AWS to accelerate the development of new identity verification solutions for various sectors.Further, AWS was selected by Experian as the preferred cloud provider. With the aid of AWS’ robust portfolio of cloud technologies and global infrastructure, Experian intends to shift its core business operations, consumer-service products, analytic tools and on-premises servers to AWS in a bid to support its multiyear information technology modernization initiative.AWS was picked by Southwest Airlines Co. LUV as the preferred cloud provider.Southwest Airlines strives to boost its digital transformation efforts, deliver a responsive customer support experience, streamline its operations and unveil advanced digital solutions on the heels of AWS solutions.In addition, Zurich Insurance Group selected AWS to migrate its enterprise information technology infrastructure to AWS.We believe that AWS’s expanding customer base will continue to drive its top-line growth. In first-quarter 2023, AWS generated revenues of $21.3 billion (17% of total sales), which grew 16% year over year.Moreover, the strengthening performance of AWS, which has become an integral part of Amazon, will likely instill investor optimism in the stock.Notably, Amazon has gained 49.8% on a year-to-date basis.To ConcludeWe believe that AWS’ growing global clientele, on the back of its expanding portfolio as well as data centers and cloud regions, will continue to help the company gain a competitive edge against its peers, namely Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet’s GOOGL Google.Amazon currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Per the latest Canalys report, AWS accounted for 32% of global cloud spending in first-quarter 2023, maintaining its leading position in the booming cloud market.Microsoft’s Azure, the second largest cloud service provider, accounts for 23% of worldwide cloud spending. Azure's increasing number of global availability zones and regions, along with strength in its consumption-based business, is likely to continue driving Microsoft's cloud momentum in the near term.Meanwhile, Alphabet’s Google Cloud represented 8% of the cloud spending, marking itself the third largest cloud provider. Expanding data centers, availability zones and cloud regions are expected to keep boosting Alphabet's cloud position.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

PM, Altria Group, Inc. MO and 22nd Century Group, Inc. XXII.Industry: TobaccoLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2110949/watch-these-3-tobacco-stocks-on-favorable-industry-trendsPlayers in the Zacks Tobacco industry have been benefiting from their strong pricing power as smokers tend to absorb price increases due to the addictive quality of cigarettes. Strength in the smoke-free product arena amid consumers’ rising preference for the same has also been working well for players.These upsides keep Philip Morris International Inc., Altria Group, Inc. and 22nd Century Group, Inc. well-positioned amid hurdles associated with cost inflation and low cigarette volumes.About the IndustryThe Zacks Tobacco industry includes companies that manufacture and sell cigarettes as well as tobacco and nicotine-based products, such as cigars, snuffs and oral tobacco. Some companies also offer RRPs, such as e-cigarettes, vaping and heat-not-burn variants. A few of the firms are engaged in making devices and attachments needed in vaping and heat-not-burn products.Most products manufactured by the tobacco industry participants fall under the strict vigilance of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and are required to follow the permissible levels of nicotine in manufacturing. Players in this space sell products mostly through large retailers, distributors, convenience stores, drugstores, wholesalers and grocery chains. Additionally, some international tobacco firms operate in the country through subsidiaries.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Tobacco IndustryRobust Pricing Power:Industry participants have been benefiting from the solid pricing power of tobacco products, which also helps them make up for high taxes and sometimes lower cigarette sales volumes. As smokers don’t mind a price hike due to their addiction, this strategy is likely to keep working for players in the tobacco space. The high pricing of cigarettes has been supporting revenues and the operating income of players in the tobacco industry.Story continuesSmoke-Free Products Gain Prominence: Rising health consciousness and stern government regulations against cigarette smoking have pushed many consumers toward low-risk, reduced-risk products (RRPs).  Compared to cigarettes, these products are claimed to be less detrimental to health due to their scientific composition and manner of use. Consumers are increasingly taking to such products to quit cigarettes.Tobacco majors have been making investments to expand in this category, such as undertaking innovations to make these products user-friendly and energy-efficient. Companies have been witnessing substantial revenue growth in the RRPs or smoke-free product arena. The tobacco giant, Philip Morris, has been gearing up toward becoming a majority smoke-free company by 2025. We believe that strength in these products is likely to continue working well for industry participants, which have been undertaking business transformation toward the RRP space.Stern Regulations: Cigarette volumes have been bearing the impacts of strict government regulations pertaining to sales, marketing and manufacturing. Such regulatory norms are imposed due to health hazards caused by the consumption of nicotine. Some guidelines issued by the FDA include the mandatory use of precautionary labels on cigarette packets and self-critical advertisements.Moreover, campaigns against tobacco consumption have led to increased consumer awareness, which has resulted in lower smoking rates. Such headwinds, along with the rising health consciousness, have been adversely impacting cigarette sales volumes. Since cigarette sales account for the majority of revenues for companies in the tobacco industry, dwindling sales volumes in this category are a concern.Cost Inflation: An overall inflationary cost scenario has been hurting the performance of many industry players. Companies are witnessing global inflationary pressures on the cost of sales (mainly hurting the combustible tobacco business), supply-chain hurdles and the overall inflation of operating costs. Increased costs associated with smoke-free product research, development and marketplace activities have also been hurting margins.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Strong ProspectsThe Zacks Tobacco industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #114, which places it in the top 45% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates solid near-term prospects.

A focus on expanding in the RRPs arena has also been working well for Philip Morris. The company is well-placed toward becoming a majority smoke-free company by 2025.

The total sales also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $579 million by 7.7%.Operational UpdateHEICO’s total costs and expenses increased 23.2% year over year to $491.5 million in the quarter under review. The increase was due to higher cost of sales and SG&amp;A expenses.Segmental PerformanceFlight Support Group: Net sales surged 36.2% year over year to $371.3 million. This hike was driven by increased demand for the majority of its commercial aerospace products and services, resulting from continued recovery in global commercial air travel.The operating income soared 60% year over year to $83.6 million. This increase was due to solid net sales growth, improved gross profit margin and efficiencies realized from higher net sales volume.

The purpose behind the launch is to extend better health outcomes for individuals in the region struggling with uncontrolled diabetes.To effectively cater to its endeavor, UnitedHealthcare has collaborated with the leading Community Health Center of Southwest Georgia, Albany Area Primary Health Care, and the regional food bank of Georgia, Feeding the Valley Food Bank.From July, the patients at Albany Area Primary Health Care with uncontrolled diabetes will be picked out and subsequently, become qualified to join the UnitedHealthcare Catalyst program. Therefore, the program will combine clinical data with firsthand data derived from community members and detect health issues prevailing across the targeted region. Assistance from local partners like Albany Area Primary Health Care and Feeding the Valley Food Bank will aid UnitedHealthcare Catalyst to devise a coordinated community plan.Additionally, individuals participating in the program will also enjoy the benefits of medication management programming, individualized nutrition education from a dietician and medically customized food boxes delivered by Feeding the Valley Food Bank.The ulterior motive of the program remains to address the diversified health needs of diabetic patients, extend self-management education and resources and, monitor the progression of the disease. Such an initiative seems to be of dire need, considering the significant prevalence of diabetes in Dougherty County, where Albany is situated.Despite being a chronic health condition, an adequate level of nutrition and proper management can prevent diabetes from further deteriorating the patient’s health, reduce frequent medical visits and upgrade the quality of life. Thereby, the UnitedHealthcare Catalyst program seems to be a perfect fit to somewhat improve the issue of diabetes in Albany.Story continuesThe customer base of the UnitedHealthcare business in Georgia remains commendable, with over 1.1 million members enrolled in its employer-sponsored, individual and Medicare and Dual Special Needs Plans. The program offers an opportunity for the UNH arm to gain more customers across the state. An increase in membership should aid the premium growth of UnitedHealth, which remains the most significant contributor to the revenues of any health insurer.With an extensive network of 154 hospitals, 42,000-plus physicians and other care providers in Georgia, the recent program launch is likely to solidify UnitedHealthcare’s statewide footprint.The UnitedHealthcare business has also been subject to several contract wins and renewed agreements in the past as well, which have continued to boost its membership growth.Shares of UnitedHealth have declined 11.4% year to date, compared with the industry’s 13.4% decrease.

80,f07b0de7-e541-3080-9c84-48fae1aa953d,HCA,2023-06-22,HCA Healthcare Prepares for 2023 Hurricane Season,Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hca-healthcare-prepares-2023-hurricane-181500241.html,1687371300,STORY,['HCA'],"[NASHVILLE, Tenn., June 21, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA), one of the nation’s leading healthcare providers, today announced its preparation efforts for the 2023 hurricane season. Each year, the company, through its Enterprise Emergency Operations Center (EEOC), creates and distributes key resources to its facilities to maintain continuity of care across facilities, so that patients and communities can continue to count on HCA Healthcare.With dozens of hospitals in hurricane-prone regions like Florida, Texas, Louisiana, South Carolina and Georgia, HCA Healthcare works diligently to stay up to date on current and expected weather trends. During the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 through November 30, HCA Healthcare’s hurricane forecasting partner currently predicts there will be approximately 15 named storms, including 7 hurricanes.HCA Healthcare’s disaster response starts long before a hurricane makes landfall. On May 31, the company held its annual enterprise-wide hurricane readiness briefing to update and equip hospitals ahead of the season. Hospital, division and corporate leaders met to be educated on the season’s weather outlook, review the company’s 2023 Hurricane Playbook and prepare for the upcoming season.""We owe it to our patients to be able to care for them when it is needed most,"" said Sam Hazen, chief executive officer of HCA Healthcare. ""Our preparedness efforts are a prime example of how we’re showing up for our patients, colleagues and communities.""The Nashville-based EEOC responds to approximately 900 events annually and is comprised of nearly 200 multi-disciplinary leaders, including risk management, clinical experts, supply chain, patient logistics, air and ground transport and community liaison representatives. During hurricane season, EEOC leaders leverage strategic partnerships with weather forecasting agencies and utilize real-time alerting technology to continuously monitor threats and evolve response plans and programs. As soon as the EEOC identifies a potential severe weather event, HCA Healthcare begins preparations to help provide affected hospitals with everything they need to continue providing care.Story continuesWorking across HCA Healthcare’s network, the EEOC can redirect the company’s supply chain to get medical supplies, equipment and care teams to impacted areas to offer assistance. The EEOC prepositions resources, including temporary generators, bulk water and fuel supply. This year, HCA Healthcare is stationing Incident Support Unit Trailers equipped with 3,000 Flood Control Barriers and storm readiness equipment, in both its Gulf Coast and West Florida divisions.In the event of an evacuation, the company uses EvacuNATE, an algorithm developed by HCA Healthcare, which helps to reduce hospital evacuation time using real-time triage data to track every patient’s movement and where alternative care is available. To strengthen HCA Healthcare’s ability to respond to emergency events, the EEOC introduced Incident Response Teams in 2020, comprised of skilled clinicians, leaders and executives from across the HCA Healthcare enterprise. In 2022, in collaboration with a strategic air transport partner, the company established a first-of-its-kind Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Incident Support Team (NICU IST) consisting of highly skilled HCA Healthcare nurses and respiratory therapists to help transfer NICU patients during an emergency.""Our job is to ensure the infrastructure is in place—the supplies, equipment, buildings and everything it takes to deliver care — and that our colleagues and patients are taken care of,"" said Michael Wargo, RN, BSN, MBA, PHRN, CMTE, vice president of HCA Healthcare’s Enterprise Emergency Operations &amp; Medical Transport. ""We are proud of our response to previous major incidents and strive to make our procedures even more seamless so that continuity of care remains uncompromised.""For more than 50 years, HCA Healthcare has been preparing for, responding to and learning from various emergency scenarios and extreme weather events like hurricanes. Last year, when Hurricane Ian made landfall on the west coast of Florida as a powerful category 4 hurricane, causing extensive damage to communities in its path, HCA Healthcare jumped into action to care for our patients and communities. Leaders from HCA Healthcare and its EEOC mobilized ahead of the storm to help ensure hospitals had the resources, including medications, food, water and generator power, to care for patients and colleagues. In the aftermath, HCA Healthcare’s human resources and supply chain teams set up on-site mini-marts, fuel stations, showers and laundry services in Florida to assist facilities, colleagues and nearby health systems in need.HCA Healthcare also announced it would give up to $1.5 million towards disaster relief efforts through donations to the Governor’s Florida Disaster Fund and the American Red Cross as well as colleague matching gifts. The HCA Healthcare Hope Fund, an employee-run, employee-supported 501(c)(3) charity that provides financial aid and resources to employees after an extended illness, injury, disaster or other special situations, provided approximately $1.2 million in grants to colleagues impacted by the hurricane.Over the last six years, HCA Healthcare has provided more than $5.6 million in financial support to the Red Cross for disaster relief efforts, including Hurricane Harvey in 2017, hurricanes Florence and Michael in 2018, and the Texas winter storms and Kentucky tornadoes in 2021 and during historic flooding in Kentucky. For the last four years, HCA Healthcare has contributed a total of $1.75 million to the Red Cross’ Annual Disaster Giving Program (ADGP) which helps the Red Cross respond immediately to disasters, helps families during the recovery process and prepares people for future emergencies.About HCA HealthcareNashville-based HCA Healthcare is one of the nation’s leading providers of healthcare services comprising 180 hospitals and approximately 2,300 ambulatory sites of care, including surgery centers, freestanding ERs, urgent care centers, and physician clinics, in 20 states and the United Kingdom. With its founding in 1968, HCA Healthcare created a new model for hospital care in the United States, using combined resources to strengthen hospitals, deliver patient-focused care and improve the practice of medicine. HCA Healthcare has conducted a number of clinical studies, including one that demonstrated that full-term delivery is healthier than early elective delivery of babies and another that identified a clinical protocol that can reduce bloodstream infections in ICU patients by 44%.

81,103c0740-e123-3732-99b9-e293b08cc7c6,HCA,2023-06-22,Are You Looking for a Top Momentum Pick? Why HCA Healthcare (HCA) is a Great Choice,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-top-momentum-pick-why-160007716.html,1687363207,STORY,['HCA'],"[Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at HCA Healthcare (HCA), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. HCA Healthcare currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if HCA is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this hospital operator holds up.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor HCA, shares are up 6.73% over the past week while the Zacks Medical - Hospital industry is up 7.41% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 6.55% compares favorably with the industry's 9.72% performance as well.Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Over the past quarter, shares of HCA Healthcare have risen 12.11%, and are up 64.09% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 11.45% and 21.35%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to HCA's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. HCA is currently averaging 1,123,947 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with HCA.Over the past two months, 6 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost HCA's consensus estimate, increasing from $17.34 to $18.10 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 8 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that HCA is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep HCA Healthcare on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It is the largest non-governmental operator of acute care hospitals in the U.S. Headquartered in Nashville, TN, it operates hospitals and related health care entities.At the end of 2022, the company operated 182 hospitals and approximately 2,300 ambulatory sites of care, including surgery centers, freestanding emergency rooms, urgent care centers and physician clinics, in 20 states and the United Kingdom.The general, acute care hospitals also provide outpatient services such as outpatient surgery, laboratory, radiology, respiratory therapy, cardiology and physical therapy. It operates in two geographically organized groups – the National and American Groups.The National Group includes 96 hospitals across Alaska, California, Florida, southern Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, northern Kentucky, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, South Carolina, Utah and Virginia.The American Group includes 79 hospitals across Colorado, northern Georgia, Kansas, southern Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Tennessee and Texas. The company also operates six hospitals in England that are included in the Corporate and Other group.The company's general, acute care hospitals with 48,030 licensed beds provide a wide range of services to cater to different medical specialties, such as internal medicine, general surgery, cardiology, oncology, neurosurgery, orthopedics and obstetrics as well as diagnostic and emergency services. As of Dec 31, 2022, HCA Healthcare’s five psychiatric hospitals with 593 licensed beds offered a full range of mental health care services through inpatient, partial hospitalization and outpatient settings.Story continuesBottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of a few things: research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in HCA Healthcare a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in June 2013 would be worth $7,571.66, or a gain of 657.17%, as of June 21, 2023, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 176.33% and the price of gold went up 37.64% over the same time frame.Analysts are anticipating more upside for HCA.HCA Healthcare’s revenues remain on an uptick on the back of a surge in admissions, outpatient surgeries and other procedures. We expect the top line to grow 3.9% year over year in 2023. Multiple buyouts aided it in increasing patient volumes, enabled network expansion, added hospitals to its portfolio and boosted business scale. It has been gaining from its telemedicine business line. HCA Healthcare resorts to prudent capital deployment via buybacks and dividends. As of Mar 31, 2023, it had $3.7 billion left under its buyback authorization. Its shares have outperformed the industry in a year. A solid business outlook added to the positives. However, the company's escalating operating expenses have been weighing on the margins. A high debt level induces rise in interest expenses. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.Over the past four weeks, shares have rallied 6.55%, and there have been 6 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this investment bank have returned +2.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, which Goldman falls in, has gained 5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Goldman is expected to post earnings of $7.63 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.3%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $31.57 points to a change of +5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.8%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $36.22 indicates a change of +14.7% from what Goldman is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.9%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Goldman.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Goldman, the consensus sales estimate of $12.03 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.4%. The $48.18 billion and $51.51 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +1.7% and +6.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryGoldman reported revenues of $12.22 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -5.5%. EPS of $8.79 for the same period compares with $10.76 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.03 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -6.16%. The EPS surprise was +7.99%.Over the last four quarters, Goldman surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Goldman is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Goldman. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

QGEN recently announced that its ForenSeq MainstAY workflow for the U.S. National DNA Index System (“NDIS”) received FBI approval.  Licenced forensic DNA laboratories will be able to process DNA casework samples and compare the resulting profiles to American databases.NDIS CODIS database, containing 20 million offender profiles, are used by authorities across the United States to solve criminal investigations countrywide.The approval builds on the NDIS approval of the MiSeq FGx Forensic Genomics System in 2019, which included the ForenSeq DNA Signature Prep Kit workflow.The latest approval will fortify QIAGEN’s HID and Forensics business.About ForenSeq MainstAY workflowLaunched in 2021, the ForenSeq MainstAY workflow targets 52 forensically relevant autosomal and Y-STR DNA markers that support identity confirmation and familial searching. It complies with CODIS and European standards, supports inter-database interoperability and achieves the highest discrimination of any commercially available STR kit.The ForenSeq MainstAY workflow has been developed and commercialized by Verogen, a QIAGEN company. This system comprises the MiSeq FGx Sequencing System, the ForenSeq MainstAY Analysis Module and the high-throughput ForenSeq MainstAY kit. The workflow was submitted to NDIS for approval by the Utah Bureau of Forensic Services Laboratory System.Significance of the ApprovalThe ForenSeq MainstAY workflow is a cost-effective substitute for analyzing short tandem repeats (STR) with capillary electrophoresis (CE) and facilitates volume casework for sexual assault cases. It supports high-throughput processing of up to 96 samples in one run using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, offers improved sensitivity leading to increased profiling efficiency, higher resolution and is extensible for applications like forensic investigative genetic genealogy (FIGG), phenotyping and additional capabilities like body fluid identification.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis approval by the FBI reflects on the superiority of the Verogen-developed NGS-based forensic products. With ForenSeq MainstAY, QIAGEN continues to uphold its commitment to providing forensic laboratories with cost-effective NGS processes that enable them to make the switch from capillary electrophoresis without increasing their spending. The forensics community can start making this transformation thanks to NDIS compatibility, which also gives them access to federal funds for NGS validation and deployment.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Grand View Research, the global forensic genomics market size was valued at $413.32 million in 2021 and is projected to attain a CAGR of 14.25%. The industry growth can be attributed to rapid technological advancements, increased private &amp; government funding for the development of cost-effective forensic testing techniques and an increasing number of crimes, such as homicides, kidnapping and sexual assault.Recent DevelopmentsThis month, QIAGEN announced that its software for interpreting and reporting variants, QIAGEN Clinical Insight (QCI Interpret), is being used in Denmark as part of a government initiative to provide sequencing-based treatments for cancer patients. The QCI Interpret solution was selected by Danish National Genome Center for variant interpretation in oncology genome sequencing.In May 2023, QIAGEN announced that it will offer its premium enzymes as standalone solutions, giving researchers and business clients the freedom to design their own tests and workflows.

CAH scaled a new 52-week high of $92.09 on Jun 20, 2023, before closing the session marginally lower at $91.24.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 73.5% compared with 20.8% growth of the industry and a 16.7% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.Over the past five years, the company registered an earnings decline of 0.6% against the industry’s 8.3% growth. The company’s long-term expected growth rate of 13.2% compares with the industry’s growth projection of 12.1%. Cardinal Health’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 12.3%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCardinal Health is witnessing an upward trend in its stock price, prompted by its diversified product portfolio. The optimism led by a solid third-quarter fiscal 2023 performance and the opening of a few distribution centers are expected to contribute further. However, stiff competition and the probability of losing a major customer persist.Let’s delve deeper.Key Growth DriversDiversified Product Portfolio: Investors are upbeat about Cardinal Health’s Medical and Pharmaceutical offerings, which provide the company with a competitive edge in the niche space. In May, the company launched modern payment solutions powered by Square to help independent pharmacies increase operational efficiency, stay updated with customer payment preferences and access integrated software tools for their business.In April, Cardinal Health announced the launch of the Stray Away hair management drape for more efficient surgical procedure preparation.Distribution Centers: Investors are optimistic about Cardinal Health’s opening of a few distribution centers in strategic areas over the past few months. This month, the company announced its plans to build a new distribution center in Greenville, SC to support its at-Home Solutions business, a home healthcare medical supplies provider serving people with chronic and serious health conditions in the United States.Story continuesIn May, Cardinal Health Canada announced its plans to open a new distribution center in the Greater Toronto Area, thus expanding its distribution footprint to better meet the medical and surgical product demands of the Canadian healthcare system.Strong Q3 Results: Cardinal Health’s impressive third-quarter fiscal 2023 results buoy optimism. The company’s robust top-line and bottom-line results and solid performance by the Pharmaceutical segment were encouraging. Per management, the segmental performance highlights branded pharmaceutical sales growth from existing Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty Solutions customers.DownsidesProbabilities of Loss of a Major Customer: Cardinal Health faces the risk of losing considerable business if it loses a major customer, which will severely impair its revenues in the future. In this regard, post establishing a generic sourcing joint venture with CVS Caremark in 2014, Cardinal Health largely depends on the former for more than 20% of its revenues. Collectively, five of Cardinal Health’s main customers, including CVS, accounted for as much as 40% of its revenues.Stiff Competition: Cardinal Health operates in a highly competitive environment in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and consumer healthcare products, as well as in the manufacturing and distribution of medical devices and surgical products. The company also competes on many levels, including price and service offerings.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc. HOLX, Merit Medical Systems, Inc.

AVNS recently announced a definitive agreement to acquire Diros Technology Inc. The company intended to share additional details about the transaction, which is expected to be closed in the third quarter of 2023 (subject to customary closing conditions), on its Investor Day event on Jun 20.Avanos expects the new business to be immediately accretive to its revenue growth, gross margins, operating margins and earnings per share (EPS).Toronto, Canada-based Diros Technology is a well-known manufacturer of innovative radiofrequency (RF) products to treat chronic pain conditions.The latest acquisition is likely to significantly boost Avanos’ pain management treatment options and complement its premium COOLIEF Cooled RF product offerings.Rationale Behind the AcquisitionPer Avanos, more than a million radiofrequency ablation (RFA) procedures are performed annually for the treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain. Diros Technology's products deliver RF energy via precisely placed, minimally-invasive probes for chronic pain management. The RF energy thus delivered heat the nervous tissues near the probe's tip, deactivating the nerve's ability to transmit pain signals.Avanos’ management believes that the buyout of Diros Technology will likely strengthen its foothold in RF technology by providing a full range of high-quality, differentiated pain management products. The enhanced portfolio is expected to offer significant opportunities to deliver non-opioid-based and minimally-invasive treatments to patients worldwide.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Facts and Factors, the global RFA devices market was worth around $3.59 billion in 2021 and is anticipated to reach $10.21 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of approximately 11%. Factors like the rising prevalence of chronic pain disorders and the growing demand for pain management are expected to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest buyout is expected to significantly strengthen Avanos’ global business.Story continuesRecent DevelopmentsThis month, Avanos entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Respiratory Health (RH) business to SunMed Group Holdings, LLC. Per Avanos, the divestiture of the RH business represents a key component of its ongoing three-year transformation process and accelerates its efforts to focus its portfolio on markets where it is well-positioned to succeed.Last month, Avanos announced its first-quarter 2023 results, wherein it registered a solid adjusted EPS performance. Strength in the Chronic Care segment from a solid Digestive health business and robust growth in NeoMed (fueled by strong execution of customer conversions to Avanos’ ENFit technology in North America) and CORTRAK were also recorded.Price PerformanceShares of Avanos have gained 0.8% in the past year compared with the industry’s 15.8% rise and the S&amp;P 500's 16.7% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, Avanos carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

EYE is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters with the ongoing comparable store increase. The company has been making investments for improved patient care and optometric experience, including investments in AI.The patterns within the broader eyewear market are likely to bode well for EYE’s business. Meanwhile, mounting expenses and operating in a tough competitive environment are concerning for the company.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 3.2% compared with the 19.8% fall of the industry and a 19.2% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The leading optical retailer has a market capitalization of $2.01 billion. The company projects long-term estimated earnings growth of 21.9% compared with the industry’s 14.1%. National Vision surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in one, delivering an earnings surprise of 69.9%, on average.Let’s delve deeper.UpsidesComparable Store Growth Holds Promise: In the first quarter, National Vision opened eight stores (four America's Best and four Eyeglass World stores), with the expected launch of nearly 65 to 70 stores in 2023. The company noted that the new stores opened over the past 12 months are continuing to perform well and are in line with the company’s expectations.In 2023, EYE invested $27.7 million in capital expenditures, primarily focused on new store openings and customer-facing technology investments. In terms of marketing, the company’s merchandising and distribution teams continue to execute well and are confident that the current inventory levels are sufficient to support continued growth in 2023.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFavorable Industry Trends: Changing lifestyle patterns and the increasing adoption of luxurious accessories among millennials are strongly favoring the global eyewear market’s growth, valued at $169.9 billion in 2022. The establishment of remote working models during lockdown has factored in the increasing sales of blue light canceling and anti-fatigue lenses for eyewear companies.Story continuesPer a 2022 report by The Vision Council, 82% of respondents use a form of vision correction, 69% use prescription eyewear and 68% use some form of non-prescription eyewear.Technological Investment: National Vision recently invested in an early-stage health care, AI start-up, Toku, alongside Topcon Healthcare. Through the investment, EYE is strengthening the future of optical care in which more people are able to have affordable access to potentially life-saving health data on an easily accessible, non-invasive test.DownsidesMargins Down: EYE reported a significant year-over-year decline in first-quarter earnings. Escalating expenses caused a contraction in the gross and adjusted operating margins. The company is facing demand headwinds across its network of stores, given the current macro environment and supply challenges in a smaller subgroup of stores due to the constraints on eye exam capacity.Tough Competition: In a highly competitive optical retail industry, National Vision competes with national retailers like LensCrafters, Pearle Vision and Visionworks. Competition exists in physical retail locations and e-commerce platforms.The company also faces competitive threats from online sellers of contact lenses and eyewear. Several firms are focused on selling eyeglasses in the online market like Warby Parker and Zenni Optical.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for EYE’s 2023 earnings per share (EPS) has remained constant at 50 cents in the past 30 days.The Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $2.12 billion. This suggests a 5.5% rise from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Zimmer Biomet ZBH, Penumbra PEN and Hologic, Inc.

(HOLX): Here is What You Need to Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-hologic-inc-130014481.html,1687352414,STORY,['HOLX'],"[Hologic (HOLX) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this medical device maker have returned +2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, which Hologic falls in, has gained 3.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Hologic is expected to post earnings of $0.88 per share, indicating a change of -7.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.89 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -35.4%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.09 indicates a change of +5.1% from what Hologic is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Hologic.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Hologic, the consensus sales estimate of $956.48 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -4.6%. The $4.01 billion and $4.15 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -17.6% and +3.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryHologic reported revenues of $1.03 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -28.5%. EPS of $1.06 for the same period compares with $2.07 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $967.05 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.15%. The EPS surprise was +20.45%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Hologic is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Hologic. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

100,eefa6108-1f28-3223-8f96-115527ae7d34,NFLX,2023-06-22,"Ryan Murphy leaving Netflix, reportedly heading to Disney",Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/ryan-murphy-leaving-netflix-reportedly-212021844.html,1687382421,VIDEO,"['NFLX', 'DIS']","[Producer Ryan Murphy will leave Netflix when his five-year deal expires and reportedly head back to Disney. The Yahoo Finance Live team discusses what these entertainment deals with big-name talent mean for the media industry.Video Transcript- But speaking of shopping, one high profile producer is looking for his next big deal. That is Ryan Murphy. He is the producer behind big shows like ""Dahmer"", ""American Horror Story"", ""The Watcher"". He is leaving his five year deal with Netflix and reportedly is going to Disney World. He'll be reunited with Dana Waldman. She's the co-chairman of Entertainment, close friend and confidante of Murphy.From what I've read, it's not super surprising that Murphy is reportedly going to Disney considering he has ties to that company through 20th Century Fox, FX, but it does signal to me a new era for Netflix, because Murphy was one of those creators early on who scored these big huge deals-- a reported $300 million for five years. Shonda Rhimes, another one of those-- $100 million multi-year deal as well.So you wonder if Netflix is going to continue that approach or if they're going to be a little more selective and pull back.- So that's my big question here. Would you invest in writers or actors, if you're trying to attract people to your streaming service right now, right? Because I looked it up, the reports for Adam Sandler's deal for four movies was $250 million. Obviously, Adam Sandler's huge. I was a big Adam Sandler fan when Adam Sandler made the more popular movies over 15 years ago now.I haven't loved the Netflix movies, and I would not get Netflix to watch those movies, so I don't know if that's the play versus having a writer that's going to write something like ""Dahmer"", writw one of those TV series that we talk about a lot. It seems like that makes more sense to me than just getting a big name actor.- I mean, back in-- it was three years ago when he signed the deal-- Murphy--Story continues- Five years.- Five years ago. That was like the heyday of Hollywood showrunners making tons of money. The streaming money was coming out the wazoo. We all three could have pitched a show and made some money off it--- It's sort of an arms race, really, across all the streaming services--- --Shonda Rhimes. They said Murphy. Huge guns that they brought into Netflix to sort of boost their offerings, and now it's like maybe that wasn't so worth it. Plus because there's a mixed track record there, right? Murphy and Netflix. So now he's going back to where he was very successful working with Dana Waldman, right? So we'll see if that works out. But I think you're right. I think it's the actors versus the showrunners.- Oh, no, see, I would take the-- I would take the writer.- No, that's the debate. I think it's a show runners that are the ones you want.- I think it's risky in general because just because you invest in a really popular writer, producer, actor, that doesn't necessarily mean that their content, that their shows are going to explode, and we saw that with Murphy. Really, his only two shows that took off in Netflix were ""The Watcher"" and ""Dahmer"". He had a lot of other shows-- ""Hollywood"", ""The Politician"". They just did not do that well. And ""Dahmer"", that was towards the end of his five year deal.- So was ""The Watcher"".- So was ""The Watcher"". So you have to wonder that it's more so the show and whether or not that can take off in a certain way rather than--- You were hitting on what it means for Netflix. I'm curious what it means for Disney though too when you think about would they let him write a ""Watcher"" style show or a ""Dahmer"" style show that goes on Disney plus. So then you're getting more of the adult side of Disney plus, maybe you put it in-- I'm totally spitballing here now, right? I'm going down-- down that rabbit hole but then you get more of an adult side of Disney Plus and you get the parents to actually want to use Disney plus more rather than just being mainly for your kids and for like superhero movies and stuff.You get those kind of drama TV shows--- Or Hulu, right? Like maybe--- --out on Disney plus there. You put it on Hulu. I think that'd be an interesting side that I'm not sure Disney really has as a consumer--- And real quickly here, ""Dahmer"" is going to have a season two. There's a season two iteration of that and Ryan Murphy is still going to produce that for Netflix even though he's reportedly going over to Disney. So perhaps, that's something that's worked into his contract.]"

Developments associated with Phillips 66 PSX, Ovintiv OVV and APA Corporation APA also made it to the headlines.Overall, it was a bullish seven-day period for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures increased 2.3% to close at $71.78 per barrel, while natural gas prices jumped 16.9% to end at $2.63 per million British thermal units (MMBtu).In particular, the crude price action flipped to the positive after two weeks, as signs of moderating U.S. inflation, a pause on rate hikes and China’s economic stimulus plans propped up the commodity.Meanwhile, natural gas performed even better following a lower-than-expected increase in stockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states, a hint of tightening supply and predictions of strong cooling demand.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1. U.S. oilfield service firms Patterson-UTI Energy and NexTier Oilfield Solutions last week announced a definitive agreement to combine through an all-stock deal totaling $1.9 billion.The “merger of equals” deal has been unanimously approved by both companies’ boards, though it is still subject to clearance by their shareholders and regulators. The transaction is expected to close by the end of this year. The current stockholders of Patterson-UTI Energy will own approximately 55% of the combined company, with NEX shareholders owning the rest. The combined company will operate under the Patterson-UTI Energy name and trade under the ‘PTEN’ ticker, while its well completions brand will be called NexTier.The merged firm is expected to generate some $200 million worth of annual cost savings and operational synergies within a year and a half of closing. Investors should know that Patterson-UTI possesses the second-largest onshore drilling rig fleet in the United States, while NexTier has been boosting its fracking expertise over the last few years by way of inorganic growth. It’s worth mentioning that almost two-thirds of this newly combined fleet will be dual-fuel in nature — capable of running on both diesel and natural gas to enhance efficiency and reduce carbon emissions. (Patterson-UTI, NexTier Combine to Create Oil Services Giant)2. Phillips 66 has completed the acquisition of all publicly held common units in DCP Midstream for $3.8 billion. As of Jun 15, DCP Midstream’s common units are no longer listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The acquisition will double the refining giant’s stake in DCP Midstream to 86.8%.DCP Midstream’s assets gather, process and transport natural gas and natural gas liquids from the major U.S. shale plays, including the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford, the Ardmore and Anadarko Basins in Oklahoma and the Denver-Julesburg Basin in Colorado.Phillips 66 focuses more on midstream, renewables and chemical operations, making its business model more stable. The acquisition provides Phillips 66 with natural gas processing in important regions, increased fractionation capacity and long-haul pipelines appearing from the Denver-Julesburg and Permian basins. Owning those assets offers Phillips 66 enhanced flexibility. (Phillips 66 Acquires All Public DCP Midstream Units)3.  Upstream operator Ovintiv made significant updates to its production and capital spending guidance for the second quarter of 2023 and the full year. These revisions are a result of the timely closure of the $4.275 billion acquisition of core Midland Basin assets and the $875 million sale of Bakken shale assets. Ovintiv's revised projections emphasize its commitment to delivering exceptional results that align with its position as an industry leader.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company expects total production of 520,000-540,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/day) in the second quarter of 2023. It also anticipates oil and condensate output in the range of 175,000-179,000 barrels per day (bbl/day), and capital spending in the band of $670-$710 million during the same time frame.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Ovintiv has also updated its full-year production and capital spending guidance to reflect the evolving market conditions. The company now expects production in the range of 521,000-546,000 boe/day. The oil and condensate output is estimated between 186,000 bbl/day and 196,000 bbl/day. Ovintiv now projects capital expenditure of $2.68-$2.98 billion. (Ovintiv Revises Guidance for Q2 and Full-Year 2023)4.   APA Corporation’s subsidiary Apache announced that it is set to cease North Sea drilling and reduce its British workforce because high taxes have made operations less competitive in the U.K. However, the U.S. oil and gas finder did not disclose the number of jobs that will be lost as a result of this move.The U.K. imposed a windfall profit tax on oil and gas companies in May 2022. In November, U.K. prime minister, Rishi Sunak, doubled the tax to 35%, making the sector's overall tax rate one of the highest in the world at 75%. Profits from oil and gas extraction in the U.K. are subject to the tax until March 2028.Producers in the North Sea have requested the government to amend the Energy Profits Levy to include an oil price floor because it might jeopardize investment and reduce output at a time when Britain is trying to increase domestic production. (APA's Unit Ceases Drilling &amp; Cuts Jobs in UK Due to High Taxes)Story continuesPrice PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of some major oil and gas players over the past week and during the last six months.Company    Last Week    Last 6 MonthsXOM                  -2.1%                -3.7%CVX                   -1%                   -8.9%COP                  +1%                   -6.9%OXY                    -2%                   -6.8%SLB                   +0.5%                -7.7%RIG                    -0.2%                +40%VLO                   +0.7%                -6.3%MPC                   +0.2%               +0.3%With oil and gas both moving up for the week, stocks were mostly positive. The Energy Select Sector SPDR — a popular way to track energy companies — edged down 0.6% last week. Over the past six months, the sector tracker has decreased 9.3%.What’s Next in the Energy World?As usual, market participants will closely track the regular releases to look for guidance on the direction of the commodities. In this context, the U.S. Government’s statistics on oil and natural gas — one of the few solid indicators that come out regularly — will be on energy traders' radar. Data on rig count from the oilfield service firm Baker Hughes, which is a pointer to the trends in U.S. crude/natural gas production, is closely followed too.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.TJX (TJX) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this parent of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and other stores is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for TJX is 7.9%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 14.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 10.8%.Cash Flow GrowthCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for TJX is 8.2%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 3.3%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 7.3% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 5.4%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for TJX. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.1% over the past month.Bottom LineTJX has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination positions TJX well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The approval converts BLINCYTO's accelerated approval to a full approval.""We are pleased the FDA has granted full approval for BLINCYTO, the first FDA-approved CD19-directed CD3 T-cell engager BiTE® immunotherapy and the first to be FDA-approved for MRD in 2018,"" said David M. Reese, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. ""Today's full approval underscores the clinical benefit of BLINCYTO for people living with B-ALL, and we look forward to exploring how we can continue to make a significant impact for these patients.""Amgen continues to advance a robust development program for BLINCYTO, including studies aimed at treating patients with MRD-negative B-ALL, trials designed to minimize chemotherapy, and the clinical investigation of a subcutaneous formulation, all intended to help address remaining unmet needs for patients.""In a Phase 2 study, roughly 80% of adult patients treated with blinatumomab experienced a complete MRD response,"" said principal investigator Elias Jabbour, M.D., Department of Leukemia, Division of Cancer Medicine at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. ""The FDA's decision to grant a full approval for blinatumomab further validates the use of this therapy to treat adults and children with B-cell precursor ALL with MRD present following a remission, which is a strong predictor of relapse in this patient population.""Story continuesAbout BLINCYTO® (blinatumomab)BLINCYTO is a BiTE® (bispecific T-cell engager) immuno-oncology therapy that targets CD19 surface antigens on B cells. BiTE molecules fight cancer by helping the body's immune system detect and target malignant cells by engaging T cells (a type of white blood cell capable of killing other cells perceived as threats) to cancer cells. By bringing T cells near cancer cells, the T cells can inject toxins and trigger cancer cell death (apoptosis). BiTE immuno-oncology therapies are currently being investigated for their potential to treat a wide variety of cancers.BLINCYTO was granted breakthrough therapy and priority review designations by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of:CD19-positive B-cell precursor ALL in first or second complete remission with minimal residual disease (MRD) greater than or equal to 0.1% in adults and pediatric patients.relapsed or refractory CD19-positive B-cell precursor ALL in adults and pediatric patients.In the European Union (EU), BLINCYTO is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of:adults with Philadelphia chromosome-negative CD19 positive relapsed or refractory B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).adults with Philadelphia chromosome-negative CD19 positive B-precursor ALL in first or second complete remission with minimal residual disease (MRD) greater than or equal to 0.1%.pediatric patients aged 1 year or older with Philadelphia chromosome negative CD19 positive B-precursor ALL which is refractory or in relapse after receiving at least two prior therapies or in relapse after receiving prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONWARNING: CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME and NEUROLOGICAL TOXICITIESCytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), which may be life-threatening or fatal, occurred in patients receiving BLINCYTO®. Interrupt or discontinue BLINCYTO® and treat with corticosteroids as recommended.Neurological toxicities, which may be severe, life-threatening or fatal, occurred in patients receiving BLINCYTO®. Interrupt or discontinue BLINCYTO® as recommended.ContraindicationsBLINCYTO® is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to blinatumomab or to any component of the product formulation.Warnings and PrecautionsCytokine Release Syndrome (CRS): CRS, which may be life-threatening or fatal, occurred in 15% of patients with R/R ALL and in 7% of patients with MRD-positive ALL. The median time to onset of CRS is 2 days after the start of infusion and the median time to resolution of CRS was 5 days among cases that resolved. Closely monitor and advise patients to contact their healthcare professional for signs and symptoms of serious adverse events such as fever, headache, nausea, asthenia, hypotension, increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), increased total bilirubin (TBILI), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The manifestations of CRS after treatment with BLINCYTO® overlap with those of infusion reactions, capillary leak syndrome, and hemophagocytic histiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome. If severe CRS occurs, interrupt BLINCYTO® until CRS resolves. Discontinue BLINCYTO® permanently if life-threatening CRS occurs. Administer corticosteroids for severe or life-threatening CRS.Neurological Toxicities: Approximately 65% of patients receiving BLINCYTO® in clinical trials experienced neurological toxicities. The median time to the first event was within the first 2 weeks of BLINCYTO® treatment and the majority of events resolved. The most common (≥ 10%) manifestations of neurological toxicity were headache and tremor. Severe, life-threatening, or fatal neurological toxicities occurred in approximately 13% of patients, including encephalopathy, convulsions, speech disorders, disturbances in consciousness, confusion and disorientation, and coordination and balance disorders. Manifestations of neurological toxicity included cranial nerve disorders. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms and interrupt or discontinue BLINCYTO® as outlined in the PI.Infections: Approximately 25% of patients receiving BLINCYTO® in clinical trials experienced serious infections such as sepsis, pneumonia, bacteremia, opportunistic infections, and catheter-site infections, some of which were life-threatening or fatal. Administer prophylactic antibiotics and employ surveillance testing as appropriate during treatment. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of infection and treat appropriately, including interruption or discontinuation of BLINCYTO® as needed.Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS), which may be life-threatening or fatal, has been observed. Preventive measures, including pretreatment nontoxic cytoreduction and on-treatment hydration, should be used during BLINCYTO® treatment. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of TLS and interrupt or discontinue BLINCYTO® as needed to manage these events.Neutropenia and Febrile Neutropenia, including life-threatening cases, have been observed. Monitor appropriate laboratory parameters (including, but not limited to, white blood cell count and absolute neutrophil count) during BLINCYTO® infusion and interrupt BLINCYTO® if prolonged neutropenia occurs.Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines: Due to the possibility of neurological events, including seizures, patients receiving BLINCYTO® are at risk for loss of consciousness, and should be advised against driving and engaging in hazardous occupations or activities such as operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery while BLINCYTO® is being administered.Elevated Liver Enzymes: Transient elevations in liver enzymes have been associated with BLINCYTO® treatment with a median time to onset of 3 days. In patients receiving BLINCYTO®, although the majority of these events were observed in the setting of CRS, some cases of elevated liver enzymes were observed outside the setting of CRS, with a median time to onset of 19 days. Grade 3 or greater elevations in liver enzymes occurred in approximately 7% of patients outside the setting of CRS and resulted in treatment discontinuation in less than 1% of patients. Monitor ALT, AST, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and TBILI prior to the start of and during BLINCYTO® treatment. BLINCYTO® treatment should be interrupted if transaminases rise to &gt; 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or if TBILI rises to &gt; 3 times ULN.Pancreatitis: Fatal pancreatitis has been reported in patients receiving BLINCYTO® in combination with dexamethasone in clinical trials and the post-marketing setting. Evaluate patients who develop signs and symptoms of pancreatitis and interrupt or discontinue BLINCYTO® and dexamethasone as needed.Leukoencephalopathy: Although the clinical significance is unknown, cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes showing leukoencephalopathy have been observed in patients receiving BLINCYTO®, especially in patients previously treated with cranial irradiation and antileukemic chemotherapy.Preparation and administration errors have occurred with BLINCYTO® treatment. Follow instructions for preparation (including admixing) and administration in the PI strictly to minimize medication errors (including underdose and overdose).Immunization: Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least 2 weeks prior to the start of BLINCYTO® treatment, during treatment, and until immune recovery following last cycle of BLINCYTO®Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity in Neonates: Serious adverse reactions, including fatal reactions and the ""gasping syndrome,"" have been reported in very low birth weight (VLBW) neonates born weighing less than 1500 g, and early preterm neonates (infants born less than 34 weeks gestational age) who received intravenous drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. Early preterm VLBW neonates may be more likely to develop these reactions, because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol.Use the preservative-free preparations of BLINCYTO® where possible in neonates. When prescribing BLINCYTO® (with preservative) for neonatal patients, consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including BLINCYTO® (with preservative), other products containing benzyl alcohol or other excipients (e.g., ethanol, propylene glycol) which compete with benzyl alcohol for the same metabolic pathway.Monitor neonatal patients receiving BLINCYTO® (with preservative) for new or worsening metabolic acidosis. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which serious adverse reactions may occur in neonates is not known. The BLINCYTO® 7-Day bag (with preservative) contains 7.4 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL.Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Based on its mechanism of action, BLINCYTO® may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with BLINCYTO® and for 48 hours after the last dose.Adverse ReactionsThe most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) are pyrexia, infusion-related reactions, infections (pathogen unspecified), headache, neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.Dosage and Administration GuidelinesBLINCYTO® is administered as a continuous intravenous infusion at a constant flow rate using an infusion pump which should be programmable, lockable, non-elastomeric, and have an alarm.It is very important that the instructions for preparation (including admixing) and administration provided in the full Prescribing Information are strictly followed to minimize medication errors (including underdose and overdose).Please see BLINCYTO® full Prescribing Information, including BOXED WARNINGS, at www.BLINCYTO.com.About BiTE® TechnologyBiTE® (bispecific T-cell engager) technology is a targeted immuno-oncology platform that is designed to engage patient's own T cells to any tumor-specific antigen, activating the cytotoxic potential of T cells to eliminate detectable cancer.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company (including BeiGene, Ltd., Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd., or any collaboration to manufacture therapeutic antibodies against COVID-19), the performance of Otezla® (apremilast) (including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion), the Five Prime Therapeutics, Inc. acquisition, the Teneobio, Inc. acquisition, the ChemoCentryx, Inc. acquisition, or the proposed acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics plc, as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business and operations may be negatively affected by the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving our environmental, social and governance objectives. The effects of global climate change and related natural disasters could negatively affect our business and operations. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.Any scientific information discussed in this news release relating to new indications for our products is preliminary and investigative and is not part of the labeling approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the products. The products are not approved for the investigational use(s) discussed in this news release, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or effectiveness of the products for these uses.CONTACT: Amgen, Thousand Oaks Michael Strapazon, 805-313-5553 (media)Jessica Akopyan, 805-440-5721 (media) Arvind Sood, 805-447-1060 (investors)Amgen Logo.

The company intends to prioritize other value-accretive opportunities and maintain a disciplined capital allocation strategy.The deferral of the Yanacocha Sulfides project is the first step in Newmont's plan to achieve at least $2 billion in near-term cash flow improvements within the first two years as it evaluates opportunities to re-sequence project capital and optimize its combined portfolio.The deferral of the investment decision will result in a reduction of development capital expenditures, including roughly $300 million, which was part of Newmont's outlook for 2024.The company's proposed acquisition of Newcrest will create a leading portfolio of Tier 1 operations and enhance its pipeline of value-accretive projects. The company aims to build a more profitable and resilient future by strategically reevaluating and rationalizing its project portfolio.Newmont remains committed to its long-term strategy and the Yanacocha mine, which has the potential to operate as a Tier 1 gold and copper mine for several decades.

Featuring the market performance of 500 of the largest companies listed on stock exchanges in the U.S., you’re dealing with proven winners. To be fair, you might not receive a blistering performance. At the same time, these ideas are less likely to leave you stranded on the road.In addition, ChatGPT points out that the best S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy offer diversification. Specifically, by acquiring undervalued securities within the index, investors can potentially benefit from the performance of a diverse range of companies and industries, mitigating risks associated with individual stocks or sectors.As well, the artificial intelligence-powered chatbot mentions the potential for reversion to fair value as a benefit for cheap S&amp;P 500 stocks. Basically, enterprises that are undervalued now may carry the potential to their fair value over time. As market inefficiencies correct themselves, undervalued stocks can experience price appreciation as the market recognizes their true worth. So, if you’re ready to start winning consistently, these may be the best S&amp;P 500 stocks for June.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsADMArcher Daniels Midland$74.56CFCF Industries$70.08BIIBBiogen$297.83SNASnap-On$274.27MPCMarathon Petroleum$113.83VLOValero Energy$114.03GDGeneral Dynamics4214.96Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comAn American multinational food processing and commodities trading corporation, Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) makes an excellent case for undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy. Fundamentally, no matter how advanced we become as a civilization, certain things will never change. Of course, the most critical is our need for nutritional sustenance. Thus, long-term investors may treat ADM’s loss of over 18% this year as irrationality.Story continuesNo matter, when the market is giving you one of the best S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy at a discount, you take it. Over the trailing one-year period, ADM slipped over 11%, which seems like overkill given the underlying relevance. More importantly, the market prices ADM at a forward multiple of only 10.55. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than 81.7% of the competition.It’s no slouch on the operational metrics either. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 16.4% (on a per-share basis), above 76.8% of its peers. Also, its Piotroski F-Score comes in at 7 out of 9, indicating solid operational efficiency. Thus, it’s easily one of the S&amp;P 500 stocks for June.CF Industries (CF)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Headquartered in Deerfield, Illinois, CF Industries (NYSE:CF) is an American manufacturer and distributor of agricultural fertilizers, including ammonia, urea, and ammonium nitrate products. Given the geopolitical flashpoint in Eastern Europe and implications for the global food supply chain, agricultural entities such as CF command extraordinary relevance. However, exposure to geopolitics has many investors worried, with CF shedding over 17% since the Jan. opener.Nevertheless, those with a patient view might consider the agro firm as one of the undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks. True, the present circumstances don’t seem enticing at all. Plus, in the past 365 days, CF stock gave up more than 26% of market value. Still, at some point, circumstances will eventually normalize. Plus, the red ink presents much food for thought.Mainly, the market now prices CF at a trailing multiple of 4.53. As a discount to earnings, CF ranks better than 90.61% of its peers. Also, shares now trade at a price-earnings-growth ratio of 0.12. In contrast, the sector median value stands at a loftier 0.72 times. Therefore, it’s worth consideration as one of the cheap S&amp;P 500 stocks.Biogen (BIIB)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comBased in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) is a multinational biotechnology firm specializing in the discovery, development, and delivery of therapies for the treatment of neurological diseases to patients worldwide. Thanks to its permanently relevant business, BIIB ranks among the best S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy. Since the Jan. opener, shares popped just over 10%.Despite its performance in the charts, however, BIIB also ranks among the undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks. At the moment, the market prices shares at a trailing multiple of 13.93. As a discount to earnings, Biogen ranks better than 72.7% of companies listed in the drug manufacturing industry. Also, BIIB trades at 0.95 times the projected free cash flow. In contrast, the underlying sector median value is 1.58 times.Just as well, the company benefits from excellent profitability metrics. For example, its trailing-year net margin clocks in at 31%, outflanking 95.87% of its rivals. With a Piotroski F-Score of 7 out of 9, Biogen delivers an operationally efficient business. Thus, it’s a solid candidate for S&amp;P 500 stocks with upside.Snap-on (SNA)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Best Speculative StocksSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comHailing from Kenosha, Wisconsin, Snap-on (NYSE:SNA) is an American designer, manufacturer, and marketer of high-end tools and equipment for professional use in the transportation industry. This includes solutions for automotive, heavy-duty, equipment, marine, aviation, and railroad industries. To be fair, SNA is one of the boring entities among undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks. Still, that shouldn’t be confused with underperforming.Since the beginning of this year, SNA gained over 18% of its equity value. In the trailing one-year period, it popped up over 33%. Thanks to its everyday relevance, Snap-on offers resilience and predictability for its stakeholders. Despite the robust gains, however, SNA offers a discount for those seeking S&amp;P 500 stocks for June.Notably, the market prices SNA at a forward multiple of 15.86. As a discount to projected earnings, Snap-on ranks better than 62.4% of companies listed in the industrial products sector. Also, SNA trades at 0.8 times discounted cash flow, ranking better than 60.2% of the competition.Marathon Petroleum (MPC)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Findlay, Ohio, Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) is a petroleum refining, marketing, and transportation firm. Mostly specializing in the downstream and midstream components of the hydrocarbon energy value chain, MPC could benefit from rising relevancies. As society continues to normalize, traffic volume should rise. On paper, this framework should benefit MPC.So far, though, the market doesn’t really seem to appreciate this thesis. Since the Jan. opener, MPC gained less than 1%. Nevertheless, this lack of mobility in the charts might make MPC one of the undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks. Significantly, the market prices Marathon shares at a forward multiple of 6.08. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than nearly 63% of its oil and gas peers.Also, MPC trades at 0.32 times sales. In contrast, the sector median stands at 0.91 times. That’s noteworthy because Marathon’s three-year revenue growth rate clocks in at 27.1%, above 80.28% of its rivals. As well, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period pings at 60.9%. Thus, it’s a great idea for cheap S&amp;P 500 stocks with upside potential.Valero Energy (VLO)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comA downstream petroleum specialist, Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) mostly focuses on manufacturing and marketing transportation fuels. As well, it produces other petrochemical products and power. As with Marathon Petroleum above, Valero should benefit from rising social normalization trends. However, the market has a dim view of VLO, with shares fading nearly 7%. Over the trailing one-year period, it’s down almost 13%.Still, the red ink might make Valero one of the compelling undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy. On the valuation front, the market prices VLO at a forward multiple of 5.26. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than 71.08% of its oil and gas compatriots. Also, shares trade at 0.25 times sales. In contrast, the sector median again stands at 0.91 times.Nevertheless, Valero performs very well on the operational side. Its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 19.4%, above nearly 70% of its peers. Also, its Piotroski F-Score lands at a perfect 9 out of 9, indicating superior operational efficiency. Combined with an Altman Z-Score of 5.77 (indicating low bankruptcy risk), VLO makes a strong case for the best S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy.General Dynamics (GD)image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocksSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.comAlthough a bit on the controversial side for some investors for its aerospace and defense business, General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) technically meets the qualifications for undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks. Despite its relevant business profile – and gaining relevance, unfortunately – the market doesn’t believe in GD stock. Since the start of the year, shares tumbled nearly 15%. Over the past 365 days, GD is almost 3% below parity.Nevertheless, rising instability in the geopolitical realm could see demand for General Dynamics rise. In the meantime, the market prices GD at a forward multiple of 16.82. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than 66.67% of enterprises in the aerospace and defense industry. Also, GD trades hands at 14.43 times operating cash flow. In contrast, the sector median stat is 18.89 times.Aside from its value proposition, General Dynamics enjoys strong profitability metrics. Its trailing-year net margin clocks in at 8.5%, above 70.76% of its peers. Also, it’s worth mentioning that its Piotroski F-Score lands at 7 out of 9, indicating decent operational efficiency. Overall, then, it makes a solid case for S&amp;P 500 stocks for June.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

""In the next five years, our plan will generate excess cash that will exceed our current market capitalization and deliver tremendous value for our shareholders.""""We are better positioned than ever before to capitalize on NRG’s market leadership in energy and the relationships we have built with millions of customers,"" said Lawrence Coben, Chair of the NRG Board of Directors. ""We fully support Mauricio and the management team and are confident in our strategy and ability to deliver superior, sustainable shareholder value.""Highlights from today’s presentation include:Expanding outlook of robust and sustainable cash flows: NRG expects free cash flow before growth (FCFbG) per share to increase approximately 15% to 20% on a compounded annual basis between 2023 and 2027. This equates to $8.3 billion of cumulative excess cash after deleveraging – exceeding NRG’s current market cap.Story continuesGreater capital return to shareholders: With the acquisition of Vivint Smart Home complete, NRG now has line of sight into the investment needs of the Company going forward. Accordingly, NRG has updated its capital allocation framework and plans to, after deleveraging, return 80% of excess cash to shareholders and invest 20% in growth initiatives; this compares to the Company’s prior 50% / 50% allocation. As a result of the expected cash flow generation, the Company expects $6.9 billion of cumulative capital returns to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends through 2027. The Company’s Board of Directors has increased the share repurchase authorization from $1.0 billion to $2.7 billion through 2025. NRG expects 7% to 9% long-term annual dividend per share growth.Strengthening the Company’s balance sheet: In addition to significant capital returns to shareholders, NRG expects to complete up to $2.55 billion of debt reduction to enable NRG to achieve its target investment grade credit metrics of 2.5x to 2.75x net debt / adjusted corporate EBITDA by 2025, aligning with rating agency and counterparty expectations.Enhanced efficiency through cost savings: Reflecting management’s ongoing focus on cost discipline and operational excellence, the Company is announcing a new $150 million cost reduction initiative that is expected to be completed by 2025, derived from operations and maintenance efficiencies, sourcing optimization, automation, service levels, spans of control and other redundancies. These savings are in addition to $300 million in Direct Energy cost synergies that are expected to be completed by the end of 2023 and $100 million in cost synergies related to the Vivint acquisition that are expected to be completed by 2025.Consumer services model enhanced by leading smart home platform: NRG has grown to become the largest retail power provider and the second largest retail natural gas provider in the United States. With the recently completed acquisition of Vivint Smart Home, NRG has positioned itself to fully capitalize on its market leadership and approximately 7.5 million residential customer base. The enhanced consumer services platform is creating new, high margin recurring revenue streams and extending customer tenure and reach. Through a combination of cross-selling, bundling and organic growth, NRG expects to achieve $300 million of incremental free cash flow before growth by 2025.Governance UpdateNRG is working with an independent search firm and evaluating feedback from NRG shareholders to bring additional expertise to the Board. This is part of an ongoing, deliberate process to evolve board composition with a focus on diverse skills and experiences in alignment with the Company’s strategy.Investor Day Webcast DetailsAs previously announced, NRG’s Investor Day begins at 9:00 am Eastern Time.

AGR have mutually agreed to revise their merger agreement and extend it to Dec 31, 2023. If both companies agree, the deal may be extended by another three months. While the merger is likely to create a very strong clean-energy company, the ongoing delay can lower the desired returns for the companies.Background of the MergerInitially announced in October 2020, the merger was expected to get completed in the fourth quarter of 2021, subject to approval by the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission (“NMPRC”). However, following rejection by NMPRC, the companies filed an appeal to the New Mexico Supreme Court against the regulatory authority’s decision.In March 2023, PNM Resources, AVANGRID and NMPRC filed a combined request before the New Mexico Supreme Court to reject the companies' appeal related to the December 2021 NMPRC refusal and return the case to NMPRC.However, on May 15, 2023, the court denied the request and scheduled oral arguments on the appeal for Sep 12, 2023.Merger CommitmentBoth PNM and AGR are committed toward the merger, which will provide benefit of more than $300 million to New Mexico consumers and communities. It will also offer rate relief of more than $16 million to Texas customers.The companies can accelerate clean energy development in Texas and New Mexico, and lay further emphasis on consumer reliability and resiliency.Motive Behind the MovePNM Resources’ long-standing expertise in fulfilling environmental regulations and its focus on developing cost-effective generation units provide reliable and affordable power to customers. The acquisition will aid AVANGRID’s expansion of renewables business in the Southwest. Also, the scope and diversity of the combined business will augment its ability to invest in energy efficiency and new technologies.The combined entity will have an improved credit profile, greater financial flexibility and lower cost of capital. The deal will create a leading U.S. regulated utility and renewable energy platform, which seems lucrative to both companies.Story continuesFocus on Renewable EnergyPNM Resources and AVANGRID are both committed in lowering emission and add more renewable sources in generation portfolio. Along with PNM and AGR, some other electric power industry companies like Dominion Energy, Inc. D and NextEra Energy, Inc. NEE are adopting measures to meet clean-energy targets.Dominion Energy aims to cut emissions by 70-80% by 2035 from the level of 2005. By 2035, Dominion Energy also intends to make zero- and low-emitting resources accountable for 99% of the company’s electric generation. The company is working on offshore wind projects, battery storage projects and hydropower projects to lower emissions.D’s long-term (three- to-five year) earnings growth rate is pegged at 20%. It had delivered average earnings surprise of 1.7% in the last four quarters.NextEra Energy is aiming to reduce total carbon emissions by 67% within 2025 from 2005 base. It continues to work on its strategy of making a long-term investment in clean-energy assets. The company expects to be able to add 33-42 gigawatts of new renewables in the 2023-2026 period to the generation portfolio via clean-energy investments.NEE’s long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 8.38%.

Now I'd like to hand the call over to Don Zurbay.Story continuesDonald J. ZurbayThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Patterson had an exceptionally strong fourth quarter, including a fiscal year in which we achieved our financial goals and delivered value for our customers and shareholders. On the top line, year-over-year internal sales increased approximately 6% during the fourth quarter and increased nearly 3% for the fiscal year including sales growth across both the Dental and Animal Health segments. We delivered year-over-year adjusted operating margin expansion in both of our business segments and for Patterson overall achieving adjusted operating margin of nearly 7% for the fourth quarter and approximately 5% for the fiscal year. Our strong performance enabled us to return $157 million to shareholders during fiscal '23 in the form of cash dividends and share repurchases. And we delivered fiscal '23 adjusted EPS growth of 7% year-over-year, culminated by a record fourth quarter of $0.84 per diluted share, an 18% increase compared to the prior year. These results are a clear demonstration that our value proposition continues to resonate with customers, progress we are making to drive margin improvement and outstanding execution against our strategic plan. I'm proud of the entire Patterson team and grateful for their continued hard work and dedication. Before we jump into the details of the quarter, I'd like to take a step back to put our results in context. Our strong performance during the fourth quarter and throughout fiscal '23 as a continuation of the momentum we have been building for several years. I joined Patterson 5 years ago during the early months of fiscal 2019. At that time, Patterson was experiencing challenges that were reflected in several areas, including the company's financial results. In my previous role as CFO, I worked closely with the rest of our leadership team to develop a strategy to change the trajectory of the business, accelerate our performance and position Patterson for sustainable, long-term value creation. Thanks to the focused efforts of the entire Patterson team, I believe we have more than delivered on these objectives. During the period from fiscal '19 to fiscal '23, we have increased reported net sales by $1 billion with average annual internal sales growth of 5%, increased our adjusted operating margin from 3.7% for fiscal '19 to 4.9% in fiscal '23, with an average annual improvement of 30 basis points. And we increased our adjusted EPS for $1.40 for fiscal '19 to $2.42 per diluted share in fiscal '23, with an average annual improvement of 15%. Our strong and continually improving year-over-year financial results is clear evidence that our strategy is working. And the numbers are particularly impressive, given the past 5 years include the historic challenges posed by the pandemic and other macroeconomic factors. The key takeaway is that we have a great foundation to build from and a proven track record of success. And with the combination of our culture, strategy and people, I am confident we will continue to drive improved performance over time. Now I'll provide some more detail on the growth drivers in each of our segments during the fiscal fourth quarter before sharing some perspective on the path ahead. Let's start with Dental. In the fourth quarter, Dental segment internal sales increased 8% year-over-year, including growth across our consumables, equipment and value-added service categories. We also achieved year-over-year operating margin expansion in the fourth quarter and for the full fiscal year. A few specific highlights from our Dental segment. First, equipment sales were up 19% in the fourth quarter on a tough prior year comparison, driven by strength across all equipment categories. As we've discussed previously, our quarterly equipment results can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter due to factors that influence the timing of sales. But when you widen the lens, the long-term trend of our equipment sales performance provides a clear view of our strength in this category. Over the last 8 quarters, our average quarterly equipment internal sales growth is 8%. Evidence that our dental customers are investing in their practices and a testament to our value proposition and market-leading capability to sell, finance, install and service new technology innovation. Second, our consumables portfolio of non-infection control products continued to perform well with over 4% internal sales growth. Within our infection control product portfolio, we are still experiencing a deflationary impact for certain products compared to the year ago period. While this impact is moderating, we expect this trend to persist into fiscal '24 and stabilize in the second half of the year. And third, our value-added service category achieved double-digit internal sales growth during the fourth quarter primarily due to strong performance in technical service, software and e-services. Value-added services represents a comprehensive suite of offerings we provide to our customers that makes us an indispensable partner to their practice. These offerings are central to our value proposition, create sticky customer relationships and enhance profitability. A comprehensive suite of software and e-services products include on-premise and cloud-based solutions that handle everything from revenue cycle management to practice analytics and insights and patient communication. These products truly are the nerve center of dental practice to help our customers operate efficiently, scale their business, and provide a better patient experience. Software and e-services are a key part of our strategy going forward, and we will expand our investment in this area to ensure Patterson remains the partner of choice for dentists looking to modernize their practices. Additionally, our leading technical service offering both contributes to and benefits from our strong equipment sales and allows us to serve our customers at a higher level. We believe our technical service offering is a competitive advantage for us as our customers turn to and trust Patterson for ensuring their equipment is delivering for their practice. Looking ahead, the dental market remains healthy, and we are confident that our Dental business will continue to benefit from strong fundamentals, including an aging population, demand for practice modernization, a growing appreciation for oral health as a key link to overall health, and consistently strong traffic following a rebound from pandemic levels. I'm proud of the Dental team's execution and commitment to serving our customers. Let's now turn to Animal Health. During the fourth quarter of fiscal '23, our internal sales increased 3% year-over-year, driven primarily by sales growth in the companion animal business. The Animal Health segment also achieved operating margin expansion in both the fourth quarter and for the full fiscal year. In Companion, our internal sales in the fourth quarter increased by mid-single digits as we continued to outperform a healthy and growing market. This sustained growth demonstrates the successful continued execution of our plan, including excellent performance from our internal and external sales teams, operational discipline and our value-added consultative approach. On the production animal side, fourth quarter internal sales decreased nearly 1% year-over-year from the impact of certain market headwinds and including the drought impact on (inaudible) and antibiotic pricing pressure that we've discussed previously. Despite these challenges, Patterson delivered low single-digit internal sales growth for the full fiscal year as we benefited from the depth of our offerings and omnichannel presence. Patterson is well-positioned to navigate different market cycles because of our comprehensive solutions for diverse customers across a wide range of animal species. Across the Animal Health segment, our value-added services category delivered double-digit growth during the fourth quarter and for the full fiscal year. Largely attributed to strong sales of our software solutions and equipment service. Similar to our Dental business, we offer a robust software portfolio to our veterinary customers and provides them with critical infrastructure to manage and execute their daily workflows. We remain focused on positioning Patterson Animal Health who is the leading provider of technology, software, data insights, services and products to the animal health industry. As we enter fiscal 2024 with momentum across the business, I want to take a few minutes to touch on our key areas of focus going forward. We continue to execute and refine our overall strategy, which is designed to achieve 4 core objectives. First, drive revenue growth above the current end market growth rates. Second, build upon the progress we've made to enhance our margin performance. Third, continually evolve our products, channels and services to best serve the customers in our end markets. And fourth, improve efficiency and optimization. This objective includes a rigorous focus on cost discipline as well as targeted investments to leverage best practices and advance operational excellence across the entire enterprise. Patterson is well-positioned to achieve these objectives, and our team is aligned around several initiatives that build upon our momentum and advance our strategic goals. I'd like to highlight a few of the key areas of focus in the year ahead which includes expanding our investments in strategic growth opportunities like software and value-added services. There has been a growing demand among our customers and vendors for tightly integrated software technology and actionable data and insights to drive top and bottom line growth and compete more effectively. As we've discussed today, Patterson already offers a robust suite of software solutions in both our Dental and Animal Health segments. But we believe the opportunity for growth within software remains significant. As we move forward, we are expanding our investment in our existing solutions to better leverage our strong foundation and to our capabilities and address evolving customer preferences. Beyond software, we are also focused on expanding our value-added services more broadly. Customers are increasingly turning to partners like Patterson to address their central business needs and ease their administrative burden. Value-added services have been an important and differentiating category at Patterson for some time. However, I believe we can achieve more in this area, and it will remain a top priority. Importantly, our comprehensive value-added services offerings are central to the value proposition of our core distribution categories and drive sales across consumables and equipment. While we expand investments in key areas, we are also focusing on adapting our business to meet evolving industry dynamics. As our customers' needs change, we will adapt to meet them where they are and exceed their expectations including a continued focus on product and channel optimization to ensure our go-to-market approach is designed to best serve and strengthen the people who keep us and our animals healthy. To meet these changing expectations, we must also be willing to drive greater efficiencies within all areas of our organization. Across the business, we are committed to expanding our best practices, managing our expenses, and leveraging common platforms and eliminating redundancies. Taken together, our strategic areas of focus build upon our strong foundation and success over the past several years to further distinguish our market position and drive enhanced growth, profitability to value creation over the long-term. Our strategy is reflected in the fiscal '24 adjusted earnings guidance range of $2.45 to $2.55 per diluted share that we initiated today. This guidance accounts for our plans to invest behind strategic growth opportunities as well as our commitment to deliver year-over-year internal sales growth and adjusted operating margin expansion for the total company and across both our Dental and Animal Health segments. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin Barry to provide more detail on our financial results.Kevin BarryThank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. In my prepared remarks, I will cover the financial results for our fourth quarter of fiscal '23, which ended on April 29, 2023, as well as our full year results for fiscal '23. I will also discuss our fiscal '24 earnings guidance we issued this morning along with several modeling assumptions related to the financial outlook for the next fiscal year. Consolidated reported sales for Patterson Companies in our fiscal '23 fourth quarter were $1.7 billion, an increase of 5.0% versus the fourth quarter 1 year ago. Internal sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal '23, which are adjusted for the effects of currency translation and contributions from recent acquisitions increased 5.7% compared to the same period last fiscal year. For the full year of fiscal '23, Consolidated reported sales for Patterson Companies were $6.5 billion, a decrease of 0.4% versus the same period 1 year ago. Internal sales for fiscal '23, which are adjusted for the effects of currency translation, contributions from recent acquisitions, and the extra week of selling results in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 2.9% compared to fiscal 2022. Our fourth quarter fiscal '23 gross margin was 22.6% and an increase of 140 basis points compared to the prior year. Our gross margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 was negatively impacted by 10 basis points by the mark-to-market accounting adjustment from rising interest rates on our equipment financing portfolio. Any positive or negative impact related to our equipment financing portfolio is nearly offset by our corresponding hedging instrument which is reflected in the interest and other expense line on our P&amp;L. So the net result has a minimal impact on our adjusted earnings per share. If you recall, this dynamic also occurred in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year when the negative impact of the mark-to-market accounting calculation was 50 basis points. When normalizing for market-to-market accounting adjustments in both periods, our gross margin rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 is 100 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of fiscal '22. Remember, the accounting impact of the mark-to-market adjustment impacts our total company gross margin, but not the gross margin within our business segment. For the full year of fiscal '23, our adjusted gross margin was 21.2%, an improvement of 138 basis points compared to the full year of fiscal [2022]. Normalizing for the impact of the mark-to-market accounting adjustment to the equipment financing portfolio in both periods resulted in a 50 basis points improvement in our gross margin in fiscal '23 compared to fiscal '22.Importantly, during the fiscal fourth quarter and for the entire fiscal '23 year, each of our business units posted a year-over-year increase to their respective gross margins versus the prior year period. Across the company, we continue to focus on pricing and cost execution and improving our mix by driving higher growth of margin-accretive product categories. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 were 16.0% and favorable by 26 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '22. For the full year of fiscal 2023, adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were 16.4% and slightly unfavorable to the prior year by 15 basis points compared to fiscal '22. In the fourth quarter of fiscal '23, our consolidated adjusted operating margin was 6.7%, an increase of 166 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year fiscal '23, our consolidated adjusted operating margin was 4.9%, an improvement of 48 basis points over the prior fiscal year. Again, when normalizing for the accounting impact of the mark-to-market adjustment in both periods related to gross margin consolidated adjusted operating margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 expanded by 110 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '22. And for the full year of fiscal '23, consolidated operating margin expanded by 40 basis points over the full year of fiscal '22. I am proud of our team's efforts to deliver on our commitment to drive operating margin expansion in each of our business segments and for the total company in fiscal '23. The foundational initiatives we put in place to improve gross margin with pricing and cost execution, working more closely with strategic vendors who reward us for our sales performance, driving improved mix, exercising expense discipline and leveraging our cost structure have certainly translated to a higher level of profitability for Patterson. Our adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 was 24.4%, an increase of 140 basis points compared to the prior year. For the full year of fiscal '23, our adjusted tax rate was 23.6%, a decrease of 20 basis points compared to full year fiscal '22. Reported net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. for the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 was $75 million or $0.77 per diluted share. This compares to reported net income in the fourth quarter of last year of $63.9 million or $0.65 per diluted share. Adjusted net income attributable to Patterson Companies in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23, which excludes deal amortization and gains on investments to $82.4 million or $0.84 per diluted share, a record quarter for Patterson. This compares to $70.4 million or $0.71 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal '22. This 18% year-over-year increase in adjusted earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter was primarily due to increased sales of dental equipment and value-added services as well as operating margin expansion in both business segments. Both reported and adjusted net income in the fiscal 2023 fourth quarter contained a onetime gain of $3.6 million or $0.03 per diluted share related to the sale of a real estate asset. For the full year of fiscal '23, reported net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. was $207.6 million or $2.12 per diluted share compared to $203.2 million or $2.06 per diluted share in fiscal 2022. Adjusted net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. in fiscal '23, which excludes deal amortization, integration and business restructuring expenses, legal reserves, inventory donation charges and gains on investments, totaled $236.4 million or $2.42 per diluted share compared to $223.7 million or $2.27 per diluted share in the prior fiscal year. Now let's turn to our business segments, starting with our Dental business. In the fourth quarter of fiscal '23, internal sales for our Dental business increased 8.0% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '22. When excluding the impact of price deflation of certain infection control products, internal sales for our Dental business increased 10.8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '22. Internal sales of dental consumables in the fourth quarter increased 0.3% compared to 1 year ago. And again, were impacted by the continued moderation of infection control products compared to the pandemic-related performance last year. Internal sales of non-infection control products increased 4.4% in the fiscal fourth quarter compared to the year ago period. For the full year of fiscal '23, internal sales of consumables declined by 2.1% due to the price deflation of PPE products during the year. Excluding the impact of these products, dental consumables increased by 3.1% in fiscal '23 compared to fiscal '22. In the fourth quarter of fiscal '23, internal sales of dental equipment increased 19.2% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '22 with strong growth across all product categories. Our sales team drove equipment demand to finish our fiscal '23 with strong momentum as Dental customers continue to invest to maintain and improve their practices or open additional offices. For the full year of fiscal '23, internal sales of dental equipment increased 4.9% over fiscal '22. Internal sales of value-added services for the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 increased 13.4% over the prior year period led by solid year-over-year performance of our technical service team and continued growth of our software and e-services business. Value-added services represent the entire suite of offerings we provide to our customers that help make us an indispensable partner to their practice, and these valuable offerings are also mix favorable to our P&amp;L. For the full year of fiscal '23, Internal sales of value-added services increased 8.1% compared to fiscal '22. Adjusted operating margins in Dental were 12.1% in the fiscal fourth quarter and a 205 basis point improvement over the prior year period. This operating margin performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 reflects the continued efforts of our dental team to improve gross margins through driving higher growth plus margin-accretive products, as well as exercising continued expense discipline to deliver operating margin expansion in the fiscal fourth quarter of fiscal '23. In addition, the dental operating margin contained a onetime gain of $3.6 million related to the sale of a real estate asset in the fourth quarter. For the full year of fiscal '23, adjusted operating margins in our dental business, of 10.0%, a 65 basis point improvement over the prior fiscal year. Now let's move on to our Animal Health segment. In the fourth quarter of fiscal '23, internal sales for our Animal Health business increased 3.2% compared to the same period 1 year ago. For the full year of fiscal '23, internal sales for our Animal Health business were up 3.4% compared to fiscal year 2022. Internal sales for our companion animal business in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 increased 6.7% compared to the prior year. For the full year of fiscal '23, Internal sales in our companion animal business increased 5.3% compared to fiscal '22. Internal sales for our production animal business in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 decreased by 0.7% compared to the same period 1 year ago. For the full year of fiscal '23, internal sales in our production animal business increased 1.2% compared to fiscal '22. Adjusted operating margins in our Animal Health segment in the fiscal fourth quarter were 5.5%, an increase of 57 basis points from the prior year. For the full year of fiscal '23, adjusted operating margins in our Animal Health segment were 4.2%, which represents 36 basis points of margin expansion compared to fiscal 2022. Our Animal Health team continues to drive business with strategic manufacturing partners who value our ability to increase sales, while also exercising expense disciplines our Animal Health team delivered operating margin expansion for the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 and for the full year of fiscal ['23.] Now let me cover free cash flow and capital allocation. During fiscal '23, our free cash flow declined by $14.4 million compared to the same period 1 year ago. This was primarily due to an increased level of capital spending in fiscal '23 and as well as a slightly higher level of receivables related to the strong sales month we had in April. Now turning to capital allocation. We continue to execute on our strategy to return cash to our shareholders. In the fourth quarter of fiscal '23, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per diluted share, which was then paid at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal '24. Also in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 the company repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares of stock. During fiscal '23, Patterson Companies returned $156.8 million of cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Let me conclude with our financial outlook for fiscal '24. This morning, we issued a GAAP earnings guidance range for fiscal '24 of $2.14 to $2.24 per diluted share, and an adjusted earnings guidance range of $2.45 to $2.55 per diluted share. For modeling purposes, let me highlight a few additional items to consider as you think about our guidance for fiscal '24. First, as mentioned earlier, our fiscal 2023 adjusted EPS of $2.42 benefited from a onetime gain related to the sale of real estate assets, which represented approximately $0.03 of adjusted EBITDA. Second, we are modeling low to mid-single-digit revenue growth in fiscal '24. This is inclusive of some continued deflation of PPE products compared to the pricing of these products during fiscal '23. We are also modeling operating margin expansion for both business units and the total business. Third, as Don noted, our guidance reflects expanded investments to further develop and grow our software and value-added services capabilities. Fourth, we are modeling a higher overall tax rate of approximately 25%. This is higher than where we finished fiscal '23 due to increased tax rates in the U.K. and other adjustments to our tax expense. And finally, we expect to face additional headwinds in fiscal '24 regarding higher interest rates on our variable rate debt. If you exclude the onetime $0.03 per share benefit associated with the sale of the real estate asset from our fiscal '23 adjusted EPS performance, our fiscal 2024 adjusted EPS guidance range of $2.45 to $2.55 per diluted share, imply a 5% year-over-year growth at the midpoint and 7% year-over-year growth at the top end of our range. And now I will turn the call back over to Don for some additional comments.Donald J. ZurbayThanks, Kevin. Before we open it up for Q&amp;A, I'd like to reiterate a few key takeaways from our call this morning. Patterson had an exceptionally strong fourth quarter, including a fiscal year in which we achieved our financial goals of delivering year-over-year sales growth and adjusted operating margin expansion. Our performance during the fourth quarter and throughout fiscal '23 is a continuation of our track record of success over the past several years. We continue to execute and refine our proven strategy to build upon this momentum. And we are well-positioned to drive enhanced growth, profitability and value creation over the long-term. That concludes our prepared remarks. Kevin and I will be glad to take questions. Operator, please open the line.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Jason Bednar of Piper Sandler.Jason M. BednarCongrats on a real nice quarter to close out the fiscal year. Don or Kevin, the margin performance here was extremely impressive in the fourth quarter. We have been going along a path of modest margin expansion here for the last, call it, few years. For the last couple of quarters, you just blow that out of the water. I understand the dental equipment strength this quarter probably helped. But you're sitting at multiyear highs in each of Dental and Animal Health even after adjusting for that one-time gain in Dental that you mentioned. So it's been a long road to get to where we're at. But could you talk about how you think about these multi-year high margin performance as we think forward to the coming years. I know you don't have a formal LRP out there, but where do you see the potential for Dental and Animal Health as you look ahead over the next few years?Donald J. ZurbayYes. Thanks, Jason, and I appreciate the comments. I think the margin journey has really been the last, I mean, you could say the last 4 or 5 years, but -- what we're looking at is the fact that the programs we put in place are working. The things that we're doing, we think are impactful and sustainable. And so as you look forward, I think we would talk about -- and I think we have talked about op profit margins for the company. We like the 20 to 30 basis point improvement on a year-over-year basis, that could go up or down. And certainly, as we make some investment decisions that could impact that. But we're committed to operating profit improvement in both of the business units and the overall company. And that's a drumbeat that's constant here. We work really hard. There's a lot of programs in place. And the focus, as I mentioned, when we talk about those programs, our sustainable programs. So I don't know maybe, Kevin, if you have any additional comments or thoughts on some specific things that you might mention. But we're pretty pleased with it. We're not surprised by it. And more importantly, we're excited about what that looks like going forward.Kevin BarryYes, Jason, I think the strength this year and this quarter, it really starts with the gross margin performance, and that speaks to some of these internal initiatives and focus areas that we've implemented around our mix of products, our efficiencies in our distribution network, our ability to drive that gross margin line really helps. And I think what's also long-term for us, too, as we feel like we've got a cost base that we can leverage. So as we're out winning with our customers and driving that top line. We feel really good that we can get some leverage over our operating expenses with how our operating day. That's going to allow us to both reinvest in the business as we need to, but also continue that margin expansion journey we're on.Jason M. BednarAnd it sounds like a lot of sustainability there. The dental equipment strength was probably the other big outlier in the quarter, at least to me, seems like a nice improvement in demand and tone from you all regarding just overall demand across the portfolio. How much of this is real time and therefore, an improvement in demand trends from what we've seen across the last couple of quarters versus how much is maybe a clearing of demand backlog that's been in place. Anything you can share on the order book exiting the quarter and maybe your confidence in seeing dental equipment sales grow in fiscal '24 within that low to mid-single-digit company-wide revenue guide you gave today?Donald J. ZurbayYes, I think you'd have to look at both things really. I mean, certainly, the second half of our year, particularly the fourth quarter, just given the cadence of some of the things we do shows strength. And so there's always a little bit of a second half bias. There's probably some clearing of the backlog. I think the most important thing, though, and if you go back here, equipment is lumpy. It was a very good quarter. We're not going to minimize it because we know what's behind it, and it was across the whole equipment portfolio. But I look back and we talked about this before, 3-month increments are important, but in equipment particularly, I think you look back over longer periods of time. And I'm particularly proud of 8% growth average over the last 8 quarters. I think that really smooths out all the things you're talking about and kind of gives you a good snapshot of what we're doing. We think that's above the market growth. We think it's our -- it shows kind of our advantage that we have in this area and kind of the full suite of products and really the life cycle management that we use when we talk to our customers about equipment sales. So I think a little of all that. But again, I think kind of step back and say how are we doing -- doing better than the market, and we're pretty proud of that.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny of Bank of America.Michael Aaron ChernyI want to echo the comments on a strong quarter and robust outlook. Maybe a 2-part question kind of interlocked, but you mentioned some of the dynamics regarding the pricing on PPE. Can you give us a sense, aside from that, about any variations to either the up or downside you expect over the course of the year? And I guess alongside that, as well, any dynamics either quarterly or at least from a total perspective of the magnitude of some of the innovation investments that you'll be making?Donald J. ZurbayMaybe I'll let Kevin kind of walk through a little that as much as we're going to share here.Kevin BarryYes. I think on the PPE dynamics, Michael, what we expect going forward is that we're starting to see the prices of that basket of products stabilize. But on a year-over-year basis, when you compare back first quarter F '24 to '23, we still expect to see a bit of a headwind that really should dissipate as we go through the first half of the year. That's really when we should lap it. That is built into our guidance. So we're in the guidance details I gave on the call, that's all built in there. I'd say, on some of the investments that we're anticipating making here this year, I'd say those -- we're starting those now. There probably will be a bit of a ramp as we go over the course of the year on the OpEx line.Michael Aaron ChernyAnd anything else that's seasonally different from what you'd expect normally? Obviously, I think Jason asked about coming off the strong equipment quarter, but any other moving pieces, any product launches on either segment that you're expecting to have a meaningful variation versus what you normally expect to give in the year? Or what's built in the guidance?Donald J. ZurbayNo, I don't think so. And again, I think Kevin mentioned some things that year-over-year, you can look at the impact when you talked about guidance. Obviously, the increasing interest rate environment, at least just on a year-over-year basis is a headwind and the software investments and those kind of things, but that's all built into the guidance. I think what it really shows is even with the guidance we've given, which is strong, we feel the underlying business is really set up to overcome those headwinds.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Nathan Rich of Goldman Sachs.Nathan Allen RichI wanted to start on dental consumables. I think 3.1% for the fiscal year ex infection control. And Don, I think you called out kind of consistently strong patient traffic. Can you maybe talk about how you feel about health of the end market? And maybe for the fiscal year, how volume kind of compared to price? And should we think about a similar level of dental consumables growth into fiscal '24?Donald J. ZurbayYes. I think this is an area where at least in our business, what we're seeing is very steady traffic. I think our own internal data and the ADA data on utilization really is kind of bearing that out. But we're certainly seeing that in our customer base. And it's a combination of price and utilization.And I think -- as we look into next year, we're really not modeling any significant fluctuations in that. I think that's a good proxy right now for the way the business is operating. And probably if you're modeling it for next year, for us, at least, you'd look at that same kind of dynamic.Nathan Allen RichGreat. That's helpful. And as a follow-up, I wanted to go back to the earlier comments on margins. I think you talked about the 20 to 30 basis points as being a good target. But could you maybe just frame the opportunity from here relative to what it was in fiscal '19? You obviously talked about the progress that you made, but margins are kind of now kind of back above where they were kind of 5 years ago. Where do you kind of see the longer-term margin potential for this business, used to be at kind of 6% to 7% margins. Is that eventually where you can get back to if we look over the next 3, 5 years and play this forward?Donald J. ZurbayYes, Nathan. Well, I think I'd like to stay away from too much long-term guidance on specifics. I think over the last 5 years, in the earlier years in that cycle, we probably benefited a little bit more just from the idea that we were getting the business back on track and improving what was -- where we were. But at the same time, we were putting in programs that were sustainable and that we thought would benefit our margin on a more consistent basis and long-term basis going forward. And so right now, what we're seeing is the benefit of those types of things. And again, when we look at this and we really think through margin initiatives, we're thinking through it in the -- from the standpoint of not a onetime or a short-term basis, but really what's a long-term sustainable program. And so -- for me, as I look forward and we kind of talk about future I would say for our horizon for the foreseeable future, we're looking at that again at that 20 to 30 basis point improvement each year.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Block of Stifel.Jonathan David BlockGreat. Thanks, guys. Good morning. Just the first one, maybe just in light of some of the trends throughout the most recent quarter? And Kevin, if I heard you correctly, you might have touched on it a little bit regarding the AR comments. It seems like April was strong. Is that correct? How did that sort of continue into May? And then importantly, what are you extrapolating when we think about the full year guidance? If the recent trends were strong April and May, is it a continuation in the recent guide? Or did you build in any conservatism around that?Kevin BarryYes. I think talking about the dental market specifically, I'd just reiterate what Don said, we're just seeing very steady end market patient traffic. And for us, you start with kind of our consumables business, our value-added services business. I think that's been [steady] throughout the fourth quarter. Like Don said, we see that being fairly consistent as we look forward. Equipment. We did have a stronger equipment quarter that was more back-ended in the quarter for us. But again, I think we have, as we look forward, like we saw strength across all subcategories than equipment, which again, to us, speaks to the health of the end market. Dentists continue to invest in their in their practices, whether through expansion or optimizing within the practice they have new technology, and that's the strength of ours. And so as we look forward, we're going to continue to work with those dentists and make sure that we're meeting them where they need to go with the products that we offer. So I see those dynamics continue as we go into F '24 here, John.Jonathan David BlockAnd then maybe just to pivot from Dental to Animal Health. Animal had solid results, and it seems like companion continues to lead the charge. But if I look at the companion animal numbers, if I've got it right, it looks like the fourth straight quarter of the 2-year stacked decelerating by a decent clip, right? I mean, from like a crazy levels of, call it, mid-30s to low double digits more recently. Maybe if you can just talk to the companion animal market, the amount of resiliency and then what your rough expectations are going into fiscal '24, again, more specific to companion.Donald J. ZurbayOkay. Yes. Well, Thanks, John. I think over -- I think you're right. Look, over that period of time that you're referencing, there definitely has been moderation. You kind of talked about all the dynamics of the pandemic and the other factors. What we're seeing right now is with that moderation, visits are down slightly, but spending is up. I think as people are bringing pets back to the vet, there's maybe a catch-up element as well. But I think when we cut through it, again, we're in a healthy market. And I think from our data standpoint, we're outperforming the market. So we're a market share gainer, and that's where we want to be particularly, there will be some movements in the market, but we think we're gaining share.OperatorThank you. And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson of Baird.Jeffrey D. JohnsonMost of my questions have been answered, but -- and you've used the word stability to hear a lot around the dental business. So I probably heard the answer to this question as well. But Don, when I think about the dental equipment business, notwithstanding your 8% growth over the last 8 quarters. I think over the last 6 months, it's been 5% growth over the last 12 months, it's been 5% growth. So is that a reasonably good with what you're seeing in the backlog and order trends. Is that kind of mid-single digit on dental equipment, a good jumping-off place to be thinking about as we go into fiscal '24 here? And then maybe if you could just talk about pricing around tech in equipment versus basic. I know basic is up very nicely. Is that helping offset fully some of the deflationary pressures on the tech side? Or just how those 2 are balancing out on pricing?Donald J. ZurbayYes. Well, Jeff, I think good question. I think on your 5% over the last 12 months, and we have 8% over the last 8 quarters. But I think that mid-single-digit range is good. I think that's a good way to think about this over the slightly longer-term. On the pricing, I think for us, we're seeing, again, not to beat on stability. But I think we're seeing pretty good stability on our pricing in this area. We have a healthy program and a disciplined program and the pricing has held up in spite of some of the macroeconomic trends and so has the demand. So for us, this has been a good story and expect it to continue to be.Jeffrey D. JohnsonAnd then I guess a follow-up question just on the consumable business. Obviously, you guys are overweight kind of general consumables. But with the Dolphin business in that, I think you probably have some decent insights at least on the orthodontic side. One of the things we've been seeing in our survey work is clearly, the patient volumes are holding in, but maybe spend per patient or some of the high end, high acuity mix coming down a little bit. So just what's your sense on kind of how much that steady patient is really helping the hygiene in the general consumables side versus the spend per patient. And maybe what you're seeing in some of your orthodontic data or anything like that, that would help us understand kind of that higher acuity spend level versus the general [hygiene.]Donald J. ZurbayAgain, I think if you're getting at the mix of just demand and pricing, I mean -- I think it's kind of a little of both. I guess I'm not -- the orthodontic data probably isn't quite as applicable to us. So I haven't -- I would reference those back to more to the dental data, the 88 utilization. And just again, all the different elements of data that we are looking at really point to that kind of steady traffic -- that steady traffic theme.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson of Evercore ISI.Elizabeth Hammell AndersonTalking about some of the investments that you guys are thinking about in terms of software and value-added service. I think I heard you in one of prior questions today that, that would sort of be reflected in the OpEx line. I guess I just wanted to: a, confirm that; and b, I'd like to just sort of understand a little bit more if you have any sort of more details on specific areas. And then two, like -- how do you think about that kind of buy versus build? Is that kind of (inaudible) in your calculation? Or how do you guys think about that?Donald J. ZurbayYes, Elizabeth. Thanks for the question. I think -- the -- let's maybe start with the buy versus build. I mean we -- we're looking at both as we continue to enhance our capabilities. We are generally committed to build. I think that's been our history, and that's been where we've been with Fuse. The investments themselves, it is reflected in the guidance. There's an element of operating expense. There is an element of capital that's involved. But overall, the higher investment is reflected in all the comments and the numbers we're talking through here today. And then additional capabilities, I guess I wouldn't get into all the -- just competitively get into all the specific capabilities. I think I would say that we are making investments in both our Eaglesoft platform and Fuse. I think our view is that we really are excited about where these products are and where they're headed. It's a very fast-paced and evolving area. So for us, having the features and functionality we need is important. But again, not only on the on-prem side, but on the cloud-based side. And so there's a lot of things happening here, a lot of technology and innovation, and it's happening quick. And so we're determined to stay ahead of that.Elizabeth Hammell AndersonAnd I guess my next question is should we think about the general dentistry market and sort of your presence among DSOs. How is that strategy at all changing? Have you seen any new dynamics there? I mean, obviously, you have some large customers. How are those relationships we haven't heard an update on that in a little while, so I'd just be sort of curious how you're viewing that in the current environment?Donald J. ZurbayI think it's really pretty steady this area. I mean, it's evolving. But our strategy is consistent. And so overall, I think this is a good story. I don't really -- there's the national side, there's regional side. Obviously, we're working on both of them. We think we have a good core competence, particularly on the regional DSO kind of area. But probably nothing new to report in terms of any different dynamics.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Kevin Caliendo of UBS.Kevin CaliendoI guess first one, is just on cadence. I know you don't like to give quarterly guidance and the like, but there is some lumpiness to some of the numbers. And just any kind of color you can provide us or help you can provide us as we think about modeling out the year to get to the guidance for the full year in terms of the quarterly or first half, second half, or even just sort of revenue growth expectations or margin expectations.Kevin BarryYes, Ken, I'd say I think as we look forward, our first half, second half split should be fairly in line with the past couple of years in terms of how we're modeling it right now.Kevin CaliendoOkay. Great. And that's from an EPS perspective is what you're.Kevin BarryRight. Correct.Kevin CaliendoYou talked a little bit on the equipment side and said there was strength across all 3 categories. I think you also said maybe there was a little bit of a drawdown in backlog. Can you maybe talk about where you're seeing demand where maybe you saw some of the backlog come in a little bit, where maybe demand increased a little bit across the categories as best you can. Any sort of color across the 3 about the changing dynamics between demand and backlog going, but what do you expect to be going forward more than looking back?Donald J. ZurbayYes. I think again, as we mentioned, it is a bit lumpy. So for me, we watch it back -- and we watch it through each of the categories and look at the data. I think the backlog kind of reflects the lumpiness. So the backlog at times is high at other times it's low. But I haven't -- I'm not drawing and I don't believe there's a correlation here between anything that's going on with our backlog at any time and kind of overall traffic and demand. It's -- depends more on innovation cycle, inventory we're holding and then installation. So but nothing that I'm going to -- nothing that we think would be interesting in terms of reporting this out right now that would give you more insight.OperatorAnd for that, I'm going to go and move on to the next question. I'll bring up the person again in a second. And the next question comes from Brandon Vazquez of William Blair.Brandon VazquezJust one on consumable -- sorry, on equipment that we were talking about before. Some of the other peers in the space have been talking about how equipment demand has been strong, but there's been a little bit of a shift maybe in some markets, especially like internal scanners towards lower price maybe as we get higher in adoption curve. Curious if you guys are seeing any -- maybe the answer is no, given how strong of a quarter you had within equipment, but curious if you're seeing any higher demand for lower end prices within that segment or not?Kevin BarryYes. I think -- I guess what I'd say is I think our teams do a really good job managing through those dynamics when they pop up. I mean we've got a pretty broad selection of multiple equipment categories and technologies. And our team out in the field is a really good job of understanding what a dental practice needs and how to meet those needs. And in most markets if there is price declines, you generally see demand increase and adoption increase when those things happen. So I think that's what I'd say is we benefit from really skilled sales force that knows our customers and knows what's going to be a good match for them and a wide variety of products to meet those needs.Brandon VazquezAnd then my second question, looking back at the value-added services and software segment, another great quarter for you guys there. And we asked a little bit earlier about what's in the pipeline, but maybe I'll ask that question slightly different. Is there any way you can frame the opportunity for us within value-added services and software? Maybe any figures like what percent of your customers today are using your value-added services? Or what kind of pocket share can you get incrementally from current customers? Anything like that, just helpful to understand the market.Donald J. ZurbayYes, I appreciate the question and definitely want to be helpful. Probably not going to give that level of data. It's something we track. I think maybe just suffice it to say that -- this is a very important part of our product portfolio. It's a high-margin part of our product portfolio and a huge focus for us going forward. Again, kind of reflected in the additional investments we're going to make here. But yes, probably at this point, I'm not going to give you too much of a breakdown. I think it's a big addressable market for us.OperatorAnd your last question comes from the line of A.J. Rice of Credit Suisse.Albert J. William RiceMaybe a couple of quick ones here. You mentioned a couple of times the impact of the rising rate environment. I wondered as you are looking at equipment financing and how your buyers are approaching the market, has that changed their willingness to finance equipment sales in any way? Are you seeing any changes or opportunities there?Kevin BarryYes, A.J., I'd say we haven't seen a dramatic change in how much of our sales get financed. We've obviously adjusted our rates to reflect the higher rate environment. But we also -- we work closely with our manufacturer partners to drive smart promotions that can drive more demand and sometimes those are in the financing area. And so we participate with them some of those promotions that can help the ROI for a dentist as they look at the opportunity.Albert J. William RiceAnd then maybe another sort of market-oriented question. There's been obviously a lot of discussion about the tightness of supply of dental hygienists and so forth. And you've also had similar commentary in the veterinary space. We're seeing a little bit of easing in some other areas. Are you seeing your ongoing customer base easing in either of those areas? And is that having any impact on wait times to get appointments? Or is that a potential help in the next year in your consumables side?Donald J. ZurbayWell, we're definitely aware there are some of those dynamics out there. It really has not shown up in the ADA data and on our data. And I think I go back to the comments on steady traffic. I think it's a challenge for dental (inaudible). Don't get me wrong. But for us, again, from what we're seeing right now, that's not been a major factor. Anyway, that's our last question.

The company projects adjusted EPS in the range of $2.45-$2.55. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $2.28.Our TakePatterson Companies ended fiscal fourth-quarter 2023 on a strong note, wherein both earnings and revenues beat the consensus mark by a significant margin.Both the Dental and the Animal Health segment showed signs of improvement. Sales at both the segments were hurt by unfavorable currency movement. A prudent cost-savings approach and solid sales execution worked in favor of the stock, expanding gross margin. Sustained momentum in the Animal Health business bodes well.A broad spectrum of products cushions the company against economic downturns in the MedTech space. We believe that a diverse product portfolio, strong veterinary business prospects, accretive acquisitions and strategic partnerships are the key catalysts.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderPatterson Companies currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some other stocks in the medical space that have announced quarterly results are CONMED CNMD, Dentsply Sirona XRAY and Merit Medical Systems MMSI, all carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).CONMED reported first-quarter fiscal 2023 adjusted EPS of 66 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.00%.

127,a15f6b9a-2365-3d78-88ab-83d78ca5cf3e,BK,2023-06-22,Is The Bank Of New York Mellon (BK) a Good Pick for Value Investors?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bank-york-mellon-bk-good-133000277.html,1687354200,STORY,['BK'],"[Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put The Bank Of New York Mellon BK stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, The Bank Of New York Mellon has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9.26, as you can see in the chart below:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&amp;P 500 stands at about 20.66. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, The Bank Of New York Mellon’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint (which is 11.31) over the past five years. Moreover, the current level stands well below the highs for the stock, suggesting that it can be a solid entry point.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Finance sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 14.78. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWe should also point out that The Bank Of New York Mellon has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 9.41, which is higher than the current level. So, it is fair to expect an increase in the company’s share price in the near term.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, The Bank Of New York Mellon has a P/S ratio of about 1.55. This is a bit lower than the S&amp;P 500 average, which comes in at 3.83x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIf anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, The Bank Of New York Mellon currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks wecover from this look. This makes The Bank Of New York Mellon a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for The Bank Of New York Mellon is just 1.18, a level that is far lower than the industry average of 1.22. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, BK is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though The Bank Of New York Mellon might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of A. This gives BK a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here &gt;&gt;)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been robust at best. The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower, while the full year estimate has seen three up and two down in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 0.8% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched higher by 0.4%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Price and ConsensusThe Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Price and ConsensusThe Bank of New York Mellon Corporation price-consensus-chart | The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation QuoteEven though Western Union has a better estimates trend, the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). That is why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineThe Bank Of New York Mellon is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (among Bottom 16% of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. However, over the past two years, the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry has clearly underformed the broader market, as you can see below:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSo, value investors might want to wait for analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn favorable in this name first, but once that happen, this stock could be a compelling pick.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The collaborative solution connects mutual clients of TSOX, Bloomberg's fixed income execution management system (EMS) and S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence's InvestorAccess ('InvestorAccess') platform. Portfolio managers and traders are provided with an optimized end-to-end primary markets workflow, which includes quick access to the most up-to-date information on new issue securities of interest, electronic order routing and automatic delivery of final allocations.(PRNewsfoto/S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence)The solution improves the primary markets workflow by providing market participants with a more efficient way to process orders and allocations. The linkage between TSOX and InvestorAccess begins with the staging and intelligent aggregation of orders from multiple portfolio managers. These orders are electronically routed to InvestorAccess and dynamically updated as the new issue security evolves from initial announcement to final terms. This is followed by delivery of the order allocations via straight-through-processing as soon as the syndicate has released them.Bloomberg users who stage orders into TSOX from their Order Management System (OMS) can now take advantage of automated security creation, electronic order routing and dynamic order modification and cancellation. In addition, once the orders are filled, the details are immediately delivered to a client's OMS for easy tracking.The synchronization of the primary market data workflow between both firms helps ensure that traders can exchange pertinent order-level information on new issue securities. This alignment allows for free exchange of new issue data by systems supporting the market participants' trading desk through the syndicate banks' book building technology. This minimizes the need for proprietary mapping and manual tracking of security information.Story continues""This integration is part of our commitment to making data available to users faster, following the announcement of a new issue. By providing clients a streamlined electronic workflow we're helping to optimize their interactions within the primary markets,"" said Phil McCabe, Global Head of EMS and Analytics Product at Bloomberg. ""Bloomberg has continued to invest in this space, and by centralizing new issue workflows, traders are able to combine the best of data and information discovery with efficient and inter-operable execution management using TSOX.""""The synchronization of the primary market data workflow between both firms aims to ensure that traders can exchange pertinent order-level information on new issue securities,"" said Chris Sztam, Head of Global Markets Group, S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.

Tesla was cut from the index last year because of issues including claims of racial discrimination and crashes linked to its autopilot vehicles. The removal prompted Chief Executive Elon Musk to responds with tweets such as ""ESG is a scam"". The re-inclusion of Tesla is largely symbolic because only about $8 billion in assets track the S&amp;P 500 ESG index, a tiny fraction of the $15.6 trillion in assets that track the S&amp;P 500 index, according to its provider, part of S&amp;P Global. ""It is more a soft benefit so people will have more confidence that the company is indeed relatively ESG friendly,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at financial research firm VettaFi. Tesla was among 39 companies added to the S&amp;P 500 ESG index effective May 1 as part of an annual rebalancing. Other companies added included Chevron and Fox, while 23 companies were removed including Exxon and Oracle. Tesla, Chevron and Oracle did not respond to requests for comment. Exxon and Fox declined to comment. An S&amp;P spokesperson said Tesla fared better this year, ""especially on environmental factors, which are material for a company in the automobiles industry."" Tesla gave information about its assessment of physical climate risks and of ESG considerations in its supply chain management strategy, the spokesperson added. Recent ESG-related matters at Tesla include a $3.2 million discrimination verdict against the company.

The partnership has paved the way for SYF’s Allegro Credit installment loan product to act as the primary patient financing solution that can be accessed by Miracle-Ear’s clients at its almost 300 corporate-owned stores.The installment loan product extends fixed-term financing that can be repaid by patients in anticipated monthly payments. The hassle-free nature of applying for the installment loan while visiting a Miracle-Ear store and subsequently, the flexibility imparted to customers in choosing a convenient payment option in regards to their varied financial needs remains lucrative.As the financing solution of Synchrony Financial is integrated within the practice management software of Miracle-Ear, it becomes easier for the latter’s provider team to issue a payment solution while discussions related to treatment suggestions remain underway.In addition to gaining access to the installment loan product, Miracle-Ear customers can also avail benefits of SYF’s CareCredit health and wellness credit card. Boasting a solid presence in the healthcare space, CareCredit is best known for offering financing options equipped with monthly payments and is accepted by over 266,000 providers and health-focused retail locations across the United States for a wide array of health and wellness services.The latest alliance reinforces Synchrony Financial’s efforts to expand the reach of hearing solutions, reduce the hurdles in the way of patients in availing quality hearing health care, achieve an optimal hearing level and thus, improve the overall health of patients. Miracle-Ear, backed by an extensive U.S. presence and a solid history of providing advanced hearing solutions for more than seven decades, seems to be the apt partner for complementing SYF’s endeavor.Such partnerships show Synchrony Financial’s prudence and also bear testament to its efforts in establishing a strong footprint across the fast-growing hearing care market. Per the National Institutes of Health, more than one in 10 Americans aged 18 and above report hearing loss. The source further estimates that the usage of a hearing device can be of great help to almost 28.8 million adults.Story continuesTherefore, the availability of a suitable financing solution, which eliminates the need to make lumpsum payments without straining one’s finances, might boost the purchasing power of patients in need of quality hearing care. Synchrony Financial makes active efforts to offer enhanced credit products best suited for addressing evolving customer expectations and serving diversified industries. Thus, these steady efforts attract newer partners as well as retain existing ones, resulting in bolstered credit lines, increased repeat sales and a greater customer lifetime value for SYF.Shares of Synchrony Financial have gained 12.6% in a year, compared with the industry’s 1.1% growth.

134,37962fc4-8b62-350b-b1a2-3a4f3da57e64,MA,2023-06-22,Shredding a Myth About Recycling: It’s Time To Tackle First-Use Plastic Cards,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shredding-myth-recycling-time-tackle-194500984.html,1687376700,STORY,['MA'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / June 21, 2023 / MastercardMastercard, Wednesday, June 21, 2023, Press release pictureToday's payment card packs a huge punch in a piece of plastic 3/100th of an inch thin - a microchip that securely processes purchases, a wire antenna that snakes through the card enabling contactless transactions, a hologram to defeat counterfeiters, and more. It's the result of decades of innovation and collaboration across the industry.But one element has largely remained the same - the plastic itself. Most of the 25 billion cards in circulation today are made from first-use plastics like PVC that will not break down and decompose, and they are difficult to recycle because of the metals and other materials embedded within. As a result, the vast majority wind up in landfills already choked with plastics.To combat this, it will take a collective effort. That's been our mantra as we pursue ways to reduce our impact on the environment, including our recent decision to require the use of sustainable materials in all new payment cards starting in 2028 and our work to propel the secular shift to digital payments, including our Digital First card program in which cardholders can opt out of a physical card entirely.We see a future where all plastic cards can be recycled easily - at your bank, your corner store or your municipal recycling center - to make a small but meaningful dent in the plastic pollution crisis. The innovation and collaboration that produced the payment cards we carry today can and should be harnessed to dispose of them in a secure and sustainable way.That's why we are establishing a blueprint for card recycling that can be replicated across the world, including collection, transportation and recycling, and we're asking our global network of partners to help us put this in place, starting in the U.K. with HSBC, now offering card recycling at select branches.Cardholders can drop off any expired payment cards into secure, dedicated collection boxes inside the bank branches. For additional peace of mind, the cards are shredded inside the collection box, ensuring no card information can be stolen and the build-in chip is destroyed.Story continuesThe shredded waste is then shipped to our recycling partner. For the U.K., this is TerraCycle, which has been tackling hard-to-recycle products, from toothpaste tubes to mascara wands to water filters to coffee pods, for more than 20 years. The shredded card waste is then separated and the plastic reformed into pellets and powders to be reused for other products.Since 2018, our DigiSec Lab in northern England has been exploring ways to recycle plastic cards and develop more sustainable ones by scrutinizing their physical and chemical makeup - gnashing and grinding them, using a diamond-edge saw to expose the cross-section, examining them under a scanning electron microscope and an infrared spectrometer.We also look at the amount of energy, carbon emissions and waste involved in card manufacturing. Those that meet our stringent standards of a sustainable card earn our badge of approval as an eco-friendly card.Since 2021, more than 403 financial institutions and fintechs from 92 countries have joined us in our journey toward a more sustainable way to pay by issuing 235 million Mastercard cards made from approved recycled, recyclable and bio-sourced materials, including recycled ocean plastic or bioplastics made from sugar or corn.We're calling on all card issuers to take the next step by working with us to provide recycling for existing first-use plastic cards. We can provide our expertise and connect them with our recycling partner to organize programs of their own, maximizing impact with minimal cost and effort.Across our business, we've taken a hard look at how we can help combat climate change, from reducing our own carbon footprint with a commitment to reach net-zero emissions by 2040 to working with our partners to restore 100 million trees through the Priceless Planet Coalition to enabling consumers to make more informed spending decisions using our Carbon Calculator.Propelling the evolution of the payment card into a more sustainable future is the next - and necessary - step.Click here to view the original contentView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Mastercard on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: MastercardWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/mastercardEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: MastercardView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/762942/Shredding-a-Myth-About-Recycling-Its-Time-To-Tackle-First-Use-Plastic-Cards]"

MA cardholders will be able to go cashless and transact via Alipay app by linking their debit or credit card with the wallet.This move is likely to bode well for Mastercard, which is focused on solidifying its payment network and diversifying it to new locations. This partnership will boost MA’s payment network revenues which contributed 63.5% to its total revenues in first-quarter 2023. The company will earn through higher fees generated as a result of improved gross dollar volume. This strategic collaboration is expected to grow business organically.Mastercard will be able to enhance its value proposition by expanding to new markets and thus experience robust retention of clients (financial institutions). Account holders can take advantage of a seamless payment experience while Chinese merchants get access to a larger customer base. Alipay and Mastercard’s collaboration is expected to strengthen MA’s footprint in Chinese market. Moreover, travel rewards for cards issued in South Korea, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan regions should help with customer loyalty for financial institutions.This partnership highlights MA’s goal to tap opportunities such as rebounding travel around the world after pandemic. Per Mastercard Economics Institute's Travel Industry Trends 2023 report, bookings for leisure travel rose 31% in March compared with the same period of 2019 levels. Popular tourist destinations around the world can be attractive markets for its expansion motives.MA carries out innovation in technology to keep cardholders’ data secure and free from cyber-attacks. The company also believes in creating innovative solutions to reduce its carbon footprint. Per reports, it has partnered with HSBC Holdings plc HSBC to recycle debit and credit cards, in a bid to reach net-zero emissions by 2040.Story continuesIt plans to reduce overfilling of landfills with billions of cards.

A potential investment is a growth company or a value stock. It’s high quality or it’s risky speculation. This sort of thinking is understandable. Such frameworks are useful for quickly understanding the world. But sometimes a company can represent multiple different styles of investment, such as with the three hidden growth blue-chip stocks below.People often think of the best blue-chip stocks to buy as being ones in staid, boring businesses that pay reliable dividends but don’t grow very much. But today’s picks offer both safety and considerable upside.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNike (NKE)Nike (NKE) store in a shopping mall in Penang, Malaysia. robinhood stocksSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.comNike (NYSE:NKE) is the world’s dominant seller of athletic apparel and footwear. While the company was once a growth superstar, investors might think of Nike’s opportunity as being largely played out at this point.But this blue-chip stock still has surprising upside thanks to emerging markets. In recent years, Nike has invested heavily in fast-growing consumer markets such as China, Southeast Asia and Latin America. As these countries see their middle classes blossom, Nike should be able to sell a lot more shoes and jerseys.Second, Nike was at the forefront of harnessing the power of the direct-to-consumer model. Back in the mid-2010s, when shopping malls were still riding high, Nike was taking its products to customers directly through social media, apps and influencers. Being early to this transition allowed Nike to thrive over the past few years as traditional brick-and-mortar retail was upended by the pandemic.Nike remains well-positioned to grow as the world economy normalizes. That’s especially true in China, where Nike’s results have been soft due to that country’s lingering pandemic lockdowns. Once China is fully back in business, NKE stock should enjoy a major tailwind.Estee Lauder (EL)An Estee Lauder retail store at Elements Shopping Mall in Hong Kong.Source: Sorbis / Shutterstock.comStory continuesShares of cosmetics company Estee Lauder (NYSE:EL) have gotten pummeled over the past 18 months, falling from a high of around $370 to less than $200 today. EL stock now trades for roughly the same price it did prior to the onset of the pandemic.At this price, the leading beauty products firm offers a solid value proposition. That’s because it benefits from many of the same trends as Nike. For instance, Estee Lauder relies on emerging markets for much of its future growth possibilities.The global prestige beauty market is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 5.56% through 2028. With Americans spending much more a year on prestige beauty products than those in countries like China and Brazil, Estee Lauder has a big growth opportunity. As the middle class continues to prosper in these large developing countries, it provides Estee Lauder with a tremendous growth runway.Shares have slumped recently as the initial economic reopening wave largely played itself out in some markets. But investors shouldn’t sleep on the longer-term possibilities. Particularly with the heightened focus on social media and beauty products among younger consumers, Estee Lauder has plenty of great years ahead of it.Qualcomm (QCOM)Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on a large sign with another sign that says 5GSource: Xixi Fu / Shutterstock.comLast up on our list of hidden growth blue-chip stocks to buy is Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), one of the world’s leading semiconductor companies focused on mobile communications.The firm rose to prominence by developing key patents for technologies such as 3G and 4G. Over the years, Qualcomm has monetized this intellectual property heavily, leading to tremendous results for its shareholders. Additionally, its move into designing its own chip ecosystems, such as Snapdragon, has proven lucrative.The key driver for the company now will be artificial intelligence (AI). Qualcomm has long prioritized making AI-enabled chips for mobile applications such as phones, connected cars, and internet of things (IoT) applications. Qualcomm’s AI chips have performed well in tests, particularly related to power efficiency.QCOM stock is an underappreciated growth investment that also offers appealing blue-chip characteristics such as a healthy starting valuation and a strong dividend yield of 2.6%.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in NKE, EL and QCOM stock.

On Jun 19, the National Association of Home Builders//Wells Fargo preliminary Housing Market Index (HMI) for June came in at 55, marking the sixth straight month of increase in home builders’ confidence. For the first time the confidence level has crossed the mid-point 50 mark to enter positive territory since July 2022.On Jun 20, the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development jointly announced that the privately-owned housing starts in May jumped 21.7% month-over-month to 1.631 million units, surpassing the consensus estimate of 1.4 million units. However, April’s data was revised downward to 1.34 million units from 1.401 million units reported earlier. Year over year, housing starts grew 5.7% in May.Privately-owned building permits in May surged 5.2% month-over-month to 1.491 million units, outpacing the consensus estimate of 1.41 million units. April’s data was revised marginally upward to 1.417 million units from 1.416 million units reported earlier. However, year over year, building permits fell 12.7% in May.The housing market is likely to remain buoyant as the Fed paused its interest rate hike in the June FOMC meeting. At this stage, it will be prudent to invest in building construction stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five home builders that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions for 2023 in the last seven days.

147,61dcf024-06e9-3bd6-b3f7-2ccd61cccd27,PHM,2023-06-22,3 Housing Stocks to Buy on Bullish Homebuilders' Sentiment,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-housing-stocks-buy-bullish-115200468.html,1687348320,STORY,"['PHM', 'LEN', 'LEN-B', 'TOL']","[An uptick in raw materials coupled with higher mortgage rates has impacted housing activity for quite some time. However, for the first time in almost a year, homebuilders’ sentiment about the housing market has turned bullish, thanks to strong housing demand.The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/ Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI) jumped five points to 55 in June, indicating that builders are feeling good about the newly built single-family housing market. The NAHB Index moved above the midpoint of 50 for the first time in 11 months, while sentiment among builders improved for the sixth successive month.The NAHB Index’s, June reading of 55, in reality, was the strongest since July 2022 as steady improvements in supply chains and low levels of inventory boost builders’ confidence. Further, the NAHB index’s readings on current and future sales conditions in the housing market also improved. Home builders, at present, have begun to curtail sales incentives, a tell-tale sign that demand for single-family homes is increasing.And with the Federal Reserve almost nearing the end of its tightening cycle, the future of the housing market certainly looks brighter. This is because a pause in interest rate hikes will make it easier to purchase physical properties, which won’t be expensive.Meanwhile, housing starts have picked up pace in the country despite economic headwinds, added the U.S. Census Bureau. Housing starts soared by 21.7% in May, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) of 1.63 million units, with both multifamily and single-family starts ticking up.Construction of single-family homes picked up pace mostly in the Midwest region, as the weather warmed up. Building permits for single-family homes also increased 5.2% last month. Thus, with homebuilder sentiment improving, and builders ramping up the construction of single-family homes, housing stocks like PulteGroup PHM, Lennar LEN, and Toll Brothers TOL are well-poised to benefit in the near term.Story continuesThese stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). The search was also narrowed down with a VGM Score of A or B. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum, and the score is a weighted combination of these three metrics. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.PulteGroup is primarily involved in homebuilding activities in the United States. PHM aims to increase its investment in land acquisition and development initiatives mostly due to strong buyer demand, and an uptick in construction activities.PHM, currently, has a Zacks Rank #1 and a VGM Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up almost 23.9% over the past 60 days. PHM’s expected earnings growth rate for the next five-year period is 16%.

The move was backed by solid volume with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This compares to the stock's 20.5% gain over the past four weeks.Valneva recorded a strong price increase after it announced that its pivotal Phase 3 data for its single-shot chikungunya vaccine candidate, VLA1553, have been published in The Lancet. Anticipated better-than-expected second quarter 2023 loss per share with the latest Zacks Consensus Estimate showing significant narrowing for the metric compared to the year-ago reported numbers raises optimism about the stock. The company is expected to release its second-quarter earnings on Aug 10, 2023.This company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.32 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +88.8%. Revenues are expected to be $45.58 million, down 40.1% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.For Valneva SE Sponsored ADR, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. And a stock's price usually doesn't keep moving higher in the absence of any trend in earnings estimate revisions. So, make sure to keep an eye on VALN going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

For Threadneedle Strategies Founder Ann Berry, it's buying those companies that will be gathering the data for sectors that may be overlooked. In an interview with Yahoo Finance Live, Berry suggests, for example, John Deere could be a company that is gathering information on what is happening in agriculture, but its stock doesn't have the valuations that some of the big tech companies have.Video Transcript- Well, what else has dominated the market rally? Of course, it's AI hype. It's dominated earnings calls as well and market enthusiasm for much of 2023. Although everyone seems eager to benefit from soaring AI interest, which companies will actually win out in the years to come? Ann Berry, Threadneedle founder is joining us now.And, Anne, you gave us a little test-- a little taste of this in our earlier discussions. It has to do with data.ANN BERRY: Yeah, data. Data. I say it differently.- I know.- I say-- I never know what is the right way to say it.- Yes. But it has to do with that, so how did how does then that thesis play out?ANN BERRY: Well, let's start with a piece of equipment that we all know and love, which is the iPhone. And so we all have it. It's out here, and the narrative around Apple is it's becoming an AI company because there are so many Apple devices out there gathering consumer data all the time, 24/7. Is that going to be the data gatherer that wins in the consumer space?So, Julie, I look at that and I say, I think that's an interesting thesis. Now, who is the equipment manufacturer and data gatherer for other sectors that we don't talk about as much? In farming, in ag, for example, I think it's John Deere. In medical devices, I think it's Metronics.So I'm trying to take that Apple thesis and AI and apply it to other industries to look for places to play without these massive valuations.- Well, speaking of Apple, I mean, look, it's huge. It's not the most compared to the rest of the Magnificent , Seven if you will, this year. It's up 47% year to date. Is it too expensive at this level, or is it because it could be seen as an AI leader? Does it have more room to run?Story continuesANN BERRY: I'm not buying more Apple at right this moment. I have been buying Apple up until now. I do think there's a replacement cycle coming because lots of folks are due for upgrades. And I do think that there is some AI sitting in there.I think where I'm a little bit nervous about Apple is it has been right in the eye of regulators trying to figure out how privacy and data is conserved. I think until that's sorted out for Apple specifically, it's going to have, perhaps, a little bit too much scrutiny. I think there are others who are flying below the radar screen.- It's so interesting to me-- the AI discussion because all of these companies have already done this. In other, words Deere already has a lot of data. Metronics already has a lot of data. And they have been using it through machine learning and AI, which has been around for a while.I'm really curious-- and I know we're not data scientists sit around this table-- but how generative AI then pushes it that next-- to that next phase of growth for some of these company?ANN BERRY: Well, I think that points, Julie, to there is going to be a replacement cycle. There is going to be a next generation of hardware and equipment that's able to process data more quickly, that's able to collect more sophisticated data. Sensors, for example, are getting more sophisticated.So I think there's a whole generational upgrade of the equipment provided, a replacement of the installed base that's going to come. But I think, Julie, the other piece of this that's interesting is on-site data scanning, getting real-time insights.Let's take medical devices, for example. One of the applications of AI that Google's talked about is much more sophisticated reading of scans, of X-Rays, even beyond sometimes what medical practitioners can do. But you've got to have the equipment that's actually doing that in the clinic in the room with you, so I think that's where that cycle is coming from.- Speaking of Google and something that you mentioned earlier about privacy concerns when it comes to Apple-- you talk about them being under scrutiny. I mean, Google, Alphabet has been under scrutiny, particularly when it comes to Europe. Is there any cause for concern about where it stands in terms of its value for Alphabet?ANN BERRY: I think so, and I think this also comes back then to the bigger question, which is, how is AI going to be regulated, period? Right? That's so up for debate right now. We're seeing the talks that are happening in the UK. The EU is actually being quietly in the US, not so quietly if you read the European press, passing regulations and laws designed to limit it.In the US, we don't actually know what the AI regulatory framework looks like yet. And until we do, it's really hard to know whether it's going to cap the growth of the big tech companies specifically.- Yeah, we'll have to see what happens. Ann, thanks for spending so much time with us this morning.ANN BERRY: This was fun.- Yeah. Ann Berry, Threadneedle Strategy's founder. Appreciate it.]"

The Biden administration's drug pricing reform aims to save $25 billion annually by 2031 through price negotiations for the drugs most costly to Medicare.The latest lawsuit argues that the ""unrestrained authority"" given to the Department for Health and Human Services (HHS) by Congress conflicts with the United States' separation-of-power principle.""Congress took a series of unconstitutional shortcuts, giving the executive branch the open ended task of replacing market based prices in Medicare with an entirely new set of prices at the (Medicare) agency's own choosing,"" PhRMA general counsel James Stansel said at a press conference.Story continuesThe lawsuit also contends that the price negotiation program violates the U.S. Constitution's Eight Amendment, which protects against excessive fines, and Fifth Amendment by exempting key decisions from public input.PhRMA and the other two groups are seeking an injunction against the price caps and a declaration that the IRA's price negotiation is unconstitutional.The negotiations are scheduled to start in September after the agency that runs Medicare and Medicaid releases its list of 10 costly drugs initially selected for the process, with the agreed prices taking effect in 2026.The suits challenging the plan have been filed in four different federal courts, with Merck's in Washington, D.C., the Chamber of Commerce in Ohio and Bristol Myers' in New Jersey.In response to the previous lawsuits, the White House said there is nothing in the U.S. Constitution that prevents Medicare from negotiating lower drug prices.A spokesperson for HHS on Wednesday said the law is on its side.“As the (HHS) secretary has already made clear, we will vigorously defend the president’s drug price negotiation law, which is already helping to lower healthcare costs for seniors and people with disabilities.""

Yahoo Finance Reporter Anjalee Khemlani breaks down the lawsuit, as well as other companies suing the HHS over the IRA drug price rule.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: The Department of Health and Human Services is being hit with lawsuits. And it could get worse. Starting with pharmaceutical giant Merck suing to block Medicare drug price negotiations. Calling that program unconstitutional. Could we see others? Joining us now on this is ""Yahoo Finance's"" reporter Anjalee Khenlani.And it seems like we are already seeing some others.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: We are, but not in the way that you might expect with companies lining up the way we thought might happen. And that is part of a UBS analyst note that I'll get to in a second. But as we were waiting for this segment, we just got another lawsuit, as you mentioned, Julie, from the trade group pharma. And that is including the National Infusion Center Association and Global Colon Cancer Association. This time, citing the Eighth Amendment.So what we have is a bunch of lawsuits citing either the First, Fifth, or now, Eighth Amendment, calling the IRA unconstitutional. We've got, of course, freedom of speech. And then Fifth, you think about it as pleading against incrimination. But they're using this in the context of government seizing property. Calling that the fourth sale of the drugs through there. And then the Eighth Amendment, which as you know would be cruel and unusual punishment, is now being cited for the part of it that deals with excise tax or excessive fines.And they're saying that forcing the companies to sell at the rate that Medicare sets would fall under that. So that's their argument, and the way that they are filing these suits against the health department. We know that Merck and Bristol Myers Squibb are the two companies that came out alone to sue separately aside from trade groups. But we've also seen some interest from some of the other large pharma companies that might be targeted based on their being the drugs that might fall under the parameters of being negotiated because they're top sellers. And, therefore, that's the target for Medicare.Story continuesBut in a UBS analyst note, we saw some thoughts that maybe these companies won't come out individually and follow suit of Merck really looking at the political considerations considering the election next year. So in a quote the analysts said, our legal expert checks indicate potential for multiple other manufacturers to join the fray. But that others may choose not to litigate based on political considerations. And that could include a number of things. Of course, the election next year and what that turns out to be, but also, what's going on right now with the Democratic stronghold in certain committees, for example, in the Senate namely, Bernie Sanders at the Health Committee.So a lot of things going on that would really incentivize them to not put a target on their back ahead of time. So we'll just have to see if that really does pan out or if others do join. But very much a topic of conversation right now. And something where these companies are really feeling the pressure as it gets closer and closer to negotiation time.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. So we'll see if any of these various efforts at blocking it bear fruit. Anjalee, thanks for tracking it for us. Appreciate it.]"

The primary endpoints of the study were EFS, overall survival (“OS”) and pathological complete response (“pCR”).Data from the study showed that participants treated with the Keytruda regimen achieved statistically significant improvement in pCR endpoint, which measures the absence of all signs of cancer in tissue samples.Since the study was unable to achieve the EFS endpoint, the OS endpoint was not formally tested.Shares of Merck have nosedived 0.7% year to date against the industry’s 1.9% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe detailed results of the KEYNOTE-585 study will be presented at a future medical meeting.Keytruda has received global approval for treating various types of cancer.The drug’s sales are gaining from continued strong momentum in metastatic indications, including some types of non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cancers, and a rapid uptake across recent earlier-stage launches. It is also being studied for over 30 different types of cancer, as both monotherapy and combination studies.Keytruda is continuously growing and expanding into new indications and markets globally.Earlier this month, Merck announced that the FDA accepted its supplemental biologics license application, seeking approval for Keytruda combined with the standard-of-care chemotherapy to treat patients diagnosed with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic biliary tract cancer.A final decision from the regulatory body is expected by Feb 7, 2024.Story continuesMerck &amp; Co., Inc.

(Photo: Shutterstock/John Gress Media Inc.)FedEx plans to remove 29 aircraft from its fleet this year through permanent retirement and temporary storage, fulfilling its new program to eliminate permanent costs and make its logistics network more flexible as global trade slows.CEO Raj Subramaniam said on Tuesday’s earnings briefing that the Express unit will park 20 aircraft in fiscal year 2024 and permanently retire nine additional MD-11 freighters. But the latest fleet statistics show the integrated logistics and parcel carrier’s mainline fleet will actually grow by 10 aircraft this year as Boeing planes ordered years ago are delivered.FedEx Express retired 18 aircraft in the just-completed fiscal year, including 12 MD-11s, four Boeing 757-200s and two Airbus A300-600s. FedEx wrote off the $70 million book value of the planes plus 34 related engines in its fourth-quarter results.FedEx (NYSE: FDX) began flying less in October as part of a corporate restructuring aimed at improving efficiency and reducing immediate costs as the downturn in shipping and e-commerce sales took hold.Express revenues fell 13% in the fourth quarter, ended May 31, to $10.4 billion while operating income was halved at $430 million. Success in decreasing expenses and higher U.S. yields partially offset lower volumes and helped improve profits, which tumbled 64% for the full year. The aircraft retirements were a large component of the unit’s $1.1 billion reduction in operating expense. The company said Express package volumes declined 7%, an improvement from the third quarter.Since fall, the company’s in-house airline has slashed dozens of daily flights from its schedule, accelerated the retirement of aging aircraft and deactivated other aircraft until demand picks up. Management has also indicated it plans to rely more heavily on partner airlines in the future instead of purchasing capacity itself to improve cash flow and prioritizing owned aircraft for parcel shipments over heavy freight, which will be moved more by third parties.Story continuesFedEx reduced global flight hours by 12%, year over year, during the fourth quarter. Domestic aircraft utilization is down even more, according to a recent analysis by Morgan Stanley.“We continue to make significant progress in taking cost out of our network, delivering a $2 billion year-over-year reduction in operating cost in the fourth quarter of FY ’23. This included more effectively matching flying with demand, marking the first quarter of this year where our flight hours declined more than the underlying volumes,” said Subramaniam.The express delivery company decommissioned its few remaining MD-10-30 cargo jets in December. Those planes were taken off the accounting books at the end of fiscal year 2022 but were utilized a few months longer because FedEx was still anticipating continued strong demand midway through last year.Overall fleet size decreased during the fiscal year by 10 units, with retirements offset by the addition of 14 factory-built Boeing 767-300 freighters and two Boeing 777s. FedEx currently has 700 aircraft, including 407 mainline aircraft and 293 feeder aircraft — 14 more than the prior year.Decisions on aircraft acquisitions were made years ago, well before the current financial pressures forced FedEx to rebalance its network and consolidate Express and Ground operations to better utilize existing infrastructure and personnel. The fleet additions are mostly for fleet modernization as they will replace aircraft being retired.FedEx currently has 46 MD-11s, which will be phased out by fiscal 2028.During the next two years, FedEx plans to add 55 aircraft to its fleet, the majority of them small feeder aircraft operated by contractors. It will get rid of 18 MD-11s, while adding 24 767s and six 777s, 27 all-new Cessna 408 SkyCourier aircraft, and 16 ATR72-600s, barring production delays.The Cessnas and ATRs are small turbo-prop planes. FedEx has committed to buying 41 SkyCouriers and 17 ATR72s.After fiscal year 2025, FedEx has no firm commitments for aircraft purchases. Capital expenditures for aircraft are expected to decrease to about $1 billion in fiscal 2026, the company’s CEO said. A big piece of the company’s transformation roadmap is becoming more disciplined with capital allocation to boost earnings.For FedEx Corp., overall, fourth-quarter adjusted operating income dropped 20% to $1.77 billion. Ground and Express volumes were lower than expected, but the rate of decline slowed. FedEx continued to make progress with its DRIVE cost campaign, cutting $2 billion in operating expenses in the quarter versus the prior year and $800 million more than in the third quarter.Management recently agreed on a five-year contract with its pilots’ union. Pilots will vote next month on whether to ratify the deal.Click here for more FreightWaves stories by Eric Kulisch.RECOMMENDED READING:Fewer FedEx flights raises red flag for fourth-quarter earningsFedEx to transfer LAX airport maintenance to IndianapolisFedEx says air network restructuring to save $700M annuallyFedEx readjusts air network again amid sharp volume declinesFreighters flying fewer hours underscores market weakness in air cargoThe post FedEx to shut down 29 more aircraft as demand shrinks appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

""If we are looking for 30 people, imagine Airbus and Safran.""Some small and medium-sized suppliers in India see opportunities from the jet buying spree of their local airlines.Ankit Patel, founder and director of Ankit Fasteners with about 450 employees, was already looking to double capacity in the next three or four years.""There is a euphoria around India,"" said Patel, whose company supplies fasteners like screws and bolts to Airbus and Boeing. ""Now's the time to capitalise, to say yes, we have capacity on the ground, Airbus and Boeing, look at us we can deliver.""(Reporting by Allison Lampert in Paris and Aditi Shah in New Delhi; Editing by Mark Potter)]"

Most of our members have concluded that the company's offer is unacceptable,"" IAM said in a statement.The union said it would regroup and begin planning ""the following steps to bring the company back to the table.""Boeing said it continued to monitor the situation and support Spirit.Airbus, while not commenting on the work stoppage itself, said it conducted regular assessments with suppliers to mitigate potential risks to production.In May, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said it would be difficult to make contingency plans for a strike at Spirit.""Even if they tried to get ahead of it by virtue of their current production, that will be measured in weeks not in months, so we're supporting them in every way possible to get to a constructive answer,"" he said.Last month, Spirit said it expected to take a $31 million hit to its full-year gross profit from disruptions related to 737 MAX fuselages and took a $110 million loss in reach-forward charges on Airbus and Boeing jet production in the first-quarter.

""For essentially the same trip costs I put 11 more passengers on.""In October, Alaska Airlines said it was exercising options to purchase 52 MAX aircraft for delivery between 2024 and 2027 and secured rights for 105 more planes through 2030. The company said on Wednesday it has 48 MAX 10s on order.""We're anxious that it gets approved,"" Minicucci said. ""Of course it has to be safe and certified appropriately but we'll be a big fan of the -10 when it comes out.""Boeing said on May 31 certification of the MAX 7 is taking a ""considerable amount of time"" due to new documentation requirements, but the planemaker still believes it can be approved by the end of the year.Both the MAX 7 and MAX 10 are seen as critical for Boeing to compete against Airbus for orders at the smaller and larger ends of the narrowbody market.Minicucci said Alaska has a good relationship with Boeing, which builds the MAX near its Seattle headquarters and has been transparent about supply chain issues.""They walked us through every production glitch that they've had,"" Minicucci said.

Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off.

QuoteDeal RationaleThe latest deal is expected to close in the second half of 2023, upon which it is expected to generate $1.8 billion in sale proceeds for PayPal.PayPal plans to use this fund for its general corporate financing and shareholders’ returns. It intends to increase its share repurchases by allocating around $1 billion to this purpose.The company also upgraded its outlook for 2023 share repurchases. Its total share repurchases are now expected to be worth $5 billion for 2023.We believe increasing share repurchase activities will instill investor optimism in the stock in the days ahead.PayPal has lost 3.2% on a year-to-date basis against the industry’s growth of 48.5%.PayPal’s BNPL EffortsPayPal’s robust BNPL offerings have made it one of the biggest BNPL players in the global market. Moreover, its strong BNPL portfolio makes it attractive to  customers as well as investors.Notably, it generated above $20 billion of BNPL payment volume globally in 2022, which was up approximately 160% from 2021.PayPal, which forayed into the BNPL market in 2020, now offers PayPal Pay Monthly, which lets customers break the total cost of their purchased item into monthly payments.Further, the company’s acquisition of Paidy — a Japan-based BNPL solution provider — remains noteworthy.The introduction of the Pay in 4 service — PayPal’s first BNPL solution in Australia — is another positive. The service is free of any interest, payment fees or sign-up fees.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, PayPal carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Palo Alto Networks PANW, NVIDIA NVDA and AMETEK AME.

During the pandemic, many created passive income by starting a side hustle like a YouTube channel or becoming a TikTok influencer. But those side hustles take a lot of work and there’s no guarantee of any actual income.What if you could get passive income by buying stocks that pay dividends? It’s still not easy, as you need cash to get started, but the dividends are paid out each quarter while you’re doing other things. That’s the very definition of “passive.”The Dividend AristocratsBut how do you know which company to buy shares in? There are some S&amp;P 500 companies that are called “dividend aristocrats.” It usually means companies that have paid dividends for several decades AND have raised the dividend every year during that time.In the case of ProShares S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrat ETF, the requirements include having paid dividends every year for 25 years AND having raised it every year during that time. The ProShares ETF currently has 66 companies that have this record.Story continuesBut what if you were to add the Zacks Ranks of #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) to the dividend aristocrats?You’d hopefully get rising earnings estimates too.3 Top Ranked Dividend Aristocrats1.      Cintas Corp. CTASCintas, the uniform company, has raised its dividend each year since 1983. That’s 40 years of payouts. Cintas is currently paying a yield of 0.9%.Cintas shares have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over the last 5 years. It’s up 157% versus just 60% for the S&amp;P 500. Cintas isn’t a cheap stock, with a forward P/E of 35.1.It’s a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.Should Cintas be on your short list for the dividend?2.      W.W. Grainger, Inc. GWWGrainger is a true dividend aristocrat. The broad line distributor, with business in North America, Japan and the United Kingdom, has raised its dividend 52 consecutive years. In April 2023, it raised it again, by 8%. Grainger’s dividend is currently yielding 1%.Over the last 5 years, shares of Grainger have outperformed the S&amp;P 500, rising 134.7% compared to 60% for the S&amp;P 500. It trades with a forward P/E of 20.4.Grainger is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Should Grainger be on your short list for the dividend?3.      Caterpillar Inc. CATCaterpillar, the large equipment manufacturer, has paid, and raised, its dividend for 28 years. It also has the largest yield of these three stocks, at 2%.Over the last 5 years, Caterpillar’s stock has jumped 72.7% which beats the S&amp;P 500’s performance by 12.7%. It’s also cheap, with a forward P/E of just 13.9.Caterpillar is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Shares of Caterpillar are up just 0.8% in 2023. Should Caterpillar be on your short list?2 Dividend Aristocrats with Big Dividend YieldsInvestors looking for dividend paying stocks, should be alert for stocks that have high dividend payouts. Sometimes an extra-large dividend, with a company that is not a commodities play, can indicate something unfavorable is going on behind the scenes at the company. Big dividend payouts aren’t always best.But what if a dividend aristocrat is also paying a big yield?1.      Walgreens Boots Alliance WBAWalgreens Boots Alliance has paid, and raised, its dividend for 47 years, first as Walgreens Company and then as the joint merged Walgreens Boots Alliance which has pharmacies worldwide and owns No7 Beauty Company.Walgreens Boots Alliance pays a dividend currently yielding 5.9%. Why so high? The shares have fallen 52% over the last 5 years, including 12.9% in 2023. It was recently trading at 5-year lows.Walgreens Boots Alliance is cheap, with a forward P/E of just 7.3. It reports earnings next week, on June 27, 2023.2.      IBM IBMIBM is a dividend aristocrat which has raised its dividend 28 years in a row. The technology giant currently pays a dividend yielding 4.8%.But shares of IBM are up just 1.2% over the last 5 years while the S&amp;P 500 was up 60% and competitors like Apple and Sony were up 301% and 91.4%, respectively.IBM is cheap with a forward P/E of just 14. Earnings are expected to be up just 2% in 2023, however.What Else do you Need to Know about Passive Income and Dividend Aristocrats?Listen to this week’s podcast to find out.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

During the pandemic, many created passive income by starting a side hustle like a YouTube channel or becoming a TikTok influencer. But those side hustles take a lot of work and there’s no guarantee of any actual income.What if you could get passive income by buying stocks that pay dividends? It’s still not easy, as you need cash to get started, but the dividends are paid out each quarter while you’re doing other things. That’s the very definition of “passive.”The Dividend AristocratsBut how do you know which company to buy shares in? There are some S&amp;P 500 companies that are called “dividend aristocrats.” It usually means companies that have paid dividends for several decades AND have raised the dividend every year during that time.In the case of ProShares S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrat ETF, the requirements include having paid dividends every year for 25 years AND having raised it every year during that time. The ProShares ETF currently has 66 companies that have this record.But what if you were to add the Zacks Ranks of #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) to the dividend aristocrats?You’d hopefully get rising earnings estimates too.3 Top Ranked Dividend Aristocrats1.      Cintas Corp. (CTAS)Cintas, the uniform company, has raised its dividend each year since 1983. That’s 40 years of payouts. Cintas is currently paying a yield of 0.9%.Story continuesCintas shares have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over the last 5 years. It’s up 157% versus just 60% for the S&amp;P 500. Cintas isn’t a cheap stock, with a forward P/E of 35.1.It’s a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.Should Cintas be on your short list for the dividend? 2.      W.W. Grainger, Inc. (GWW)Grainger is a true dividend aristocrat. The broad line distributor, with business in North America, Japan and the United Kingdom, has raised its dividend 52 consecutive years. In April 2023, it raised it again, by 8%. Grainger’s dividend is currently yielding 1%.Over the last 5 years, shares of Grainger have outperformed the S&amp;P 500, rising 134.7% compared to 60% for the S&amp;P 500. It trades with a forward P/E of 20.4.Grainger is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Should Grainger be on your short list for the dividend?3.      Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)Caterpillar, the large equipment manufacturer, has paid, and raised, its dividend for 28 years. It also has the largest yield of these three stocks, at 2%.Over the last 5 years, Caterpillar’s stock has jumped 72.7% which beats the S&amp;P 500’s performance by 12.7%. It’s also cheap, with a forward P/E of just 13.9.Caterpillar is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Shares of Caterpillar are up just 0.8% in 2023. Should Caterpillar be on your short list?2 Dividend Aristocrats with Big Dividend YieldsInvestors looking for dividend paying stocks, should be alert for stocks that have high dividend payouts. Sometimes an extra-large dividend, with a company that is not a commodities play, can indicate something unfavorable is going on behind the scenes at the company. Big dividend payouts aren’t always best.But what if a dividend aristocrat is also paying a big yield?1.      Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)Walgreens Boots Alliance has paid, and raised, its dividend for 47 years, first as Walgreens Company and then as the joint merged Walgreens Boots Alliance which has pharmacies worldwide and owns No7 Beauty Company.Walgreens Boots Alliance pays a dividend currently yielding 5.9%. Why so high? The shares have fallen 52% over the last 5 years, including 12.9% in 2023. It was recently trading at 5-year lows.Walgreens Boots Alliance is cheap, with a forward P/E of just 7.3. It reports earnings next week, on June 27, 2023.2.      IBM (IBM)IBM is a dividend aristocrat which has raised its dividend 28 years in a row. The technology giant currently pays a dividend yielding 4.8%.But shares of IBM are up just 1.2% over the last 5 years while the S&amp;P 500 was up 60% and competitors like Apple and Sony were up 301% and 91.4%, respectively.IBM is cheap with a forward P/E of just 14. Earnings are expected to be up just 2% in 2023, however.What Else do you Need to Know about Passive Income and Dividend Aristocrats?  Listen to this week’s podcast to find out. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In that same time, the Oils-Energy sector gained 1.09%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 4.86%.Marathon Petroleum will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be August 1, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Marathon Petroleum to post earnings of $4.77 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 55.04%.

Featuring the market performance of 500 of the largest companies listed on stock exchanges in the U.S., you’re dealing with proven winners. To be fair, you might not receive a blistering performance. At the same time, these ideas are less likely to leave you stranded on the road.In addition, ChatGPT points out that the best S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy offer diversification. Specifically, by acquiring undervalued securities within the index, investors can potentially benefit from the performance of a diverse range of companies and industries, mitigating risks associated with individual stocks or sectors.As well, the artificial intelligence-powered chatbot mentions the potential for reversion to fair value as a benefit for cheap S&amp;P 500 stocks. Basically, enterprises that are undervalued now may carry the potential to their fair value over time. As market inefficiencies correct themselves, undervalued stocks can experience price appreciation as the market recognizes their true worth. So, if you’re ready to start winning consistently, these may be the best S&amp;P 500 stocks for June.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsADMArcher Daniels Midland$74.56CFCF Industries$70.08BIIBBiogen$297.83SNASnap-On$274.27MPCMarathon Petroleum$113.83VLOValero Energy$114.03GDGeneral Dynamics4214.96Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comAn American multinational food processing and commodities trading corporation, Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) makes an excellent case for undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy. Fundamentally, no matter how advanced we become as a civilization, certain things will never change. Of course, the most critical is our need for nutritional sustenance. Thus, long-term investors may treat ADM’s loss of over 18% this year as irrationality.Story continuesNo matter, when the market is giving you one of the best S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy at a discount, you take it. Over the trailing one-year period, ADM slipped over 11%, which seems like overkill given the underlying relevance. More importantly, the market prices ADM at a forward multiple of only 10.55. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than 81.7% of the competition.It’s no slouch on the operational metrics either. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 16.4% (on a per-share basis), above 76.8% of its peers. Also, its Piotroski F-Score comes in at 7 out of 9, indicating solid operational efficiency. Thus, it’s easily one of the S&amp;P 500 stocks for June.CF Industries (CF)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Headquartered in Deerfield, Illinois, CF Industries (NYSE:CF) is an American manufacturer and distributor of agricultural fertilizers, including ammonia, urea, and ammonium nitrate products. Given the geopolitical flashpoint in Eastern Europe and implications for the global food supply chain, agricultural entities such as CF command extraordinary relevance. However, exposure to geopolitics has many investors worried, with CF shedding over 17% since the Jan. opener.Nevertheless, those with a patient view might consider the agro firm as one of the undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks. True, the present circumstances don’t seem enticing at all. Plus, in the past 365 days, CF stock gave up more than 26% of market value. Still, at some point, circumstances will eventually normalize. Plus, the red ink presents much food for thought.Mainly, the market now prices CF at a trailing multiple of 4.53. As a discount to earnings, CF ranks better than 90.61% of its peers. Also, shares now trade at a price-earnings-growth ratio of 0.12. In contrast, the sector median value stands at a loftier 0.72 times. Therefore, it’s worth consideration as one of the cheap S&amp;P 500 stocks.Biogen (BIIB)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comBased in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) is a multinational biotechnology firm specializing in the discovery, development, and delivery of therapies for the treatment of neurological diseases to patients worldwide. Thanks to its permanently relevant business, BIIB ranks among the best S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy. Since the Jan. opener, shares popped just over 10%.Despite its performance in the charts, however, BIIB also ranks among the undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks. At the moment, the market prices shares at a trailing multiple of 13.93. As a discount to earnings, Biogen ranks better than 72.7% of companies listed in the drug manufacturing industry. Also, BIIB trades at 0.95 times the projected free cash flow. In contrast, the underlying sector median value is 1.58 times.Just as well, the company benefits from excellent profitability metrics. For example, its trailing-year net margin clocks in at 31%, outflanking 95.87% of its rivals. With a Piotroski F-Score of 7 out of 9, Biogen delivers an operationally efficient business. Thus, it’s a solid candidate for S&amp;P 500 stocks with upside.Snap-on (SNA)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Best Speculative StocksSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comHailing from Kenosha, Wisconsin, Snap-on (NYSE:SNA) is an American designer, manufacturer, and marketer of high-end tools and equipment for professional use in the transportation industry. This includes solutions for automotive, heavy-duty, equipment, marine, aviation, and railroad industries. To be fair, SNA is one of the boring entities among undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks. Still, that shouldn’t be confused with underperforming.Since the beginning of this year, SNA gained over 18% of its equity value. In the trailing one-year period, it popped up over 33%. Thanks to its everyday relevance, Snap-on offers resilience and predictability for its stakeholders. Despite the robust gains, however, SNA offers a discount for those seeking S&amp;P 500 stocks for June.Notably, the market prices SNA at a forward multiple of 15.86. As a discount to projected earnings, Snap-on ranks better than 62.4% of companies listed in the industrial products sector. Also, SNA trades at 0.8 times discounted cash flow, ranking better than 60.2% of the competition.Marathon Petroleum (MPC)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Findlay, Ohio, Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) is a petroleum refining, marketing, and transportation firm. Mostly specializing in the downstream and midstream components of the hydrocarbon energy value chain, MPC could benefit from rising relevancies. As society continues to normalize, traffic volume should rise. On paper, this framework should benefit MPC.So far, though, the market doesn’t really seem to appreciate this thesis. Since the Jan. opener, MPC gained less than 1%. Nevertheless, this lack of mobility in the charts might make MPC one of the undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks. Significantly, the market prices Marathon shares at a forward multiple of 6.08. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than nearly 63% of its oil and gas peers.Also, MPC trades at 0.32 times sales. In contrast, the sector median stands at 0.91 times. That’s noteworthy because Marathon’s three-year revenue growth rate clocks in at 27.1%, above 80.28% of its rivals. As well, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period pings at 60.9%. Thus, it’s a great idea for cheap S&amp;P 500 stocks with upside potential.Valero Energy (VLO)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comA downstream petroleum specialist, Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) mostly focuses on manufacturing and marketing transportation fuels. As well, it produces other petrochemical products and power. As with Marathon Petroleum above, Valero should benefit from rising social normalization trends. However, the market has a dim view of VLO, with shares fading nearly 7%. Over the trailing one-year period, it’s down almost 13%.Still, the red ink might make Valero one of the compelling undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy. On the valuation front, the market prices VLO at a forward multiple of 5.26. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than 71.08% of its oil and gas compatriots. Also, shares trade at 0.25 times sales. In contrast, the sector median again stands at 0.91 times.Nevertheless, Valero performs very well on the operational side. Its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 19.4%, above nearly 70% of its peers. Also, its Piotroski F-Score lands at a perfect 9 out of 9, indicating superior operational efficiency. Combined with an Altman Z-Score of 5.77 (indicating low bankruptcy risk), VLO makes a strong case for the best S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy.General Dynamics (GD)image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocksSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.comAlthough a bit on the controversial side for some investors for its aerospace and defense business, General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) technically meets the qualifications for undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks. Despite its relevant business profile – and gaining relevance, unfortunately – the market doesn’t believe in GD stock. Since the start of the year, shares tumbled nearly 15%. Over the past 365 days, GD is almost 3% below parity.Nevertheless, rising instability in the geopolitical realm could see demand for General Dynamics rise. In the meantime, the market prices GD at a forward multiple of 16.82. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than 66.67% of enterprises in the aerospace and defense industry. Also, GD trades hands at 14.43 times operating cash flow. In contrast, the sector median stat is 18.89 times.Aside from its value proposition, General Dynamics enjoys strong profitability metrics. Its trailing-year net margin clocks in at 8.5%, above 70.76% of its peers. Also, it’s worth mentioning that its Piotroski F-Score lands at 7 out of 9, indicating decent operational efficiency. Overall, then, it makes a solid case for S&amp;P 500 stocks for June.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Investors, one analyst contends, are viewing the company as a safe bet on AI technology.“It’s kind of like the markets are finally realizing the full value of the software that they've been developing for a long time that a lot of people have been saying is going to be incredibly valuable,” Gerber Kawasaki Wealth &amp; Investment Management CEO Ross Gerber told Yahoo Finance Live (video above).Tesla's stock opened at $260 on Tuesday, the highest since September. In the past two weeks alone, Tesla is up a healthy 12%.For years, Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk have said AI, which is at the center of the firm's self-driving software tech, is one big reason to pay attention to the EV company. That drum keeps beating. For example: Last September, the company held an “AI Day” where execs spoke about the self-driving Autopilot software, a prototype robot named Optimus, and its high-performance Dojo hardware, which has the capability to train Tesla’s AI on videos filmed by the vehicles.Also fueling the Tesla AI hype is a new wave of excitement about the company’s robotaxi concept, a potential ride-sharing service that relies on autonomous driving technology. Tom Narayan, lead equity analyst, global autos at RBC Capital Markets told Yahoo Finance Live last week that robotaxis could make up 70% of Tesla’s future value.“It's really nice that everybody's into AI, but this has been going on for a long time,” Gerber said of Tesla’s push into the AI conversation.That said, there are still some serious challenges ahead: Tesla's Autopilot has been involved in hundreds of crashes, demonstrating that the technology is not yet perfect and there may be a few bumps in the road ahead.For years, Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk have pushed AI as a reason to work for the EV company. (Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images) (Chesnot via Getty Images)That aside, Gerber said he is seeing other signs of optimism when it comes to Tesla’s stock. Gerber – who criticized Musk in recent months for his role at Twitter – said “institutional investors” have returned since Musk stepped down as CEO of the social network a month ago and increased his focus on Tesla.Story continuesMore good news: Tesla is signing on new partners to its Supercharger network across the United States and Canada. Rivian (RIVN) joined on Tuesday, following Ford (F) and GM (GM) in expanding the number of EVs that can use Tesla's chargers. Tesla's partnerships with competitors will increase its control over the business of EV charging—another plus for shareholders.""We just have seen full fledge how Elon's focus makes such a huge difference in the results,"" Gerber said.

Now, instead of waiting in line to talk to an agent or search for new options, the airline's new self-service tool automatically presents travelers personalized re-booking options, bag tracking information and meal and hotel vouchers when eligible if their flight is delayed or canceled.United’s New App Feature Helps Customers Re-book and Receive Meal and Hotel Vouchers AutomaticallyWhile United had the lowest mainline flight and seat cancellation rates of any airline in the country during the first three months of the year, the carrier still has the most flights impacted by weather given the location of its major domestic hubs.According to the airline, nearly 50% of its customers already turn to the app or united.com to self-serve during disruptions, so United began beta testing the new feature at the end of last year. United found that customers responded well to having alternate travel options automatically served to them in the app and that airport employees appreciated reducing the number of people physically waiting in line.""Our goal is to get our customers to their destination on time, but we know things don't always go as planned and that's when a tool like this can make a real difference,"" said Linda Jojo, Chief Customer Officer for United. ""Our new mobile app feature offers more transparency, saves time and reduces stress for our customers, and it shortens lines at customer service desks so our employees can better assist passengers with complex issues or questions. Plus, it's another example of United's continued investment in new technology and tools.""When a flight is delayed by more than 60 minutes or canceled, customers will automatically see options for delays and cancellations on the home screen of the United mobile app. Here's how it works:Story continuesGet notified: Click the link in the automatic text notification or enter flight details in the mobile app or united.com to open the tool. For customers who have their reservation already loaded in the app, they'll see a prompt right on the home screen.Check flight and re-booking status: Confirm the status of your flight and see if you've been re-booked. Customers also have the option to look at other flight options and book based on their preference.Track your bags: Follow the status of your checked luggage to see when it is checked-in, loaded on your flight and received at your final destination.View eligible vouchers: Receive hotel, meal and/or rideshare vouchers if eligible.Connect to a United customer service agent virtually: Call, text or video chat with one of hundreds of United agents who can offer the same assistance as the agents at the airport.For those without the United mobile app, the self-service tool is accessible on a mobile device or computer at united.com, and customers still have the option to connect in-person with a customer service agent.This new feature is the latest way United uses technology to give travelers more transparency and improve the customer experience. For years, the airline has led the industry on implementing new technologies and policies across its operation to increase customer transparency, including:Free family seating: United is the first and only airline to offer a dynamic seat map feature that makes it easier to seat children under 12-years-old next to an adult in their party for free – even travelers in Basic Economy.Automatic customer communications: United sends personalized, real-time updates via text notifications with timely information about boarding, gate location, travel disruptions, bag tracking and more, providing awareness into flight plans or status.Flexible refunds and travel credits: United offers a 24-hour flexible booking policy, and in September 2021, United launched more self-service options to easily find, apply and combine credits at check-out.No change fees: In August 2020, United got rid of change fees, offering more flexibility for travel plans, and started complimentary standby travel, becoming the only U.S. airline that lets all customers in all classes of service fly same-day standby for free.For more information, download the United mobile app here, and view media assets here.About UnitedAt United, Good Leads The WaySM.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this airline have returned +10.1%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry, which United falls in, has gained 15.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, United is expected to post earnings of $3.77 per share, indicating a change of +163.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.3% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $9.13 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +262.3%. This estimate has changed -0.6% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.38 indicates a change of +13.6% from what United is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for United.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of United, the consensus sales estimate of $13.96 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +15.3%. The $52.93 billion and $56 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +17.7% and +5.8%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUnited reported revenues of $11.43 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +51.1%. EPS of -$0.63 for the same period compares with -$4.24 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.42 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.07%. The EPS surprise was +13.7%.Over the last four quarters, United surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.United is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about United. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Union Pacific (UNP) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.83 a share, just 29 days from its upcoming earnings release on July 20, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $2.83 Most Accurate Estimate and the $2.78 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Union Pacific has an Earnings ESP of 1.8%.UNP is part of a big group of Transportation stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at United Airlines (UAL) as well.Slated to report earnings on July 19, 2023, United Airlines holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $4.11 a share 28 days from its next quarterly update.United Airlines' Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 9.07% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.77.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, UNP and UAL could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

A bunch of them together penned an open letter to Target CEO Brian Cornell on June 16, urging him to reverse the removals.While the AGs commended Target’s intention to keep staff and customers safe from verbal, and at times physical, attacks, they encouraged the Minneapolis-based big-box retailer to restock the nixed goods. “Against this backdrop, Pride merchandise like Target’s helps LGBTQIA+ people see that they enjoy considerable support and that loud and intimidating fringe voices and bullies do not represent the views of society at large,” they wrote.Read moreAll the sports that are part of Saudi Arabia's sportswashing planGoogle has officially changed its mind about remote workHow many UBI trials do we need to prove giving away money works?And they instilled some judicial credence in their argument. All the 14 states that signed off on the letter—Massachusetts, Minnesota, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, plus the District of Columbia—“have laws protecting against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in places of public accommodation like Target stores,” the signatories affirmed.The legal vote of confident is crucial at a time when the tides are turning against the queer community in the US. State laws imposing restrictions such as banning public schools from discussing LGBTQIA+ identity, prohibiting children’s participation at drag shows, ending gender-affirming care for children as well as limiting transgender sports participation, are all creating a hostile environmental for the community.Quotable: Target should double down on inclusivity“We urge Target to double down on inclusivity, reject hate in all its forms, and stand firm in the face of intimidation and discrimination. We hope that we can work together with Target to create a welcoming space where members of this community, including Target staff and customers, can express themselves in the joyful spirit of Pride.” —Attorney Generals in the June 16 open letterStory continuesTarget’s retreat after anti-LGBTQIA+ attacksIn the past, Target has faced ample right-wing backlash for removing gender labels from kids clothing, not separating “boy” and “girl” toys, and installing gender neutral bathrooms. But the company has stood by its inclusive moves.The attorney generals echoed activists’ clarion calls in the aftermath of Target pulling products. Human Rights Campaign president Kelley Robinson urged Target to “put the products back on the shelves and ensure their Pride displays are visible on the floors, not pushed into the proverbial closet.”Sarah Kate Ellis, president and CEO of advocacy group GLAAD, warned that the only way anti-LGBTQ violence and hate won’t win in America is if corporate leaders “do not cave to fringe activists calling for censorship.”Pulling products sets a dangerous precedent that bigoted backlash can force brands into submission. Just look at what happened after Bud Light mishandled the fallout from conservative customers’ rage at the beer brand partnering with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. But there’s an alternative, like the Nike way. The sportswear brand, which also partnered with Mulvaney, did not seek to distance itself from the trans activist when it faced backlash in the form of the “Burn Bra Challenge” on TikTok. Instead, it doubled down on its support for the trans influencer, urging people to “Be kind, be inclusive … Encourage each other.”A brief timeline of Target’s pride merch walkbackMay 10: A misleading post by Gays Against Groomers, which the Anti-Defamation League has labeled a group that “peddles dangerous and misleading narratives about the LGBTQ+ community,” falsely claims that Target’s “tuck-friendly” adult swimsuits, for trans people who have not had gender-affirming operations, were also available in the kids’ section.May 23: Target pulls some Pride collection merch from its June Pride Month catalog after a number of customers had violent confrontations with store staff. The axed designs are three products by London-based company Abprallen’s with three queer and trans-positive captions: “We belong everywhere,” “Too queer for here,” and “Cure transphobia, not trans people.”Even where products aren’t entirely removed from the shop floor, products are moved to the back and big displays shrunk to a third of their size.Target CEO Cornell ends the day by penning a letter to employees, in which he calls the violence in the aisles“gut-wrenching” and expresses commitment to the LGBT community—albeit in talk and not action.May 24: Erik Carnell, the trans designer behind Abprallen, whose products were taken off shelves, urges people to disengage with the Target fiasco and instead support local business and organize to show up for the community on his Instagram stories.June 16: The various attorney generals show support and ask Target to refrain from pulling Pride line products.Related stories🫣 Target’s Pride collection is the latest casualty of increasing intolerance💗 Pride month collections represent a moment of truth for companies courting the pink dollar🏳️‍🌈 A Florida restaurant is suing DeSantis to keep hosting family-friendly drag showsMore from QuartzWhat's next for student loans if SCOTUS knocks down Biden's debt forgiveness?How to manage ADHD—and leverage its benefits—at workSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

The Yahoo Finance Live team breaks down why these sales are such a big deal both to the companies and the economy.Video TranscriptJOSH SCHAFER: Welcome back to Yahoo Finance. Josh Schafer here with Alexandra Canal and Pras Subramanian. We're breaking down some of the top trending stories of the day that we have had our eyes on. Guys, I've had my eyes on Amazon Prime Day and Target Circle Day just announced today.They're going to be happening in a couple of weeks now in that July 10th week, kind of the week after the 4th of July. Obviously, have our eyes on that because there are big moments for those companies. I was looking into those numbers. We'll get into those numbers in a little bit, kind of how much they matter for a company like Amazon.But, I guess, just at a high level, I am not someone that gets excited about Amazon Prime Day, which is why I wanted to talk about it. I don't love the deals. I don't think they're that good. I think they're just steering you to buy Amazon products, which is fine. But I'm not a big Amazon product person. Are you guys Prime Day people, Target people going to go do some pickup or no?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Well, I would say I have dabbled in Prime Day in the past. But like you said, the only real deal That I think I found was the Amazon Alexa. I did it for a Christmas gift I think for my younger brother. You can get more than 50% off the Alexa devices. That to me is a good deal. Other than that, I'm not some person that goes and searches for these big mega deals. And personally, I don't think they have a ton of that for Prime. However, I know it's a big shopping day for a lot of consumers.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, you know, and I noticed, Josh, we're looking at today. The website for Prime has like a live streaming box in there. People like talking about, check out these noise machines. Check out this new this, like pumping gadgets like--Story continuesALEXANDRA CANAL: Overwhelming.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I mean, is it just them clearing out inventory they don't want anymore. I don't know. But, you know, we were surprised also by the effect of how big Prime Day is for Amazon sales. I didn't know how big it was. Yeah, I know you got data for that.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, I was looking into that. I was very surprised. They said last year they accounted for about 400 basis points to the upside in sales for the quarter. So this will be in Amazon's third quarter earnings, which I thought was very interesting. That's 4% obviously, to the upside, very big for them.And I was reading back to last year, just seeing different commentary. Wells Fargo said in the July retail sales, Amazon Prime Day, they specifically called it out. They wrote a whole paragraph on it. And that contributed to positive retail sales for the month of July.Interesting to think about when we've been talking consistently about that consumer, right? Are we going to see the consumer slow down? Are we going to see the consumer slow down? But we haven't seen those retail sales number. And maybe Prime Day actually sort of boosts it again in July.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: That's when I quickly, 63% of Americans are Prime.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Not as great.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I mean, so that's like half the population, over half is eligible for the sale. So I'm not surprised it's so big, but the question, are you going to buy the little like heart rate monitor.JOSH SCHAFER: 40% off a TV. 40% off a TV was like a headline one for me.

""It's frankly easy for me because [Delta CEO Ed Bastian] is so clear that our values as Delta are not for sale and that he's willing to step into situations and issues that are not always popular, certainly by among a 100 percent of our constituents.""But as the US braces for another presidential election in 2024, marketing execs at Delta and elsewhere are preparing to walk an even narrower tightrope when it comes to corporate messaging.""It would be naive to think that ’24 is not gonna be the most divisive kind of vitriolic narrative that we've seen,"" Mapes said. ""But I always think that the beautiful thing about communication, and what we do as marketing, is the answer to all of that is more communication, right? Getting out and sharing what is it that you believe in — what do you stand for? And let the chips fall where they may, but you've gotta be true to yourself.""Delta chief marketing officer speaks with Brad Smith and Brian Sozzi at Cannes, France. (Yahoo Finance)It's 'much easier' to stand firm on corporate valuesUnder Bastian's leadership, Delta has not made a point of being outspoken, but it also hasn't shied away from certain hot-button issues.In 2021, for instance, Georgia's House of Representatives threatened to remove some of Delta's tax breaks after Bastian spoke out against the state's new voting restrictions. The airline has also made efforts to celebrate its LGBTQ employees, such as hosting an Atlanta Pride festival event in October 2022, and has made strides toward greater diversity, equity, and inclusion in its operations.At the same time, companies such as Disney (DIS), Target (TGT), and Bud Light maker ABInBev (BUD) have been seen as fumbling in their attempts to expand customer bases and communicate with their audiences.Story continuesBud Light has faced declining sales after some US consumers boycotted the brand after transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney endorsed the light beer on Instagram in April. Target also came under fire after it pulled LGBTQ-themed merchandise, prompting a wider backlash among those who saw the move as wavering on Target's commitment to underrepresented groups.""I think some of the instances we've seen recently are people who go out with one thing and then backtrack and flip and flop, and then they, frankly, alienate both sides,"" Mapes said. ""It's much easier to be really clear what you stand for.""""And to the extent others aren't for that, that's just gonna have to be OK because strategy is as much what you're not going to do as what you are going to do or be,"" Mapes added. ""And so, 90,000 Delta people are quite clear about where we are, what we stand for, and it accelerates decision-making throughout the company.""—Brad Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

However, a volatile office market landscape and a high interest rate environment present significant challenge.Boston Properties concentrates on a few select high-rent, high barrier-to-entry geographic markets of Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC and is well-poised to benefit from the flight-to-quality preference of office tenants.The company enjoys a diverse tenant base across industries, which includes several forerunners. As of Mar 31, 2023, the weighted average remaining lease term for its 20 largest clients, based on leased square footage, was 10.4 years. The long-term leases with such tenants with a solid credit profile ensure stable revenue generation for the company. We estimate revenues from lease to improve 3.4% in 2023.Moreover, BXP’s life-science assets have been witnessing solid demand on the back of the growing need for drug research and innovation, aiding leasing activity. Amid this, the company is converting numerous straight office buildings to laboratory/life science spaces in its suburban portfolio, especially its Kendall Center project, which is one of the leading preferred locations for life-science clients in the world.Boston Properties has a healthy balance-sheet position with ample liquidity. As of May 4, 2023, the company had $3.2 billion of liquidity. The company’s share of net debt to EBITDAre (annualized) was 7.78X, while the fixed charge coverage ratio was 2.67 times as of Mar 31, 2023. Given its solid operating platform and prudent financial management, the company is well-poised to navigate any economic uncertainties.However, the choppy macroeconomic environment amid inflation woes and high interest rates has softened demand in all of Boston Properties’ markets as tenants are adopting a cautious approach and refraining from making new commitments. Moreover, the U.S. office real estate market continues to struggle from the aftereffects of the health crisis, with negative absorption and high vacancy levels. The lackluster environment can be attributed to the pandemic-led job cuts and remote-working models, which have diminished office space utilization.In first-quarter 2023, Boston Properties’ in-service portfolio occupancy fell 50 basis points year over year to 88.6%. We project in-service portfolio occupancy to be 88.7% for 2023.Additionally, elevated interest rates imply high borrowing costs for the company, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate. It has a substantial debt burden and its share of debt as of Mar 31, 2023, was approximately $15 billion. We expect 2023 interest expenses to rise 19.4% year over year.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 8.3% over the past three months against the industry’s rise of 3.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 funds from operations (FFO) per share has decreased by 0.7% over the past month to 7.16.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Ventas VTR and Host Hotels &amp; Resorts HST.

After a replacement is named, Rentler will stay on board in an advisory role though the end of March 2027.Rentler has served as CEO and board member of Ross Stores since 2014 and has served as vice chair of the board since 2021. Prior to that, she served as president and chief merchandising officer of Ross between 2009 and 2014. Between 2006 and 2009, she served as EVP of merchandising.

However, the off-price retailer is also in a position to offer value for consumers looking to save money. In the first quarter, Ross reported earnings per share of $1.09, with net earnings of $371 million, compared to last year’s Q1 earnings per share of $0.97 and net income of $338 million. Q1 sales were $4.5 billion, up from $4.3 billion in Q1 of 2022, with comparable store sales up 1 percent.“We remain focused on delivering the most compelling bargains possible while diligently managing expenses and inventory to maximize our opportunities for growth,” Rentler said in a call with analysts discussing results for the first quarter.Story continuesAt the same time, Ross is forging ahead with an ambitious store expansion plan. The retailer in March said it was targeting roughly 100 new store openings in fiscal 2023.

If you want to skip our analysis of the hospitality market and want to check out the top profitable Airbnb cities, head on over to 5 Most Profitable Airbnb Cities in the World. The growth in internet connectivity, aided particularly by the mobility offered by the smartphone, has disrupted several key traditional industries. Some of these are media, finance, communications, and hospitality.Within the hospitality sector, applications such as Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) have provided travelers with opportunities to not only avail accommodations that provide a closer 'feel' to the cities that they're visiting but also enabled them to travel to more places than they might have been able to otherwise due to a lack of hotel coverage.In fact, key markets being unserved by hotels is actually quite larger in scope than you might believe. For instance, today's economic hotshot, the Republic of India which is the world's second most populous nation and one of the biggest economies in the world is also one of the biggest underserved hotel markets on the planet. Data from Colliers Hong Kong shows that while India expects around thirty million tourists a year by 2030, the country has a mere 2.6 million hotel rooms. Mind you, these hotel rooms are not only for foreign tourists and have to also account for the needs of domestic travelers. This shortage and the resulting focus on the sector particularly by the Indian government has led hospitality giants such as Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) and the Radisson Hotel Group to significantly expand their presence in the country.Another underserved hotel market, quite surprisingly is Japan. The world's third largest economy is also home to the most populous city on the planet, Tokyo. Yet, luxury hotels in Japan are not as numerous as the demand for them would necessitate. Out of the three thousand hotels in Tokyo in 2019, only five had been awarded five stars by Forbes during the same year. This is despite the fact that the number of foreign visitors to Japan has more than tripled between 2010 and 2018, but the hotel industry fails to meet the demand for luxury hotels since most properties are quite old and require costly maintenance to bring them up to luxury standards. As of 2023, there are 56 luxury hotels in Japan, which are quite few compared to the 117 in China or even 68 in Indonesia.Story continuesAt the same time, companies like Airbnb and Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE)'s Vrbo offer travelers a chance to experience a home-like environment during their journey. Looking at the best Airbnb locations in the world, according to data from the company itself, the best Airbnb destination based on searches on the platform was Bangkok, Thailand. And for 2023, Airbnb believes that Madrid, Sydney, and Melbourne might be some cities worth checking out. But what if you were interested in buying an Airbnb and one that was away from the hustle and bustle of large city life? Well, some great small town locations for Airbnb investment that might be worth your while include Bend, Oregon; Ithaca, New York; Bay Arbor, Michigan; Grand Lake, Colorado; and Kenai, Alaska. However, as you'll find out below, it's often the big cities that have the highest rentals. So if you're looking to invest in Airbnb for 2023, its own summer travel forecast outlines that Bali, Indonesia; Barcelona, Spain; London, United Kingdom; Rouen, France; and Grindelwald, Spain, are some hot destinations right now.However, not everyone is willing to make a significant commitment as buying a new apartment or house. Well, a capital free method of making money from Airbnb is arbitrage. This involves renting a place and then putting it up on Airbnb - allowing the renter to earn some money while also making sure to keep up with rental payments. Finding the best cities for Airbnb arbitrage is more of a science. It first involves looking at the supply of rental units in a city, then ensuring the landlord is comfortable with subletting, and finally determining the right amount of investment in furniture and other amenities to get started on the Airbnb journey. According to the Airbnb analytics site Airbtics, some of the best U.S. cities for Airbnb arbitrage are San Antonio, New York City, Las Vegas, San Diego, Chicago, and Miami.But before considering an Airbnb investment, it's worth it to take a look at how the market is performing. On this front, the firm's management shared in its first quarter of 2023 earnings conference:We’re building the foundation for new products and services that we plan to launch in 2024 and beyond. At the same time, Airbnb is still underpenetrated in many markets around the world. So we’re increasing our focus on these less mature markets, and we are already seeing positive results. So let me just give you 2 examples. In Germany and Brazil, we rolled out our expansion playbook for accelerated growth.And as a result, we are now 2 — they are now 2 of our fastest-growing markets. And this playbook has, in fact, worked so well. So we are now expanding it to other markets around the world. Now before we go to questions, I want to talk a little bit about our 2023 Summer Release. Last week, we introduced the most extensive set of improvements ever to Airbnb, and it was all based on feedback from our community. We took a design-driven approach to perfecting our core service. We created a blueprint of the entire experience: every screen, every policy and every interaction with customer service. We then analyzed millions of calls and thousands of social media posts. And we hosted listening sessions with guests and hosts all over the world. And we mapped all this feedback against our blueprint and we prioritized the most common issues.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the most profitable Airbnb cities in the world.15 Most Profitable Airbnb Cities in the WorldOur Methodology To compile our list of the most profitable Airbnb cities in the world, we first made a list of more than sixty cities popular across a multitude of web sources for Airbnb investment. Then, the approximate average rental for a one bedroom apartment in each of these was calculated. The top 25 Airbnb cities were then selected. Then, the approximate average one bedroom apartment price in each city was determined. Finally, the number of years that would take to recover the average apartment price was determined and the cities with the lowest years were selected as the most profitable Airbnb cities in the world.15 Most Profitable Airbnb Cities in the World15. Ann Arbor, USANumber of Approximate Years To Recover Investment: 13.44Ann Arbor is a city in the U.S. state of Michigan.

Naturally, it has its top pick of luxury hotels, including Marriott's Ritz Carlton.10. Hilo, USANumber of Approximate Years To Recover Investment: 10.34Hilo is a settlement in the U.S. tropical state of Hawaii. It is quite a small area, with a population of 44,186 - making it ripe for an Airbnb especially as few big hotel players have a presence there.9.

Although there appeared to be no definite trigger for the sudden slide, the strong undercurrent of uncertain market conditions likely played the lead role behind the descent. The focus has now shifted to the Federal Reserve’s Jul 25-26 policy meeting, which is likely to be another potential market catalyst.The equity market rally was primarily triggered by the Fed’s decision to hit a pause button for its aggressive rate hike regime and maintain its benchmark interest rate in the range of 5-5.25%. The pause was largely driven by a slowdown in inflation, which recorded 4.1% annual growth in May, significantly down from its peak value of 9.1% in June 2022. Retail sales, which are not adjusted for inflation, improved 0.3% month over month against broad-based expectations of a 0.2% decline. On a year-over-year basis, it jumped 1.6% as consumers continued to spend.The latest New York state factory activity data further showed a surprise rebound in orders and shipments in June, portraying economic strength. The markets were also propelled by a better-than-expected May jobs report that allayed the fears of recession from the near-term horizon to at least until 2024. The jobs report revealed that payrolls in the public and private sectors increased by 339,000 in May, significantly higher than broad-based expectations of a 190,000 rise. However, markets continued to be under stress as Fed indicated that two more rate hikes are likely to take place later this year.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they can benefit from “cash cow” stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. Marriott International, Inc. MAR, Suzano S.A. SUZ, Atkore Inc. ATKR, Nexstar Media Group, Inc. NXST and Triton International Limited TRTN are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.Story continuesWhy ROE?ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Parameters Used for ScreeningIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash-rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow lesser than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for $1 of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow-generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the seven stocks that qualified the screen:Marriott: Headquartered in Bethesda, MD, Marriott is a leading worldwide hospitality company focused on lodging management and franchising. As of year-end 2022, the company's portfolio encompassed nearly 8,300 properties under 30 leading brands spanning 138 countries and territories.It has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 15.5% and delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 8%, on average.

While prices have eased slightly, higher mortgage rates are hurting affordability, and many of those who already own a home are not incentivized to list. As a result, the total number of home sales (projected to be down 15.8% to 4.2 million) is likely to be at its lowest point since 2012. On the rental side, prices are expected to drop slightly on the year (-0.9%), as strong multi-family construction is improving inventory.""High inflation and the Fed's actions to curb it have had a significant impact on the housing market this year. And while inflation has begun to ease, the sustained spike in mortgage rates was enough to stifle the housing market after several years of low rates and strong activity,"" said Realtor.com® Chief Economist Danielle Hale. ""The housing market has really seen a double whammy in 2023, with a retrenchment in the number of homes for sale coupled with still-high prices and mortgage rates that have kept both first-time and repeat buyers on the sidelines.""Revised 2023 Housing ForecastHousing IndicatorRealtor.com® 2023 Revised ForecastRealtor.com® 2023 Forecast (Nov. 2022)2022 Historical DataMortgage RatesAverage 6.4% throughout the year, 6.1% by end of yearAverage 7.4% throughout the year, 7.1% by end of yearAverage 5.3%, 6.7% at end of yearExisting Home Median Sales Price Appreciation- 0.6 %+5.4 %+10.2 %Existing Home Sales- 15.8%4.2 million-14.1%4.5 million-17.8%5.0 millionExisting Home For-Sale Inventory- 5 %+22.8 %Single-Family Home Housing Starts-19.6%0.8 million-5.4%0.9 million -10.6%1.0 million Homeownership Rate65.7 %65.7 %65.8 %Rent Change-0.9 %+6.3 %+10.9 %Affordability improving, but still a long way to goHome prices have been supported by persistent underbuilding relative to household growth over the last decade, but low affordability has had an outsized impact on demand. As a result, Realtor.com® now expects a modest decline in home prices of 0.6% for the year. The expectation is that mortgage rates will also be slightly lower than originally anticipated, but not low enough to bring down buying costs until the end of the year. As inflation is expected to cool gradually, we expect that mortgage rates will start to do the same beginning mid-year and nearing 6% by the end of the year. For the year as a whole, the cost of a mortgage is expected to be up 10.5% compared to 2022.Story continuesMortgage rate lock-in effect impacting inventoryRealtor.com® expects home sales to decline 15.8% in 2023 for a total of about 4.2 million sales for the year, the smallest annual total since 2012. Mortgage rate lock-in has been a stronger factor than initially expected, and the number of homes for sale has not met initial projections. As a result, the expectation now is for inventory levels to slip 5% for the year, and not the growth projected in the initial forecast.""The vast majority of homeowners locked in low rates during the pandemic and aren't particularly excited to give them up in order to buy a new home, unless they really need to move for personal reasons,"" said Hale.Rental prices pull backChallenging conditions in the housing market will lead many to continue renting, driving ongoing demand for rentals through the second half of 2023. However, the strong uptick in new multi-family construction and people choosing to stay in their unit in order to save money is likely to decrease competition for new units and lead to a slight annual decline in rental prices (-0.9%). However, despite this pull-back, rental prices are still historically high with the average rent about $350 more than it was pre-pandemic.Other economic factors to considerDespite the Fed's tightening, the economy and labor markets have shown resilience. And while paychecks haven't kept pace with inflation, Americans have dipped into pandemic savings and continued to spend money. While this is boosting the current economy, it could have an impact in the future if consumers burn through savings and need to rely on high-interest debt.About Realtor.com®Realtor.com® is an open real estate marketplace built for everyone.

230,7e75f8e5-9fed-307c-a5f6-acf76b2d7c81,SNA,2023-06-22,Snap-On (SNA) Could Be a Great Choice,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/snap-sna-could-great-choice-154506424.html,1687362306,STORY,['SNA'],"[Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Snap-On in FocusHeadquartered in Kenosha, Snap-On (SNA) is a Consumer Discretionary stock that has seen a price change of 19.49% so far this year. Currently paying a dividend of $1.62 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 2.37%. In comparison, the Tools - Handheld industry's yield is 0.79%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.7%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $6.48 is up 10.2% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Snap-On has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 14.80%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Snap-On's current payout ratio is 37%. This means it paid out 37% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for SNA for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $17.74 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 5.47%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that SNA is not only an attractive dividend play, but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Thus, long-term investors may treat ADM’s loss of over 18% this year as irrationality.Story continuesNo matter, when the market is giving you one of the best S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy at a discount, you take it. Over the trailing one-year period, ADM slipped over 11%, which seems like overkill given the underlying relevance. More importantly, the market prices ADM at a forward multiple of only 10.55. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than 81.7% of the competition.It’s no slouch on the operational metrics either. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 16.4% (on a per-share basis), above 76.8% of its peers. Also, its Piotroski F-Score comes in at 7 out of 9, indicating solid operational efficiency. Thus, it’s easily one of the S&amp;P 500 stocks for June.CF Industries (CF)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Headquartered in Deerfield, Illinois, CF Industries (NYSE:CF) is an American manufacturer and distributor of agricultural fertilizers, including ammonia, urea, and ammonium nitrate products. Given the geopolitical flashpoint in Eastern Europe and implications for the global food supply chain, agricultural entities such as CF command extraordinary relevance. However, exposure to geopolitics has many investors worried, with CF shedding over 17% since the Jan. opener.Nevertheless, those with a patient view might consider the agro firm as one of the undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks. True, the present circumstances don’t seem enticing at all. Plus, in the past 365 days, CF stock gave up more than 26% of market value. Still, at some point, circumstances will eventually normalize. Plus, the red ink presents much food for thought.Mainly, the market now prices CF at a trailing multiple of 4.53. As a discount to earnings, CF ranks better than 90.61% of its peers. Also, shares now trade at a price-earnings-growth ratio of 0.12. In contrast, the sector median value stands at a loftier 0.72 times. Therefore, it’s worth consideration as one of the cheap S&amp;P 500 stocks.Biogen (BIIB)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comBased in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) is a multinational biotechnology firm specializing in the discovery, development, and delivery of therapies for the treatment of neurological diseases to patients worldwide. Thanks to its permanently relevant business, BIIB ranks among the best S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy. Since the Jan. opener, shares popped just over 10%.Despite its performance in the charts, however, BIIB also ranks among the undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks. At the moment, the market prices shares at a trailing multiple of 13.93. As a discount to earnings, Biogen ranks better than 72.7% of companies listed in the drug manufacturing industry. Also, BIIB trades at 0.95 times the projected free cash flow. In contrast, the underlying sector median value is 1.58 times.Just as well, the company benefits from excellent profitability metrics. For example, its trailing-year net margin clocks in at 31%, outflanking 95.87% of its rivals. With a Piotroski F-Score of 7 out of 9, Biogen delivers an operationally efficient business. Thus, it’s a solid candidate for S&amp;P 500 stocks with upside.Snap-on (SNA)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Best Speculative StocksSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comHailing from Kenosha, Wisconsin, Snap-on (NYSE:SNA) is an American designer, manufacturer, and marketer of high-end tools and equipment for professional use in the transportation industry. This includes solutions for automotive, heavy-duty, equipment, marine, aviation, and railroad industries. To be fair, SNA is one of the boring entities among undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks. Still, that shouldn’t be confused with underperforming.Since the beginning of this year, SNA gained over 18% of its equity value. In the trailing one-year period, it popped up over 33%. Thanks to its everyday relevance, Snap-on offers resilience and predictability for its stakeholders. Despite the robust gains, however, SNA offers a discount for those seeking S&amp;P 500 stocks for June.Notably, the market prices SNA at a forward multiple of 15.86. As a discount to projected earnings, Snap-on ranks better than 62.4% of companies listed in the industrial products sector. Also, SNA trades at 0.8 times discounted cash flow, ranking better than 60.2% of the competition.Marathon Petroleum (MPC)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Findlay, Ohio, Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) is a petroleum refining, marketing, and transportation firm. Mostly specializing in the downstream and midstream components of the hydrocarbon energy value chain, MPC could benefit from rising relevancies. As society continues to normalize, traffic volume should rise. On paper, this framework should benefit MPC.So far, though, the market doesn’t really seem to appreciate this thesis. Since the Jan. opener, MPC gained less than 1%. Nevertheless, this lack of mobility in the charts might make MPC one of the undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks. Significantly, the market prices Marathon shares at a forward multiple of 6.08. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than nearly 63% of its oil and gas peers.Also, MPC trades at 0.32 times sales. In contrast, the sector median stands at 0.91 times. That’s noteworthy because Marathon’s three-year revenue growth rate clocks in at 27.1%, above 80.28% of its rivals. As well, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period pings at 60.9%. Thus, it’s a great idea for cheap S&amp;P 500 stocks with upside potential.Valero Energy (VLO)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comA downstream petroleum specialist, Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) mostly focuses on manufacturing and marketing transportation fuels. As well, it produces other petrochemical products and power. As with Marathon Petroleum above, Valero should benefit from rising social normalization trends. However, the market has a dim view of VLO, with shares fading nearly 7%. Over the trailing one-year period, it’s down almost 13%.Still, the red ink might make Valero one of the compelling undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy. On the valuation front, the market prices VLO at a forward multiple of 5.26. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than 71.08% of its oil and gas compatriots. Also, shares trade at 0.25 times sales. In contrast, the sector median again stands at 0.91 times.Nevertheless, Valero performs very well on the operational side. Its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 19.4%, above nearly 70% of its peers. Also, its Piotroski F-Score lands at a perfect 9 out of 9, indicating superior operational efficiency. Combined with an Altman Z-Score of 5.77 (indicating low bankruptcy risk), VLO makes a strong case for the best S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy.General Dynamics (GD)image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocksSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.comAlthough a bit on the controversial side for some investors for its aerospace and defense business, General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) technically meets the qualifications for undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks. Despite its relevant business profile – and gaining relevance, unfortunately – the market doesn’t believe in GD stock. Since the start of the year, shares tumbled nearly 15%. Over the past 365 days, GD is almost 3% below parity.Nevertheless, rising instability in the geopolitical realm could see demand for General Dynamics rise. In the meantime, the market prices GD at a forward multiple of 16.82. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than 66.67% of enterprises in the aerospace and defense industry. Also, GD trades hands at 14.43 times operating cash flow. In contrast, the sector median stat is 18.89 times.Aside from its value proposition, General Dynamics enjoys strong profitability metrics. Its trailing-year net margin clocks in at 8.5%, above 70.76% of its peers. Also, it’s worth mentioning that its Piotroski F-Score lands at 7 out of 9, indicating decent operational efficiency. Overall, then, it makes a solid case for S&amp;P 500 stocks for June.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Network slicing allows customers to send their traffic over virtual end-to-end networks tailored to specific application requirements, while optimizing network performance to support all services. This capability, designed for network traffic on Verizon’s new cloud-native, containerized, virtualized standalone 5G core, will offer unprecedented levels of service agility, flexibility, and automated scalability.“Matching network performance characteristics to specific application requirements, network slicing promises differentiated customer experiences to efficiently provide our customers with the type of service they need to complete the task they want to complete on our network and provide them an exceptional experience,” said Adam Koeppe, Senior Vice President of Technology Planning at Verizon.The recent demonstration successfully registered a 5G smartphone to multiple network slices and passed data through the entire network. The demonstration used a commercially available smartphone, virtualized and non-virtualized RAN equipment in production in the field, and Verizon’s multi-vendor 5G standalone core. This end-to-end test successfully accessed network slicing capabilities from the device and validated the ability for the device chipset, operating system, application, radio network base station, and the core of the network to work in harmony to demonstrate a full end-to-end path for data to travel on a virtual network slice. Network slicing will be made available with the evolution of Verizon’s 5G standalone core. In order to take advantage of this network functionality, customers must have 5G network slicing capable devices.Story continuesWhat is network slicing?This unique 5G capability uses a virtualized network infrastructure to dynamically match network performance characteristics to specific application requirements, while optimizing the network performance to support all services. The advanced capabilities, high speed, increased bandwidth, and low latency of 5G is inspiring development of a wide variety of new use cases that include everything from massive numbers of IoT devices that use very few network resources, to smartphone applications that use data in countless ways, to more complex solutions such as gaming, AR/VR and mixed reality that will require massive computing capabilities and low latency on the edge of the network. Those solutions would each benefit from different combinations of network capabilities. The 5G standalone core’s cloud-native virtualized applications, in combination with built-in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), will enable the dynamic allocation of the appropriate resources, referred to as network slicing. It will also allow for automated network configuration changes, including the ability to scale up or scale down network function capacity in real time - to provide the right service levels and network resources needed for each use case.For example, utility company smart readers use very little bandwidth, are not latency sensitive, and do not need mobility routing functions as they are in a fixed position attached to homes and do not move. This use case would require fewer network resources. Alternatively, massive multi-player online gaming in a mobile environment would benefit from certain upload and download speeds and low latency to work effectively and provide players an immersive experience on a mobile device. In each case, using network slicing, Verizon would be able to better match network performance to application requirements. In short, dynamic network resource provisioning allows the network to dynamically support the experience a customer should get for the applications they are using and efficiently provide that specific service level when resources are available.MEDIA CONTACT:Karen Schulz864.561.1527Karen.schulz@verizonwireless.com]"

These upgrades are part of a multi-year redesign of its network architecture to stay ahead of exponential data usage increases, upgrade the technology in the network, and to pave the way for personalized customer experiences. Network upgrades in Allentown include deploying new cell sites to extend coverage and capacity in local communities. They also include adding more capacity on fiber optic cables to move more data through the network and adding bandwidth to the cellular network to accommodate new services like wireless internet service for homes and businesses. Specifics on the upgrades include:Engineers have deployed 5G Ultra Wideband service using Millimeter Wave (mmWave), its premium, high-band spectrum which allows for extremely fast speeds and massive capacity as well as C-band spectrum designed for fast speeds, high capacity and wide coverage. With the recent deployments and upgrades, more than 82% of people in Allentown now have access to 5G service from Verizon. Verizon Engineers have deployed 5G Ultra Wideband service using its C-band spectrum designed for high capacity and wide coverage. Most notably, Verizon’s 5G Ultra Wideband service has recently expanded to areas in Carbon, Lehigh, Northampton, and Warren.In the Carbon County area, Tri-State upgraded the service in Jim Thorpe, where tourists enjoy white water rafting on the Lehigh River through Lehigh Gorge State Park. Lehighton borough residents and Route 209 will benefit from the C-Band additions too.Lehigh County:The Boyer Pond area now has a new macro cell site that includes C-Band to cover Route 145, the residential area, and Laurys Firehouse Park.5G service using C-band spectrum was added to cover:Downtown Allentown to provide better service to area residents, businesses, and the Allentown Fairgrounds.A shopping district near Lehigh &amp; Vultee StreetsA few sites in Emmaus covering residential areas, including the High School and I-476.In Northern Lehigh County, covering I-78 on the Eastern side near interchanges 78 &amp; 22, I-78 from the Route 100 interchange to the Route 22 split, and the industrial &amp; commercial business complexes along I-78.In Southern Lehigh County, covering I-476 and Rte. 222.In the Bethlehem area, covering Route 378 on the Eastern side of Northampton &amp; the surrounding residential population.Route 309, Southern Lehigh Middle &amp; High Schools, and the residents in Upper Saucon Township.I-78 and the Promenade Shops at Saucon ValleyIn Northampton County, 5G service using C-band spectrum was added in:The Crayola Factory, downtown Easton, Centre Square at the cross of Northampton &amp; North 3rd Streets, and Lafayette College.In West Easton, covering the residential &amp; shopping areas and the Easton Area High School.I-78 from Morgan Hill Road to Easton Road.SteelStacks, the former Bethlehem Steel Plant, residents near the Lehigh &amp; Keystone Valley Model Railroad Museum, and Lehigh University &amp; the surrounding community.Route 191 in Washington TownshipAllentown’s exceptional 5G coverage uses a combination of mmWave spectrum and Verizon’s recently acquired C-band spectrum. Verizon engineers are using 60 MHz of C-band spectrum to deliver 5G service to customers. By the end of the year, customers in Allentown will be able to take advantage of nearly twice that amount of spectrum as it becomes available for 5G Ultra Wideband.  That additional bandwidth will turbo charge the service, offering significantly higher speeds, much greater capacity to accommodate more customers and more robust servicesEven as engineers provide wireless service in more places, they are also enhancing the service by deploying leading edge, modernized technology in the area. Engineers have upgraded the hardware in many of the cell sites providing service throughout Allentown adding capacity for more data to be used by customers, providing power efficiency, and providing virtualization. This technology milestone allows Verizon to rapidly respond to customers’ varied latency and computing needs, and provides greater flexibility and agility in the introduction of new products and services. The move to a cloud-based, virtualized architecture with standardized interfaces in every part of the network leads to greater flexibility, faster delivery of services, greater scalability, and improved cost efficiency in networks.Lastly, the addition of 5G service and the many additional wireless solutions allow far more data to travel on the wireless network in Allentown. That exponential increase in data carried into and out of the cell sites serving the community requires upgraded fiber optic cable links.  Fiber optic cables are used to move data between cell sites and connect those sites to the rest of the network.  Verizon has increased the capacity on the fiber connections in many cell sites in the Allentown area so they can carry 10 times the amount of data.Story continues“We know customers count on us, and we work every day to ensure we deliver for them. Our reliable, secure network connects families, friends, homes and businesses in Allentown, PA with best-in-class 5G Ultra Wideband technology,” said Kevin Smith, Vice President of Engineering and Operations for Verizon.With these and other technology advancements on Verizon’s network, customers are able to use more data in more ways.

The tree cover and jungle-like growth covering the property are easily observable. She is proud of the photo, set in a gilded frame, and once you see another picture, one taken nearly 20 years ago of the same area, you'll understand why. The comparison is stark - the older photo is of a modest white house with low-lying green behind it and a scrubby patch of dirt in front. There are no trees, no grass, no shade. This current version of Elida's farm is an oasis of different trees, shrubs, and other plant life has been thoughtfully integrated to maximize their symbiotic relationships.Elida is part of an initiative led by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Brazil and funded in part by the Tapestry Foundation to rehabilitate degraded areas of the Cerrado biome, a vast savanna that covers the state of Moto Grosso do Sol in Brazil. Her farm, Boa Vida, is one of the sites where WWF is promoting the sustainable restoration of land that had been previously converted to ranch land for cattle grazing. The collection of native vegetation includes a diverse variety of plants, many of which are edible. This is agroforestry, the integration of trees and shrubs into crop and animal farming systems to create environmental, economic, and social benefits. In addition to improving the health of the land, this model offers an opportunity for comprehensive social impact.The leather supply chain is long, complex, and opaque; in most regions of the world, there is little traceability of hides and leather as it moves through the value chain. Globally, habitat conversion for pasture is the largest single driver of deforestation. As part of a four-year, multi-faceted $3 million grant launched in 2022, the Tapestry Foundation and WWF are partnering to accelerate the development of deforestation- and conversion-free (DCF) leather supply chains. What is unique about this approach is that while the long-term benefits of reforestation are crucial, investing in the area in the short-term is a vital part of the process.Story continuesIn the short term, the grant is focused on social enterprise models that support the local community and environment. In the first year, the project has restored nearly 11,000 acres of pasture and riparian areas and WWF has held seven training courses to initiate seed collection community projects with 125 rural people reached through these courses (67% women including settlers and local landowners). Native seed collection, which is a key step in the recovery of degraded areas, contributes directly to economic empowerment of rural families, the appreciation of local knowledge, and the empowerment of these women. Women who complete these courses and become involved in seed collection are able to substantially increase their household income.In a recent visit to the Cerrado, Tapestry and WWF teams spent two weeks on the ground meeting with local people, including Elida, to experience first-hand the importance of centering local voices to meet immediate challenges while also creating long-term change. Year one of the pilot project reinforced that change cannot happen without the collaboration of communities, and that true innovation comes from testing and learning from new ways of thinking. WWF Brazil and the Tapestry Foundation outperformed year 1 targets for reforestation by 750% through funding hyper-local social enterprise models that scale reforestation efforts while providing economic opportunities for local community members.Tapestry, parent company of Coach, kate spade new york, and Stuart Weitzman, is dedicated to proving a deforestation and conversion free leather supply chain can exist in Brazil but we know a comprehensive approach is necessary and will take time.Over the long-term, the project aims to create lasting solutions that support responsible sourcing of leather, reduce land conversion and deforestation, and restore what has already been degraded. Tapestry will be a key partner in scaling up important work led by WWF to the rest of the manufacturing sector and beyond to the rest of the cattle and leather supply chains in areas threatened by deforestation. Together this partnership will learn the best ways to shift the economic incentives leading bad actors to clear swaths of forested land (like cattle ranching and monocropping) to sustainable integrated solutions. While WWF tests solutions like agroforestry on the ground to reorient approaches around land use, Tapestry is working in conjunction with our industry on other commitments and pledges around deforestation and moving forward a DCF supply chain.Deforestation is a complex problem that requires purposeful cooperation-the Tapestry grant with WWF allows collaboration with all stakeholders, from cattle ranchers to government decision makers, fellow fashion brands, to the communities living within proximity of areas feeling the worst effects of deforestation, to work together to change the system.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Tapestry, Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Tapestry, Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/tapestry-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Tapestry, Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/762710/Tackling-Deforestation-in-Brazil-The-Tapestry-Foundations-Comprehensive-Approach-From-the-Ground-Up]"

ASML Holding NV, whose extreme ultraviolet lithography systems are essential in the production process, is up 27%.The contrast in performance reflects Nvidia’s position as the most immediate beneficiary of the demand for technology that powers AI applications. For TSMC and ASML, any gains will be longer term, while in the short run, much of their vast client bases are being hit hard by a slump in global chip demand.These factors are reflected in estimates of adjusted earnings per share. Over the past six months, analysts have raised current year forecasts for Nvidia by 77%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In the same period, estimates for TSMC were trimmed by 15%, while those for ASML held steady.Nvidia is “expensive for a reason,” said Richard Clode, a portfolio manager with Janus Henderson. “You’ve ultimately got to see upside to earnings and profit forecasts. That’s the only thing that sustainably keeps stocks higher, and the only company we are seeing at the moment is Nvidia.”Here are four charts showing how Nvidia is pulling clear of peers as the AI frenzy gathers momentum:Nvidia’s market capitalization has surged past the $1 trillion mark without a pause, taking the firm’s value beyond that of ASML and TSMC combined. It’s now twice as big as ASML, having been worth less as recently as January, and four times larger than TSMC.Story continuesEarlier this month, TSMC tempered its annual spending budget, a blow for its equipment supplier ASML, whose quarterly order intake has slumped to the lowest level since 2020.Trading at 50 times estimated annual earnings, Nvidia is the second most-expensive among profitable members of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, leaving TSMC and ASML far behind.Heightened tensions between China and Taiwan, which motivated Warren Buffett to close out his position in TSMC, have worked against the Taiwanese chipmaker’s valuation. A US-led effort to restrict China’s access to semiconductor technology has also hit ASML, as the Netherlands readies export curbs on some of its advanced machines.“The geopolitical side is something that has to be factored into valuation,” said Gene Munster, co-founder and managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management.While analysts have increased estimates of Nvidia’s forward adjusted earnings per share by 79% in the past six months, those for TSMC and ASML have fallen.Even though TSMC is the sole maker of Nvidia’s AI processors, its revenue may see only a low single-digit percentage boost in the short term, according to Bernstein analysts led by Mark Li. That’s because Nvidia’s processors account for a small portion of TSMC’s revenue, and capacity for packaging these chips is tight.For ASML, boosts from generative AI won’t come until 2025, said Societe Generale analyst Alexander Peterc. It takes over a year for the Dutch firm to fulfill an order for the EUV equipment that is indispensable to producing the most cutting-edge chips, and these machines are almost fully booked for next year. For 2025, the benefit may amount to 3% additional sales, Peterc estimated.Nvidia traders have been snapping up options to bet that the stock will rise or fall, sending total speculative interest to the highest level in four years. Wagers on TSMC and ASML’s American depositary receipts have also been rising, but to levels short of their November peaks.Tech Chart of the DayNikola Corp. shares have more than doubled in June, rallying with other growth and technology stocks after the Federal Reserve paused its series of interest-rate hikes.

Starting at the same price as the previous generation, these platforms support higher levels of database consolidation with more capacity and offer dramatically greater value than previous generations. Thousands of organizations, large and small, run their most critical and demanding workloads on Oracle Exadata including the majority of the largest financial, telecom, and retail businesses in the world.(PRNewsfoto/Oracle)""Our 12th generation Oracle Exadata X10M continues our strategy to provide customers with extreme scale, performance, and value, and we will make it available everywhere—in the cloud and on-premises,"" said Juan Loaiza, executive vice president, Mission-Critical Database Technologies, Oracle. ""Customers that choose cloud deployments also benefit from running Oracle Autonomous Database, which further lowers costs by delivering true pay-per-use and eliminating database and infrastructure administration.""Available now in both Oracle Exadata Cloud@Customer and Oracle Exadata Database Machine, the new Exadata X10M platforms feature 4th Gen AMD EPYC™ processors. With up to 3X more cores in database servers and 2X more cores in storage servers compared to the previous generation, Exadata X10M platforms deliver up to 3X higher transaction throughput and up to 3.6X faster analytic queries. Exadata X10M's high-capacity storage servers can now hold 22 percent more data, while all-flash storage servers now offer 2.4X the capacity of the previous systems. In addition, database servers now support 50 percent higher memory capacity—enabling more databases to run on the same system.Story continues""AMD EPYC CPUs were designed from the ground up to achieve three key goals—deliver more performance for complex data center workloads, reduce latency with larger, better-designed caches, and increase throughput with more cores per socket. It is ideally suited for mission-critical database workloads,"" said Mark Papermaster, executive vice president and chief technology officer, AMD. ""Our engineers worked closely with Oracle to ensure the Exadata X10M based on 4th generation AMD EPYC processors, with 96 cores per socket, is a balanced configuration that enables near-linear scalability and improved energy efficiency for database workloads.""The combination of improved price performance and more storage and memory capacity enables greater levels of database consolidation and dramatically lowers costs for all database workloads. The greater compute and storage density offered by Exadata X10M platforms also reduce the size of the systems that customers require to meet their needs, lowering data center costs for power, cooling, and floor space, and improving data center sustainability. In addition, with its large scale, simple expandability, and affordable consumption pricing, Exadata Cloud@Customer X10M enables customers to easily deploy incremental development, testing, and production environments without adding servers or systems.Organizations can scale out their Exadata X10M infrastructure by adding individual database or storage servers, allowing them to tailor their configurations to meet immediate needs and expand them in the future should those needs change. Oracle's Real Application Clusters technology uniquely enables scaling and planned maintenance while databases are fully online for both mission-critical online transaction processing (OLTP) and data warehouse workloads.Cloud automation in enterprise data centers with Oracle Exadata Cloud@CustomerOracle Exadata Cloud@Customer is a key component of Oracle's distributed cloud strategy, offering customers the benefits of cloud with greater control over data residency, locality, and authority. Exadata Cloud@Customer is the only platform that runs both Oracle Autonomous Database and Oracle Exadata Database Service in customer data centers. Autonomous Database automates routine, manual data management tasks including tuning, patching, and provisioning. In addition, Autonomous Database can automatically scale consumption up and down as workloads change, allowing organizations to run them faster when demand increases and reduce resource consumption and costs when demand decreases. With Autonomous Database, customers avoid over-provisioning of resources and only pay for their actual consumption.Customer and Analyst Quotes""At PayPal, we understand that microseconds matter, and fast physical I/O is essential for exceptional customer satisfaction. To meet the demands of our large workloads and ensure lightning-fast response times, we have currently chosen to modernize our IT Infrastructure with Oracle Exadata X10M,"" said Akash Guha, director of Transaction Processing and Data Services Enterprise Data Platform, PayPal. ""With Exadata X10M, we expect to seamlessly handle the immense demands of our operations, delivering outstanding performance, and exceeding the needs of our valued customers. We have trust in our exciting new relationship with Oracle to deliver exceptional results and drive continuous improvement.""""Founded in 1808, Banco do Brasil (BB) is one of Latin America's largest and oldest banks. To better support our digital financial needs and keep up with new banking technology, such as Brazil's Pix instant payment platform, we sought to accelerate the digital transformation,"" said Paulo André Rocha Alves, Infrastructure General Manager, Banco do Brasil. ""We chose Oracle Exadata Cloud@Customer X10M and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, and expect to gain greater flexibility, increase cost savings, and innovate faster.""""Now in its 12th generation, Oracle's latest release of Exadata points the spotlight at the power of density, and how it has changed what's possible with commodity infrastructure. Tripling to 96 cores was long unthinkable outside of the world of specialized eight-socket machines. But with Exadata X10M, Oracle has shifted gears to work with AMD which has broken the scaling barrier on standard two-socket units,"" said Tony Baer, principal, dbInsight. ""Paired with leading-edge capabilities such as RDMA, Oracle customers can continue to be assured that Exadata's scale and performance will grow with their needs. Running Oracle Database on anything but Exadata fits the definition of insanity: keep running on the same hardware but expecting different results.""""Oracle Exadata X10M and Oracle Exadata Cloud@Customer X10M maintain the highest degree of identicality across both cloud and on-premises implementations, remarkably even while moving the underlying CPU architecture to AMD EPYC processors,"" said Holger Mueller, principal analyst and vice president, Constellation Research. ""Now in its 12th generation, Oracle Exadata engineering continues to innovate the hardware and software architecture to deliver more than triple better performance for OLTP and analytics workloads. The combination of higher performance and greater capacity enable customers to consolidate databases and reduce operational costs, while increasing reliability and performance and lowering data center costs—including power and cooling, which help sustainability efforts.""Additional ResourcesHear from Juan Loaiza and AMD's Mark Papermaster to learn more about the latest Exadata innovationsRead the technical blogReal global industry analyst views about Exadata X10MLearn more about Oracle ExadataAbout OracleOracle offers integrated suites of applications plus secure, autonomous infrastructure in the Oracle Cloud.

Companies that offer dividends give shareholders more reasons to hold onto shares during good times and bad times.When the bad times come, the stock market can present opportunities to investors. Stock valuations get lower, and some dividend stocks suddenly look like bargains. Buying shares in undervalued companies gives you a greater margin of safety and a higher dividend yield. Finding undervalued dividend stocks can help you secure higher yields for stable corporations that have ample cash flow and earnings growth to support future dividend hikes.These three top dividend stocks to buy have seen their stock prices fall a bit lately but are still enticing choices for long-term investors.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPrudential (PRU)Prudential logoSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comPrudential (NYSE:PRU) has had a tough start to 2023, with shares down roughly 16% year-to-date. The company reported decreases in revenue and earnings for each quarter in 2022, but the most recent earnings report suggests Prudential is on the right track. In Q1 2023, Prudential reported $1.46 billion in net income and $17.05 billion in revenue.If Prudential continues reporting results like the first quarter, the P/E ratio will condense and support further capital appreciation. Prudential’s forward P/E ratio sits a tad below 7, which is lower than Prudential’s historical P/E ratio, which has ranged from 8 to 10. Once the bad quarters go in the rearview mirror, the P/E ratio can reach a more reasonable level.The company’s exposure to commercial real estate presents a risk, but Prudential’s leadership feels confident about continuing the streak of good quarters. The company recently announced a dividend hike from an annualized $4.80 dividend per share to an annualized $5 dividend per share. This dividend hike represented a 4.17% year-over-year increase and brought the dividend yield above 6%. The current dividend and adjusted book value per common share of $97.29 helps establish Prudential as one of the high-yield, undervalued dividend stocks to consider.Story continuesPublic Storage (PSA)a Public Storage sign in front of a facility of storage buildingsSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comPublic Storage (NYSE:PSA) is a real estate investment trust that acquires and maintains self-storage properties. The company has been volatile in 2023 but is up 5% year-to-date. The stock is down almost 20% from its all-time high and is reasonably valued. The company has a 12 P/E ratio and a 4% dividend yield.Public Storage reported funds from operations (FFO) of $4.08 per diluted share in the first quarter. REIT investors use FFO per share when assessing investments instead of EPS to gauge the dividend’s safety. $4.08 FFO per diluted share is more than enough to cover the quarterly $3 dividend. Funds from operations jumped 11.8% year-over-year, and revenue also increased by 9.8% compared to Q1 2022.Other public storage stocks like CubeSmart (NYSE:CUBE) and Life Storage (NYSE:LSI) have higher P/E ratios, ticking in at 29 and 30, respectively. These companies are also some of the best dividend stocks for investment capital due to their high yields, but Public Storage has them beat on valuation. All three REITs produced similar year-over-year growth in FFO and revenue.Bank of America (BAC)The logo of Bank of America (BAC) in modern office building in Beverly Hills, CaliforniaSource: Tero Vesalainen/ShutterstockBank of America (NYSE:BAC) saw its stock price tumble as a result of the Silicon Valley Bank fallout in March. The news shocked many investors and led to a major selloff in bank stocks. Regional banks got hit hard, but the more established banks also saw significant declines.While Silicon Valley Bank’s downfall created reasonable concern, Bank of America’s stock didn’t have much reason to fall as much as it did. If anything, Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse helped Bank of America, as the large bank reaped $15 billion in deposits a few days after government authorities closed Silicon Valley Bank. Consumers and businesses moved their money into more established financial institutions like Bank of America to mitigate their risk.Bank of America has done its part with 9.2% year-over-year revenue growth and 15.5% year-over-year income growth in Q1 2023. It’s also the second-largest bank in the U.S. and has over $3 trillion in assets. The company has a P/E below 9, a P/B ratio below 1, and a dividend yield above 3%. You can get higher yields with other undervalued dividend stocks, but Bank of America rarely has a yield above 3%. Bank of America trades below $34/share, the price BAC stock had before the Silicon Valley Bank news gripped the markets. No underlying changes to the company, plus its strong position in the banking industry, suggest the market’s reaction in March was misguided.On this date of publication, Marc Guberti did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The Reuter’s source also revealed that the Indian government agreed to the production-linked incentive worth $1.34 billion for the plant.Being one of the world’s biggest producers and consumers of electronics and automobiles, the Indian government is trying hard to build a semiconductor ecosystem within the country to cater to the growing demand for chips. In doing so, the government announced an incentive package worth INR 76,000 crore for the technologically sophisticated industry.Micron’s multi-billion-dollar investment news has come at a time when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is on a five-day visit to the United States to take the relationship between the two countries to new heights. The official announcement of Micron’s investment plan is most likely to be declared during Modi’s stay between Jun 20 and Jun 24 in the United States.Micron Technology, Inc. Price and ConsensusMicron Technology, Inc. Price and ConsensusMicron Technology, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Micron Technology, Inc. QuoteWe opine that Micron’s new investment plan is critical for India as well as the United States. The company’s chip testing and packaging plant will not only lay the foundation stone for the Indian government’s domestic semiconductor ecosystem plan but also boost Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ambitious Make in India initiative.Meanwhile, it will help the U.S. government’s long-term strategy of reducing dependence on China for the supply of semiconductors as well as restrict Chinese access to critical and more advanced chip technologies.Micron Caught in the Trade War CrossfireMicron’s Indian investment plans could be seen as its strategy of diversifying its business operations and improving the supply chain of its memory chips, which had been disrupted due to extensive pandemic-led lockdowns in China.Story continuesThe company’s move can also be seen as a balanced approach to sustain its business operations, which have been caught in the crossfire of the ongoing tech war between the world’s two largest economies — the United States and China.In May 2023, the Chinese government imposed restrictions on Micron for selling its products in key domestic industries on national security concerns, stating that the memory chipmaker failed to pass a cybersecurity review initiated in late March 2023. The restrictions can be seen as a retaliatory action against the U.S. government’s export ban on China for certain advanced chips used in data centers for AI, data analytics and computing applications.The tit-for-tat actions could jeopardize Micron’s prospects, which are already facing the brunt of the weak demand for its memory chips. Chip sales in China make up approximately 11% of Micron’s total revenues.In late March, Micron reported weaker-than-expected financial results in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The company reported a non-GAAP loss of $1.91 per share, which was significantly higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 67 cents. The bottom line compared unfavorably with the prior-year quarter’s earnings of $2.14 per share.The quarterly revenues of Micron plunged 53% year over year to $3.69 billion, which missed the consensus mark of $3.76 billion. The rapidly weakening consumer demand and substantial customer inventory adjustments across end markets amid macroeconomic uncertainty were the main reasons behind the dismal quarterly performance.The memory chip maker has offices in Shanghai and Shenzhen and a chip packaging facility in the city of Xian. In early 2022, Micron announced that it would shut down DRAM design operations at its Shanghai facility by the end of the year. The move was seen as a strategic shift from the manufacturing of chips back to the United States amid mounting trade tensions between the United States and China.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderMicron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Shares of the company have rallied 33.9% year to date (YTD).Some better-ranked stocks from the broader technology sector are Meta Platforms META, Manhattan Associates MANH and Blackbaud BLKB, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Like at the beginning stages we wanted to be an example of the change that we wanted to see. So our infrastructure is one that's full of color, a landscape of inclusion, right? Because that's what it's supposed to be.THAI RANDOLPH: Hartbeat-- Kevin's the North Star and sort of the heartbeat of the company. We're working with so many amazing creators across audio, TV, Film. And you know, I think what's really exciting about Hartbeat is it serves as a platform that he's created for the next generation of not just comedic creators but just creators in general.TARIQ HASSAN: The power of culture. And that's a big word, everyone uses it, but we set that as our North Star to really become a cultural icon. We're McDonald's, so we shouldn't just be participating in culture. We should be creating it, which means if you're going to do it externally, that gives you a thought to how you have to build that culture internally. And that's really what's been the driver of the business for the last 2 and 1/2 years.MANOLO ARROYO: This is one of the most, if not the most, inclusive brand in the planet. Proportion of population today, particularly Gen Z, ESG, your level of commitment on ESG, it matters. And for others it's innovation. So the name of the game for us is growth.PAUL WACHTER: The biggest concern, I think, for talent, at least Hollywood talent, would be how long does the writer's strike last? How bad is the pullback by the streaming companies in terms of how much they're willing to spend on content? On the other side of the coin in the music business, where I spend a lot of my time, it's never been better. The live music business is off the charts.JIM LANZONE: Everybody wants to know, you know, what the state of that market is, are things going to come back-- storming back. I'd say, look, things are pretty stable. I think that's the sentiment here. People fear a really tough 2023. It's not the fastest growing year ever, but things are pretty stable in the industry.

""People reconnecting and realizing that there was a value to this brand that frankly, I think, we had forgotten and we'd lost a bit of our swagger.""McDonald's launches new Grimace campaign with Twitter takeoverWhat is Grimace, exactly?Grimace, a fast-food marketing icon in the 1980s, has taken over McDonald's social media as part of an omnichannel marketing initiative promoting a special meal for the character's birthday.After debuting in 1971 as ""Evil Grimace,"" a mascot known for stealing McDonald's shakes, Grimace has evolved over the years into a much more friendly mainstay at the chain. But what exactly is the 'Purple Pal' that has seen a 2023 transformation?""First of all, Grimace represents joy and happiness,"" Hassan said, describing the character as the ""McDonald’s-land friend glue.""Hassan added that while there's a lot of debate over what Grimace actually is, ""the lore is that he represents a taste bud.""Now the purple gumdrop-shaped figure has the opportunity to cook up additional sales for the Golden Arches.McDonald's leans into nostalgia marketingGrimace isn't the first reintroduction of a nostalgia-inducing McDonald’s character.In 2015, the Hamburglar returned in an advertising campaign and looked more akin to a Magic Mike than a beef patty thief — and consumers didn’t seem too upset about that.Story continuesFast forward to 2023, and Hamburglar will be seen throughout national marketing efforts once more, this time appearing more similar to the image crafted for the character during the 1980s, but with the 2023 standards of screen resolution.""At the end of the day, our responsibility is also to drive the business and make sure we're showing up for our franchisees and growing the business,"" Hassan said, reflecting on the strategic business decision to reintroduce its brand characters to a younger audience.And some analysts on Wall Street are convinced that the marketing effort toward Gen Z and millennials is gaining traction.Ronald McDonald, Hamburglar, and Grimace of McDonald's attend the 2022 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade on November 24, 2022, in New York City.

In a note, analyst Gregory Francfort called the franchise still the most ""McCompelling"" stock in the restaurant sector.""We think McDonald’s success is the cumulative effect of years of investment in the asset base, improvements in the marketing message, and a digital engagement story that has legs,"" Francfort added.And for anyone wondering when Ronald McDonald will get his own ad campaign, it likely won't be anytime soon.However, ""if it's what the fans are looking for, I think we're showing we can deliver on it,"" Hassan said.Brad Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

Google ended the practice and today has its own trove of user-written reviews.But earlier this month, that new Tripadvisor CEO, Matt Goldberg, said at an investor conference that his company is having “really good conversations” with Google about a potential partnership.“When I say they [Google] want us to exist, that’s for multiple reasons,” Goldberg told financial analyst Richard Clarke at a Bernstein conference. “Number one, they’ve got regulatory challenges. They would like to have competitors in these spaces. They do not want to destroy the competition… We are a paying user of Google. They want us to continue to pay. And so we have really good conversations around how we can differentiate, how we can focus on what we’re going to do best, and how we can partner there.”To be clear, Tripadvisor and its Viator tours and activities brand already spend a ton of money on Google ads and other sponsored placements. But Google is making a big push in offering “things to do,” and Tripadvisor/Viator is likely the largest player in the world, so there are potential areas for a deeper relationship.Over the years, Tripadvisor has been one of the most aggressive voices in the travel industry calling on regulators to level the playing field regarding Google’s business practices as they impact competitors — and some say travelers, as well.Goldberg said at the investor conference that he isn’t approaching discussions with Google naively.“And of course, we’re not rosy eyed about it,” he said. “We recognize that Google has, in many ways, advantaged their own monetization, and that’s had an impact on us.

Understanding what motivates each of them can help companies more effectively recruit, manage and retain strong teams. Examining the Multigenerational Workforce, a new report from talent solutions and business consulting firm Robert Half, reveals what to know about today's multigenerational workforce. Insights include:A new report from Robert Half, reveals what to know about today's multigenerational workforce.Money matters most for most workers. A competitive salary with regular merit increases has the biggest impact on job satisfaction and retention for millennials, Gen Xers and baby boomers. Gen Z is the only generation for whom other factors ranked higher than compensation. In addition, Gen X workers (32%) are most likely to feel underpaid.Takeaway: Research and benchmark salaries on a regular basis. Consult sources like the Salary Guide From Robert Half to ensure employees are paid competitively.Gen Z wants the best of both worlds. One-third of Gen Z professionals prefer to choose when and where to work. At the same time, they crave more in-person interactions than employees of other generations. And six in 10 are concerned about missing out on project opportunities and promotions when working remotely.Takeaway: Consider implementing a flexible work policy that allows for both remote options and purposeful in-office time for training and team building activities.AI is weighing on workers' minds. Despite being digitally savvy, 78% of Gen Z professionals are concerned about AI impacting their job, versus 48% of millennials, 40% of Gen Xers and only 27% of baby boomers. That said, workers of all generations would rather undergo training to reskill for a new role at their current company than pursue a different position if their job was at risk.Takeaway: Provide opportunities for employees at all levels to learn new skills, stay up to date with technology and explore different career paths within your company.Contract work is attractive to younger professionals. Half of Gen Zers who are looking for a new job in 2023 are interested in full-time contract work. Contract roles appeal to many people due to the opportunity to take on a variety of assignments and work at different companies to build skills and connections.Takeaway: Consider hiring contract professionals who have specialized skills and fresh ideas that can help your business stay nimble.Deal breakers are similar across generations. Though not in the same order, all generations rank a lack of salary transparency, unclear or unreasonable job responsibilities and poor communication with a hiring manager among the top reasons to withdraw from consideration for an open role.Takeaway: Be upfront about salaries and job responsibilities with candidates. When working with a talent solutions firm, communicate your needs clearly and stay in close touch with the recruiter.Story continues""Building and managing teams is complicated, especially as workforce demographics and priorities shift,"" said Paul McDonald, senior executive director of Robert Half. ""Ultimately, all professionals want to feel supported and valued. Understanding what makes different generations tick and striving to create a work environment that addresses their various needs can go a long way toward improving engagement, productivity and retention.""About the ResearchFindings are based on surveys developed by Robert Half and conducted by an independent research firm in April and January 2023 and November 2022. Each survey contains responses from at least 1,000 workers 18 years or older. View Robert Half's Examining the Multigenerational Workforce report for additional insights.About Robert HalfRobert Half (NYSE: RHI) is the world's first and largest specialized talent solutions firm that connects opportunities at great companies with highly skilled job seekers.

All in all, it is certainly not the best time to be in the shipping business with even Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) dealing with the strike of 84 delivery drivers in California as well as an aftermath of an Amazon driver being shot after delivering a package.FedEx’s Fourth Fiscal Quarter Key FiguresFor the quarter ended on May 31st, the Memphis-based shipping giant reported revenue dropped from last year’s comparable quarter ($24.4 billion) to $21.9 billion. Express segment revenue brought in $10.41 billion. While the Ground segment improved due to increased revenue per package and cost-reductions, the Express segment experienced its operating results decline due to lower global volumes that were only partially offset by loweredexpenses and higher U.S. domestic yields. Adjusted operating income amounted to $1.77 billion with the strongest operating margin of the fiscal year at 8.1% as a result of efficient execution of expense management controls. Net income also dropped from last year’s comparable quarter ($1.8 billion) to $1.25 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share amounted to $4.94.At FedEx Express air and international unit, flight hours slipped 12% in the quarter, which exceeded the volume decline.Corporate Staff ChangesIn a separate announcement, FedEx announced that CFO Michael Lenz will retire on July 31st. Lenz will be present until the year-end to ensure a smooth transition of his successor who is still unknown.Story continuesFlattish Fiscal 2024 GuidanceFlat low-single-digit revenue growth is expected in the new fiscal year that kicked off on June 1st, with $1.8 billion in permanent savings out of $4 billion in savings in this fiscal year and the following. Margin improvements at its Express and Ground units are expected, while freight margins are expected to remain under pressure throughout the year and especially during the undergoing quarter.Following the two-year of skyrocketing demand created by the pandemic, the industry is dealing with a package volume decline and therefore, lowering costs is the logical way to go. As it grapples with this challenging new reality of weakened demand, FedEx is taking this road to improve its profitability.US Largest Single-employer Strike Is Looming Over UPSIf UPS does not make an agreement with the Teamsters union, more than 340,000 UPS workers are threatening to strike over pay, hours and working conditions. If it takes place, it would be the largest single-employer strike in US history. As a reminder, the 1997 UPS strike that gathered 185,000 workers resulted in 15 days of standstill operations that slashed deliveries, overwhelmed FedEx and the US Postal Service and caused massive damage to US businesses.The Worst-case ScenarioThe good side is a short UPS strike would not be as devastating as it was 25 years ago as things are quite difference these days. Amazon did not exist back then while FedEx has grown quite bit and retailers such as Walmart (NYSE: WMT) created shipping alternatives such as the store and curb pickup option. But a longer strike would certainly do more than just slower deliveries such as result in raised prices and empty shelves. Caution is not what the market wanted to hear as it seems it was expecting the glimpse of self-confidence of Amazon, but it could be a smart move for FedEx that is doing what it can to protect margins as pressures are here to stay for a while.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

Ocean CD complements and extends Spot Ocean, optimizing delivery of cloud applications by automating deployment strategies across clusters and workloads. The combination of Spot Ocean and Ocean CD extends our Kubernetes automation and optimization solutions to application delivery, reducing complexity and burdens for DevOps teams while connecting how applications are delivered with how they are operated in production to provide greater agility, reliability and efficiency.Organizations rely on the ability to deploy and operate cloud-native applications with speed, scale and confidence to support critical business priorities and initiatives. However, the already overstretched DevOps teams that they depend on to make that possible face daunting challenges and time-consuming work to deliver increasingly complex applications in a consistent, repeatable and reliable way. The delivery process typically contains hundreds of deployments over multiple clusters and is conducted by dozens of developer stakeholders. These challenges increase the risk of frequent failures in delivery that slow down application innovation and impact reliability, frustrating application teams and adding to DevOps and operations burdens.Ocean CD automates and optimizes the delivery process, providing uniquely valuable Kubernetes deployment control without compromising reliability, security or efficiency. With Ocean CD, DevOps teams can set and maintain deployment strategies across multiple clusters and workloads, while giving developers the ability to identify and prevent potential incidents in early stages that could result in inefficiency and costly failures. Ocean CD enables teams to transform from a basic software release process into a gradual deployment process using proven deployment strategies. Additionally, Ocean CD limits potential failures due to software changes by utilizing gradual releases, continuous real-time verification, automatic rollback and granular visibility for service owners. Using Ocean CD together with Spot Ocean and the rest of the Spot by NetApp portfolio of solutions enables organizations to optimize and scale the way they deploy and operate cloud-native applications, simplifying and improving their application delivery and operations pipeline.Story continues""Organizations rely on being able to quickly and reliably deliver and evolve cloud applications to support their business priorities, but too often find themselves hindered by complexity and inefficiency,"" said Haiyan Song, Executive Vice President and General Manager, CloudOps at NetApp. ""Spot Ocean CD extends our automation and optimization to application delivery, enabling DevOps teams to simplify, standardize and automate the complex Kubernetes software delivery process across any cloud and Kubernetes cluster so that teams can innovate and operate applications rapidly, reliably and efficiently.""Ocean CD provides DevOps teams with the following key capabilities:Visibility into code rollout in a clear visual interface to easily manage multiple services across clusters in one place, which simplifies complex Kubernetes software delivery processes with automation and gradual software deployment, centralizing all deployment-related activities and views in one spot. It also allows a generic model that makes it easy to dynamically manage or change multiple deployment pipelines for all services across all clusters and cloud providers.Better control to deploy software changes and rollouts into production with confidence based on clear metrics and policies that identify and fix hidden failure points of deployments without slowing down releases. Ocean CD detects and intercepts deployments, adding intelligent CD capabilities such as Canary or Blue-Green rollout strategies, traffic management, verification-driven process and managed failure policies for smarter rollbacks with better control, allowing users to gain the full power and agility out of Kubernetes with peace of mind and minimal overhead.An enterprise-ready continuous delivery product with the right automation to eliminate bottlenecks and manual overhead, simplifying the release of application changes, and ability to scale over hundreds of clusters and services. Ocean CD offers enterprise-grade support and features including SSO, granular permissions management for developers, notifications, multi-cluster management, manager dashboards and frequent updates aligned to customer feedback.""With Ocean CD, we can remove bottlenecks in a way that allows us to be the best we can be in our CD environment,"" said Matthieu Antoine, Senior Staff System Engineer at JUMO. ""Ocean CD creates a seamless process that’s as automated as it can be, so developers can spend as little time around it as possible. It also reduces production errors and provides better orchestration of complex processes that require a lot of time, such as migrating Kubernetes clusters to newer versions. With this automation now in place, we can better deliver on our greater mission, which is offering reliable financial services to people that so far had no access to such services at all.""Spot Ocean CD is now available via the Spot console UI, API or CLI.

292,d402b924-3ae4-3cb0-8d32-bfe83c1ad1fc,NI,2023-06-22,3 Reasons Growth Investors Will Love NiSource (NI),Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reasons-growth-investors-love-164504932.html,1687365904,STORY,['NIMC'],"[Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.That's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Our proprietary system currently recommends NiSource (NI) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this energy holding company a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for NiSource is 2.4%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 7.5% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 4.8%.Cash Flow GrowthWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for NiSource is 15.5%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 5.2%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 9.3% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 6.5%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for NiSource have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1% over the past month.Bottom LineNiSource has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that NiSource is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

PriceZimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. PriceZimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. price | Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. QuoteOverall, the business experienced a faster-than-expected recovery of elective procedures, driven by the easing of staffing-related headwinds, normalization of cancellation rates, and some backlog recapture. Further, Zimmer Biomet benefited from lighter comps, strong commercial and supply chain execution and new product uptake.Even amid the challenging macroeconomic conditions, expansion in the company’s adjusted gross and operating margins is encouraging. The raised 2023 guidance is an indication of the strong growth momentum to continue through the year.Story continuesOn the flip side, Zimmer Biomet continued to face significant challenges in terms of unfavorable foreign exchange, supply, inflation and staffing shortage. Reimbursement headwinds in the United States restorative therapies are another downside.

EYE is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters with the ongoing comparable store increase. The company has been making investments for improved patient care and optometric experience, including investments in AI.The patterns within the broader eyewear market are likely to bode well for EYE’s business. Meanwhile, mounting expenses and operating in a tough competitive environment are concerning for the company.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 3.2% compared with the 19.8% fall of the industry and a 19.2% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The leading optical retailer has a market capitalization of $2.01 billion. The company projects long-term estimated earnings growth of 21.9% compared with the industry’s 14.1%. National Vision surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in one, delivering an earnings surprise of 69.9%, on average.Let’s delve deeper.UpsidesComparable Store Growth Holds Promise: In the first quarter, National Vision opened eight stores (four America's Best and four Eyeglass World stores), with the expected launch of nearly 65 to 70 stores in 2023. The company noted that the new stores opened over the past 12 months are continuing to perform well and are in line with the company’s expectations.In 2023, EYE invested $27.7 million in capital expenditures, primarily focused on new store openings and customer-facing technology investments. In terms of marketing, the company’s merchandising and distribution teams continue to execute well and are confident that the current inventory levels are sufficient to support continued growth in 2023.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFavorable Industry Trends: Changing lifestyle patterns and the increasing adoption of luxurious accessories among millennials are strongly favoring the global eyewear market’s growth, valued at $169.9 billion in 2022. The establishment of remote working models during lockdown has factored in the increasing sales of blue light canceling and anti-fatigue lenses for eyewear companies.Story continuesPer a 2022 report by The Vision Council, 82% of respondents use a form of vision correction, 69% use prescription eyewear and 68% use some form of non-prescription eyewear.Technological Investment: National Vision recently invested in an early-stage health care, AI start-up, Toku, alongside Topcon Healthcare. Through the investment, EYE is strengthening the future of optical care in which more people are able to have affordable access to potentially life-saving health data on an easily accessible, non-invasive test.DownsidesMargins Down: EYE reported a significant year-over-year decline in first-quarter earnings. Escalating expenses caused a contraction in the gross and adjusted operating margins. The company is facing demand headwinds across its network of stores, given the current macro environment and supply challenges in a smaller subgroup of stores due to the constraints on eye exam capacity.Tough Competition: In a highly competitive optical retail industry, National Vision competes with national retailers like LensCrafters, Pearle Vision and Visionworks. Competition exists in physical retail locations and e-commerce platforms.The company also faces competitive threats from online sellers of contact lenses and eyewear. Several firms are focused on selling eyeglasses in the online market like Warby Parker and Zenni Optical.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for EYE’s 2023 earnings per share (EPS) has remained constant at 50 cents in the past 30 days.The Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $2.12 billion. This suggests a 5.5% rise from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Zimmer Biomet ZBH, Penumbra PEN and Hologic, Inc.

296,c02afd99-10e6-3bb9-b326-a54e2fa26754,FTI,2023-06-22,TechnipFMC (FTI) Surges 118% in a Year: Is it Sustainable?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/technipfmc-fti-surges-118-sustainable-121100559.html,1687349460,STORY,"['FTI', 'PFIE', 'SND', 'ENI.MI']","[Energy services company TechnipFMC FTI is up nearly 118% over the past year, comprehensively outperforming the broader Oil/Energy sector and the benchmark S&amp;P 500. The energy space has inched up 0.6% during this period, while the S&amp;P 500 has gained a modest 16.5%.Let’s dive into the reasons for FTI’s outperformance and analyze whether the stock can keep the momentum going.What Led to This Price Increase?By all accounts, the manufacturer and supplier of products, services and fully integrated technology solutions for the energy industry appears to be positioned for healthy growth in the next few years. In particular, the company believes that its Subsea 2.0 platform — a new, technologically sophisticated suite of products that improves project economics by cutting down on the dimensions of the equipment installed underwater — would enjoy fast-track adoption. The next-generation, environment-friendly all-electric system should boost opportunities.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research On Apr 27, TechnipFMC reported first-quarter 2023 results, wherein the company maintained a strong backlog of projects, which was $10.6 billion as of Mar 31. In addition to revenue visibility, this backlog supports the company's future performance.Notably, FTI brought in an impressive $2.5 billion in quarterly subsea inbound orders representing a book-to-bill of 1.8. This means that FTI brought in much more work than it completed. The company kept its full-year guidance intact and has secured significant projects over the past few months to boost revenue generation in the short-to-medium term.Finally, TechnipFMC is looking to convert 40-50% of its adjusted EBITDA into free cash flow by 2025. This will be facilitated by debt reduction, allowing the leading manufacturer and supplier of integrated technology solutions for the energy industry to lower its annual interest expense.The company’s capital budget, on the other hand, is expected to be restricted between 3.5% and 4.5% of revenues. TechnipFMC has reduced its long-term debt from about $1.73 billion on Dec 31, 2021 to less than $1 billion in the most recent quarter, with a cash balance of  $1.1 billion.Story continues Is the Rally Overdone?While the overall macro environment remains constructive, investments in offshore programs remain limited. This tepidness in activity hurts the overall demand for services and equipment across the industry spectrum and does not bode well for TechnipFMC — a firm that helps develop and produce offshore energy fields.Further, despite the relative stability in oil prices, for most upstream operators, the focus is still on sustaining the lower spending levels, further trimming breakeven costs and maintaining financial health. As a matter of fact, after bouncing strongly from the depths of the pandemic, the oil and natural gas rig count in the United States has been gradually declining since the beginning of 2023. This indicates a drop in future drilling services. This is expected to hurt the likes of TechnipFMC.  Worringly, the company’s shares look pricey regarding valuation, with the current 33.49X forward earnings multiple sitting well above the 18.47X five-year median and Zacks sector average.Last but not least, FTI doesn't pay a dividend and, as such, might not appeal to income investors.In conclusion, TechnipFMC’s share gains look to be overdone from a fundamental point of view. Therefore, it would be prudent to wait for a better entry point as the timing is still not right for investors to hit the Buy button. FTI currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).3 Energy Stocks to BuyInvestors interested in the energy space might look at operators like Profire Energy PFIE, Eni S.p.A. E and Smart Sand SND, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) currently.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Profire Energy: The 2023 Zacks Consensus Estimate for Profire Energy indicates 125% year-over-year earnings per share growth.

PFIE has seen its shares fall 4.6% in a year.Eni: It is valued at some $50.8 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for E’s 2023 earnings has been revised 17% upward over the past 60 days.Eni, headquartered in Rome, Italy, beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters and missed in the other. E shares have gained 14% in a year.Smart Sand: SND beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters and missed in the other.

Joining Yahoo Finance Live, Munson breaks down several of his must-buy trades and which stocks to avoid.Video Transcript- Welcome back. Investors may have big tech on their minds as market faces economic uncertainty, and also the potential for further rate hikes, but there are other ways to play, and investors may want to keep an eye on others to stay clear of and here with more of this is Lee Munson he's a Portfolio Wealth advisors President and CIO. And Lee, thanks for sticking around here.Let's start with some of your picks. Occidental Petroleum. I've been fascinated with this ever since they bought Anadarko petroleum back in the day. Reading your notes, it's all about the Permian Basin, and the CEO was roundly criticized at the time for paying too much. Looking pretty prescient now, perhaps, and maybe he hasn't had to walk it back as much. What do you like about OXY this minute though?LEE MUNSON: This minute is that they're four years into that merger, and so they've gotten the kinks out. I love that they have cheap production. I love that this place has half the Permian Basin in their back pocket, because I think a lot of people don't get in America that the Permian Basin is America's easy oil. It's huge, the fields are nice and rich, and it's easy to extract it.And then when those fields dry out, when your well gets dry, you can pump all the stuff in it and get out through fracking. Occidental has some proprietary processes they do in fracking. Now why is that important? I've got some clients that do fracking stuff, and it eats away at the majors profit margin. So if you can do stuff in house and you can vertically integrate--- You're talking about not using oil service companies like Halliburton.LEE MUNSON: Exactly. And so if you have part of that process that you're controlling yourself, then you can get a profit advantage. And so it's all about having half in the Permian Basin. It's all about the Permian. It's all about proprietary knowledge on how to do parts of the CO2 fracking, and then, yeah, I'm not going to lie, it's nice to see grandpa Buffett having a little floor on this, and feeling like he's going to step in around that 59 level. But I think there's a lot more to it.Story continuesAlso, I think that there's a catch up trade. It's a little off versus some of the others. And I think it's a good deal. But I think that goes for energy sector in general. It's beat up, And I understand that it did really well, but I think going forward you have to think, how is this going to compound for the next five years? At what valuation? And things start looking attractive.- Yeah, a bit of a cool down that we've seen so far at least in the energy sector. Let's talk about another name, or at least we should say two names that you really like in the tech sector. We're talking about Alphabet as well as Amazon. Now Alphabet, you could argue is the AI play that you were talking about earlier, but talk to me about how you're seeing these two names in the larger picture of the tech rally that we've been watching play out.LEE MUNSON: Well, when you look at the top seven, you can look at relative valuation over say like the last 10 years. Now let's take Nvidia out of it because like, great, you saw AI, your own Nvidia, you get a big gold star. How about it?You're almost about where it was back in late 2021, a little higher, a little lower, depending on what the day is. I think that when you look at the other S&amp;P 7, as we're now calling it, you've got Amazon, Facebook, Google, all at the lower end of their historical valuation, which is crazy. I mean, they print so much money.For me, if I had a gun to my head and then you ask what do you own, it's like a little Amazon, a little Google here because I think that on a relative valuation you can get a catch up trade. And when you're a guy like me who's a little bit more value oriented I don't want to like hop on fads and lose a bunch of money.I think that that's important, especially if you're picking a basket of stuff that's basically the cause of the gains in the S&amp;P, the vast majority of it what's relatively cheap and why, because again, AI no AI. I think the only AI plays in Nvidia. Everything else is just coat tailing off of by what worked before.- And nevertheless the AI that ticker that money the money ticker belongs to a company that's basically a microcap maybe a small cap C3AI.There's a certain danger to just buying blind tickers, but that's something that a lot of people have been conditioned to do over the last few years. And then I got a question about the catch up trade as well, yeah, Intel. If it's lagging, maybe it's lagging for a reason, that's why I might look at it at this stage but your thoughts.LEE MUNSON: The story with Intel, I live out in New Mexico, and I'm a few miles from one of their big fab plants. And you get the sense that this is such a large company, they control so much of the market. I don't think people understand how huge Intel is, but it's dead money. It's more bound because they're too hooked into the PCs. It's always about well in 10 years, Intel is going to look like a different company.Well, I don't have 10 years. AI is today, right? So when you're looking a capture trade, I'd rather have Taiwan Semiconductor. At least they have the fab stuff and are doing what the hot new stuff is right with Intel it's always about in another year and another year, we're going to transform, we're going to transform.You're light. You're trying to move the Titanic. It's too hard. I'd rather go with Taiwan Semiconductor. So that's my that's my cue. And then aid.com or the ticker symbol. So back in 2016, they changed their name from C3 energy to C3 IoT remember. Internet of things.And then when you go on their website today, they have this whole thing of explaining the Baker Hughes deal, and it's like this two page memorandum like, well, we got this big client and because of that, we have all these other clients, and we've taken half the revenue and, put those into earnings now even though they're six year contracts but that's, OK. And just you're like if we needed to have a memo explaining things then, I think that that's exactly the poster child from when I came up in the business in.com where everything changed the name of.com and changed this stuff.So I think that's going to be more. And again, I hope that this large language model is able to increase productivity across the board for 10% because if it's not, we better have a stunning landing for the next six months. We better have the fed nail it.We better have some large language models, make us more productive to all the incorporation of the world because if not, you're going to see increased volatility. And I think when you look at the MOVE index, so low on the 10 year. It's like buy protection, keep your options open, and why would you go out long duration on the bond side?- A lot of ifs out there, very, very, tight tightrope for the Powell and co to navigate. Lee Munson, always great to see you here. Thank you so much Thank]"

It supports high-throughput processing of up to 96 samples in one run using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, offers improved sensitivity leading to increased profiling efficiency, higher resolution and is extensible for applications like forensic investigative genetic genealogy (FIGG), phenotyping and additional capabilities like body fluid identification.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis approval by the FBI reflects on the superiority of the Verogen-developed NGS-based forensic products. With ForenSeq MainstAY, QIAGEN continues to uphold its commitment to providing forensic laboratories with cost-effective NGS processes that enable them to make the switch from capillary electrophoresis without increasing their spending. The forensics community can start making this transformation thanks to NDIS compatibility, which also gives them access to federal funds for NGS validation and deployment.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Grand View Research, the global forensic genomics market size was valued at $413.32 million in 2021 and is projected to attain a CAGR of 14.25%. The industry growth can be attributed to rapid technological advancements, increased private &amp; government funding for the development of cost-effective forensic testing techniques and an increasing number of crimes, such as homicides, kidnapping and sexual assault.Recent DevelopmentsThis month, QIAGEN announced that its software for interpreting and reporting variants, QIAGEN Clinical Insight (QCI Interpret), is being used in Denmark as part of a government initiative to provide sequencing-based treatments for cancer patients. The QCI Interpret solution was selected by Danish National Genome Center for variant interpretation in oncology genome sequencing.In May 2023, QIAGEN announced that it will offer its premium enzymes as standalone solutions, giving researchers and business clients the freedom to design their own tests and workflows. QIAGEN is now a one-stop shop for all research needs, including solutions for sample preparation, automation and bioinformatics.Price PerformanceShares of the company have gained 5.2% in a year compared with the industry’s rise of 0.9%.Zacks Rank and Key PicksQIAGEN carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

CAH scaled a new 52-week high of $92.09 on Jun 20, 2023, before closing the session marginally lower at $91.24.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 73.5% compared with 20.8% growth of the industry and a 16.7% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.Over the past five years, the company registered an earnings decline of 0.6% against the industry’s 8.3% growth. The company’s long-term expected growth rate of 13.2% compares with the industry’s growth projection of 12.1%. Cardinal Health’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 12.3%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCardinal Health is witnessing an upward trend in its stock price, prompted by its diversified product portfolio. The optimism led by a solid third-quarter fiscal 2023 performance and the opening of a few distribution centers are expected to contribute further. However, stiff competition and the probability of losing a major customer persist.Let’s delve deeper.Key Growth DriversDiversified Product Portfolio: Investors are upbeat about Cardinal Health’s Medical and Pharmaceutical offerings, which provide the company with a competitive edge in the niche space. In May, the company launched modern payment solutions powered by Square to help independent pharmacies increase operational efficiency, stay updated with customer payment preferences and access integrated software tools for their business.In April, Cardinal Health announced the launch of the Stray Away hair management drape for more efficient surgical procedure preparation.Distribution Centers: Investors are optimistic about Cardinal Health’s opening of a few distribution centers in strategic areas over the past few months. This month, the company announced its plans to build a new distribution center in Greenville, SC to support its at-Home Solutions business, a home healthcare medical supplies provider serving people with chronic and serious health conditions in the United States.Story continuesIn May, Cardinal Health Canada announced its plans to open a new distribution center in the Greater Toronto Area, thus expanding its distribution footprint to better meet the medical and surgical product demands of the Canadian healthcare system.Strong Q3 Results: Cardinal Health’s impressive third-quarter fiscal 2023 results buoy optimism. The company’s robust top-line and bottom-line results and solid performance by the Pharmaceutical segment were encouraging. Per management, the segmental performance highlights branded pharmaceutical sales growth from existing Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty Solutions customers.DownsidesProbabilities of Loss of a Major Customer: Cardinal Health faces the risk of losing considerable business if it loses a major customer, which will severely impair its revenues in the future. In this regard, post establishing a generic sourcing joint venture with CVS Caremark in 2014, Cardinal Health largely depends on the former for more than 20% of its revenues. Collectively, five of Cardinal Health’s main customers, including CVS, accounted for as much as 40% of its revenues.Stiff Competition: Cardinal Health operates in a highly competitive environment in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and consumer healthcare products, as well as in the manufacturing and distribution of medical devices and surgical products. The company also competes on many levels, including price and service offerings.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc. HOLX, Merit Medical Systems, Inc.

AVNS recently announced a definitive agreement to acquire Diros Technology Inc. The company intended to share additional details about the transaction, which is expected to be closed in the third quarter of 2023 (subject to customary closing conditions), on its Investor Day event on Jun 20.Avanos expects the new business to be immediately accretive to its revenue growth, gross margins, operating margins and earnings per share (EPS).Toronto, Canada-based Diros Technology is a well-known manufacturer of innovative radiofrequency (RF) products to treat chronic pain conditions.The latest acquisition is likely to significantly boost Avanos’ pain management treatment options and complement its premium COOLIEF Cooled RF product offerings.Rationale Behind the AcquisitionPer Avanos, more than a million radiofrequency ablation (RFA) procedures are performed annually for the treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain. Diros Technology's products deliver RF energy via precisely placed, minimally-invasive probes for chronic pain management. The RF energy thus delivered heat the nervous tissues near the probe's tip, deactivating the nerve's ability to transmit pain signals.Avanos’ management believes that the buyout of Diros Technology will likely strengthen its foothold in RF technology by providing a full range of high-quality, differentiated pain management products. The enhanced portfolio is expected to offer significant opportunities to deliver non-opioid-based and minimally-invasive treatments to patients worldwide.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Facts and Factors, the global RFA devices market was worth around $3.59 billion in 2021 and is anticipated to reach $10.21 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of approximately 11%. Factors like the rising prevalence of chronic pain disorders and the growing demand for pain management are expected to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest buyout is expected to significantly strengthen Avanos’ global business.Story continuesRecent DevelopmentsThis month, Avanos entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Respiratory Health (RH) business to SunMed Group Holdings, LLC. Per Avanos, the divestiture of the RH business represents a key component of its ongoing three-year transformation process and accelerates its efforts to focus its portfolio on markets where it is well-positioned to succeed.Last month, Avanos announced its first-quarter 2023 results, wherein it registered a solid adjusted EPS performance. Strength in the Chronic Care segment from a solid Digestive health business and robust growth in NeoMed (fueled by strong execution of customer conversions to Avanos’ ENFit technology in North America) and CORTRAK were also recorded.Price PerformanceShares of Avanos have gained 0.8% in the past year compared with the industry’s 15.8% rise and the S&amp;P 500's 16.7% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, Avanos carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

(Photo: FreightWaves)Rob Haddock, group director of transportation strategy for Coca-Cola North America, has spent his entire career — over 40 years — in all areas of the supply chain but says transportation has always been his passion.At FreightWaves’ Future of Supply Chain event in Cleveland on Wednesday, Haddock said it is crucial to build a resilient supply chain in this volatile freight environment.In 2017, he was tasked with overhauling Coca-Cola’s transportation group after a major restructuring. At the time, he admits, he had no magic fix. Instead, he spent time evaluating the transportation group’s problems before formulating a plan.“I looked at some of our technologies that needed a little bit of refreshing, and I didn’t have a whole lot of insights into market intelligence at the time and it seemed like everybody else in the room was smarter than I was,” Haddock said. “I had to change that paradigm.”When he inherited the transportation group, Haddock said he started with a “small team for such a large business.”“We looked at what was the talent base that we needed to start to grow that,” Haddock said. “We [still] don’t have a whole lot of people, but we rely a lot on the technologies, the processes and the relationships that we’ve established.”Over the past six years, Haddock said he’s trained his team to understand the importance of delivering on-time service to customers.“If we do fall short, why did we fall short? Did we not give the carrier enough time to move it? Was there a delay at the dock? We keep some very stringent metrics on on-time performance, and we start to analyze where did we fail and could we do a better job?”In less than a week, Haddock will be moving to a new role at the Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO).“I’ve trained the younger team members on this is why we do stuff, here’s how numbers should be interpreted, here’s how you develop a long-range planning strategy,” he said. “We’ve got some very talented young people coming in, and quite honestly, it was time for me to get out of their way to let the younger organization flourish.”Story continuesInvesting in advanced visibility technology has played a huge role in reinventing Coca-Cola’s transportation group, Haddock said.“If there is a particular lane that is starting to misbehave or a carrier that’s struggling a little bit with service, we have some visibility to it and then we have people assigned to go ahead and have a conversation to get things back on track.”The post Haddock: Updated technology, long-term planning key to customer success  appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

The stock outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.53%.Heading into today, shares of the world's largest beverage maker had lost 0.23% over the past month, outpacing the Consumer Staples sector's loss of 1.54% and lagging the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.86% in that time.Coca-Cola will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. On that day, Coca-Cola is projected to report earnings of $0.71 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 1.43%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $11.69 billion, up 3.26% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $2.61 per share and revenue of $45.02 billion, which would represent changes of +5.24% and +4.7%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Coca-Cola. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. Coca-Cola currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Investors should also note Coca-Cola's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 23.5. This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 23.83.Story continuesMeanwhile, KO's PEG ratio is currently 3.47. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Beverages - Soft drinks industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 2.54 as of yesterday's close.The Beverages - Soft drinks industry is part of the Consumer Staples sector.

Like at the beginning stages we wanted to be an example of the change that we wanted to see. So our infrastructure is one that's full of color, a landscape of inclusion, right? Because that's what it's supposed to be.THAI RANDOLPH: Hartbeat-- Kevin's the North Star and sort of the heartbeat of the company. We're working with so many amazing creators across audio, TV, Film. And you know, I think what's really exciting about Hartbeat is it serves as a platform that he's created for the next generation of not just comedic creators but just creators in general.TARIQ HASSAN: The power of culture. And that's a big word, everyone uses it, but we set that as our North Star to really become a cultural icon. We're McDonald's, so we shouldn't just be participating in culture. We should be creating it, which means if you're going to do it externally, that gives you a thought to how you have to build that culture internally. And that's really what's been the driver of the business for the last 2 and 1/2 years.MANOLO ARROYO: This is one of the most, if not the most, inclusive brand in the planet. Proportion of population today, particularly Gen Z, ESG, your level of commitment on ESG, it matters. And for others it's innovation. So the name of the game for us is growth.PAUL WACHTER: The biggest concern, I think, for talent, at least Hollywood talent, would be how long does the writer's strike last? How bad is the pullback by the streaming companies in terms of how much they're willing to spend on content? On the other side of the coin in the music business, where I spend a lot of my time, it's never been better. The live music business is off the charts.JIM LANZONE: Everybody wants to know, you know, what the state of that market is, are things going to come back-- storming back. I'd say, look, things are pretty stable. I think that's the sentiment here. People fear a really tough 2023. It's not the fastest growing year ever, but things are pretty stable in the industry.

317,69d434ba-317d-387d-a777-01ed2fbf2ea8,GE,2023-06-22,10 Least Competitive Industries in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-least-competitive-industries-world-103513760.html,1687430113,STORY,"['TMUS', 'GE']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the ten least competitive industries in the world. If you want to skip our analysis of why competition is important, head on over to 5 Least Competitive Industries in the World. Competition sits at the heart of the business world and the capitalist system. It forces firms to innovate and makes those with unprofitable business models or obsolete products either get their act together or go out of business.In fact, competition is also a large reason why the Western world was eventually able to overcome the Communist system of Soviet Russia. The country had a centralized planned economy, which required steel making plants to meet their monthly quotas. The managers of these plants as a result were not eager to improve their cost efficiencies and instead would simply overhire labor and order excess raw materials to just meet the requirements set by the government. Over the long term, this introduced inefficiencies in the system, and would often lead to managers sometimes not even meeting their production targets if they were afraid that the targets would be increased next year. The end result of this ensured a lack of competition in the Soviet Union's factories and stunted innovation - which have led to key technologies such as semiconductors and optics being relatively underdeveloped even today.The world has changed since the time of the Soviet Union and one of the biggest changes comes in the form of the Internet. The internet allows people to make money while sitting at home instead of toiling away in factories or in offices. And its proliferation across the globe means that there are a variety of niche markets that any seller can target. And some great niche markets for 2023 come from none other than the retailing platform Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP). According to Shopify, great niche markets that can be interesting in 2023 include laptop accessories, desktop toys, reusable drinking straws, melatonin gummies, GPS pet trackers, and oil diffusers. And when it comes to finding high demand and low competition business ideas, it can pay to understand search algorithms to determine which products are in high demand, analyze competitor behavior, and see if any substitute products can attract similar demand to well selling ones.Story continuesAdditionally, we don't need to take a look too far back in history to pick out which industries need competition. One of the biggest examples of an industry that lacked competition and was subsequently transformed due to an agile and intelligent entrant is aerospace. The aerospace industry has typically been funded by governments for state programs as its only other source of demand is satellites. And until 2015, the industry continued to rely on big and slow companies such as The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT). However, Space Exploration Technologies Corporation's (SpaceX) entry into the fray has forever changed the way in which the astronautics industry operates. SpaceX's reusable rocket has dramatically reduced the cost of launch, taken market share from the largest company before it, and broken the United Launch Alliance's (ULA) decades old monopoly in the national security space launch (NSSL) market.Another industry that has been begging for competition for decades is satellite internet. For years the only options consumers have had came from satellites placed high up in geostationary orbits resulting in slow speeds due to the vast distances involved. And for decades, the low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite internet industry needed competition.  Yet, only one firm made an attempt starting in the 1990s. And while Teledesic Corporation tried to break into the industry, eventually it had to go bankrupt. However, SpaceX is making its mark in the LEO internet market too, with its Starlink satellite service up and running and providing coverage globally. You can take a detailed look at the satellite industry by checking out 10 VLEO Technology Stocks and Startups to Watch.Furthermore, competition is not limited only to corporate players. It also extends itself to the job market, where thousands of candidates jostle to land a dream role. Yet, others also seek a relatively stress free life where they don't have to worry about competition in the job market. So what are some jobs that have low competition but pay remarkably well? Well, some roles are pediatricians, pharmacists, dentists, optometrists, and tax directors.Finally, one highly competitive industry that sees players cut prices aggressively to woo customers is telecommunications. On this front, the management of T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) shared details about its strategies during the firm's latest earnings call where it shared:So we announced last week our latest Un-carrier move with Phone Freedom, a move aimed to free customers and other wireless providers locked into those three-year contracts, while they are subjected to relentless pricing changes and gadgets. We continue to make it easier for customers to come to T-Mobile and switch to T-Mobile for peace of mind, knowing that with price lock, we won’t raise their price for top text and data. And now with new one too are part of Phone Freedom, they will be upgrade-ready in two years, because three years is too long to force customers to wait.Here’s kind of a crazy sort of fact to get your head around, AT&amp;T reported the lowest postpaid phone churn in the industry this quarter and yet quantitative research states that their customers have the highest self-reported likelihood of switching away. Their customers report being almost 50% more likely to switch than Verizon’s or T-Mobile’s customers. The lowest churn, but the highest apparent dissatisfaction. And to me, that means one thing. Their customers are trapped and we are here to solve it and that’s what our latest Un-carrier move is all about. That’s what Phone Freedom is all about. And it’s the way we have been designing our groundbreaking Un-carrier moves for a full decade now. And as you know, we hit another milestone this month, the three-year anniversary of our merger.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the least competitive industries in the world. If you're interested to find out about companies that have remained in business despite being mostly the same, you can check out 10 Least Innovative Companies That Are Still In Business Today.10 Least Competitive Industries in the WorldNiloo / Shutterstock.comOur Methodology To compile our list of the least competitive industries in the world, we used Michael Porter's Five Forces as the backbone of our hunt. According to Porter, industries with a high buyer and supplier power, high threats of substitution and new entrants, and high competitive rivalry have low returns on investments (ROIs) since companies have little pricing power to squeeze out more margins. So, we used data from CSI Market to see which industries have the lowest ROI as a proxy for the least competitive industries.10 Least Competitive Industries in the World 10. Capital GoodsReturn on Investment (ROI) Estimate: 9.55%The capital goods industry is typically involved with making and selling heavy duty industrial equipment. This covers a wide range of products such as steam turbines, land excavators, tractors, jet engines, and other machines. The sector requires significant capital expenditure and guaranteed orders for companies to take the risk of producing bulky and expensive goods. Some notable capital goods companies are General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), and Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE).9. Consumer Non CyclicalReturn on Investment (ROI) Estimate: 8.49%The consumer non cyclical industry takes its name from the idea of a business cycle. A business cycle, broadly speaking, describes the economy and the business environment as prospering in cycles of high and low growth. Consumer non cyclical companies are those that are relatively insulated against the changes in the business cycle as they are typically operating in stable sectors such as utilities, healthcare, and consumer staples - which are bound to see demand regardless of the state of the economy.8. Basic MaterialsReturn on Investment (ROI) Estimate: 8.01%The basic materials industry is quite self explanatory really. It deals with the building blocks and raw materials for a variety of industries. One of the more popular basic materials segments these days is the lithium industry which is seeing sustained demand due to the global shift toward electric vehicles. Some well known basic materials companies are Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO), BHP Group (NYSE:BHP), and Vale SA (NYSE:VALE).7. ConglomeratesReturn on Investment (ROI) Estimate: 7.04%Conglomerates, simply put, are firms that try to do it all. These companies often have a global presence and often operate in completely unrelated industries. One of the best examples of a conglomerate is the South Korean chaebol Samsung which makes smartphones, medicines, washing machines, chips, and other products.6. TransportationReturn on Investment (ROI) Estimate: 5.56%The transportation industry is one of the more crucial ones for economic progress. Not only does it enable firms to transport raw materials and finished goods across territories, but it is also the backbone of the tourism industry.

In total, 75 F404 engines have been delivered and another 99 are on order for LCA Mk1A. Eight F414 engines have been delivered as part of an ongoing development program for LCA Mk2.Story continuesToday's agreement will advance GE Aerospace's earlier commitment to build 99 engines for the Indian Air Force as part of the LCA Mk2 program.

Featuring the market performance of 500 of the largest companies listed on stock exchanges in the U.S., you’re dealing with proven winners. To be fair, you might not receive a blistering performance. At the same time, these ideas are less likely to leave you stranded on the road.In addition, ChatGPT points out that the best S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy offer diversification. Specifically, by acquiring undervalued securities within the index, investors can potentially benefit from the performance of a diverse range of companies and industries, mitigating risks associated with individual stocks or sectors.As well, the artificial intelligence-powered chatbot mentions the potential for reversion to fair value as a benefit for cheap S&amp;P 500 stocks. Basically, enterprises that are undervalued now may carry the potential to their fair value over time. As market inefficiencies correct themselves, undervalued stocks can experience price appreciation as the market recognizes their true worth. So, if you’re ready to start winning consistently, these may be the best S&amp;P 500 stocks for June.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsADMArcher Daniels Midland$74.56CFCF Industries$70.08BIIBBiogen$297.83SNASnap-On$274.27MPCMarathon Petroleum$113.83VLOValero Energy$114.03GDGeneral Dynamics4214.96Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comAn American multinational food processing and commodities trading corporation, Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) makes an excellent case for undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy. Fundamentally, no matter how advanced we become as a civilization, certain things will never change. Of course, the most critical is our need for nutritional sustenance. Thus, long-term investors may treat ADM’s loss of over 18% this year as irrationality.Story continuesNo matter, when the market is giving you one of the best S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy at a discount, you take it. Over the trailing one-year period, ADM slipped over 11%, which seems like overkill given the underlying relevance. More importantly, the market prices ADM at a forward multiple of only 10.55. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than 81.7% of the competition.It’s no slouch on the operational metrics either. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 16.4% (on a per-share basis), above 76.8% of its peers. Also, its Piotroski F-Score comes in at 7 out of 9, indicating solid operational efficiency. Thus, it’s easily one of the S&amp;P 500 stocks for June.CF Industries (CF)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Headquartered in Deerfield, Illinois, CF Industries (NYSE:CF) is an American manufacturer and distributor of agricultural fertilizers, including ammonia, urea, and ammonium nitrate products. Given the geopolitical flashpoint in Eastern Europe and implications for the global food supply chain, agricultural entities such as CF command extraordinary relevance. However, exposure to geopolitics has many investors worried, with CF shedding over 17% since the Jan. opener.Nevertheless, those with a patient view might consider the agro firm as one of the undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks. True, the present circumstances don’t seem enticing at all. Plus, in the past 365 days, CF stock gave up more than 26% of market value. Still, at some point, circumstances will eventually normalize. Plus, the red ink presents much food for thought.Mainly, the market now prices CF at a trailing multiple of 4.53. As a discount to earnings, CF ranks better than 90.61% of its peers. Also, shares now trade at a price-earnings-growth ratio of 0.12. In contrast, the sector median value stands at a loftier 0.72 times. Therefore, it’s worth consideration as one of the cheap S&amp;P 500 stocks.Biogen (BIIB)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comBased in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) is a multinational biotechnology firm specializing in the discovery, development, and delivery of therapies for the treatment of neurological diseases to patients worldwide. Thanks to its permanently relevant business, BIIB ranks among the best S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy. Since the Jan. opener, shares popped just over 10%.Despite its performance in the charts, however, BIIB also ranks among the undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks. At the moment, the market prices shares at a trailing multiple of 13.93. As a discount to earnings, Biogen ranks better than 72.7% of companies listed in the drug manufacturing industry. Also, BIIB trades at 0.95 times the projected free cash flow. In contrast, the underlying sector median value is 1.58 times.Just as well, the company benefits from excellent profitability metrics. For example, its trailing-year net margin clocks in at 31%, outflanking 95.87% of its rivals. With a Piotroski F-Score of 7 out of 9, Biogen delivers an operationally efficient business. Thus, it’s a solid candidate for S&amp;P 500 stocks with upside.Snap-on (SNA)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Best Speculative StocksSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comHailing from Kenosha, Wisconsin, Snap-on (NYSE:SNA) is an American designer, manufacturer, and marketer of high-end tools and equipment for professional use in the transportation industry. This includes solutions for automotive, heavy-duty, equipment, marine, aviation, and railroad industries. To be fair, SNA is one of the boring entities among undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks. Still, that shouldn’t be confused with underperforming.Since the beginning of this year, SNA gained over 18% of its equity value. In the trailing one-year period, it popped up over 33%. Thanks to its everyday relevance, Snap-on offers resilience and predictability for its stakeholders. Despite the robust gains, however, SNA offers a discount for those seeking S&amp;P 500 stocks for June.Notably, the market prices SNA at a forward multiple of 15.86. As a discount to projected earnings, Snap-on ranks better than 62.4% of companies listed in the industrial products sector. Also, SNA trades at 0.8 times discounted cash flow, ranking better than 60.2% of the competition.Marathon Petroleum (MPC)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Findlay, Ohio, Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) is a petroleum refining, marketing, and transportation firm. Mostly specializing in the downstream and midstream components of the hydrocarbon energy value chain, MPC could benefit from rising relevancies. As society continues to normalize, traffic volume should rise. On paper, this framework should benefit MPC.So far, though, the market doesn’t really seem to appreciate this thesis. Since the Jan. opener, MPC gained less than 1%. Nevertheless, this lack of mobility in the charts might make MPC one of the undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks. Significantly, the market prices Marathon shares at a forward multiple of 6.08. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than nearly 63% of its oil and gas peers.Also, MPC trades at 0.32 times sales. In contrast, the sector median stands at 0.91 times. That’s noteworthy because Marathon’s three-year revenue growth rate clocks in at 27.1%, above 80.28% of its rivals. As well, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period pings at 60.9%. Thus, it’s a great idea for cheap S&amp;P 500 stocks with upside potential.Valero Energy (VLO)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comA downstream petroleum specialist, Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) mostly focuses on manufacturing and marketing transportation fuels. As well, it produces other petrochemical products and power. As with Marathon Petroleum above, Valero should benefit from rising social normalization trends. However, the market has a dim view of VLO, with shares fading nearly 7%. Over the trailing one-year period, it’s down almost 13%.Still, the red ink might make Valero one of the compelling undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy. On the valuation front, the market prices VLO at a forward multiple of 5.26. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than 71.08% of its oil and gas compatriots. Also, shares trade at 0.25 times sales. In contrast, the sector median again stands at 0.91 times.Nevertheless, Valero performs very well on the operational side. Its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 19.4%, above nearly 70% of its peers. Also, its Piotroski F-Score lands at a perfect 9 out of 9, indicating superior operational efficiency. Combined with an Altman Z-Score of 5.77 (indicating low bankruptcy risk), VLO makes a strong case for the best S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy.General Dynamics (GD)image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocksSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.comAlthough a bit on the controversial side for some investors for its aerospace and defense business, General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) technically meets the qualifications for undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks. Despite its relevant business profile – and gaining relevance, unfortunately – the market doesn’t believe in GD stock. Since the start of the year, shares tumbled nearly 15%. Over the past 365 days, GD is almost 3% below parity.Nevertheless, rising instability in the geopolitical realm could see demand for General Dynamics rise. In the meantime, the market prices GD at a forward multiple of 16.82. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than 66.67% of enterprises in the aerospace and defense industry. Also, GD trades hands at 14.43 times operating cash flow. In contrast, the sector median stat is 18.89 times.Aside from its value proposition, General Dynamics enjoys strong profitability metrics. Its trailing-year net margin clocks in at 8.5%, above 70.76% of its peers. Also, it’s worth mentioning that its Piotroski F-Score lands at 7 out of 9, indicating decent operational efficiency.

The purpose behind the launch is to extend better health outcomes for individuals in the region struggling with uncontrolled diabetes.To effectively cater to its endeavor, UnitedHealthcare has collaborated with the leading Community Health Center of Southwest Georgia, Albany Area Primary Health Care, and the regional food bank of Georgia, Feeding the Valley Food Bank.From July, the patients at Albany Area Primary Health Care with uncontrolled diabetes will be picked out and subsequently, become qualified to join the UnitedHealthcare Catalyst program. Therefore, the program will combine clinical data with firsthand data derived from community members and detect health issues prevailing across the targeted region. Assistance from local partners like Albany Area Primary Health Care and Feeding the Valley Food Bank will aid UnitedHealthcare Catalyst to devise a coordinated community plan.Additionally, individuals participating in the program will also enjoy the benefits of medication management programming, individualized nutrition education from a dietician and medically customized food boxes delivered by Feeding the Valley Food Bank.The ulterior motive of the program remains to address the diversified health needs of diabetic patients, extend self-management education and resources and, monitor the progression of the disease. Such an initiative seems to be of dire need, considering the significant prevalence of diabetes in Dougherty County, where Albany is situated.Despite being a chronic health condition, an adequate level of nutrition and proper management can prevent diabetes from further deteriorating the patient’s health, reduce frequent medical visits and upgrade the quality of life. Thereby, the UnitedHealthcare Catalyst program seems to be a perfect fit to somewhat improve the issue of diabetes in Albany.Story continuesThe customer base of the UnitedHealthcare business in Georgia remains commendable, with over 1.1 million members enrolled in its employer-sponsored, individual and Medicare and Dual Special Needs Plans. The program offers an opportunity for the UNH arm to gain more customers across the state. An increase in membership should aid the premium growth of UnitedHealth, which remains the most significant contributor to the revenues of any health insurer.With an extensive network of 154 hospitals, 42,000-plus physicians and other care providers in Georgia, the recent program launch is likely to solidify UnitedHealthcare’s statewide footprint.The UnitedHealthcare business has also been subject to several contract wins and renewed agreements in the past as well, which have continued to boost its membership growth.Shares of UnitedHealth have declined 11.4% year to date, compared with the industry’s 13.4% decrease. Nevertheless, its strong fundamentals are likely to help shares bounce back in the days ahead.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUNH currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the Medical space are ICU Medical, Inc.

A potential investment is a growth company or a value stock. It’s high quality or it’s risky speculation. This sort of thinking is understandable. Such frameworks are useful for quickly understanding the world. But sometimes a company can represent multiple different styles of investment, such as with the three hidden growth blue-chip stocks below.People often think of the best blue-chip stocks to buy as being ones in staid, boring businesses that pay reliable dividends but don’t grow very much. But today’s picks offer both safety and considerable upside.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNike (NKE)Nike (NKE) store in a shopping mall in Penang, Malaysia. robinhood stocksSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.comNike (NYSE:NKE) is the world’s dominant seller of athletic apparel and footwear. While the company was once a growth superstar, investors might think of Nike’s opportunity as being largely played out at this point.But this blue-chip stock still has surprising upside thanks to emerging markets. In recent years, Nike has invested heavily in fast-growing consumer markets such as China, Southeast Asia and Latin America. As these countries see their middle classes blossom, Nike should be able to sell a lot more shoes and jerseys.Second, Nike was at the forefront of harnessing the power of the direct-to-consumer model. Back in the mid-2010s, when shopping malls were still riding high, Nike was taking its products to customers directly through social media, apps and influencers. Being early to this transition allowed Nike to thrive over the past few years as traditional brick-and-mortar retail was upended by the pandemic.Nike remains well-positioned to grow as the world economy normalizes. That’s especially true in China, where Nike’s results have been soft due to that country’s lingering pandemic lockdowns. Once China is fully back in business, NKE stock should enjoy a major tailwind.Estee Lauder (EL)An Estee Lauder retail store at Elements Shopping Mall in Hong Kong.Source: Sorbis / Shutterstock.comStory continuesShares of cosmetics company Estee Lauder (NYSE:EL) have gotten pummeled over the past 18 months, falling from a high of around $370 to less than $200 today. EL stock now trades for roughly the same price it did prior to the onset of the pandemic.At this price, the leading beauty products firm offers a solid value proposition. That’s because it benefits from many of the same trends as Nike. For instance, Estee Lauder relies on emerging markets for much of its future growth possibilities.The global prestige beauty market is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 5.56% through 2028. With Americans spending much more a year on prestige beauty products than those in countries like China and Brazil, Estee Lauder has a big growth opportunity. As the middle class continues to prosper in these large developing countries, it provides Estee Lauder with a tremendous growth runway.Shares have slumped recently as the initial economic reopening wave largely played itself out in some markets. But investors shouldn’t sleep on the longer-term possibilities. Particularly with the heightened focus on social media and beauty products among younger consumers, Estee Lauder has plenty of great years ahead of it.Qualcomm (QCOM)Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on a large sign with another sign that says 5GSource: Xixi Fu / Shutterstock.comLast up on our list of hidden growth blue-chip stocks to buy is Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), one of the world’s leading semiconductor companies focused on mobile communications.The firm rose to prominence by developing key patents for technologies such as 3G and 4G. Over the years, Qualcomm has monetized this intellectual property heavily, leading to tremendous results for its shareholders. Additionally, its move into designing its own chip ecosystems, such as Snapdragon, has proven lucrative.The key driver for the company now will be artificial intelligence (AI). Qualcomm has long prioritized making AI-enabled chips for mobile applications such as phones, connected cars, and internet of things (IoT) applications. Qualcomm’s AI chips have performed well in tests, particularly related to power efficiency.QCOM stock is an underappreciated growth investment that also offers appealing blue-chip characteristics such as a healthy starting valuation and a strong dividend yield of 2.6%.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in NKE, EL and QCOM stock.

334,78a26ccd-06c8-34ab-95f4-721a71f53864,ADP,2023-06-22,Automatic Data Processing: A Profitable and Growing Business,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/automatic-data-processing-profitable-growing-152841910.html,1687361321,STORY,['ADP'],"[Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) shares seem to be out of favor as they have lost about 8% in 2023 when all major U.S. stock market indices have gained. From a contrarian approach, I like Automatic Data Processing now due to the combination of a low valuation, a strong business model, high profitability and growth in revenue and earnings. I believe the positive factors could soon drive a turnaround for the stock price. It is dangerous to be a contrarian investor, but contrarians can improve our chances by conducting in-depth analysis.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with ADP. Click here to check it out. ADP 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of ADPPeter Lynch Chart of ADPBusiness model and economic moatAutomatic Data Processing, better known as ADP, was founded in 1949 and is based in New Jersey. It is a global provider of human capital management (HCM) solutions and payroll services. ADP's business model is built around offering comprehensive technology-based solutions to help businesses manage their workforce and payroll processes efficiently.In terms of an economic moat, ADP benefits from its large scale and extensive network of clients, which creates network effects. As more companies and individuals use ADP's services, the value of the network increases, making it harder for competitors to attract customers and gain similar economies of scale. ADP's vast client base also provides valuable data that can be leveraged to improve its products and services. ADP has invested heavily in developing advanced technology platforms and solutions. Its comprehensive suite of cloud-based HCM software and services offers features such as payroll processing, time and attendance tracking, benefits administration, talent management and more.ADP operates in a heavily regulated industry, particularly in the areas of payroll, tax and benefits administration. The company has built deep expertise in navigating complex regulatory landscapes, ensuring compliance with local, state and federal laws. The high regulations create a barrier to entry for new entrants.Story continuesADP has established long-term relationships with its clients, including businesses of various sizes across different industries. These relationships are built on trust, reliability and a proven track record of delivering accurate and timely payroll and HR solutions. Switching from ADP to a competitor involves significant effort and potential disruption, making client retention a significant advantage for ADP.Another important advantage is the global presence the company has. ADP operates around the world, serving clients in more than 140 countries. Its international footprint and localized expertise allows ADP to adapt its services to meet the unique requirements of different markets. This global presence and localized approach give ADP a competitive advantage, as it can provide tailored solutions to multinational companies and navigate local regulations and compliance issues effectively.Overall, ADP's economic moat is built on its scale, network effects, technological capabilities, regulatory expertise, long-standing relationships, brand reputation and global presence. These factors make it challenging for competitors to replicate ADP's comprehensive suite of services, established client base and industry-leading position, which is one of the main reasons why I think the company and its stock are set for long-term success.Solid financials and growthADP has a GF Score of 94 out of 100, which means it has high outperformance potential based on a historical study by GuruFocus.Automatic Data Processing: A Profitable and Growing BusinessThe financial strength rank is moderate at 6 out of 10, but I see no problem with this given the debt-to-equity ratio of 0.9, though the Altman Z-Score of 2.01 is in the grey zone. The company has generated consistent positive free cash flows over the past five years, which slowed down in 2021 and 2022 with growth of 2.14% and 0.36% respectively, but stability in the free cash flow trend is at least better than declines.It is very positive to see that ADP has a rank in profitability from GuruFocus at 9 out of 10, along with growth receiving a perfect rank of 10 out of 10. The momentum is not bad either with a rank of 7 out of 10.Automatic Data Processing's operating margin is expanding, with a five-year average growth rate of 5.40% per year. For the quarter ending in March 2023, the operating margin was 23.87%. The net margin was also very good at 22.30% for the same quarter, the highest figure over the past 12 quarters.The return on equity of 97.77% is magnificent. The company has also shown predictable revenue and earnings growth over the past five years, especially on the bottom line, with a five-year average earnings per share without non-recurring items growth rate of 12.10%. The company also has a three-year revenue per share growth rate of 7.2%, and Morningstar analysts estimate a three to five year total revenue growth rate of 6.08%.In terms of valuation, the GF Value chart rates the stock as modestly undervalued.Automatic Data Processing: A Profitable and Growing BusinessIn conclusion, I believe that ADP shares could soon rebound as the market is clearly ignoring the strength of the business model as well as the strong historical profitability and growth. The low valuation is quite unfair in my opinion, and I think this may be due to temporary factors such as the current labor market.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Lease With Life Time at PENN 1,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vornado-vno-inks-53k-sq-124900973.html,1687351740,STORY,"['VNO', 'VTR']","[Vornado Realty Trust VNO recently signed a lease agreement with the United States’ premier healthy lifestyle brand — Life Time LTH — for the first three floors of its PENN 1 property. With office tenants’ growing preference for top-notch office properties with class-apart amenities, the move is likely to attract more tenants to VNO’s premier destination, aiding leasing activity.  Life Time will occupy more than 53,000 square feet of this redeveloped 57-story building situated adjacent to Madison Square Garden in New York City. Strategically located at 33rd Street Plaza with its main entrance facing Madison Square Garden, Life Time is set to offer the most indoor pickleball courts in Manhattan. The opening will be carried out in two phases beginning this summer.In the initial phase, Life Time will replace the existing fitness center on the tower's second and third floors with a new, chic athletic club for office workers, commuters and neighborhood residents.The company’s club will feature boutique studios for its exclusive group studio, indoor cycle formats and hundreds of pieces of best-in-class cardiovascular, functional and strength training equipment. Additionally, LTH will offer a curated recovery space, spa, exquisite dressing rooms offering high-end amenities and a juice bar complete with its proprietary nutritional products.In the second phase, scheduled to open in early 2024, Life Time will add seven ground-level pickleball courts, a lounge, seating and bar area, and dedicated spaces for its Signature Group Training programs — Alpha and GTX — and one-on-one Dynamic Personal Training.Per Glen Weiss, executive vice president, Vornado, “We are delighted to add LifeTime as another key piece of our overall PENN DISTRICT strategy. The addition of Life Time's premier athletic club offers our current and future tenants, neighborhood residents, and commuters a first-class health and fitness facility to enjoy daily.”Vornado has been experiencing healthy leasing activity across its portfolio of top-quality office spaces in a few select, high-barrier-to-entry markets of New York. Moreover, its efforts to redevelop its assets are likely to help the company command more rents at its properties, thereby increasing profitability.Notably, in January 2023, Vornado leased its 350 Park Avenue office building, encompassing 585,000 square feet, to Citadel on an “as is” basis for 10 years. The initial annual net rent for the property was $36 million, retroactive to Jun 15, 2022.Additionally, the company entered a joint venture with Rudin (“Vornado/Rudin”) to purchase 39 East 51st Street for $40 million. VNO will combine this property with 350 Park Avenue and 40 East 52nd Street to create a premier development site, to be known as “Site” collectively.Nonetheless, the U.S. office real estate market has been choppy for quite some time now, with negative absorption and increasing vacancy levels. The continuation of the flexible working environment and pandemic-led job cuts have led to diminishing office space utilization.Amid this, demand for office properties is likely to remain subdued in the near term, which could hamper leasing volume to a certain extent.Also, stiff competition from developers, owners and operators of office properties and other commercial real estates, including sublease space available from its tenants, could curb Vornado’s ability to attract and retain tenants at relatively higher rents.Vornado currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Its shares have lost 25.3% in the year-to-date period compared with its industry’s decline of 2.7%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Ventas VTR and Host Hotels &amp; Resorts HST.

They had suffered last year as the Federal Reserve raised rates aggressively and the housing market plunged from its pandemic-driven highs.Housing starts jumped 21.7% in May, by the most since 2016 and were well above consensus estimates. Earlier this week, the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) reported that homebuilder sentiment improved to an 11-month high and moved into positive territory in June, thanks to solid demand, a lack of existing inventory, and improving supply chain efficiency.The supply in the existing-home market remains tight as higher mortgage rates have discouraged many homeowners from selling and giving up their current low rates. About a third of all homes listed for sale are new homes now.Lumber prices are down about 25% this year, according to Calculated Risk, boosting builders’ profits. In fact, many homebuilders reported positive surprises for the first quarter.The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage fell for the third consecutive week and is close to 6.7%, down from its 20-year high of over 7% hit in the fall. While the Federal Reserve is close to the end of its tightening campaign, many prospective homebuyers are adjusting to the possibility of rates staying at elevated levels for a long time.The iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF ITB tracks a market cap weighted index of home construction and related stocks. It is top heavy with four holdings--D.R.

Higher mortgage rates, which kept buyers away from purchasing homes, seem to have become the new normal.Homebuilders’ confidence hit new lows past year, but people are once again buying new homes, prompting a rise in building permits and housing starts in recent times. Given this situation, it would be ideal to invest in homebuilding stocks as interest rate hikes have also finally come to a halt.Building Permits, Housing Starts IncreaseThe Commerce Department said on Jun 20 that U.S. single-family homebuilding projects jumped in May to its highest level in three decades. Alongside, permits for future residential construction projects also climbed last month.According to the report, housing starts surged 21.7% in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.631 million units, hitting a 13-month high. However, the level achieved in April 2022 is still the highest since 2006.May’s jump follows April’s downwardly revised 1.34 million units. Moreover, the 291,000 unit jump in May’s housing starts was the highest since 1990. Also, the 21.7% monthly jump in May was the biggest percentage gain since October 2016.Single-family housing starts rose 18.5%, while multi-family starts jumped 28.1%.Also, permits for future construction climbed 5.2% in May to hit its highest level since October 2022 at 1.491 million units. Building permits for single-family homes jumped 4.8%, while multi-family permits climbed 7.8%.The housing market’s rebound comes as the Fed finally paused its interest rate hikes in June after 10 straight increases. Higher mortgage rates had been compelling buyers to stay away from new home purchases.However, buyers are finally adapting to the higher mortgage rates. Moreover, a halt in interest rate hikes should lift their sentiment and boost home sales.Story continuesOn Monday, a survey revealed that the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index for June surpassed the midpoint threshold of 50. This is the first time it has reached this level since July 2022.The rise in the index can be attributed to a shortage of existing homes available for sale, which has boosted demand for new construction. Notably, the index has experienced a substantial recovery, increasing by 77% since December.Also, the Commerce Department said earlier this month that spending on construction projects jumped a solid 1.2% in April. This was driven by a 0.5% rise in spending on residential construction projects.Our ChoicesGiven this scenario, it will be prudent to invest in homebuilding stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank that are poised to gain from the rise in spending on construction projects. We narrowed down our search to four such stocks, each currently carrying either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Beazer Homes USA, Inc.

You're watching Yahoo Finance. And we are here at Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity. Joining us now, we've got Jane Wakely, who is the chief consumer, marketing officer and chief growth officer of International Foods at the great brand of PepsiCo. Thank you so much for joining us today.JANE WAKELY: It is the longest title in history.BRAD SMITH: But it's a great one. You have many hands.JANE WAKELY: I'd like to rebrand it. Chief smiles officer, let's leave it at that.BRAD SMITH: You're in charge of marketing. You could do that. You could rebrand your title.JANE WAKELY: You know what, I'm working on it. I'm working on that.BRAD SMITH: Well, you're bringing a lot of people smiles already through both beverage and snack. But now, you're going to bring even more people smiles through soccer or should we say football?JANE WAKELY: Oh, nice. You've been doing your homework. Did you like that sport?BRAD SMITH: I do.JANE WAKELY: Soccer versus football? OK, yeah. Now, we've got some very exciting news to break here at Cannes. We're actually announcing that we've just signed again with UEFA Champions League for the next three years.BRAD SMITH: Wow.JANE WAKELY: For both beverages and our foods business, which we're incredibly excited about. And actually, I was at the final in Istanbul two weekends ago. And the energy and the difference we can make for our brands, for our consumers who we serve, but also for people in the planet, through this partnership, we're super excited about. So like at Istanbul, I attended the Gatorade 5v5 contest. It's just one example. And we've now touched 120,000 young people's lives through that. And it's all about driving access to sport in line with Gatorade's mission to fuel everybody. And just seeing the impact, that sort of initiative, has on young people's lives, we're very excited to be able to do things even bigger, even bolder in the next three years. Wembley next year, see you there.Story continuesBRIAN SOZZI: Yes. How will you show up? How will your campaigns look different over the next three years?JANE WAKELY: Well, you can already see, we're very intentional about driving diversity, equity, and inclusion in sport. So just as one example, this year we really used our brands and their reach and impact to elevate female access to sport, female-- the female game. So for example, in all of our big campaigns on Pepsi and Lay's, we featured both the male stars and the female stars. So on billions of packs around the world, you not only saw Messi, but you also saw Lieke Martens. In our campaigns, you saw Lieke Martens, Thierry Henry on Lay's, Leah and Vini on Pepsi. And it's really important that we believe, if you can see her, you can be her.BRIAN SOZZI: About time, Jane. I'll just say, about time.JANE WAKELY: Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, so we're really excited about that. And we've got big plans for Wembley. So book your tickets now.BRAD SMITH: Done. Done. You heard it here first.JANE WAKELY: And It's the first time the female game-- the female final ever sold out, record-breaking attendance. And so, you know, I'd really encourage you. Book your ticket for both now.BRAD SMITH: That is going to be my next concur charge the second we get back to the office, Jane. You authorized it.JANE WAKELY: Yeah, absolutely.BRAD SMITH: So as we think about what you're seeing in the customer right now, how would you define this customer across the categories that you're looking across at PepsiCo? Because we've continued to hear that the customer is resilient in their spending. The customer is healthy. How do you see them from your perspective in the executive teams?JANE WAKELY: You mean, what we define as consumer, I think, like the people we ultimately serve. So look our brands really democratize pleasure, democratize joy, democratize better for your approach to both snacking and beverages. And so, our brands have very high reach. So our penetration, from a portfolio perspective, is over 90% of all households in many markets. And therefore, we need to really be close to the people we serve and their needs. And what I'd say is we're lucky to be in categories that are very resilient. People are still enjoying the beverage, enjoying a snack. And we're leaning into that. But we're also leaning into the differences in the consumer's needs. So we're providing choice.So for example, we're increasingly dialing up our offering of Zero products on the beverage side. We're ensuring that consumers have a choice and can really opt in to whichever part of our brand suits them best. And so, that type of offering is really important to us. And on the snack side, we're working hard to reduce sodium, reduce sat fat, for example, to ensure that actually, when you enjoy a bag of chips, you're enjoying it in the very best way you can and removing those slight niggles which might hold you back so that you can really enjoy it more often.BRIAN SOZZI: For the past four plus years after every earnings call, we have talked to your longtime CFO and Vice Chairman, Hugh Johnston. And he has told us repeatedly, snacks are on fire. They're hot. Everybody likes snacks. Everybody's snacking. So I'll put this to you. What is the secret ingredient behind keeping snacks hot? Because when I walk down an aisle, Walmart, Target, Kroger, Albertsons, you name it, this is a competitive section. How are you giving a guy like Hugh these results every single quarter?JANE WAKELY: Well, it's putting humans and people at the heart of our business, both in terms of who we serve, the consumers, but also, I believe, the people that work at PepsiCo. Ultimately, we are there to serve our consumers. And we're working hard to delight them, delight them with the product quality, delight them with the entertainment, and be highly visible, and meet their needs right. We're moving with the times in terms of how we reach them in terms of the portfolio we're offering. And that's keeping us highly relevant. So, yeah, snacks are on fire. That's for sure.BRAD SMITH: And what about in the messaging? Because for some brands, they've gotten it incorrect by wavering on their messaging, that they're hearing their internal constituents want the brand to stand for and represent, and their external customers and partners that they also want to hear them take a stance on. How do you approach that at a very polarizing time like this?JANE WAKELY: Look, we're true to-- firstly, I think it's really important that at PepsiCo, we're very true to who we are. We have-- one of the reasons I joined the company was the company and everyone that works in it has deeply-held values. And we really strive to be very consistent with those values, whether it's an internal people decision or brand decision. And as far as our brands are concerned, I think it's important to find the authentic sweet spot between what your brand means to the consumers you serve and the impact that it can potentially have on the world. And that has to be authentic. You have to walk the talk, to really have actions behind what you say. And I think we certainly strive to follow that guidance. And that's the sort of guardrails we use internally on how to navigate. But, yeah.BRIAN SOZZI: You've mentioned-- just going back to something you mentioned earlier, Jane, on Gatorade. Gatorade has long been the standard bearer in that sports drink industry. It's a brand we've all grown up with. But there has been a lot of new entrants in this space, BodyArmor, you name it. And they've taken some market share. Is it time to change the messaging for that brand? Or I mean, how do you take it to the next generation to take the fight back to some of these other smaller brands?JANE WAKELY: Yeah. Look, Gatorade is one of our fastest-growing parts of our portfolio. And ultimately, we're going to stay distinctive to who we are and really focus on category growth as our primary driver, as well as being competitive in the market. And the way you do that, I believe, is you double down on your strengths. So Gatorade stands for hydration, obviously, and fueling access to sports. And what we're doing is we're really trying to deepen our impact by creating more choice. So you've seen innovation on Gatorade recently, Gatorade Light, obviously.We're innovating into new formats such as reusable cups, powders, pods, driving new occasions to drive plastics out and really trying to innovate into spaces that actually our consumers really are asking for. We're leading and shaping the category by meeting our consumers' needs every day. And that's what we're focused on.BRAD SMITH: We only have 15 seconds.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Union Pacific (UNP) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.83 a share, just 29 days from its upcoming earnings release on July 20, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $2.83 Most Accurate Estimate and the $2.78 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Union Pacific has an Earnings ESP of 1.8%.UNP is part of a big group of Transportation stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at United Airlines (UAL) as well.Slated to report earnings on July 19, 2023, United Airlines holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $4.11 a share 28 days from its next quarterly update.United Airlines' Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 9.07% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.77.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, UNP and UAL could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.
